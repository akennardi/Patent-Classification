   ABSTRACT
   The present disclosure provides fusion proteins that incorporate unique mechanisms for
   multimerizmg antigens to enhance their immunogenicity. The fusion proteins comprise at least
   two antigens, or other vaccine related proteins, separated by a linker sequence and an
 5 oligomerization domain. When expressed, the fusion protein forms a muKimeric protein
   complex. This approach can be used to muHimerie a single antigen/protein or to create
   multimers comprising two or more different antigens/proteins. Also provided are nucleic acids
   encoding the fusion proteins, Yet another aspect is directed to methods of inducing or
   suppressing an immune response in a subject by administering to the subject a vaccine
10 composition comprising a fusion protein or nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein, optionally
   without using an adjuvant.

BACKGROUND
       [004]     Induction of humoral or T cell immunity to clinically relevant antigens is often
hampered by the weak immunogenicity of these antigens. In order to enhance the immune
response, exogenous adjuvants are commonly used. These adjuvants fall into many different
categories but they all share the property of stimulating the immune response in an antigen
nonspecific manner (Schijns, V. F. 2000, Curr, Opin. Immunology 12: 456-463). Thus, their
clinical use has been very limited because of the concern of stimulating unwanted
inflammatory or autoimmune responses. Many of the newer, more potent adjuvants that
stimulate the innate immune system via Toll-like receptors, non-specifically activate
macrophages, dendritic cells and other innate immune cells with unwanted pro-inflammatory
sequelae (van Duin et al., 2005, Trends Immunol.). Therefore, it would be extremely valuable
to devise ways to augment the antigen-specific immune response in the absence of added
adjuvants.
       [005]     Protein aggregates are known to enhance immune responses (Rosenberg,
2006, The AAPS Joumal, 8(3):E501-507), For example, protein antigens presented in a
highly arrayed structure can induce highly potent antibody responses even in. the absence of T

WO 2014/018858                                                                  PCT/US2013/052270
                                                  2
 helper cells. The mechanism by which protein aggregates mediate such potent antibody
 responses is not fully understood. However, it is believed that the potency is due, at least in
 part, to the ability of the multivalent protein to extensively cross link the cell surface
 immunoglobulins of B cells and activate the B cells,
        [006]     Several factors can influence a protein aggregate's ability to induce an
 immune response, including molecular weight and solubility (Rosenberg, 2006, The AAPS
 Journal, 8(3):E501-507). Lower molecular weight aggregates, such as diners and trimers
 generally are not as efficient at inducing immune responses as larger multimers.
 Multimerization. rather than size, appears to be an important immunogenicity factor because
 larger sized monomeric proteins are not necessarily more immunogenic than smaller
 monomeric proteins, In addition, particulate (insoluble) antigens are more rapidly
 endocytosed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The APCs, in turn, process the antigen and
present it to T and/or B cells to induce an immune response. Other factors that can influence
a protein aggregate's immunogenicity include product origin (foreign versus endogenous),
the presence of product contaminants with immunomodulatory activity, the presence of
neoepitopes (which may be created with fusion proteins), glycosylation patterns, frequency of
administration, route of administration, the host immune status, activity of concomitant
immunomodulators, and, for endogenous proteins, the strength of immunologic tolerance to
the endogenous protein (Rosenberg, 2006, The AAPS Journal, 8(3):E501-507)
       [0073      Others have attempted to take advantage of protein aggregation or multimeric
targeting strategies in an effort to enhance iminune responses For example, Hultberg et al
constructed multimers targeting different epitopes of three different viruses. Llama heavy
chain antibody fragments (VHi-Is) against the trimeric envelope proteins of: 1) Respiratory
Syncytial Virus, 2) Rabies virus glycoprotein, and 3) H5NI Influenza virus were selected
from libraries by phage display (Hultberg et al, 2011 PloS ONE 6: c17665). Neutralizing
heavy chains recognizing the three different epitopes with affinities in the low nanomolar
range were identified for all the three viruses by viral neutralization assays. By fusion with
variable linker lengths, multimeric constructs were made that improved neutralization
potencies up to 4,000-fold for RSV, 1,500-fold for Rabies virus and 75-fold for Influenza
H5NI. The multimeric VIH constructs had increased neutralization activity and cross
protection potency as compared to their monovalent counterparts, thus demonstrating that
multimeric targeting strategies can enhance the potency of anti-viral molecules.
       [008]      U.S. Patent No. 6,749,857 describes a fusion protein with a single copy of a
truncated flavivirus 80% E protein and a leucine zipper domain fused to the C terminus of the

WO 2014/018858                                                                  PCT/US2013/052270
                                                 3
80% E protein. When expressed in cells, the fusion proteins oligomerize to form a
homodimeric polypeptide complex that mimics the homodimeric structure of the naturally
occurring flavivirus 80% E protein. This approach was designed to increase the immune
potency of the fusion protein by increasing the structural similarity to the native 80% E
protein and by increasing the size and antigenic complexity of the immunogen         While the
fusion proteins of U.S. Patent No, 6,749/857 were designed in part to increase the antigenic
complexity of the immunogen, the complexity of the construct was limited by a desire to
 mimic the structure of the native 80% protein. As such, the fusion protein constructs of U.S.
Patent No. 6,749,857 contained only a single copy of the 80% protein and the resulting
polypeptide complex formed by the oligomerization of two fusion proteins contained only
two copies of the 80% protein, limiting the size of the multimeric antigens formed through
this strategy.
       [009]     Even though protein aggregates are known to enhance immune responses,
simple approaches to multimerize proteins in a defined and cost-effective manner for vaccine
use, with direct validation of a resultant increase in imiunogenicity, have been limited.
       10010]    Other multi-component constructs have been designed to enhance immune
responses by bringing two cells of interest into close proximity. For example, activation of T
cells requires two signals. The first signal is initiated by T cell receptor binding to antigenic
peptide presented by MHC molecules on antigen presenting cells (APC. The second,
costimulatory signal, is mediated via CD28 on the T cell, upon binding to CD80 or CDS6 on
the APC. To selectively localize costimulatory activity to the surface of tumor cells and
enhance activation of tumor-specific T cells, Asano et al. developed bi-specific costimulatory
proteins with antibody-like structure (Asano et al, 2008, J. Immunother. 31: 752-761).
Specifically, within a single polypeptide chain they assembled the lgV-like, CD28-binding
domain of human CD86 together with hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgG 1, and the
scFv antibody fragment which recognizes the ErbB2 protooncogene present at high levels on
the surface of many human tumor cells. Their results suggest that such multivalent soluble
proteins which combine specific targeting to tumor cells with co-stimulatory activity may
become useful tools to elicit and/or improve T-cell mediated, tumor-specific immune
responses,
       [0011]    Another multi-component vaccine approach was designed to bring two
different cell types into close proximity using a construct with components that allow
simultaneous targeting of both cells (Asano et al., 2008. 1 Immnother. 31: 752-761).
Asano et at. produced a recombinant bi-specific antibody that co-targeted epidermal growth

 WO 2014/018858                                                              PCT/US2013/052270
                                                4
 factor receptor on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells. The bi-specific and bi-valent IgG-like
 antibodies showed stronger binding to each target cell than did the monovalent diabody. The
bi-specific construct mediated tumor cell cytotoxicity that was 10 times that of the
 monovalent constructs. Further the Fc portion of the bi-specific construct further enhanced
 cytotoxicity via binding to Fe receptors on blood mononuclear cells for antibody-dependent
 cytotoxicity (ADCC). The growth-inhibition effects of this construct were superior to the
 approved therapeutic antibody cetuximab, which recognizes the same epidernal growth
 factor receptor antigen.
       [0012]    Miyata et al developed a multi-component vaccine strategy to enhance
 immune responses by creating genetic fusion proteins to target the antigen to specific APCs
(Miyata et al, 2011, Jnfect. knmun. 79: 4260-4275). The fusion complex was composed of
three physically linked molecular entities: 1) a vaccine antigen, 2) a multimeric a-helical
coiled-coil core, and 3) an APC-targeting ligand linked to the core via a flexible linker.
Immunization of mice with the tri-component complex as compared to the antigen only,
induced an enhanced antibody response that conferred increased protection against lethal
Plasmiodiun yoe/i infection.
       [0013]    New and improved constructs for enhancing immune responses are needed,
particularly constructs that can be used to enhance immune responses in the absence of added
adj uvant.
SUMMARY
       [0014]    The present disclosure provides new and improved strategies for enhancing an
immune response. These improved strategies involve fusion proteins that incorporate unique
mechanisms for nmultimerizing antigens to enhance their imnaunogenicity       One mechanism
for mtultimerizing antigens is using a linker sequence to separate two antigens in the fusion
protein. Without intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed that such a linker
sequence can allow the two antigens, whether they be the same or different, to undergo
conformational folding and form a dimer or higher order multimer. Another mechanism for
multimerizing antigens is using an oligomerization domain, such as a leucine zipper
dimerization domain, a T4 bacteriophage fibritin motif trimerization domain, or a
tetramerization domain. Combined with the linker sequence, the oligomerization domain
permits the further multim erization of an antigen (e.g., tetramer, hexamer, octamer, etc). This
approach can be used to multimerize a single antigen or to create multimers comprising two
or more different antigens.

                                                 5
        [0015]   This multimerization strategy can also be used to multimerize two or more
 proteins of interest, such as two or more vaccine-related proteins. Thus, another aspect is
 directed to a fusion protein comprising a first protein, a linker sequence, a second protein, and
 an oligomerization domain, where the linker sequence joins the first protein to the second
 protein and wherein the first and second proteins are vaccine related proteins or peptides,
 such as a vaccine target protein, an adjuvanrting protein, a cell surface targeting domain, a
 molecule that mediates immune suppression, or a cell surface target domain that binds to an
 activated cell.
       [0016]    Another aspect is an isolated nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein or
 oligomerized fusion protein. Yet another aspect is directed to methods of inducing an
 immune response in a subject by administering to the subject a vaccine composition
 comprising a fusion protein or nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein, where the fusion
protein induces an immune response in the subject. In certain embodiments, the vaccine
composition is used to induce an immune response in the subject without using an adjuvant.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
       [0017]    The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part
of this specification, illustrate certain embodiments, and together with the written description,
serve to explain certain principles of the constructs and methods disclosed herein.
       10018]    Figure 1 shows that tetanus toxoid is a more potent carrier protein than gp350
for a pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine. Mice were immunized i.p. with
gp350-PPS 14 or TT-PPS14 at 1 or 5 fig/mouse (5 mice per group) in alum + CpG-ODN, and
boosted in a similar fashion on day 14. PPS 14-specific IgG titers were measured by ELISA
from sera obtained on day 21. *Significance, p-0.05 between gp350-PPS 14 and TT-PPS 14.
       [0019]    Figure 2A shows a DNA plasmid map for production of tetrameric gp50
containing TT-specific CD4+ T cell epitopes. "(GlySerdj" disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 3 and
"His6 " disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 14. Figure 2B shows production of a tetrameric gp350
protein containing     E-specific CD4+ T cell epitopes by SDS-PAGE (denatured) and PAGE
(native) gels developed with 72A1 mAb.
      [0020]     Figure 3 shows that tetrameric gp350 is markedly more immunogenic than
monomeric gp350 protein whether administered in saline or with an adjuvant. DNA
vaccination of these constructs also induced heightened immune responses. Mice (5 per
group) were immunized i.p. with the indicated doses per mouse, of monomeric or tetrameric
gp350 in (Fig. 3A) alum or (Fig. 313) alum + CpG-ODN, and boosted in a similar manner on

 WO 2014/018858                                                               PCT/US2013/052270
                                                 6
 day 2 L Mice (7 per group) were inrrnunized in the abdominal skin with two tandem
 deliveries of 0.5 mg 1-3 pn-diameter gold particles coated with 10 pg DNA vaccine for a
 total dose of 4.0 pg DNA, Mice were boosted in a similar manner on week 4. Serum titers of
 gp350-specific IgC were determined by ELISA at the indicated times (Fig. 3C). Sera from
 tetramer-immunized mice: "A" and "B" (day 35, 25 pg dose) and "C" (week 6) were
 analyzed for senarn titers of IgG isotypes (Fig. 3D) *Significance, p<0.05 between tetramer
 and monomer.
       [0021]     Figure 4 shows that the enhanced gp350-specific IgG response requires both
priming and boosting with tetrameric gp 3 50. Mice (5 per group) were primed and boosted as
 indicated with tetrameric or monomeric gp350 in alum. Serum titers of gp350-specific igG
were determined by ELISA. *Significance, pc0.05.
       [0022]     Figure 5 shows that immunization of mice with tetrameric gp350 protein
 induces markedly higher levels of neutralizing gp350-specific antibodies relative to
monomer. 25 p1 of pooled mouse serum (5 mice each) from naive or immunized mice (day
35, 25 pg monomeric or tetrameric gp350/mouse in alum, see Fig. 3A), were incubated with
2.5 p1 of DyLight 633-labeled gp350 monomer, CR2MI a cells were then stained with these
mixtures and analyzed by flow cytometry. Various concentrations of 72A l mA b (neutralizing
gp350-specific IgG) were used instead of serum to create a standard curved for quantitation.
       100231    Figure 6 shows that priming with TT protein inhibited the gp350-specific IgG
response to tetrameric, but not monomeric gp350, For Fig. 6A, mice (5 per group) were
imunnizerd with 25 ug/mouse of monomeric or tetrameric gp350 in alum, Spleen cells were
harvested from each mouse on day 21 and separately cultured for 5h in medium containing
 10 U/mi rmiL-2 +/- 5 pg/ml of P2 and P30 YE-specific peptides. Golgi Stop was added I h
after initiation of culture. Cells were then stained for cytoplasmic IL-4 or IL-5 and analyzed
by flow cytomety. The percentage of gated CD4+ cells staining positively for each cytokine
is illustrated in Fig. 6A. *Significance, p<0 05. For Figs. 6B and 6C, Mice (5 per group) were
immunized with 25 pg/mouse (Fig. 6B) or 0,25 pg/mouse (Fig. 6C) of whole TT in alum for
 14 days. Mice were then challenged with 25 pg of tetrameric or monomeric gp350 in alum
and similarly boosted 14 days later. Serum titers of gp350-specific IgG were determined by
ELISA. *Significance, p90.05.
       [0024]    Figure 7 shows that the TT-specific T cell epitopes in tetrameric gp350 do not
contribute to the gp350-specific IgG response in naive mice. In Fig. 7A, mice (5 per group)
were immunized with monomeric gp350 protein, tetrameric gp35 0 containing TT epitopes
("tetramer"), or tetrameric gp350 without TT epitopes ("tetramer") at either 25 pg or 1.0 pg

were measured by ELISA (Fig, 7A). *Significance, p<0.05 between tetramer and monomer;

immunization with plasmids encoding monomer, tetramer, and tetramer 2 as described in Fig
3C; *Significance. p<0.05 between tetramer or tetramer~" versus monomer.
       [0025]   Figure 8 shows that the tetrameric gp350 binds more avidly to human CD21
than monomer CR2M i u cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with gp350 monomer or
tetramer (0.05-30 ptg/ml), washed, then incubated further with 2L 10 mAb (mouse IgG I anti
gp350 mAb) fLor 30 min. Cells were then washed, followed by staining with DyLight 633
labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Broken line: CR2M Ia
cells without gp350; solid line: with gp350,
       [0026]   Figure 9 shows that neither monomeric nor tetrameric gp350 polyclonally
activates human B cells. Purified peripheral blood human B cells were cultured for 24 or 72 h
with monomeric or tetrameric gp350 (10 pg/nl), recombinant PspA (10 pg/ml), goat anti
human IgM F(ab') 2 (20 pg/mi), or (SAC, 1:100 dilution) + recombinant human IL-2 (200
11/ml). Cells were then stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD69 mAb (24 h post-stimulation)
or PE-conjugated anti-CD25 mAb       t FITC-conjugated anti-CD86 mAb (72 h post
stimulation) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
      [0027]    Figure 10 shows that immunization of rabbits with tetrameric gp350 protein
(0,2 pg, 1.0 pg, or 5.0 pg) induces markedly higher levels of neutralizing gp350-specific
antibodies relative to monomer.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
      [0028]    It is to be understood that the following detailed description is provided to
give the reader a fuller understanding of certain embodiments, features, and details of aspects
of the invention, and should not be interpreted as a limitation of the scope of the invention
      [0029]    Defnitions. In order that the present invention may be more readily
understood, certain terms are first defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the
detailed description.
      [0030]    The term "antibody" as used in this disclosure refers to an imnunoglobulin or
an antigen-binding fragment thereof The term includes but is not limited to polyclonal,
Monoclonal, monospecific, polyspecific, non-specific, humanized, human, single-chain,

WO 2014/018858                                                               PCT/US2013/052270
                                                8
chienric, synthetic, recombinant, hybrid, mutated, grafted, and in vitro generated antibodies,
The antibody can include a constant region, or a portion thereof, such as the kappa, lambda,
alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes. For example, heavy chain
constant regions of the various isotypes can be used, including: IgG1 , igO2, 1g0    IgG 4, 1gM
IgA, IgA,, IgD, and IgE. By way of example, the light chain constant region can be kappa
or lambda.
       [003 1]   The terms "antigen-binding domain" and "antigen-binding fragment" refer
to a part of an antibody molecule that comprises amino acids responsible for the specific
binding between the antibody and antigen. For certain antigens, the antigen-binding domain
or antigen-binding fragment may only bind to a part of the antigen. The part of the antigen
that is specifically recognized and bound by the antibody is referred to as the "epitope" or
"antigenic determinant." Antigen-binding domains and antigen-binding fragments include
Fab (Fragment antigen-binding); a F(ab') fragment, a bivalent fragment having two Fab
fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; Fv fragment; a single chain Fv
fragment (seFv) see e.g, Bird el al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et a. (1988)
Proc; Nat Acad Sci. USA 85:5879-5883); a Fd fragment having the two VH and CHI
domains; dAb (Ward et al (1989) Nature 341:544-546), and other antibody fragments that
retain antigen-binding function. The Fab fragment has VjC I and V-C domains
covalently linked by a disulfide bond between the constant regions. The F, fragment is
smaller and has V{1 and Vt domains non-covalently linked, To overcome the tendency of
non-covalently linked domains to dissociate, a scF can be constructed. The seF, contains a
flexible polypeptide that links (1) the C-terminus of VH to the N-terminus of V, or (2) the
C-teniTus of VL to the N-terminus of Va1 . A 15-mer (Giy4Ser)3 peptide (SEQ ID NO:3) may
be used as a linker, but other linkers are known in the art. These antibody fragments are
obtained using conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the
fragments are evaluated for function in the same manner as are intact antibodies,
       [0032]    The term "fusion protein" refers to a protein translated from a nucleic acid
transcript generated by combining a first nucleic acid sequence that encodes a first protein
and at least a second nucleic acid that encodes a second protein, where the fusion protein is
not a naturally occurring protein. The nucleic acid construct may encode two or more
proteins that are joined in the fusion protein.
       [0033]    The term "adjuvanting protein" refers to a protein that enhances the immune
system's response to an antigen. An adjuvanting protein may accelerate, prolong, or enhance
antigen-specific immune responses when used in combination with specific antigens.

 WO 2014/018858                                                                 PCT/US2013/052270
                                                  9
 Exemplary adjuvanting proteins include, but are not limited to, flagellin, a heat shock protein,
 a toll like receptor ligand, or fragments or derivatives thereof that retain the adjuvanting
 property.
        [0034]    The term "cell surface targeting domain" refers to any moiety that will direct
 an antigen, vaccine, or specific cell to another specific cell type by binding to a specific cell
 surface receptor. Exemplary cell surface targeting domains, include, but not limited to, an
 antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof
        [0035]    The term "cellular activation domain" refers to any moiety that can either
 specifically or non-specifically bind to a cell and induce cellular activation. Exemplary
cellular activation domains include, but are not limited to, CD40 on B cells and CD28 on T
cells,
        [0036]    The term "molecule mediating immune suppression" or "molecule that
mediates immune suppression" refers to a molecule that upon binding to a cell induces

       [0040]     Fusion Proteins, The present disclosure relates to a new strategy for

 WO 2014/018858                                                                PCT/US2013/052270
                                                 10
 multimerizing protein antigens in vaccine-related or other immunotherapeutic constructs.
 The strategy involves creating nucleic acid constructs with oligomerization motifs and a
 linker sequence separating two or more antigens such that the encoded fusion protein can
 form a dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, hexameric, heptaneric, or octameric complex from a
 single nucleic acid construct. This strategy was tested first with a nucleic acid construct
 encoding two copies of a truncated EBV gp350 protein separated by a tinker and a leucine
 zipper oligonerization domain. To enhance the immunogenicity of the construct, two potent
 T cell epitopes derived from the tetanus toxoid were included because it was believed that
 they would be necessary to recruit sufficient T cell help. With the leucine zipper domain, this
 construct formed a tetrameric gp350 complex when expressed. Compared to the traditional
 monomeric gp350, the tetramer showed an approximately 25-50 -fold higher immunogenicity
 for specific antibody production both in the presence of weak and strong exogenous
 adjuvants. Surprisingly, however, the tetramer containing the tetanus toxoid T cell epitopes
 actually induced immune suppression in animals previously immunized with tetanus toxoid, a
potential problem if used clinically. Based on these results, another nucleic acid construct
 was prepared without the tetanus toxoid epitopes. This construct encoded two copies of the
 truncated EBV gp350 protein separated by a linker and a leucine zipper oligomerization
 domain, The construct without the tetanus toxoid epitopes induced gp350-specific antibody
 responses that were comparable to the antibody responses induced by the construct
 containing the tetanus toxoid epitopes, unexpectedly showing that the tetanus toxoid epitopes
were not required to achieve optimal immunogenicity in un-primed animals and in fact could
be suppressive.
       [0041)    This strategy for multimerizing proteins can be exploited with proteins other
than EBV gp350/220 proteins, including other viral, bacterial, parasitic, autoimmune, and
tumor antigens. This platform can be used to create multimcric fusion proteins comprising
multiple copies of a single antigen of interest, like an EBV gp350/220 antigen. For example,
a bomodimer, homotrimer or tetramer can be created using two, three, or four copies of the
same antigen with a dimerization, trimerization or tetramerization domain. When the
oligomerization domains associate together, the construct will form a tetramer (if a
dimerization domain is used) comprising four copies of the same antigen, a hexamer (if a
trimerization domain is used) comprising six copies of the same antigen, or an octaner
comprising eight copies of the same antigen (if a tetramerization domain is used).
       [0042]    Alternatively, this platform can be used to create multimeric fusion proteins
comprising two or more different antigens of interest. For example, a heterodimer can be

 WO 2014/018858                                                                  PCT/US2013/052270
                                                 11
 created with a first antigen linked to a second different, antigen (or a heterotrimer comprising
 two or three different antigens). When the oligomerization domains associate together, the
 construct will form a tetramer (if a dinerization domain is used) that is dineric for both the
 first and second antigen, a hexamer (if a trimeuization domain is used in the construct) that is
 dineric for at least the first and second antigen or trimeric for the first, second, and third
 antigen, or an octamer (if a tetramerization domain is used). Alternatively a trimeric protein
 can be formed if the original protein is presented in monomeric form in association with the
trimerization domain.

       [00653     Epstein Barr Virus. Epstein Barr virus (EBV), also known as human
herpesvirus 4, is a major global source of morbidity and mortality, responsible for such
pathologic entities as Burkitt lyniphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, infectious
mononucleosis, a subset of Hodgkin's disease, and the lynphoproliferative syndrome in
immunosuppressed patients [1 -3], EBV has a double stranded, linear DNA genome. The
nucleotide sequence of the EBV genome (SEQ ID N):15) and the amino acid sequences of
the viral proteins encoded thereby are known and set forth under the NCBI Reference
Number NC 009334, Version NC 009334.1, G:139424470, which sequences are hereby
incorporated by reference.
       [0066]     In the developing world, EBV seroconversion typically occurs in infancy,
whereas in developed countries it is more likely contracted in adolescence. Infectious
mononucleosis typically occurs only in this latter group [3]. The major human reservoir for
latent EBV and EBV transmission is the resting memory B lymphocyte [4]. EBV is
dependent upon the gp350-CD21 binding event for viral entry into the B cell [5, 6], an event
that is critical for infectivity and B cell neoplastic transformation [2]. Gp3 5 0 is the major
EBV outer membrane glycoprotein, while CD2 1, also known as complement receptor type 2
(CR2), is a receptor on the surface of B cells that binds to iC3b complement protein. Sera
from patients with active EBV infection contain antibody that prevent EBV entry into B cells
("neutralizing" antibody). Adsorption of these sera with gp350, eliminates most of this
neutralizing activity [7], indicating that gp350 serves as the major EBV antigen to which a
protective humoral immune response is directed.
       [0067]     A number of studies have demonstrated that immunization of non-human
primates with a subunit gp350 vaccine in adjuvant protects against experimental EBV
induced lymphoma or EBV replication. Thus, purified native gp350, injected into cottontop
marmosets (CTM), in association with liposomes, ISCOM's, or muramryl dipeptide, protected
against EBV-induced lymphoma [8, 9]. Recombinant gp350 in alum or muramnyl dipeptide
was similarly protective [10, 11]. Connon marmosets also showed decreased viral
replication after EBV challenge following immunization with recombinant gp350 in alum
[12]. Non-human primate studies using gp350 expressed by adenoviral or vaccinia viral

                                                 18
 vectors have similarly shown protection against experimental EBV-induced lymphoma or
 EBV replication in CTM or common marmosets [13-15].
       [0068]    A pilot study in humans has also suggested a potential role for gp350
vaccination in host protection against EBV, In a study by Gu et a] [16] a single dose of
gp350/220 expressed by vaccinia virus (VV) was give by scarification to 1-3 year olds who
were EV-scronegative, and VV-seronegative, These children developed neutralizing
antibodies to EBV (1:40-1: 160). Whereas 10/10 unvaccinated controls became infected at 16
months of follow-up, only 3/9 vaccinated children became infected at this time. More
recently, Phase 1/11 studies were conducted in which healthy EBV-seronegative adults were
immunized with a recombinant monomeric gp350 protein in alum +/- monophosphoryl lipid
A [17, 18]. Following 3 doses, up to 82% of subjects had detectable neutralizing serum anti
gp 350 antibody titers. The vaccine demonstrated an efficacy of 78.0% in preventing the
development of infectious mononucleosis but not in preventing asymptomatic EBV infection,
Finally, an additional phase I trial of recombinant monomeric gp350 protein in alum given to
children with chronic kidney disease demonstrated only a minority of subjects developing
detectable neutralizing serum anti-gp350 titers (19].
      [0069]     A monomeric protein, as used in phase 1/11 human clinical trials assessing
gp350-induced IgG responses, is by itself a relatively weak immunogen relative to proteins
that are expressed in a multimeric manner or that are aggregated [20-25]. Without intending
to be bound by any theory, increased iununogenicity of multimeric proteins is most likely
due, at least in part, to their more avid binding to, and crosslinking of the B cell receptor
followed by more potent signaling and enhanced uptake of antigen by the B cell.
      [0070]     G1350/220. The EBV glycoprotein gp350 and the related splice variant gp220
are responsible for attachment of EBV with high affinity to CR2 on B cells. Antibodies to
gp350/220 that block EBV binding neutralize B-cell infection. gp350/220 is a highly
glycosylated single-pass membrane protein. As a result of alternative splicing, the viral
glycoprotein appears in two forms, with approximate masses of 350 and 220 kDa. The 200
kDa splice form lacks residues 500-757 of the full length gp350. Both gp350 and gp220
retain the CR2 binding domain at the amino terminus. A truncated version of gp350/220
having amino acids 1-470 of gp350 retains the ability to bind CR2 and can inhibit the binding
of EBV to CR2 [29]. In addition, portions of the gp350/220 protein between amino acids 21
26 or between amino acids 372-378 of the gp350 sequence have been linked to CR2 binding
Tanner et aL, Cell 203-213 (1987) and Nemerow et al. 61:1416-20 (1987). Thus, the term
gp350/220 protein or gp350/220 antigen refers to the full length gp350 or gp220 proteins as

        [0080]   Variant polypeptides can be obtained by mutation of nucleotide sequences
 encoding the gp350/220, gH, gL, gB, or gp42 polypeptides. Alterations of the amino acid
 sequence can occur naturally, or be accomplished by any of a number of conventional
 methods. Mutations can be introduced at particular loci by synthesizing oligonucleotides
 containing a mutant sequence, flanked by restriction sites enabling ligation to fragments of
 the native sequence. Following ligation, the resulting reconstructed sequence encodes an
 analog having the desired amino acid insertion, substitution, or deletion.
        [0081]   Alternatively, oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis procedures
 can be employed to provide an altered gene wherein predetermined codons can be altered by
 substitution, deletion or insertion, Exemplary methods of making the alterations set forth
 above are disclosed by Waider et at (Gene 42: 133, 1986); Bauer et al, (Gene 37:73, 1985);

       [0082]    Oligomerization Domain. Oligomerization domains are polypeptides that
 cause polypeptides comprising them to oligomerize, ix., to form covalent and/or non
 covalent associations with another polypeptide comprising a corresponding oligomerization
 domain. Thus, two or more polypeptides are "oligomerized" if they are bound to each other
via their oligomerization domains. Any oligomerization domain known in the art can be used.
Examples include leucine zipper domains and fibritin domains. The polypeptides in an
oligomer can have identical polypeptide sequences, similar polypeptide sequences, or
different polypeptide sequences.
       [0083]    Homodimerization and homo-oligomerization refer to the association of the
same polypeptide components to form diners or oligomers. Heterodimerization and hetero
oligomerization refer to the association of different polypeptides to form diners or oligomers.
Homo-oligomers thus comprise an association of multiple copies of a particular polypeptide,
while hetero-oligomers comprise an association of copies of different polypeptides.
"Oligomerization," "oligomerize," and "oligomer," with or without prefixes, are intended to
encompass "dimerization," "dimerize," and "dimer." Thus, in one embodiment, the
oligonierization domain is a dimerization domain that mediates the self-association of two

domain that mediates the self-association of three fusion proteins, In another embodiment,
the oligomerization domain is a tetramerization domain that mediates the self-association of
four fusion proteins. In one embodiment, the trimerization domain is fibritin motif or a
eukaryotic GCN4 transcription factor motif or derivative thereof.
       [0084]    In one embodiment, the oligomerization domain comprises a leucine zipper
domain. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in
which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding
proteins (Landschulz et al., Science 240:1759, 1988), and have since been found in a variety
of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and
derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. For example, the yeast GCN4 leucine zipper
can be used to dimerize polypeptides of interest [27, 28]. Other examples of leucine zipper
domains suitable for producing soluble multimeric proteins are described in PCT application
WO 94/10308, and the leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD) described
in Hoppe et al FEBS Lett. 344-191, 1994. The use of a modified leucine zipper that allows
for stable trimerization of a heterologous protein fused thereto is described in Fanslow et al,
Semin. Immunol. 6:267, 1994.
       [0085]    In yet another embodiment, the oligornerization domain is a fibritin
trimerization motif, particularly a bacteriophage fibritin trimerization motif, more particularly
a fibritin trimerization domain from bacteriophage T4 or phage RB69 or phage ARI or a
derivative thereof. The T4 fibritin trimerization domain and variants thereof are described in
U.S. Pat. No. 6,911,205; U.S. Patent No. 8,147,843, and WO 0 A/19958, which are hereby
incorporated by reference in their entirety.
       [0086]    Linker Sequences. Linker sequences are used in the fusion proteins to
separate different components of the fusion protein. Thus, the amino terminal end of the
linker segpence is joined by a peptide bond to a first polypeptide and the carboxy terminal
end of the linker sequence is joined by a peptide bind to a second polypeptide. The first or
second polypeptide may be an antigen, an oligomerization domain, an adjuvanting protein, a
cell surface targeting domain, a molecule that mediates immune suppression, or a cellular
activation domain. Such a linker sequence joins the first polypeptide and the second
polypeptide, in contrast to a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide that are joined
together without an intervening polypeptide sequence. Thus, the linker sequence can join
two antigens, an antigen and an oligomerization domain, an antigen and an adjuvanting
protein, an antigen and a cell surface targeting domain, an antigen and a molecule that
mediates immune suppression, and an antigen and a cellular activation domain, an

 WO 2014/018858                                                                PCT/US2013/052270

 adjuvanting protein and an oligomerization domain, etc. It is understood that the linker
 sequence is not a sequence that naturally separates a first and second polypeptide, if the first
 and second polypeptide happen to naturally exist in combination together.
        [00871   in one embodiment, the linker sequence is a polypeptide having 5-25 amino
 acids, particularly a length of6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 12, 13, 14 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 amino
acids. In another embodiment, the linker sequence is a polypeptide having 10-25 amino acids,
The linker sequence preferably comprises glycine and shrine amino acids. In one
embodiment, the linker sequence is 15 amino acids in length and has the amino acid sequence
(GlyASer) (SEQ ID NO:3),
        [0088]   Other suitable peptide linkers are those described in US, Pat, Nos. 4,751,180,
4,935,233, and 5,073,627, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. A
DNA sequence encoding a desired linker sequence may be inserted between, and in the same
reading frame as, for example, DNA sequences encoding the first and second polypeptide
using conventional techniques known in the art. For example, a chemically synthesized
oligonucleotide encoding the linker may be ligated between sequences encoding the first and
second polypeptide.
       100891    Nucleic Acids, Cloning and Expression Systems. The present disclosure
further provides isolated nucleic acids encoding the disclosed fusion proteins. The nucleic
acids may comprise DNA or RNA and may be wholly or partially synthetic or recombinant.
Reference to a nucleotide sequence as set out herein encompasses a DNA molecule with the
specified sequence, and encompasses a RNA molecule with the specified sequence in which
U is substituted for T, unless context requires otherwise.
       [0090]    The present disclosure also provides constructs in the form of plasmids,
vectors, phagemids, transcription or expression cassettes which comprise at least one nucleic

cell which comprises one or more constructs as above.
       [00911    Also provided are methods of making the fusion proteins encoded by these
nucleic acids, The fusion proteins may be produced using recombinant techniques. The
production and expression of recombinant proteins is well known in the art and can be carried
out using conventional procedures, such as those disclosed in Sambrook et al., Molecular
Cloning: A LaboratoryManual (4th Ed. 2012), Cold Spring Harbor Press. For example,
expression of the fusion protein may be achieved by culturing under appropriate conditions
recombinant host cells containing the nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein. Following
production by expression a fusion protein may be isolated and/or purified using any suitable

        [00921   Systems for cloning and expression of a polypeptide in a variety of different
 host cells are well known in the art. Any protein expression system compatible with the
 constructs disclosed in this application may be used to produce the disclosed fusion protein.
        [00931   Suitable vectors can be chosen or constructed, so that they contain appropriate
 regulatory sequences, including promoter sequences, terminator sequences, polyadenylation
 sequences, enhancer sequences, marker genes and other sequences as appropriate,
        [0094]   A further aspect of the disclosure provides a host cell comprising a nucleic
acid as disclosed herein. A still further aspect provides a method comprising introducing
such nucleic acid into a host cell, The introduction may employ any available technique. For
eukaryotic cells, suitable techniques may include calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE
Dextran, electroporation., liposome-mediated transfection and transduction using retrovirus or
other virus, e.g., vaccinia or, for insect cells, baculovirus, For bacterial cells, suitable
techniques may include calcium chloride transformation, eleciroporation and transfection
using bacteriophage. These techniques are well inown in the art. See e.g., Current Protocols
in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et a]. eds., John Wiley & Sons (2010) DNA introduction
may be followed by a selection method (e.g., antibiotic resistance) to select cells that contain
the vector.
       [0095]    Vaccine Compositions. The fusion proteins and nucleic acids encoding the
same that are described in this application provide an improved platform for developing a
vaccine that achieves enhanced immunogenicity in a subject.
       [0096]    Thus, one aspect is directed to a composition comprising the nucleic acid
encoding the fusion protein or the fusion protein, at least one pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient, and optionally an adjuvant (hereinafter referred to as "vaccine composition"). In
certain embodiments, the vaccine composition does not include an adjuvant.
       [00971   The pharmaceutically acceptable excipient can be chosen from, for example,
diluents such as starch, microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, lactose, sorbitol,
mannitol, sucrose, methyl dextrins; binders such as povidone, hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose, dihydroxy propyleellulose, and sodium carboxylmethylcellulose; and
disintegrants such as crospovidone, sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose sodium, and
mixtures of any of the foregoing. The pharmaceutically acceptable excipient can further be
chosen from lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl
behenate, hygrogenated vegetable oil, glycerine fumerate and glidants such as colloidal
silicon dioxide, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable

                                                 26
 excipient is chosen from microcrystalline cellulose, starch, talc, povidone, crospovidone,
 magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and mixtures of any of
the foregoing. The excipients can be intragranular, intergranular, or mixtures thereof
       [0098]   The vaccine composition can be formulated as freeze-dried or liquid
preparations according to any means suitable in the art. Non-limiting examples of liquid
form preparations include solutions, suspensions, syrups, slurries, and emulsions. Suitable
liquid carriers include any suitable organic or inorganic solvent, for example, water, alcohol,
saline solution, buffered saline solution, physiological saline solution, dextrose solution,
water propylene glycol solutions, and the like, preferably in sterile form. After formulation,
the vaccine composition can be incorporated into a sterile container which is then sealed and
stored at a low temperature (e.g., 40 C), or it can be freeze dried.
       [0099)   The vaccine composition can be formulated in either neutral or salt forms.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino
groups of the active polypeptides) and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for
example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or organic acids such as acetic, oxalic, tartaric,
mandelic, and the like, Salts formed from free carboxyl groups can also be derived from
inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric
hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol,
histidine, procaine, and the like.
       [00100] The vaccine composition can optionally comprise agents that enhance the
protective efficacy of the vaccine, such as adjuvants. Adjuvants include any compound or
compounds that act to increase an immune response to an antigen delivered by the fusion
protein, thereby reducing the quantity of fusion protein (or nucleic acid encoding the same)
necessary in the vaccine, and/or the frequency of administration necessary to generate a
protective immune response. Adjuvants can include for example, emulsifiers, muramyl
dipeptides, avridine, aqueous adjuvants such as aluminum hydroxide, chitosan-based
adjuvants, and any of the various saponins, oils, and other substances known in the art, such
as Amphigen, LPS, bacterial cell wall extracts, bacterial DNA, CpG sequences, synthetic
oligonucleotides and combinations thereof (Schijns er at (2000) Curr, Opin. Immunol.
12:456), Mycobacterialphlei (M phlei) cell wall extract (MCWE) (U.S, Patent No
4,744,984),. M phlei DNA (M-DNA), and ML phlei cell wall complex (MCC). Compounds
which can serve as emulsifiers include natural and synthetic emulsifying agents, as well as
anionic, cationic and nonionic compounds, Among the synthetic compounds, anionic
emulsifying agents include, for example, the potassium, sodium and ammonium salts of

 WO 2014/018858                                                                 PCT/US2013/052270
                                                 27
 lauric and oleic acid, the calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts of faty acids, and organic
 sulfonates such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Synthetic cationic agents include, for example,
 cetyltrhethylammonlum bromide, while synthetic nonionic agents are exemplified by
 glycerylesters (e.g., glyceryl monostearate), polyoxyethylene glycol esters and ethers, and the
 sorbitan fatty acid esters (e.g., sorbitan monopalmitate) and their polyoxyethylene derivatives
 (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate). Natural emulsifying agents include acacia,
 gelatin, lecithin and cholesterol.
         [00101] Other suitable adjuvants can be formed with an oil component, such as a
 single oil, a mixture of oils, a water-in-oil emulsion, or an oil-in-water emulsion. The oil can
 be a mineral oil, a vegetable oil, or an animal oil. Mineral oils are liquid hydrocarbons
 obtained from petrolatum via a distillation technique, and are also referred to in the art as
 liquid paraffin, liquid petrolatum, or white mineral oil, Suitable animal oils include, for
 example, cod liver oil, halibut oil, menhaden oil, orange roughy oil and shark liver oil all of
 which are available commercially. Suitable vegetable oils, include, for example, canola oil,
 almond oil, cottonseed oil, com oil, olive oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, soybean
 oil, and the like. Freund's Complete Adj uvant (FCA) and Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant
 (FIA) are two common adjuvants that are commonly used in vaccine preparations, and are
 also suitable for use in the present invention. Both FCA and PIA are water-in-mineral oil
 emulsions; however, FCA also contains a killed Mycobacterium sp.
        [00102] immunomodulatory cytokines can also be used in the vaccine compositions to
 enhance vaccine efficacy, for example, as an adjuvant, Non-limiting examples of such
cytokines include interferon alpha (IFN-a), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and granulocyte
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or combinations thereof.
        [00103] The vaccine composition can be prepared using techniques well known to
those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, mixing, sonication and nicrofluidation
The adjuvant can comprise from about 10% to about 80% (v/v) of the vaccine composition.,
more preferably about 20% to about 50% (v/v), and more preferably about 20% to about 30%
(v/v,), or any integer within these ranges.
        [00104] The vaccine composition can be administered to any animal, and preferably is
a mammal such as a human, mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, cat, dog, monkey, cow,
horse, pig, and the like. Humans are most preferred.
        [001053 Administration of the vaccine composition can be by infusion or injection
(e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intrathecal,
intraduodenally, intraperitoneally, and the like). The vaccine composition can also be

 administered intranasailly, vaginally, rectally, orally, intratonsilar, or transdermally,
 Additionally, the vaccine composition can be administered by "needle-free" delivery systems.
         [00106] The effective amount of the vaccine composition may be dependent on any
 number of variables, including without limitation, the species, breed, size, height, weight,
 age, overall health of the patient, the type of formulation, or the mode or manner or
 administration, The appropriate effective amount can be routinely determined by those of
 skill in the art using routine optimization techniques and the skilled and informed judgment
 of the practitioner and other factors evident to those skilled in the art. Preferably, a
 therapeutically effective dose of the vaccine composition described herein will provide the
 therapeutic preventive benefit without causing substantial toxicity to the subject,
         1001073 The vaccine composition can be administered to a patient on any schedule
 appropriate to induce and/or sustain an immune response against EBV Gp350/220 or any
 other protein of interest. For example, patients can be administered a vaccine composition as
 a primary imnunization as described and exemplified herein, followed by administration of a
 secondary immunization, or booster, to bolster and/or maintain protective immunity.
        [00108] The vaccine administration schedule, including primary immunization and
booster administration, can continue as long as needed for the patient, for example, over the
course of several years, to over the lifetime of the patient. The frequency of primary vaccine
 and booster administration and dose administered can be tailored and/or adjusted to meet the
particular needs of individual patients, as determined by the administering physician
 according to any means suitable in the art.
        [001091 The vaccine composition may be administered prophylactically (before
exposure to the antigen or pathogen of interest) or therapeutically (after exposure to the
antigen or pathogen of interest).
        [001101 Methods of inducing or Suppressing an Immune Response. In another
aspect, the vaccine composition comprising the fusion protein (or nucleic acid encoding the
same) can be used in a method of inducing or suppressing an immune response. The immune
response can be induced in a naive subject who has not previously been exposed to EBV,
CMV, or HIMV (or some other foreign pathogen). Alternatively, the immune response can be
induced or suppressed in a subject who has been previously exposed to EBV, CMV, or HIV
(or some other foreign pathogen) and used to enhance an existing immune response,
        [00111] In one embodiment, the method of enhancing or suppressing an immune
response comprises administering to a subject a vaccine composition comprising a fusion
protein, as described in this application, wherein the fusion protein induces or suppresses an

imrnmune response against an antigen in the fusion protein in the subject. In another
embodiment, the method of enhancing or suppressing an immune response comprises
administering to a subject a vaccine composition comprising a nucleic acid construct that
encodes a fusion protein, as described in this application, wherein the fusion protein is
expressed in the subject and induces or suppresses an immune response against an antigen in
the fusion protein in the subject.
       [0011:21 In these methods of inducing or suppressing an immune response, the immune
response can be measured using routine methods in the art, such as those disclosed in this
application, These routine methods include, but are not limited to, measuring an antibody
response, such as an antibody response directed against a protein encoded by the recombinant
vector, and measuring cellular proliferation, including, for example, by measuring tritiated
thymidine incorporation or cytokine (e.g., IFN-y) production.
       [00113] Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have
the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, Although
methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the
practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described
below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein
are incorporated by reference in their entirety; In case of conflict, the present specification,
including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are
illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.
       EXAMPLES
       1001141 To test whether protein multimerization can provide a cost-etTective and
reproducible means for enhancing immune responses to target antigens of interest, a
recombinant nucleic acid plasmnid was designed to encode a fusion protein comprising a first
and second antigen, separated by a linker sequence and an oligomerization domain. In the
test construct prepared to validate the system, two identical gp350 sequences are separated by
a (Gly4Ser)3 (SEQ ID NO:3) linker to allow for proper protein folding [26], followed by a
Saccharomyces cerevisiae G3CN4 leucine zipper sequence [27, 28] to mediate self-association
of the gp350 dimer, and thus formation of a tetrameric gp350. Immunization of mice with
either the plasmid DNA itself or the resulting tetrameric protein results in markedly higher
titers of gp350-specific IgG relative to the gp350 monorner, even in the presence of a strong
adjuvant. Most importantly, the gp350 subunits that comprise the tetrameric protein are
conformationally intact and elicit serum titers ofneutralizing antibody that are more than 19-

                                              30
 fold higher than that induced by monomer. These data strongly suggest a promising, new
 prophylactic EBV vaccine for future clinical testing, as well as a more general approach to
 enhance the imnmunogenicity of other proteins of vaccine interest.

      [00131] EXAMPLE P DNA plasmid andproduction of a tetraneric gp350 protein
containing TT-specific CD4+ T cell epitopes. Optimal antibody responses to protein
antigens require both dominant B and T cell epitopes. Although the EBV gp350 envelope
protein is a potential target for an antibody-based prophylactic EBV vaccine, the relative
strength and dominance of its T cell epitopes are unknown. Highly immunogenic carrier
proteins, such as tetanus toxoid (TT), are utilized in polysaccharide conjugate vaccines to
recruit CD4 T cell help for the associated IgG anti-polysaccharide response. Initially, it was
believed that adding TT to the EBV construct would help enhance and optimize the antibody
response to the gp350 proteins. This initial belief was reinforced with early experiments
comparing the relative ability of gp350 versus TT to promote an igG response specific for
pneumococcal polysaccharide, serotype 14 (PPS 14), and thus indirectly to recruit CD4+ T
cell help, Mice were immunized i~p, with either I or 5 pg ofgp350-PPSl4 or TT-PPS14 in
alum + CpG-ODN as adjuvant and similarly boosted on day 14. Serum titers of PPS14
specific IgG, measured on day 21, were significantly higher using TT-PPS14 relative to
gp350-PPS 14 using either 1 or 5 pig of conjugate (Fig. 1), strongly suggesting that TT
contained more potent CD4+ T cell epitopes,

 cells, mediating EBV entry. Thus, proper folding of the individual gp350 molecules in the
 tetramer was considered important. Given the known properties of TT as a potent inOucer of
 CD4 T helper cells and the data illustrated in Fig. 1, two universal human YT-specific CD4+
 T cell epitopes (P2 and P30) [30] were introduced into the construct to maximize recruitment
 of T cell help for the gp350-specific IgG response. The construct design is illustrated in Fig,
 2A. Specifically, an IgG light chain leader sequence was introduced 5' to facilitate protein
 secretion, followed by two identical gp350 sequences separated by a (Gy 4 Ser3 linker (SEQ
 ID NO:3) to allow br proper protein folding [26], Sequences encoding P2 and P30 were
 introduced 3' to the second gp350 followed by a Saccharomyces cereivisiae GCN4 leucine
 zipper sequence [27, 28] to mediate self-association of the gp 3 50 dimer, and thus formation
 of a tetramneric gp350. A His 6 tag (SEQ ID NO: 14) was positioned 3' of the leucine zipper for
purposes of purification. A DNA construct encoding a monomeric gp350 lacking TT-specific
epitopes was also produced for comparison
        [00133] To produce protein, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were stably
transfected with either tetrameric or monomeric gp 3 50 DNA, and high-producing CHO cells
were selected using increasing concentrations of methotrexate in the culture medium. Protein
was purified from culture supernatant and detected by SDS-PAGE (denaturing) and PAGE
(native) using the gp350-specific 72A 1 mAb that recognizes the CD2 1-binding,
conformational epitope [31] (Fig, 213). Under denaturing conditions, in which leucine zipper
binding is disrupted single band of about 200 Kd was observed for the resulting gp350
dimer, whereas under native conditions a single band representing intact tetrameric gp350 of
about 400 Kd was detected. in both cases, monomeric gp350 was detected as an
approximately 100 Kd band. Of note, under denaturing conditions the concentration of 72A 1
mAb required for development of a detectable band was 10-fold higher than that necessary
under native conditions, likely reflecting loss of gp350 conformation in the former.

 monomer, whereas tetramer at a dose of 012 gg/mouse elicited a barely detectable gp350
 specific IgG response (data not shown). Thus, tetrameric gp350 exhibited about 25-fold
higher immunogenicity on a per weight basis relative to monomer. In marked contrast to
tetramer, monomer induced a barely detectable gp350-specific IgG response at 1.0 jig.
        [00135] Next the effects of an adjuvant more potent than alum were tested to
 determine whether the differences observed between the imrniunogenicity of tetrameric and
 monomeric gp350 would still be manifest in the presence of the more potent adjuvant, Mice
were immunized i.p. with 25 or 1.0 pg of tetrameric or monomeric gp350 per mouse in the
presence of alum and 25 pig of a stimulatory 30-mer CPG-contaning oligodeoxynucleotide
(CpG-ODN), a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR)9 1401. Addition of CpG-ODN to alum
 resulted in a 21 -fold enhancement in the secondary serum gp350-specific IgG titers in
response to 25    [pg of tetrameric gp350 relative to that observed using only alum as adjuvant
(Fig, 3B). Similarly, CpG-ODN enhanced the response to 25 pig of monomeric gp350 by 54
fold. Nevertheless, at the 25 ig dose, tetrameric gp350 still induced 1 1-fold higher gp350
specific IgG titers relative to 25 pig of monomer. Of note, in the presence of alum + CpG
ODN, I pig of tetrameric gp350 induced responses that were comparable to mice receiving 25
  ig of monomer. Even at the lower and much weaker immunogenic dose of I pg, tetrameric
gp350 induced 21--fold higher serum titers of gp350-specific IgG relative to monomer. Thus,
tetrameric gp350 is markedly more immunogenic than monomeric gp350 even in the
presence of a relatively strong adjuvant.
        [00136] Vaccination with p lasmid DNA may confer a number of advantages over
protein immunization [41], including the ability to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated

igG following primary immunization, and boost at 4 weeks, of equal amounts of DNA
encoding monomer versus tetramer was compared. DNA was introduced into the epidermis
on microscopic gold particles (ixe particle-mediated epidermal delivery [PMED]) [42, 431.
Primary immunization with either plasmid induced minimal serum titers of gp350-specific
IgG by 4 weeks (Fig. 3C). However, upon boosting, both plasmids induced a significant
gp350-specific IgG response by week 6, Of note, the secondary gp350-specific IgG response
to the DNA encoding tetrameric gp350 was 8-fold higher (p=0.0004 ) than that elicited by

IgG2a comparable to and lower (about 3-fold), respectively, to that observed for gp350
protein in alum + CpG-ODN, whereas no detectable lgG2b was observed in response to DNA
(Fig. 3D), Minimal titers of gp350-specific IgG3 were produced in response to any of the 3
immunization groups.
       [00137] EXAMPLE 3: The enhanced gp330-specific IgG response requires both
pricing and boosting with the tetrameric form of gp3S0. The stimulatory requirements for
elicitation of a T cell-dependent secondary response are typically less stringent than that for
induction of a primary [44, 45]. The substantially higher secondary gp350-specific IgG
responses observed following priming and boosting with tetrameric gp350 relative to
monomer, could have been caused by the tetraneric gp350 during the primary and/or
secondary immunization. To determine this, four groups of mice were established in which
various combinations of priming and boosting with tetrameric and monomer gp350 were
performed, using alum as adjuvant, As illustrated in Fig. 4, only both priming and boosting
with tetrameric gp350 resulted in significantly higher secondary serum titers of gp350
specific IgG relative to priming and boosting with monomer.
       [001381 EXAMPL E 4: Immunization with tetrameric gp350 protein induces
markedly higher levels of neutralizing gp350-specqic Ig relative to monomer. Binding of
EBV gp350 to CD21 is necessary for viral entry into the B cell [5, 6], an event that is critical
for infectivity and B cell neoplastic transformation [2]. Thus, elicitation of antibody that
blocks this interaction (i.e. "neutralizing" antibody) [7] may serve as the basis for an effective
prophylactic EBV vaccine [17, 18]. In this regard, a gp350-specife mAb was previously
produced (clone 72Al), that can specifically block gp350 binding to human CD21 [31]. To
measure the amount of neutralizing antibody in sera from gp350-immunized mice, an
erythroleukemia cell line transfected with human CD21I (CR2MIa) was used. Initially,
monomeric gp350 was directly labeled with the fluorochrome DyLight 633 and mixed with
varying amounts of 72A1 mAb prior to incubation with CR2Mla cells. A standard
neutralization curve was generated that related the amount of 72AI mAb added with a fixed
amount of gp350-DyLight 633, and the subsequent mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of
staining of CR2MIa cells. Monomeric gp350-DyLight 633 was then mixed with undiluted
pre-immune sera or sera from mice following priming and boosting with 25 ptg of tetrameric
or monomeric gp350 and subsequently incubated with CR2M Ia cells. As illustrated in Fig,
5, pre-immune sera contained <4.0 pg/ml of 72A1 mAb-equivalents of neutralizing activity.

                                                 39
Whereas, monomeric gp350 induced 13 ptg/ml of neutralizing activity, tetramner induced 253
 JLg/ml, a 19-fold greater level of activity than monomer. Of interest the difference in
neutralizing activity between sera obtained from monomer- versus tctrame rimmunized mice
closely mirrored the difference observed for total (neutralizing and non-neutralizing) serum
titers of gp350-specific IgG (see Fig. 3) These data indicate that tetrameric gp3 50 is a more
effective EBV vaccine candidate than monomeric gp30, the latter already shown to he safe,
and to have partial efficacy in reducing the incidence of infectious mononucleosis in phase
1/11 clinical trials [17, 18].
       [001 39-1 EXAiMPLE 5. Priming with TTprotein can inhibit the gp3SS0specific IgG
response to tetraneric, but not monomeric gp35. Two universal TT-specific TT epitopes
were introduced into the tetrameric gp350 vaccine with the expectation that this would
contribute to the enhancement of the gp350-specific IgG response relative to monomeric
gp350. In this regard, children typically receive TT as a vaccine for protection against
Clostridium tetani, and thus are likely to have T-primed CD4+ T cells. It has been
demonstrated that pre-immunization of mice with TT suppressed a subsequent antibody
response to synthetic peptides conjugated to TT [46] and that this was due to clonal
dominance [47] and required CD4+ T cells for its induction [48]. Thus, it was first
determined whether tetrameric gp350 primed TT-specific CD4+ T cells in vivo, and if initial
priming of mice with whole TT protein would impact on the subsequent gp350-specific IgG
response to tetramer, Mice were immunized with 25 pg of tetrameric or monomeric gp350 in
alum On day 21 spleen cells were isolated and cultured with the P2 and P30 TT peptides,
followed by flow cytometric analysis of gated CD4+ T cells for intracytoplasmic expression
of IL-4 and IL-5. CD4+ T cells from mice primed with tetrameric gp350, but not monomer
primed or naive mice, exhibited a significant increase in CD4+ T cells expressing
cytoplasmic IL-4 and IL-5 following elicitation with TT peptide in vitro, but not in the
presence of medium alone (Fig. 6A). This indicated that tetrameric gp350 primed TT-specific
CD4+ T cells in vivo. Next, naive mice were immunized with 25 pg of whole TT protein in
alum, with boosting in a similar fashion on day 14, resulting in readily detectable serum titers
of TT-specific IgG by day 21 (data not shown). TT-primed and non-primed mice were then
immunized with 25 tg of monomeric or tetrameric gp350 in alum and boosted in a similar
fashion 14 days later, Non-primed mice immunized with tetrameric gp350 elicited a
significantly higher gp350-specific IgG response relative to monomer (Fig. 6B), as
demonstrated earlier (Fig, 3A), However, in TT-primed mice, the gp350-specific IgG
response was inhibited in response to tetrameric, but not monomeric, grp350, so that no

                                               40
 significant difference in serum titers was observed between the two groups. Utilizing a 100
 fold lower dose of TT that induced about 3-fold lower secondary serum titers of TTspecific
 IgG than that observed using 25 pg of TT for priming (data not shown), no inhibition was
 observed, and no enhancement, of the gp350-specific IgG response to tetramer (Fig. 6C). The
 TT-specific IgG antibodies elicited in response to TT did not bind tetrameric gp350 as
 indicated by ELISA assay (data not shown), consistent with P2 and PN being T cell, and not
 B cell, epitopes. Thus, Tr priming, in a dose-dependent fashion, can result in inhibition of an
 antibody response to a protein antigen containing TT-specific T cell epitopes, consistent with
 earlier reports [46-48].
        [0014031 EXAMPLE 6: The TT-.specifc T cell epitopes in tetrameric gp350 do not
 contribute to the gp350-specifc IgG response in naive mice. To determine the extent, if
 any, to which the TT epitopes contributed to the more potent imnunogenicity of tetrameric
 versus monomeric gp350 in naYve mice, a new DNA plasmid was constructed in which the
TT-specific T cell epitopes were deleted in the DNA encoding tetra.meric TT (referred to as
 "tetramer"). The new plasmid was validated by sequencing, and immunoelectrophoresis of
CHO cell-expressed protein using 72A1 mAb. A new set of mice vere immunized with 25 or
 10 pg of monomer, tetramer, or tetramer" in alum and boosted in a similar fashion on day
21. As illustrated in Fig. 7A, the tetramer and tetramef" induced dose-dependent gp350
specific IgG responses that were not significantly different from each other, but that were
each about 25-fold higher than that elicited by monomer at each of the two doses. Again, in
contrast to the robust gp350-specific IgG responses observed with I pg of tetramer or
tetramer", I pg of monomer induced a barely detectable response, Similarly, tetramer and
tetrame<"elicited a similar gp3 50-specific neutralizing antibody response at the 25 pg dose,
that was each greater than 40-fold higher than that elicited by monomer (Fig. 713). Finally,
immunization with plasmid DNA encoding tetramer and tetrame" elicited gp350-specific
IgG responses that were similar, but about 8-fold higher than that observed using plasmid
DNA encoding monomeric gp350 (Fig. 7C). These data strongly suggest that the marked
enhancement in the gp350-specific IgG response to tetrameric versus monomeric gp350 is
based exclusively on protein multimerization, and not to the provision of stronger T cell
epitopes.
       [00141 ] EXAMPLE 7: Tetrameric gp350 binds more avidly to human CD21 than
monomer. The capacity of B cells to bind cognate antigen via their B cell receptor (BCR)
and present the resulting peptide/MHC-iI to CD4t' T cells is a critical event in the evolution
of a T cell-dependent humnoral immune response In this regard, multimerization of antigen

 may boost imnutogenicity, at least in part, by promoting more avid BCR binding to specific
 B cells. Gp350 is a ligand for human, although not mouse, CD21. Thus, human CD21,
 expressed by the CR2Mla, was used as a surrogate for BCR binding to gp350, to compare
 the efficiency of binding of tetrameric versus monomeric gp350. To accomplish this,
 CR2Mlca cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled monomer or
 tetramer (0.05~30 jig/ml), followed by unlabeled 2L10 mAb (mouse igGl anti-gp350). This
 maAb binds to gp350 at a site distinct from the CD21-binding site, and hence is not blocked
upon gp350/CD2I binding. This was followed by staining with DyLight 633-labeled goat
anti-mouse IgG and analysis by flow cytometry, Incubation of CR2Mlct cells with increasing
concentrations of monomeric and tetraneric gp350 resulted in a dose-dependent progressive
increase in MFI staining in both cases (Fig. 8). Of note, staining using 1,25 pg/mi of
tetrameric gp350 resulted in an MFI equivalent to 30 pg/ml of monomeric gp350, suggesting
about 24-fold greater binding avidity of tetramer versus monomer. This degree of difference
in apparent avidity of binding is similar to that observed for induction of gp350-specific IgG
and neutralizing antibody in response to tetramer versus monomer. These data are consistent
with the notion that greater BCR binding to tetrameric gp350 by gp350-specfic B cells may
account, at least in part, for its greater immunogenicity in vivo.
       [001421 EXAMPLE 8: Neither monomeric nor tetramericgp350 polyclonally
activates human B cells. Purified, recombinant gp350 has been shown to upregulate IL-6
mRNA synthesis in human B cells in a CD2 1-dependent manner [49]. This suggests that
tetrameric gp350, which is predicted to induce CD21 crosslinking on human B cells, could
potentially act as a polyclonal B cell activator, with possible unwanted side-effects when used
as a vaccine, To determine this, purified peripheral blood human B cells were incubated with
 10 pg/ml of monomeric or tetrameric gp350, or a negative control protein (pneumococcal
surface protein A [PspAl), As positive controls we used anti-IgM antibody or SAC + IL-2 for
B cell activation, As illustrated in Fig, 9, neither monomeric nor tetrameric gp350, nor PspA,
upregulated the activation markers CD69 (at 24 brs) or CD25 (at 24 or 72 hrs), nor the
costimulatory molecule CD86 (at 24 or 72 brs). In contrast, anti-IgM or SAC + IL-2 strongly
upregulated all 3 of these markers. Further, in contrast to anti-IgM or SAC +" IL-2, neither
monomeric nor tetrameric gp350 induced increases in B cell size (data not shown), These
data are consistent with a previous report demonstrating that aggregated or latex-bound C3dg,
which crosslink CD21, lack the ability to directly trigger G I entry by resting human B cells
[50). These data strongly suggest that a tetrameric gp350 vaccine will not induce polyclonal
B cell activation in VIvoM

       (00 143] EXA MPLE 9: Tetrameric gp350 immunization in a permissive rabbit model
The rabbit, in contrast to the mouse, is a permissive model for EBV infection, and thus ideal
 for pre-clinical testing of an EBV vaccine [673. This likely reflects, in part, our own
observation that rabbit B cells, in contrast to mouse B cells, bind gp350, most likely by
 binding to B cell CD21, Thus, flow cytonetric analysis using Dyiight-labeled gp350 and
FITC-anti-rabbit IgM mAb to stain B cells was conducted to determine whether gp350 binds
to rabbit B cells. Both peripheral blood and splenic B cells, isolated from New Zealand white
rabbits, showed strong double staining. No staining was observed using a negative control,
Dylight-labeled pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) (data not shown).
         Next a series of dose response immunization studies of tetrameric versus monomeric
gp350 were performed to determine the relative immunogenicity of monomeric gp350 and
tetrameric gp350 in rabbits. Rabbits (4 per group) were immunized s.c. with 5.0, 1.0, or 0.2
 gg of monomeric or tetrameric gp350 in alum and boosted in a similar fashion on day 14.
Sera were collected at day 0, 14, and 28 for measurement of gp350-speciflc IgG titers by
ELISA (Figure 10). As illustrated, tetrameric gp350 was markedly more immunogenic than
monomeric gp350 at all doses. The difference in serum titers of gp350-specific IgG between
tetramer and monomer in the rabbit were up to 100-fold, compared to the -20-fold
differences observed in the mouse. Since co-crosslinking of CD21 and the B cell receptor
(BCR) induce synergistic B cell signaling, tetrameric gp350 may also act as an intramolecular
adjuvant in rabbits (and by extension humans).
       [00144] Example 10: Construction of other EBV mnltimneric constructs. BBV
infection and persistence is critically dependent upon viral entry into B cells and
nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. B cell infection involves initial binding of EBV gp350 to B
cell CD2I followed by binding of EBV gp42 to B cell MHC class 11 molecules. This results
in viral fusion and entry mediated by EBV gH/gL heterodimer and gB. Epithelial cell
infection by B1V also involves gl/gh and gB, but not gp 3 5 0 or gp 4 2. The multimerization
techique described in this application has been used to produce an EBV gHlgL heterodimer
with a trimerization domain, The multimerization techniques can be similarly used to
produce multimeric gB or gp42 constructs,
       [00145] Discussion: In this study, a tetramer of the EBV envelope protein gp350 was
created by constructing a plasmid in which two copies of a truncated gp350, containing the
CD2I -binding neutralization epitope, were separated by a linker, to allow for conformational
folding.This dimeric gp350 underwent further dimerization to form a tetramer following
translation within transfected CHO cells, via homotypic binding of 3' leucine zipper motifs.

WO 2014/018858                                                                    PCT/US2013/052270
                                               43
This protein multimerization strategy resulted in a marked eniancement in elicitation of
gp350-specific IgO, including neutralizing antibody, relative to monomeric gp350. Enhanced
immunogenicity of tetrameric versus monomeric gp350 was observed following direct
immunization with plasmid, or with protein in the presence of even a strong adjuvant such as
alum + CpG-ODN. Tetrameric gp350 bound much more efficiently to human CD21 but did
not polyclonally activate human B cells. Furthermore, when the immunogenicity of the
multimeric construct was tested in the permissive rabbit model, the difference in serum titers
of gp350-specific IgG between tetramer and monomer in the rabbit were up to 100-fold,
compared to the 20--fold differences observed in the mouse. Thus, these data support the
value of testing tetramerie gp350 in clinical trials for its potential to elicit more protective
immunity against such EBV-mediated diseases as infectious mononucleosis, and perhaps
neoplastic transformation, as opposed to monomeric gp350 used in previous, small-scale
human studies [16-19]. These data also support the use of this multimerization strategy to
enhance humnoral immune responses to other proteins of vaccine interest, in a reproducible
and cost-effective manner.
       [00146] Multimerization of proteins/peptides has been shown to enhance their
iimunogenicity; Thus, a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to a long
poly-glutamine tail that mediates aggregation, induced significantly higher serum GFP
specific Ig titers and enhanced GFP-specific CD8+ CTL activity following prime/boost
immunization in mice, relative to non-aggregating GFP [21]. Multimerization of bovine
serum albunin (BSA) by covalent attachment of BSA or haptenated BSA to dextran at a ratio
of 20-30 BSN'2 x 106 MW dextran resulted in strong enhancements in elicited murine serum
titers of BSA- or hapten-specific IgG I, respectively, relative to unconjugated protein [25].
Rabbits immunized with glutathione S-transferease (GST) fusion proteins with increasing
copy number of a peptide epitope (M2e) of the influenza virus M2 protein elicited M2e
specific IgG in response to GST-(M2e)s with an average affinity constant         (KA) of up to two
orders of magnitude greater than that induced by GST-(M2e) 1 [20, Covalent attachment of
increasing copy number of peptides onto virus-like particles (VLPs) resulted in a positive
correlation between epitope density and the magnitude of the peptide-specific murine IgG,
although not gM, response following immunization [23]. Higher epitope densities also
allowed for efficient IgG responses in the absence of complement receptor type 2 (CD21). An
unwanted consequence of protein multimerization has been observed with the use of
therapeutic proteins such as human growth hormone, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG),
human serum albumin, human interleukin-2, and human interferon-p in which aggregated

 WO 2014/018858                                                                  PCT/US2013/052270
                                                   44
 proteins within the preparation preferentially induced immune responses, including
 neutralizing antibody that decreased therapeutic efficacy [22, 24]. Finally,alum, a commonly
 used adjuvant in clinical vaccines, itself forms aggregates that trap antigen at the site of
 injection [5 1], Of note, in this study, tetranieric gp3 50 in alum with or without additional
 adijuvanting with CpG-ODN was nevertheless markedly more immunogenic than monomeric
 gp350 delivered in the same adjuvants. Although direct evidence in vivo is limited, and
 without intending to be bound by any theory, the increased immunogenicity of mnultimeric
 proteins likely arises from more efficient activation of complement, enhanced binding to the
 BCR, more efficient BCR-mediated signaling, enhanced B cell uptake and presentation of
 protein-derived peptide to CD4+ T cells and/or enhanced trapping of multimerie proteins on
 the surface of follicular dendritic cells [24, 52].
        [00147] The presence of strong CD4+ T cell, in addition to B cell, epitopes is
 important for robust T celldependent (TD) IgG responses to protein antigens. In this regard,
 TT was shown to be a significantly more potent carrier protein than gp350 for eliciting a TD
 IgG response specific for a pneumococcal polysaccharide, as part of a conjugate vaccine.
This strongly suggested that TT contained more potent CD4+ T cell epitopes than gp350 for
 delivery of helper function to B cells, Accordingly, the initial gp350 tetramer design
 incorporated two known universal TT-specific CD4+ T cell epitopes. However, the data in
this study unexpectedly show that not only did the TT epitopes not contribute to the
immnunogenicity of the tetramer in naive mice, but they actually mediated inhibition of
antibody responses in TT-primed nice. This latter observation was relevant in light of the
widespread use of TT as a clinical vaccine. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that pre
immunization of mice with T T suppressed a subsequent antibody response to synthetic
peptides conjugated to T'[46] and that this was due to clonal dominance [47] and required
CD44 T cells for its induction [48]. However, it is possible that inclusion of other universal
human CD4+ T cell epitopes such as N 19 [53, 54] or PADRE [55, 56] might prove more
successful,
       [00148] EBV gp350 binds to human (and rabbit), but not mouse, CD21 [57].
Physiologically, CD2 1 expressed on B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDC) binds the
complement fragment C3d that in association with antigen, promotes immunogenicity [26,
58, 59]. This likely occurs via co-crosslinking of BCR and CD21, leading to highly
synergistic B cell signaling [60], and trapping of antigen via CD21 on FDC to promote
germinal center formation [61]. A previous study further demonstrated that gp350 could
potentially substitute for C3d as an adjuvant, by promoting human B cell signaling via

WO 2014/018858                                                               PCT/US2013/052270
                                                45
BCRICD2I co-crosslinking [62]. Enhancement of antigen-specific antibody responses via
C3d, involves at least 2 copies of C3d per molecule of antigen. Thus, in humans, gp350
specific B cells binding to tetrameric but not monomeric, gp350 via a single BCR would
potentially have access to 2-3 gp350 molecules for CD21 binding, that could facilitate
specific BCRICD21 co-crosslinking and synergistic B cell signaling. In light of this data
demonstrating a marked increase in the efficiency of binding of tetramer versus monomer to
human CD21, we predict that tetrameric gp350 will also bind to specific BCR, as well CD21
expressing human FDC with greater avidity than monomeric gp3 50. Collectively, these
observations strongly suggest that gp3 50, expressed as a tetramer, will act as both a
molecular adjuvant as well as a specific target antigen for a clinical EBV vaccine.
Importantly, tetrameric gp350 by itself did not polyclonally activate human B cells, thus
obviating concerns for unwanted non-specific immuane stimulation in vio,
      [00149] The molecular strategy described herein for creating tetrameric gp350 could
also be applied to boost humoral immune responses to other proteins of vaccine interest,
including other EBV proteins, such as gH/gL, gp42, and gB. Further, gp350 might be of
value as a molecular adjuvant for another target protein, through creation of a heterodimer
linked to a leucine zipper for dimerization, or a trimerization motif such as the T4
bacteriophage fibritin (FT) [63] or the eukaryotic GCN4 transcription factor motif (GCN4)
[64]. Finally, heterodimers comprising a target protein and an additional protein possessing
adjuvant activity, such as flagellin [65], or for example to an scFv fragment that targets an
antigen-presenting cell or innate receptor [66], may generate additional, highly immunogenic
multimeric proteins for vaccination.
