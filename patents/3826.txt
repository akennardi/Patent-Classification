      CONSTIPATION USING ORAL COMPOSITIONS OF METHYLNALTREXONE

filed 19 December 2011, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by

Background
         Opioids are widely used in treating patients with pain. Such patients include those
with advanced cancers and other terminal diseases and also those with chronic non-malignant
pain and acute non-malignant pain. Opioids are narcotic medications that activate opioid
receptors located in the central nervous system to relieve pain. Opioids, however, also react
with receptors outside of the central nervous system, resulting in side effects including
constipation, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, and severe itching. Notable are the effects
of opioids in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where these drugs inhibit gastric emptying and
peristalsis in the intestines, thereby decreasing the rate of intestinal transit and producing
constipation. The use of opioids in treating pain is often limited due to these undesired side
effects, which can be debilitating and often cause patients to refuse the use of opioid
analgesics.
         In addition to exogenous opioid-induced side effects, studies have suggested that
endogenous opioids and opioid receptors may also affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and
may be involved in normal regulation of intestinal motility and mucosal transport of fluids.
Thus, an abnormal physiological level of endogenous opioids and/or receptor activity may
also lead to bowel dysfunction. For example, patients who have undergone surgical
procedures, especially surgery of the abdomen, often suffer from a particular bowel
dysfunction, termed post-operative ileus, that may be caused by fluctuations in natural opioid
levels. Similarly, women who have recently given birth commonly suffer from post partum
ileus, which may be caused by similar fluctuations in natural opioid levels as a result of
birthing stress. Gastrointestinal dysfunction associated with post-operative or post-partum
                                                  1

    WO 2013/096444                                                             PCT/US2012/070612
ileus can typically last for 3 to 5 days, with some severe cases lasting more than a week.
Administration of opioids to a patient after surgery to treat pain, which is now an almost
universal practice, may exacerbate bowel dysfunction, thereby delaying recovery of normal
bowel function, prolonging hospital stays, and increasing medical care costs.
        Opioid receptor antagonists, such as naloxone, naltrexone, and nalmefene, have been
studied as a means of antagonizing the undesirable peripheral side effects of opioids.
However, these agents not only act on peripheral opioid receptors but also on opioid
receptors in the central nervous system, sometimes reversing the beneficial and desired
analgesic effects of opioids or causing symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Preferable
approaches for use in controlling opioid-induced side effects include administration of
peripheral acting opioid receptor antagonists that do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.
        The peripheral p opioid receptor antagonist methylnaltrexone has been studied since
the late 1970s. It has been used in patients to reduce opioid-induced side effects such as
constipation, pruritus, nausea, and urinary retention(see, e.g., U.S. Patents 5,972,954,
5,102,887, 4,861,781, and 4,719,215; and Yuan et al., Drug and Alcohol Dependence 1998,
52, 161). The dosage form of methylnaltrexone used most often in these studies has been a
solution of methylnaltrexone for intravenous injection.

Definitions
         The term "constipation" as used herein, refers to a condition in which a subject suffers
from infrequent bowel movements or bowel movements that are painful and/or hard to pass.
A subject experiencing constipation often suffers from straining during bowel movements
and/or a sensation of incomplete evacuation following bowel movements. In a particular
embodiment, constipation refers to a subject who experiences less than three (3) rescue free
bowel movements (RFBMs) per week on average, wherein "rescue free bowel movement"
refers to the passage and evacuation of feces, or laxation.
         As used herein, the term "opioid induced constipation" (OIC) refers to a subject who
suffers from constipation resulting from opioid therapy. For example, a subject may suffer
from opioid induced constipation arising from opioid therapy with alfentanil, anileridine,
asimadoline, bremazocine, burprenorphine, butorphanol, codeine, dezocine, diacetylmorphine
(heroin), dihydrocodeine, diphenoxylate, fedotozine, fentanyl, funaltrexamine, hydrocodone,

term "effective amount," as used in connection with an amount of methylnaltrexone, salt
thereof, or composition of methylnaltrexone or salt thereof, refers to an amount of
methylnaltrexone, salt thereof, or composition of methylnaltrexone or salt thereof sufficient
to achieve a rescue free bowel movement in a subject.
         The terms "treat" or "treating," as used herein, refers to partially or completely
alleviating, inhibiting, delaying onset of, reducing the incidence of, ameliorating and/or
relieving opioid induced constipation, or one or more symptoms of opioid induced
constipation.
         The expression "unit dosage form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit
of a composition or formulation of methylnaltrexone, appropriate for the subject to be treated.
It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of provided formulation will be
decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific
effective dose level for any particular subject will depend upon a variety of factors including
the severity of the opioid induced constipation; nature and activity of the composition;
specific formulation employed; age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject;
time of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific active agent employed; duration
of the treatment; drugs and/or additional therapies used in combination or coincidental with
specific compound(s) employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts.
         As used herein, the term "non-malignant pain" refers to pain originating from a non
malignant source such as cancer.
         The term "subject", as used herein, means a mammal and includes human and animal
subjects, such as domesticated animals (e.g., horses, dogs, cats, etc.) and experimental
animals (e.g., mice, rats, dogs, chimpanzees, apes, etc.). In a particular embodiment, the
subject is human.
         The terms "suffer" or "suffering" as used herein refers to one or more conditions that
a patient has been diagnosed with, or is suspected to have, in particular, opioid induced
constipation.
         The term "amphiphilic" as used herein to describe a molecule refers to the molecule's
dual hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. Typically, amphiphilic molecules have a polar,
water soluble group (e.g., a phosphate, carboxylic acid, sulfate) attached to a nonpolar, water
insoluble group (e.g., a hydrocarbon). The term amphiphilic is synonymous with
                                                 18

amphipathic. Examples of amphiphilic molecules include sodium dodecyl (lauryl) sulfate,
fatty acids, phospholipids, and bile acids. Amphiphilic molecules may be uncharged,
cationic, or anionic.
        As used herein, the term "liphophilicity" refers to a compound's ability to associate
with or dissolve in a fat, lipid, oil, or non-polar solvent. Lipophilicity and hydrophobicity
may be used to describe the same tendency of a molecule to dissolve in fats, oils, lipids, and
non-polar solvents.
Compositions of Methylnaltrexone
        In particular embodiments, the methods presented herein involve administration of
oral compositions of methylnaltrexone comprising ion pairs of methylnaltrexone and an
amphiphilic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. For example, the composition for use in
the methods presented herein may be a salt of methylnaltrexone of the formula:

Selection of Subjects for Treatment
        In certain aspects, the selection of certain subjects suffering from opioid induced
constipation for treatment with oral compositions of methylnaltrexone and subsequent
administration of the oral compositions is presented herein.
        As defined herein, a subject suffering from opioid induced constipation refers to a
subject who suffers from constipation resulting from opioid activity, for example, exogenous
opioid therapy or endogenous opioid activity. "Constipation" refers to a condition in which a
subject suffers from infrequent bowel movements or bowel movements that are painful
and/or hard to pass. A subject experiencing constipation often suffers from hard or lumpy
stools, straining during bowel movements and/or a sensation of incomplete evacuation
following bowel movements. In a particular embodiment, constipation refers to a subject
who experiences less than three (3) rescue free bowel movements (RFBMs) per week on
average, for example, over the course of the last four consecutive weeks, wherein "rescue free
bowel movement" refers to the passage and evacuation of feces, or laxation.

         The subject's opioid therapeutic regimen may be by any mode of administration. For
example, the subject may be taking opioids orally, transdermally, intravenously, or
subcutaneously.
Dosage and Administration
         Compositions and formulations may be administered to a patient as required to
provide an effective amount of methylnaltrexone. As defined above, an "effective amount"
of a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable composition can achieve a desired therapeutic
and/or prophylactic effect. In some embodiments, an "effective amount" is at least a minimal
amount of a compound, or composition containing a compound, which is sufficient for
treating or preventing one or more symptoms of opioid induced constipation, as defined
herein. In some embodiments, the term "effective amount," as used in connection with an
amount of methylnaltrexone, salt thereof, or composition of methylnaltrexone or salt thereof,
refers to an amount of methylnaltrexone, salt thereof, or composition of methylnaltrexone or
salt thereof sufficient to achieve a rescue free bowel movement in a subject.
         In some embodiments, the oral composition of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to
achieve a rescue free bowel movement in a subject within about 24 hours, within about 12

hours, within about 8 hours, within about 5 hours, within about 4 hours, within about 3 hours,
within about 2 hours, or within about 1 hours of administration to said patient. In a particular
embodiment, the oral composition of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to achieve a rescue free
bowel movement within about 4 hours of administration to the patient. In some
embodiments, the oral composition of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to achieve a rescue free
bowel movement within about 4 hours of administration to the patient for at least 100%,
99%, at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, or at least 50% of all
doses administered. In certain embodiments, the oral composition of methylnaltrexone is
sufficient to achieve a rescue free bowel movement within four hours during the first 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 weeks of dosing. In a particular embodiment, the oral composition of
methylnaltrexone is sufficient to achieve a rescue free bowel movement within about 4 hours
of administration to the patient for all doses administered during first four weeks of dosing.
         The efficacy of the oral compositions presented herein in treating opioid induced
constipation may further be assessed by an increase in the number of rescue free bowel
movements experienced by a subject. For example, in some embodiments, the oral
composition of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to increase the weekly number of rescue free
bowel movements experienced by a subject by at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10. In
particular embodiments, the oral composition of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to increase the
weekly number of rescue free bowel movements experienced by a subject by at least 1. In
another embodiment, the oral composition of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to increase the
weekly number of rescue free bowel movements experienced by a subject by at least 2. In
yet another embodiment, the oral composition of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to increase
the weekly number of rescue free bowel movements experienced by a subject by at least 3.
In certain embodiments, the oral composition of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to increase the
weekly number of rescue free bowel movements experienced by a subject during the first 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 weeks of dosing. In a particular embodiment, the oral composition
of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to increase the weekly number of rescue free bowel
movements experienced by a subject by at least 1 during the first 4 weeks of dosing.         In
another particular embodiment, the oral composition of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to
increase the weekly number of rescue free bowel movements by at least one to at least 3 a
week. In yet a further embodiment, the oral composition of methylnaltrexone is sufficient to

increase the weekly number of rescue free bowel movements by at least one to at least 3 a
week for at least 3 of the first 4 weeks following administration.
         The efficacy of the oral compositions presented herein may be further assessed using
various assessment tools available to those skilled in the art to assess treatment of
constipation.
         In a particular embodiment, the efficacy of the oral compositions of methylnaltrexone
is assessed by Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC) questionnaires. The PAC consists
of two complementary questionnaires: the PAC-Symptoms (SYM) and the PAC-Quaity of
Life (QoL) questionnaires. The PAC-SYM is a 12 item survey that measures the severity of
constipation symptoms across three domains: stool symptoms, rectal symptoms and
abdominal symptoms. The PAC-SYM scale has been used primarily to evaluate chronic
constipation. The PAC-SYM scale is further described in Frank el al. Scand J Gastroenterol
(1999) 34(9):870-877 and Slappendel et al. European Journalof Pain (2006) 10(3):209-217,
the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein. The PAC-QoL is a
28-item survey that measures constipation-specific quality of life across four domains: worries
and concerns, physical discomfort, psychosocial discomfort, and satisfaction. The PAC-QoL
scale is further described in Marquis el al. SJG (2005) 40:540-55 1, the entire contents of which
are incorporated by reference herein.
         Alternatively or in combination, the efficacy of the oral compositions of
methylnaltrexone is assessed by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)
analysis. The EQ-5D is a 5-item standardized instrument for use as a measure of patient
reported outcome (PRO). Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, the
instrument provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status.
The EQ-5D instrument is further described in Dolan P. Medical Care (1997) 35:1095-1108,

         Alternatively or in combination, the efficacy of the oral compositions of
methylnaltrexone is assessed by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment General
Health V2.0 (WPAI:GLH) questionnaire, The WPAI:GH is a 6-item questionnaire to quantify
lost time from work and loss in productivity for health problems. The WPAI:GH yields 4
types of scores: absenteeism (work time missed), "presenteeism" (impairment at

questionnaire is further described in Reilly et al. PharmacoEconomics(1993) 4(5):353-365,
the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.
         Alternatively or in combination, the efficacy of the oral compositions of
methylnaltrexone is assessed by the Global Clinical Impression of Change (GCIC) scale. The
GCIC is a 7 point rating scale designed to assess subject's and clinician's impression of the
subject's change in bowel status while on study drug. The scale ranges from I (Much Worse)
to 7 (Much Better). This scale was completed by the subject and clinician at the end of daily
dosing and End of Treatment.
         In certain embodiments, the patient is orally administered a composition of
methylnaltrexone at least once a day. In certain embodiments, the subject is administered an
oral composition of methylnaltrexone at least once, twice, three, four or five times a day. In a
particular embodiment, the subject is administered an oral composition of methylnaltrexone
three times a day.
         In various embodiments, the subject is orally administered 150 mg of
methylnaltrexone, or a salt thereof, daily. For example, the subject may be administered a
tablet comprising 150 mg of methylnaltrexone or a salt thereof, daily. In another
embodiment, the subject is orally administered 300 mg of methylnaltrexone or a salt thereof,
daily. For example, the subject may be administered two tablets, each comprising 150 mg of
methylnaltrexone or a salt thereof, daily. In yet another embodiment, the subject is orally
administered 450 mg of methylnaltrexone or a salt thereof, daily. For example, the subject
may be administered three tablets, each comprising 150 mg of methylnaltrexone or a salt
thereof, daily.
Adverse Events
         Presented herein are methods that may be predicated, at least in part, on the
identification that administration of oral compositions of methylnaltrexone, for example, 150
mg, 300 mg or 450 mg, at least once a day, for example, three times a day, is sufficient to
treat opioid induced constipation without effecting adverse events. Exemplary adverse events
induced by the administering oral methylnaltrexone are set forth in example 1. The invention

also provides methods of treating a subject with oral formulations of methylnaltrexone
described herein that decrease the occurrence of adverse events in comparison to the
frequency of adverse events observed with previous oral methylnaltrexone formulations, for

of methylnaltrexone not including an anion of an amphiphilic pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient, in particular, sodium dodecyl (lauryl) sulfate.
        Accordingly, the data presented in Example 1 demonstrate that the methods of
administering the oral formulations of methylnaltrexone described herein are safer than the
methods of administering previously described oral formulations of methylnaltrexone, for
example, enterically coated oral formulations of methylnaltrexone or other oral formulations
of methylnaltrexone not including an anion of an amphiphilic pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient, in particular, sodium dodecyl (lauryl) sulfate.

EXAMPLE 1: EFFICACY AND DOSAGE STUDIES OF ORAL
METHYLNALTREXONE IN TREATMENT OF OPIOID INDUCED
CONSTIPATION
OBJECTIVES
Primary Objective
        The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Oral
Methylnaltrexone (OM) versus placebo in subjects with chronic non-malignant pain who
have Opioid Induced Constipation (OIC).
Secondary Objectives
        The secondary objective of this study was to determine OM dosing regimen in
subjects with chronic non-malignant pain who have OIC.
Study Design
        A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
study of OM for the treatment of OIC in approximately 802 subjects with chronic non
malignant pain was conducted.
        Eligible subjects signed an informed consent form (ICF) and entered a 14-day
screening period ( 2 days), during which objective evidence of constipation was assessed
and used as the basis for enrollment.
        Constipation due to opioid use during the screening period: Constipation is defined as
< 3 Rescue-Free Bowel Movements (RFBMs) per week on average (no laxative use within 24
hours prior to bowel movement) that were associated with 1 or more of the following (based
on subject's diary report):
        a. A Bristol Stool Form Scale type 1 or 2 for at least 25% of the rescue-free bowel
            movements.
        b. Straining during at least 25% of the rescue-free bowel movements.

    WO 2013/096444                                                           PCT/US2012/070612
         c.  A sensation of incomplete evacuation after at least 25% of the rescue-free bowel
             movements.
         Subjects who remained eligible at the baseline visit (day 1) were randomly assigned
to either OM tablet formulation 150 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg, or placebo initially in a 1:1:1:1
allocation ratio. Subjects were required to take three tablets per day, first thing in the morning
on an empty stomach (prior to breakfast). Subjects were instructed to swallow the tablets
whole and never to chew, divide, or crush them and wait at least one half hour before
ingesting any food. Subjects participated in the study for up to 84 days. The first 28 days
were once daily dosing; the remaining 56 days were dosing as needed (PRN). Dosing
remained double-blind throughout the 12 week period (84 days). The 84 day treatment period
were followed by a 14-day post-treatment follow-up period ( 2 days). Enrollment continued
until a total of approximately 802 subjects have been randomized and dosed.
Study Conduct
         The study was divided into a screening period (14 days in duration [ 2 days]), a
doubleblind daily dosing period (28 days in duration), a double blind PRN dosing period (56
days in duration), and follow-up visit (14-day post-treatment follow-up visit [ 2 days]).
         a. Study Conduct - Screening Period
         The screening period was a 14 day period ( 2 days) prior to dosing. Upon receipt of
their signed and dated written ICF, subjects had their eligibility status assessed prior to
participation in the study. Screen failure, for the purpose of this study, was defined as any
subject who signed an informed consent form but did not receive any study drug. All laxative
therapy was discontinued at the start of the screening and only study-permitted rescue
laxatives were used throughout the screening and double-blind periods.
         b. Study Conduct - Double Blind Period
         At the baseline visit, subjects were randomly assigned to either OM or placebo.
Subjects who met all inclusion and no exclusion criteria at the baseline visit (day 1) received
study medication. All doses were to be taken in the morning prior to breakfast [The first dose
administered at the baseline visit could have been taken after Noon (12:00pm)] and subjects
were instructed to wait at least one half hour before ingesting any food. Subjects participated

    WO 2013/096444                                                          PCT/US2012/070612
in the study for up to 84 days: the first 28 days were double-blind once daily dosing; the
remaining 56 days were double-blind PRN dosing.
         c. Study Conduct - End of Treatment
         When a subject completed or discontinued from the study, all evaluations were
conducted at day 84 or at an early termination visit. This evaluation included the following: a
vital sign measurement, specimen collection for laboratory determinations, physical exam,
serum pregnancy test (if applicable), recording and reconciliation of AEs, concomitant
opioids, nonopioid treatments, OOWS, SOWS, Pain Intensity Scale, quality of life and
constipation symptom assessments, Global Clinical Impression of Change (GCIC), and
review of subject reported diary information and compliance.
d. Study Conduct - Follow Up Visit
         Subjects, who completed the 12 week (84 day) double-blind phase, returned for a
follow up visit 14 days ( 2 days) after Day 84 to assess the subject's overall safety status.
INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN - OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE, CHOICE OF
CONTROL GROUPS, AND APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS
         The primary efficacy endpoint of this Phase 3 study was the average proportion of
rescue-free laxation responses per subject within 4 hours of all doses during the first four
weeks of dosing. The key secondary efficacy endpoints in hierarchical order were:
         1. Change in weekly number of RFBM from baseline during Weeks 1 to 4
         2. Response (responder/non-responder) to study drug during Weeks 1 to 4, where
responder was defined as having > 3 RFBM/week, with at least 1 RFBM/week increase over
baseline, for at least 3 out of the first 4 weeks.
Choice of Treatment Groups
         The active oral methylnaltrexone (OM) doses that were assessed included 150, 300,
and 450 mg and were part of a placebo-controlled design to assess the safety and efficacy of
OM. The placebo control design (allowed blinding, randomization and included a group that
receives an inert treatment) controlled for potential influences other than those arising from
                                                   34

the pharmacologic action of the study drug. These influences included safety findings
associated with the underlying condition, spontaneous change (natural history of the
condition and regression to the mean), subject or investigator expectations, the effect of being
in a trial, use of other therapy, and subjective elements of diagnosis or assessment. For these
reasons, the placebo-controlled design was ethically acceptable and consistent with the
Declaration of Helsinki as clarified by the World Medical Association General Assembly,
Washington, 2002.
STUDY CRITERIA
         Only subjects who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in the study.
         Subjects were permitted to continue to be included in the study only if they met the
inclusion criteria at the Baseline Visit.
         Subjects were excluded from the study if they met any one of the exclusion criteria at
the Screening Visit.
         Subjects were excluded from the study if they met any one of the exclusion criteria at
the Baseline Visit.
Screening
         An eligibility assessment to ensure the presence of required inclusion criteria and the
absence of all exclusion criteria was performed and verified on the source and CRF. At the
screening visit, subjects who were eligible for the study were asked to return for the day 1
visit.
Assessment of Efficacy
         To assess for efficacy, subject-reported information including date and time of bowel
movements, Bristol Stool Form Scales, Straining Scales, Sense of Complete Evacuation
Scales, and recording of study drug and rescue laxative use.used.

       Primary E icacy Endpoints
       The primary efficacy endpoint was the average proportion of rescue-free laxation
responses per subject within 4 hours of all doses during the first 4 weeks of dosing.
       Secondary,Efficacy Endpoints
       The two key secondary efficacy endpoints in hierarchical order were:
        1. Change in weekly number of RFBMs from baseline over the entire first 4
           weeks (28 days) of dosing.
       2. Response (responder/non-responder) to study drug during Weeks I to 4, where
           responder is defined as having > 3 RF3M/week, with at least I RFB3M/week
           increase over baseline, for at least 3 out of the first 4 weeks.
       Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
       Other endpoints incl uded:
       -   Proportion of subjects achieving at least 3 RFBMs per week
       -   Proportion of subjects with rescue-free laxation response within 4 hours of the first
           dose of study drug by fasting status
       -   Time to the first RFBM after the first dose, censored at 24 hours or time of the
           second  lose, whichever occurred first by fasting status
       -   Response (responder/non-responder) to study drug over the entire 12 week
           treatment period, where a responder is having > 3 RFBM/week, with at least I
           RFBM/week increase over baseline, for > 75% of the weeks
       -   Percentage of doses resulting in any RFBM within 1, 2, 3. 4, 6, 8. and 24 hours)
Assess/entoJ afiy
       Subjects were monitored for adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs)
concomitant treatments including opioid use and rescue laxatives, and vital sign
measurements at all office visits. Vital signs, physical examinations (including rectal

examination), laboratory evaluations, serum/urine pregnancy tests, ECGs, the Objective
Opioid Withdrawal Scale (OOWS), the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) and the
Pain Intensity scale were performed at scheduled intervals during the study.
         Electrocardiograis
         Standard 12-lead ECGs were obtained after the subject had been resting for at least
five minutes at the visits designated in the Schedule of Study Visits and Evaluations. The
Investigator was responsible for reviewing, interpreting, and retaining hard copies of the
reports. Clinically significant abnormalities at any time point after the normal or non
clinically significant screening ECG were recorded as adverse events, as defined below.
PatientReported Outcomes
         Self-administered PRO endpoints were measured by the PAC-SYM, the PAC-QoL,
the EQ-5D, the WPAI:GH, and GCIC (administered by the clinician) assessments quantify the
subjects' constipation symptoms, constipation-related quality of life, overall quality of life,
change in bowel status, and degree of interference with ability to work.
         Pain imensitv Scale
         Measures of pain were recorded using The Numerical Rating of Pain Itensity Scale.
The scale, an 11-point rating scale ranging from 0 (None) to 10 (Worst Pain Possible), is a
subject assessment tool and subjects should complete the evaluation based on their pain
experienced during the 24 hours prior to completing the scale.
         Bristol Stool Scale
         Measures of stool consistency and straining were recorded for each bowel movement
using the Bristol Stool Scale. The Bristol Stool Scale is a 7-point scale rating the
characteristics of the stool sample. The range is from Type 1, Separate hard lumps, like nuts

        Straining Scale
        Measures of straining were recorded for each bowel movement using the Straining
Scale, The scale, a five-point scale to rate the amount of straining (None to Very Severe), is a
subject assessment tool and subjects were to complete the evaluations for each bowel
movement.
        Sense of Conplet Evacuation Scale
        Measures of the sense of complete evacuation were recorded for each bowel
movement using the Sense of Complete Evacuation Scale. The scale is a subject assessment
tool and subjects were to complete the evaluations for each bowel movement.
        PatientReported Outcomes (PROs
        The PROs are for the purpose of exploring the subject's experience of constipation
symptoms and the impact of constipation on quality of life and work productivity. Every
effort was to be made to maintain an unbiased assessment. The investigator was to not
influence the subject's self-assessments.
        Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC): The PAC consists of two
complementary questionnaires: the PAG-Symptoms (SYM) and the PAG-Quality of Life
(QoL). The PAC-SYM is a 12 item survey that measures the severity of constipation
syruptorms across three domains: stool symptoms, rectal symptoms and abdominal symptoms,
The PAC-SYM scale has been use primarily to evaluate chronic constipation. The PAC-QoL
is a 28-item survey that measures constipation-specific quality of life across four domains:
worries and concerns, physical discomfort, psychosocial discomfort, and satisfaction.
        European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D): The EQ-5D is a 5 -item
standardized instrument for use as a measure of PRO. Applicable to a wide range of health
conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for
health status.
        Work Productivity and Activity Impairment General Health V2.0 (WPAI:GH):
The WPAI:GH is a 6-item questionnaire to quantify lost time from work and loss in
                                                 38

productivity for health problems. The WPAI:GH yields 4 types of scores: absenteeism (work
time missed), "presenteeism" (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work
productivity loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activity
impairment.
       Global Clinical Impression of Change (GCIC): The CCIC is a 7 point rating scale
designed to assess subject's and clinician's impression of the subject's change in bowel status
while on study drug, The scale ranges from I (Much Worse) to 7 (Much Better), This scale
was completed by the subject and clinician at the end of daily dosing (Visit 4) and End of
Treatment (Visit 7),
       Study drug was provided in blister cards containing 150 mg tablets of active study
drug and/or placebo. Each card had 21 study drug tablets, which is seven days worth of study
medication. Three tablets will be taken at a time.

         Figure 6 (Table 2) provides the demographics for all the subjects enrolled in the study,
including age, gender, race. ethnicity, height, weight and body mass index.
         Figure 7 (Table 3) provides the baseline disease characteristics for all subjects enrolled
in the study. Specifically, Figure 7 provides the nature of the non-malignant chronic pain
experienced by the subject, including, for example, back pain, joint/extremity pain, arthritis,
neurologic/ neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. Figure 7 further provides (i) the average
number of rescue free bowel movements per week for each subject, (ii) the average number
of subjects having less than 3 rescue free bowel movements per week, (iii) the percentage of
subjects experiencing straining during rescue free bowel movements; (iv) the percentage of
subjects experiencing straining during at least 25% of rescue free bowei movements: (v) the
percentage of subjects experiencing a sensation of incomplete evacuation following rescue free
bowel movements; (vi) the percentage of subjects experiencing a sensation of incomplete
evacuation following at least 25% of rescue free bowel movements; (vii) the percentage of
subjects experiencing Bristol Stool Form Scale type 1 or 2 during rescue free bowel
movements; and (vii) the percentage of subjects experiencing Bristol Stool Form Scale type 1
or 2 during at least 25% of rescue free bowel movements.
PriniarEficacy Endpoints
         Results demonstrate efficacy of the oral compositions of methylinaltrexone for each of
the tested dosages, i.e., 150 mg, 300 mg and 450 mg of methylnaltrexone. Such efficacy is
evidenced by demonstration of the primary efficacy endpoint, i.e., the average proportion of
rescue free bowel movements per subject within 4 hours of all doses during the first 4 weeks of
dosing.

        Figure 8 (Table 4) summarizes the results with respect to the primary efficacy
endpoint, i.e., the average proportion of rescue free bowel movements per subject within 4
hours of all doses during the first 4 weeks of the study as set forth in Example 1.
        Figures 9-17 (Tables 5-13) further summarize the results with respect to the primary
efficacy endpoint, wherein the results are categorized by the demographics of the subject or
severity of the opioid induced constipation.
        Specifically, Figures 9 and 10 (Tables 5 and 6) provide the results for male and
female subjects, respectively, evidencing efficacy for both men and women. Figure 11
(Table 7) demonstrates efficacy for subjects 65 years of age or younger, while Figure 12
(Table 8) demonstrates for subjects older than 65. Figures 13 and 14 (Tables 9 and 10)
provide results for subjects less than 86 kg and for subjects greater than or equal to 86 kg,
respectively, each class of which exhibited efficacy with respect to the primary efficacy
endpoint. Studies further demonstrate efficacy amongst white subjects, as evidenced by the
primary efficacy endpoint.
        Figure 16 (Table 11) confirms the primary efficacy for subjects having less than 3
rescue free bowel movements per week. Finally, Figure 17 (Table 13) confirms the primary
efficacy for subjects having a Bristol Stool Form Scale Score less than 3.
Secondary EFficacy Endpoints
        Results further demonstrate efficacy of the oral compositions of methylnaltrexone for
each of the tested dosages, i.e., 150 mg, 300 mg and 450 mg of methyinaltrexone, as evidenced
by confirmation of the secondary efficacy endpoints including:
        (a) change in weekly number of rescue free bowel movements from baseline during
weeks 1-4 of the study (see Figure IS Table 14); and
        (b) response to study drug, defined as having at least 3 rescue free bowel movements
per week for each of the first 4 weeks of the study with an increase of at least one rescue free

bowel movement over baseline for at least 3 weeks of the first 4 weeks of the study (see
Figure 19; Table 15).
        Moreover, another secondary endpoint further confirmed efficacy of the study drug as
depicted in Figure 20 (Table 16) which sets forth the proportion of subjects with rescue free
bowel movements within 4 hours of the first dose of study drug.
Adverse Events
        Results further demonstrate that study drug, at dosages of 150 mg, 300 mg and 450
mg, did not result in adverse events as set forth in each of Figure 21 (all adverse events),
Figure 22 (serious adverse events organized by organ system class) and Figure 23 (adverse
events organized by organ system class).

EXAMPLE         2:   PREPARATION           OF   TABLETS      OF   METHYLNALTREXONE
BROMIDE
         Methylnaltrexone bromide may be prepared according to the methods described in
detail in international PCT Patent Application publication number, WO 2006/127899.
Formulations containing methylnaltrexone were prepared using pharmaceutically acceptable
excipients. Spheroids containing methylnaltrexone were prepared. Tablets were prepared
from spheroids, using conventional techniques. The tablets dissolve in under 10 minutes.
         The spheroids were prepared by a wet granulation process followed by extrusion and
spheronization, as described in the following general method. Methylnaltrexone bromide and
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients were combined in an aqueous solution. Water was
added until wet mass suitable for extrusion was obtained. The wet mass was passed through
an extruder, and the extrudate was spheronized in a spheronizer. The resulting spheroids
were dried in a fluid bed drier and passed through a screen. The uncoated spheroids were
stored in appropriate container.
EXAMPLE 3: CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS OF ORALLY ADMINISTERED
METHYLNALTREXONE
         Presented herein is a clinical pharmacokinetics study, Study C, as well as Studies A
and B.       Study A investigated       the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics       of
methylnaltrexone (MNTX) and its metabolites (M2: methylnaltrexone sulfate; M4: 6a
methylnaltrexol; and M5: 6-methylnaltrexol) following the subcutaneous administration of
12 mg methylnaltrexone.       In Study B, the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of
methylnaltrexone (MNTX) and its metabolites (M2, M4, and M5) were examined following a
20- minute short intravenous infusion of 24 mg of methylnaltrexone (MNTX).
         In Study C, the pharmacokinetics of methylnaltrexone (MNTX) and its 3 metabolites
(M2, M4 and M5) were investigated in two               stages: 1) single and multiple dose
pharmacokinetics of MNTX and 3 metabolites, (M2, M4 and M5) following MNTX 450 mg
PO x 7 days, and 2) the relative MNTX bioavailability following single oral dose

        Tables 21 and 22 indicate that following oral and subcutaneous administrations,
MNTX was readily absorbed with maximum MNTX plasma concentrations observed at 2 h
and 0.25 h following oral dose and subcutaneous administration, respectively. Less than 4%
of the orally administered dose was recovered in urine as an unconverted MNTX, markedly
lower than the 31.5% - 49.6% recovered in in urine following IV administration (Yuan et al.
2005 J Clin Pharm 45:538-546).         Cross-study AUCinf comparisons indicated that MNTX
tablets demonstrated an absolute bioavailability of 4.24% (relative to IV infusion) and 3.7%
bioavailability relative to SC injection whereas following multiple dose administration
resulted in a slight increase in these values (higher AUCinf) of 4.8% and 5.8% relative to SC
and IV multiple dose administrations. Subcutaneous MNTX injection resulted in high
bioavailability (112%) relative to short-term infusion.
        MNTX oral administration resulted in extensive metabolism, resulting in the
formation methylnaltrexone sulfate (M2) and stereospecific hydroxylation to form 6a- (M4)
and 60-methylnaltrexol (M5) of which M4 was found to be the favored route of metabolite
formation. Metabolic enzymes AKRC1C, SULT2A1 and SULTIE1 enzymes were reported
be responsible for the MNTX metabolism into M2, M4 and M5 (Figure 25).
        No substantial differences in the average  Cmax and Tmax were observed for MNTX and
M2 between day 1 and day 7 for oral, SC or IV routes.          These results indicate that the
observed degree of accumulation (R) following multiple oral dose administration and
reaching the apparent steady state was due to increased AUC values and decreased
elimination which was evidenced by increased AUCinf and delayed elimination       tm/
                                                                                    2 observed
on Day 7 pharmacokinetics.       Following subcutaneous administration,  Cmax and AUCinf for
MNTX and its metabolites were similar between Day 1 and Day 7, whereas following oral
administration of MNTX tablets considerable increase in AUC and        Cmax were observed on
Day 7 for MNTX and its metabolites. Higher accumulation for MNTX and its metabolite
following multiple dose oral administration was evident from higher accumulation factor (R)

EXAMPLE 4: CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS OF ORALLY ADMINISTERED
METHYLNALTREXONE WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD
           The oral absorption of MNTX is limited. The estimated bioavailability of MNTX
after oral administration was less than 1% in rats, and the relative oral bioavailability of
MNTX enteric-coated tablets and enteric-coated granule-filled capsules was 2.27% and
2.43%, respectively, compared to the subcutaneous formulation in subjects on stable
methadone maintenance.
           The pharmacokinetics of MNTX tablets was highly variable among individuals, most
likely a result of the low absorption and low systemic exposure after oral administration. The
effect of food was investigated previously for MNTX formulated in immediate release (IR)

tablet and IR capsule formulations.      Following a high-fat meal, the mean   Cmax  of MNTX
decreased by 33% for the IR capsule formulation and approximately 45% for the IR tablet
formulation; the AUCo_. decreased by 11% for the IR capsule formulation and by more than
30% for the IR tablet formulation.        The median   Tmax  and terminal t   were not altered
significantly by food.
        The pharmacokinetics of MNTX in the oral 150 mg ion-pairing formulation has been
investigated in 2 human studies.
        A 2-part study was conducted in subjects on stable methadone maintenance therapy.
In Part 1, patients received a single 150 mg dose of MNTX ion-pairing tablets; in Part 2, they
received the same ion-pairing tablet dose in a crossover design compared with a single dose
of MNTX IR tablets not using ion-pairing technology.         Treatments with study drug were
preceded by an overnight fast of > 10 hours. For the ion-pairing tablets, the average Cmax was
42.8 ng/mL with a median      Tmax  of 1 hour and average AUC 0 _. was 180 hr-ng/mL in study
part 1; the average  Cmax  was 41.5 ng/mL with a median    Tmax of 2 hours and average AUCo_
was 176.8 hr-ng/mL in study part 2. The elimination t was variable with a mean value of
18.2 hours in part 1 and 25.5 hours in part 2.
        A separate study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral
MNTX in subjects with chronic nonmalignant pain. The MNTX 150 mg tablets ion-pairing
formulation was compared to MNTX 150 mg IR tablets formulation not using ion-pairing
technology following fasting for 2 hours and 10 hours. Results for the MNTX 150 mg tablets
ion-pairing formulation (10 hour fast) were the following: at 300 mg (2 x 150 mg tablets) and
450 mg (3 x 150 mg tablets), the average    Cmax was 32.5 and 54.7 ng/mL and AUC 0 _. was 156
hr-ng/mL and 223 hr-ng/mL, respectively.
        Presented herein is a single-dose, 2-period crossover study to evaluate the effect of a
standard high-fat breakfast on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 450 mg (3 x 150
mg tablets) MNTX. The study had 2 arms and 2 dosing periods.
        Thirty-two subjects were enrolled into this study. Subjects were randomized at a 1:1
ratio to Arm 1 (fasted then fed) or Arm 2 (fed then fasted). Randomization was stratified by
sex. Each subject received a single dose of MNTX 450 mg (administered as 3 x 150 mg
tablets) with a high fat meal (MNTX fed) and after fasting (MNTX fasted). The fasted/fed
study periods were separated by 7 days. The sequence of fasted/fed or fed/fasted dosing on
Days 1 and 8 was determined by randomization on Day 1.

        For the fasted treatment, a single 450 mg (3 x 150 mg) oral dose of MNTX tablets
was administered to subjects following a supervised overnight fast of at least 10 hours. No
food was allowed for at least 4 hours post dose.
        For the fed treatment, a standard high-fat breakfast was given to the subjects
following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. A single 450 mg (3 x 150 mg) oral dose of
MNTX tablets was administered to subjects 30 minutes after the subject began the meal. No
food was allowed for at least 4 hours after drug administration.
        Subjects remained at the clinical research unit (CRU) from Day 0 through Day 14 and
were discharged on Day 15, which concluded their participation in the study.
        Subjects were administered a single oral dose of MNTX tablets (450 mg) on Day 1
and Day 8 after a high fat meal or fasting as follows: (a) MNTX 450 mg (orally as 3 x 150
mg tablets) administered after a high-fat (high caloric) breakfast, or (b) MNTX 450 mg
(orally as 3 x 150 mg tablets) administered after fasting.
        Subjects received a single dose of MNTX 450 mg administered orally as 3 x 150 mg
tablets immediately after a high fat/high calorie meal (MNTX fed) and after fasting (MNTX
fasted). A 7-day washout period separated the fasted/fed crossover periods. The sequence of
fasted/fed or fed/fasting dosing on Days 1 and 8 was determined by randomization on Day 1.
Subjects fasted overnight for a minimum of 10 hours prior to administration of a high fat
meal with the single dose of study drug (MNTX fed) or 10 hours prior to administration of
the single dose of study drug (MNTX fasted).
        Subjects were randomized to 1 of the 2 dosing sequences; the dosing sequences was
based on a standard crossover design. The timing of the doses was determined by the length
of the washout phase, which was calculated as 7 times the approximate t       of oral MNTX
observed in humans.
        Each dose on Day 1 and 8 was administered with 240 mL of room temperature
drinking water, and the subjects were instructed to drink all of the water.     No food was
permitted for 4 hours after drug administration and water was allowed as desired except for 1
hour before and after drug administration. Approximately 4 hours after dosing, a normal meal
schedule could be resumed.
        A high fat/high caloric meal includes fat content of approximately 50% of total
calories in the meal (approximately 800 to 1000 calories total).      Subjects receiving the
MNTX fed treatment regimen were required to fast for at least 10 hours before breakfast and

high caloric breakfast consisted of the following:
            e   Two slices of toast with      pat of butter on each slice.
            e   Two eggs fried in butter.
            e   Two strips of bacon.
            e   Four ounces (113 g) hash brown potatoes.
            e   Eight ounces (240 mL) of whole milk.
        The planned meal content was as follows:
        e   Fat = 500-600 calories, 50%.
        e   Protein = 150 calories.
        e   Carbohydrate = 250 calories.
        e   Total calories = 800 to 1000 calories.
        The actual meal content received during the study is consistent with the FDA
guidance on food effect studies, and included 972 total calories:          540 from fat, 299 from
carbohydrates, and 125 from proteins.        A normal meal schedule and diet was maintained,
with the exceptions noted above.
        Plasma concentrations of MNTX were determined using a validated analytical
procedure involving high performance liquid chromatography with tandem quadrupole mass
spectrometric detection.      Blood samples for determination of MNTX concentrations in
plasma were obtained predose (approximately 1 hour prior to dose administration) on Day 1,
and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours following

MNTX Pharmacokinetic Parameters - Food Effect
        Oral MNTX dosing in the fed state resulted in lower MNTX plasma concentrations
when compared with dosing in the fasted state (Table 24 and Table 25). The arithmetic mean
value for  Cmax  in fed subjects was approximately one quarter (28%) of that measured for
fasted subjects (12.91 ng/mL versus 45.55 ng/mL, respectively). Systemic exposure, as
measured by AUCiast and AUCo_., was approximately 50% lower in fed subjects than in
fasted subjects.    Mean values for AUCo_. were 169.0 ng.h/mL in the fed state and 364.3
ng.h/mL in the fasted state. Median       Tmax was delayed in the fed state when compared with
the fasted state (4.0 hr versus 2.0 hr, respectively). Oral clearance (CL/F) values were almost
2-fold higher under the fed state compared to the fasted state. The terminal rate constant was
similar under fed and fasted conditions (Xz=0.04 h-1 for each), indicating that the terminal t
of MNTX is similar when administered with or without food (approximately 17 h for each).

        Administration of a single, 450 mg dose of MNTX to healthy subjects under fed
conditions resulted in a substantial decrease in systemic exposure when compared to MNTX
administration under fasted conditions.         Both AUCiast and AUCo-       ratios were non
bioequivalent (90% CIs for fasted to fed ratios were outside the 80% to 125% range) and both
parameters were approximately 2-fold higher in fasted as compared with fed subjects.
Similarly, oral clearance values were almost 2-fold higher under the fed state compared to the
fasted state.
        In addition, the MNTX     Cmax  was not bioequivalent between the fed and fasted states
(e.g., geometric mean ratio = 273.6%; 90% CI = 222.6% to 336.3%). The arithmetic mean
value for  Cmax  in fed subjects was approximately one quarter (28%) of that measured for
fasted subjects (12.91 ng/mL versus 45.55 ng/mL, respectively).
        Median   Tmax   was delayed in the fed state when compared with the fasted state (4.0 hr
versus 2.0 hr, respectively).
        The terminal rate constant was similar under fasted and fed conditions (k=0.04 h-' for
each), consistent with data indicating that the terminal t        of MNTX is similar when
administered with or without food (approximately 17 h for each).
        Five of 32 subjects (16%) experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study.            Four
subjects had TEAEs during the fasted dosing period and 3 subjects had TEAEs during the fed
dosing period. The most frequently experienced TEAE was headache (2 subjects, 6%). All
TEAEs were considered mild by the investigator.           No TEAEs were considered by the
investigator to be related to MNTX.       There were no deaths, SAEs, or TEAEs resulting in
study discontinuation.
        Minimal changes in laboratory test results were observed for subjects during the
course of the study.     No laboratory test result was considered by the investigator to be a
TEAE.
        No significant effect of MNTX on cardiac safety parameters or vital signs was
observed in this trial.
        Results of other studies show that the pharmacokinetics of orally administered MNTX
are characterized by low bioavailability, limited tissue distribution outside the GI tract

plasma concentration and AUC appear to increase with increasing dose.

        The effects of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of a single 450-mg oral dose
of MNTX observed in this study are consistent with those previously observed for other oral
formulations of MNTX (IR tablet and capsule). In a prior study, fasting increased systemic
absorption of MNTX by approximately 25%.            In the current study, the presence of food
significantly delayed MNTX absorption (e.g., increased Tmax), and decreased MNTX
systemic exposure by approximately half to three quarters (as determined by AUC and        Cmax).
Oral MNTX was not bioequivalent between fasted and fed states.
        Laxation effects of MNTX were also increased in fasted subjects compared to non
fasted subjects in a phase 3 study \ following the first dose of study drug. This result suggests
that the therapeutic efficacy of MNTX is correlated with the extent of systemic absorption.
        Although fasting increased systemic exposure to MNTX, the incidences of TEAEs
were similar between fed and fasted conditions. A single dose of MNTX 450 mg was well
tolerated; TEAEs were reported by 5 subjects, and all were mild in intensity.
EXAMPLE 5: CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS OF ORAL ADMINISTRATION

ADMINISTRATION OF THE SAME
        The oral dosage levels and formulation of MNTX evaluated here were the same as
those in a phase 3 study of oral MNTX tablets, with the exception of a nonfunctional coating
on the MNTX tablets.        This nonfunctional coating is comprised of inactive ingredients
polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide. The pharmacokinetics of the
uncoated tablet used in the phase 3 study and the coated tablets used in the current study were
compared in a separate study. The current study was designed to evaluate the comparative
bioavailability of orally administered, 150, 300, and 450 mg MNTX doses versus a 12 mg
subcutaneous (SC) injection of MNTX.          A single-dose pharmacokinetic profile of oral
MNTX tablets was also planned for evaluation in this study.
        The objectives of this study were to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of 150,
300, and 450 mg single oral doses of MNTX tablets versus a 12 mg single SC dose of
MNTX, and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of MNTX tablets after single oral dose
administration in healthy subjects.

        Presented herein is a randomized, open-label, crossover study consisting of 6 dosing
sequences, each with 2 dosing periods; the dosing periods were separated by 7 days. All
subjects were housed in the clinical research unit from Day -1 through Day 14 and were
discharged on Day 15, which concluded their participation in the study. Prior to receiving
study drug on Days 1 and 8, the subjects underwent an overnight fast of at least 10 hours,
beginning on Days 0 and 7, respectively.       In both dosing periods, the subjects received a
single oral dose of MNTX tablets (150, 300, or 450 mg) or a single SC injection of MNTX
(12 mg). The dosing was conducted in a crossover fashion (e.g., a tablet was administered at
one visit and a SC injection was administered at the alternate visit). The strength of oral
methylnaltrexone dose (150 mg, 300 mg, or 450 mg) and the dosing sequence (Dayl: oral
tablet; Day 8: SC injection vs the alternate dosing order) for each subject were determined by
random assignment.        Each oral dose was administered with 240 mL of room temperature
drinking water.    The subjects were instructed to drink all of the water and were told to
swallow the tablets whole (e.g., not to chew, divide, or crush them). Blood samples were
collected for pharmacokinetic analyses prior to dosing (approximately 1 hour prior) on Day 1,
and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours after
dosing on Days 1 and 8.
        Each tablet contained 150 mg of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, MNTX.           In
addition, each tablet contained the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide,
crospovidone, edetate disodium calcium dihydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline
cellulose, polysorbate 80, siliconized microcrystalline cellulose, sodium bicarbonate, sodium
lauryl sulfate, and talc.
        Each injection vial contained 12 mg of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, MNTX,
per 0.6 mL of solution (i.e., 20 mg/mL solution).         The formulation also contained the
following inactive      ingredients:  edetate calcium disodium,     sodium chloride,    glycine
hydrochloride, and sodium hydroxide.
        In this study, all 48 enrolled subjects received study drug in each of the 2 study
periods and were included in the safety and pharmacokinetic analyses.
        The mean    Cmax   for MNTX was observed at 15 minutes following 12 mg SC injection
and plasma concentrations then diminished rapidly within the initial postdosing period (Table
26; abbreviations: PO = per oral, SC = subcutaneous). Beginning around 4 hours postdosing
and continuing through at least 72 hours postdosing, there were greater mean plasma

concentrations of MNTX following oral MNTX dosing relative to the SC injection for the
300 m and 450 m doses, but not for the 150 mg oral dose.
        Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of SC MNTX compared with oral MNTX
demonstrated that   Cmax was 4- to 13-fold higher, Tmax  was 6- to 8-fold shorter, and t was
shorter by 5 to 7 hours following SC MNTX 12 mg versus oral MNTX 150, 300, and 450 mg
(Table 26).
        Systemic exposure to MNTX as measured by Cmax and AUC followed generally
linear, dose-dependent trends among the oral doses (Table 26). Mean AUC and        Cmax values
increased with increasing single oral doses of MNTX tablets from 150 mg to 450 mg;        Cmax
increased from 13.2 to 39.9 ng/mL and AUCo_, increased from 106.9 to 373.3 ng-h/mL at
MNTX 150 mg and MNTX 450 mg, respectively.               Median Tmax values were constant,
ranging from approximately 1.5 to 2.0 hours post dosing. The mean CL/F values were also
similar across oral dosing groups. The mean t increased slightly from 14.0 hours to 16.6
hours as the oral MNTX doses increased, respectively, from 150 mg to 450 mg.
        The  Cmax occurred more rapidly following administration of the SC injection (median
Tmax =   15 minutes) than following any of the oral study drug administrations (median    Tmax
ranged from 1.5 to 2.0 hours) (Table 26).
        Comparison of systemic exposure parameters     (Cmax and AUC) demonstrates at least
4-fold higher mean   Cmax following SC MNTX 12 mg versus each of the oral MNTX doses;
however, mean AUCo_. following SC MNTX 12 mg was only 16% higher versus oral MNTX
300 mg and 28% lower versus oral MNTX 450 mg (Table 26). Mean         Cmax values were 174.0
ng/mL following SC MNTX 12 mg versus 26.2 and 39.9 ng/mL following oral MNTX 300
mg and 450 mg, respectively; and mean AUCo_. values following SC MNTX 12 mg were
269.1 versus 231.2 and 373.3 ng-h/mL following oral MNTX 300 mg and 450 mg,
respectively.
        Further, consistent with the observed differences in Cmax and AUC between SC
MNTX 12 mg and oral MNTX 450 mg, 300 mg, or 150 mg, elimination of MNTX was faster
following SC versus oral administration (Table 26). The MNTX clearance rate (CL/F) was
faster, 45698.7 versus 1664001.3 mL/h, and the t value was shorter, 9.2 versus 16.6 hours,
for SC MNTX 12 mg compared with oral MNTX 450 mg.

          Oral MNTX 450 mg resulted in a         Cmax   that was approximately 20% of the Cmax from
SC MNTX 12 mg and an AUCo_. that was approximately 123% of the AUCo_.                                  from SC
MNTX 12 mg; the geometric mean ratios of the oral tablet (test) to the SC injection
(reference) were 20.0% for Cmax and 123.2% for AUCo_, (Table 27). The lower bound of the
90% confidence interval for Cmax (4.3%) was well below 80% and the upper bound of the
90% confidence interval for AUCo_. (150.7%) was greater than 125% indicating that both

    WO 2013/096444                                                        PCT/US2012/070612
16 subjects each received a single oral dose of 150, 300, and 450 mg MNTX tablets and all
48 subjects received a single 12 mg SC injection of MNTX.
         Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of SC MNTX compared with oral MNTX
demonstrated that    Cmax was 4- to 13-fold higher, Tmax  was 6- to 8-fold shorter, and t was
shorter by 5 to 7 hours following SC MNTX 12 mg versus oral MNTX 150, 300, and 450
mg.
         Systemic exposure to MNTX as measured by Cmax and AUC (both AUCiast and
AUCo_)     followed generally linear, dose-dependent trends among the oral doses.
         Comparison of systemic exposure parameters     (Cmax and AUC) demonstrates at least
4-fold higher    Cmax following SC MNTX 12 mg versus each of the oral MNTX doses;
however, mean AUCo_. following SC MNTX 12 mg was only 16% higher versus oral MNTX
300 mg and 28% lower versus oral MNTX 450 mg. The              Tmax was shorter following SC
MNTX 12 mg (15 minutes) than following oral MNTX 150 mg 300 mg, or 450 mg, (2, 1.5,
and 2 hours, respectively). Also, consistent with the observed differences in  Cmax  and AUC,
the t value was shorter, 9.2 versus 16.6 hours, for SC MNTX 12 mg compared with oral
MNTX 450 mg (t 1 2 were 14.2 and 14. 0 hours following oral MNTX 300 mg and 150 mg,
respectively).
         The single-dose pharmacokinetics      of oral MNTX 150 mg tablet (ion-pairing)
formulation was also studied in a recent study of healthy adults and in prior studies of
subjects with noncancer pain and OIC and subjects on stable methadone maintenance.        The
single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of oral MNTX were generally similar in the current
study and in these other studies, although there were some quantitative differences in    Cmax
and AUC in the current study and recent study of healthy adults when compared with prior
studies of subjects with noncancer pain and OIC and of subjects on stable methadone
maintenance.
         Methylnaltrexone by SC injection was compared to MNTX administered orally in a
pharmacokinetic study in subjects on stable methadone maintenance.           The oral MNTX
formulation was different in the current study than in the previous study, in which the oral
formulations were enteric-coated granules in capsules and enteric-coated tablets. Although it
is difficult to compare the current study and the previous study due to different oral MNTX
formulations, the comparative pharmacokinetic profiles between SC dosing and oral dosing
were similar between studies. Specifically, as in the current study,   Tmax  was shorter, Cmax
                                               63

was higher, and    t1/ 2 was shorter following SC dosing compared with oral dosing; whereas
differences in AUC values between SC and oral administrations were less pronounced than
the differences in   Cmax, Tmax,  and  t1/ 2 . Dose-normalized oral bioavailability relative to SC
injection was 2.43% for enteric-coated capsules and 2.27% for enteric-coated tablets in the
previous study, compared with 3.7% for the oral tablet (ion-pairing) formulation in the
current study.
        Oral doses of 150, 300, and 450 mg MNTX tablets and 12 mg MNTX SC injection
and well tolerated in healthy volunteers who received 1 of the 3 oral doses of MNTX tablets
as well as the SC injection of MNTX in this 2-period crossover study.
