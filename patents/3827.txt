Cross-Reference to Related Applications
[01]            This application is a divisional of Australian patent application no.
<removed-apn> filed on <removed-date>, which is a divisional of Australian patent application no.
2012379018 filed on 2 May 2012, which is a national phase application of International
patent application no. PCT/US2012/036076, filed on 2 May 2012, the disclosures of which
are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Technical Field
[02]            The present disclosure is related to an optical fiber cable that incorporates a
ribbon-like structure in place of individual loose optical fibers.
Background
[03]            Two different types of optical fiber cables are ribbon cables and cables with
individual optical fibers, either loose-tube, or tightly buffered. When designing and building
networks, the advantages and disadvantages of these cables are weighed. Some of the
advantages and disadvantages of these cables are listed below.
[04]            Advantages of ribbon cables include: (1) they allow for easy MPO
connectorization; (2) they are relatively easy to mass splice; and (3) they provide for lower
skew than cables with individual fibers. However, the design and manufacturing of ribbon
cables can be more difficult.
[05]            Advantages of cables with individual fibers: (1) Lower PMD than ribbon
cable; and (2) the design and manufacturing of the cables is easier relative to ribbon cables.
[06]            Fig. 2 shows an example of a conventional flat ribbon cable 4. This type of
ribbon cable can be used by a user that requires low skew considering high speed
                                                  1

transmission (e.g. 40 G or 100 G of parallel transmission). In addition, users that like the
easy operation of MPO connectorization may use this type of cable. Two 12 fiber ribbons 5,
6 are stacked on top of each other in the cable 4. The cable 4 has an outer jacket 7. Aramid 8
is inside of the jacket and the inner shape is rectangular to keep the ribbon shape flat. This
type of cable requires careful handling during the installation, because bending in incorrect
directions may damage the fibers.
[07]             Conventional single-fibers cable are sometimes used by the users who prefer
round and small cables. Fig. 3 shows an example of a single-fiber cable 13. Twenty-four
fibers can be divided into two 12 fiber bundle units 11 by the binders. An appropriate
amount of aramid yarn 12 is inserted between an inner pipe (e.g., a pipe 9) and an outer pipe
10 to protect the optical fibers from tension during installation and use. This type of cable
allows a multiple installation into limited space because of its small diameter, light weight
and flexibility.
[08]             It would be useful to produce a cable structure that has the advantages of both
ribbon cables and single-fibers cables.
[09]             Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like
included in the present specification is not to be taken as an admission that any or all of these
matters form part of the common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present
disclosure as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application.

Detailed Description
[40]             The following detailed description is provided to assist the reader in gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the methods, apparatuses and/or systems described herein.
Various changes, modifications, and equivalents of the systems, apparatuses and/or methods
described herein will suggest themselves to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of
well-known functions and structures are omitted to enhance clarity and conciseness.
[41]             Hereinafter, the exemplary embodiments will be described with reference to
accompanying drawings.
[42]             The new concept ribbon shown in Figs. lA-IC allows for the design of round
and small cables, like single-fibers cables. The new cable, using the new ribbons can satisfy
requirement for premise cables, such as low skew, quick connectorization and multiple
installations into limited spaces.
[43]             The features of the new cable design ribbon are described below using the
example of 12 fiber ribbon 1 shown in Figs. lA-IC. Figure 1A shows the 12 fiber ribbon 1
in a Z-direction view. In Fig. 1A, twelve fibers la through 11 are arranged onto X-axis. The
fibers can have an appropriate color arrangement, but that is not required. For example, a
blue fiber la could be bonded intermittently with an orange fiber lb which is next to blue
one. In a similar way, all fibers la - 11, which are arranged side by side, are bonded partially.
Also, while this embodiment shows each fiber intermittently bonded to at least one other
fiber, the intermittent bonding does not have to occur between each fiber. There may be
some fibers that bonded to another fiber along the entire length of the fibers.
[44]             The fibers can be bonded by any know conventional methods. One such
known method of bonding is described in U.S. Application Publication No. 2010/029678 1,
which is incorporated herein by reference. The bonding elements 2 are shown in Figs. 1A
and 1B. Note that only one bonding element 2 between fibers la and lb is shown in Fig. 1B.

There would also be bonding elements between the other fibers. There could also be bonding
elements between the fibers in Fig. IC.
[45]             Fig. 1A shows the bonding elements 2 arranged in a diagonal pattern across
the ribbon. However, they do not have to be diagonal. Other patterns could also be used.
[46]             The length of the bonding element can be very small relative to the length of
the fibers that are not attached to the bonding element (gap 3). For example, the length of
the bonding element 2 could be between approximately 2 and 20 mm, with a preferable
length of 10 mm. The gap between bonding elements could be between approximately 20
and 500 mm, with a preferable length of 50 mm. Preferable ratios of bonding length to gap
length could be between approximately 1/5 to 1/20. This intermittent bonding structure
enables the ribbon to be more flexible like single fibers.
[47]             Fig. 1B shows the y-direction view of the 12 fiber ribbon 1 that has not been
inserted into a cable. Fig. IC shows the y-direction view of the 12 fiber ribbon 1 that has
been inserted into a cable (cable is not shown).
[48]             Alternatively, mass splicing could be performed in the same way as for a
conventional ribbon.
[49]             Four fiber ribbon, eight fiber ribbon and other fiber arrangement can be used
depending on the specific needs of the user. Also, multi-mode (MM) fibers and single mode
(SM) fibers can be used depending on the specific needs of the user.
[50]             Fig. 4 shows an example of a 24 fiber cable 15 using the new fiber ribbon.
The structure consists of two 12 fiber ribbons 1 and a pipe 14. In this embodiment, the pipe
could be a single layer jacket. However, in the context of this disclosure, a pipe could refer
to a "jacket" or a "tube." In this embodiment, the cable does not include aramid yam inside
the pipe 14. Each ribbon can be identified by marking on the ribbon or by using a different
color of thread wound around the ribbon. In this embodiment, the pipe 14 material is PVC.

Other pipe materials such as PE, FRPE, PP, PBT or other thermoplastics could also be used.
The cable shape is round and the cable diameter is small, like conventional single-fiber
cables. This cable may also be used as a unit in a larger cable. The ribbon type in the cable
is variable. For example, the size of the ribbons may vary, for example, from 2 fibers to 24
fibers and the total fiber counts in the cable may also vary. The ribbon 1 can be twisted
helically, or S-Z twisted.
[51]            Also, the inner diameter of the pipe could be adjusted so that the cable is
considered to be either "tightly buffered," or "loosely buffered." One example of a tightly
buffered cable would be one in which the ratio of the cross sectional area of the inner
diameter of the pipe to the cross-sectional area of the ribbon would be less than
approximately 1.34. Cables that are not "tightly buffered" may be considered to be "loosely
buffered."
[52]            Fig. 5 shows an example of a 24 fiber trunk cable 16. Aramid yams 18 are
embedded between the 24 fiber cable 15 shown in Fig. 4 and an outer pipe 17. The amount
of aramid yarns 18 will depend on the tensile performance requirements (e.g. GR409 vertical
or GR409 horizontal). In this example, outer pipe material 17 is PVC. Other pipe materials
such as PE, FRPE, Polyurethane, Polyamide or other thermoplastics could also be used. The
cable shape is round and the cable diameter is small as in the conventional cable shown in
Fig. 3. The ribbon type in the cable is variable. For example, the size of the ribbons may
vary, for example, from 2 fibers to 24 fibers and the total fiber counts in the cable may also
vary.
[53]            Fig. 6 shows an example of a 24 fiber cable 19 for interconnect use. This
cable consists of two 12 fiber ribbons 1 and Aramid yams 21 surrounded by a single layer
pipe 20. An appropriate amount of yam 21 is embedded in order to meet tensile specification
(e.g. GR409 interconnect). The pipe 20 material could be PVC PE, FRPE, Polyurethane,

Polyamide or other thermoplastics. The cable shape is round and one example of the cable
diameter is equal or less than 3.8 mm, which is same as that of the conventional single-fibers
cable. However, other diameters may be used. The ribbon type in the cable is variable. For
example, the size of the ribbons may vary, for example, from 2 fibers to 24 fibers and the
total fiber counts in the cable may also vary. For example, if one 12 fiber ribbons is in the
cable the cable diameter could be equal or less than 3.0 mm. Also, if four 12 fiber ribbons
are in the cable the cable diameter could be equal or less than 4.8 mm.
[54]            Fig. 7 shows an example of a 144 fiber trunk cable for vertical and horizontal
use. Twelve 12 fiber cables 23 with 3.0 mm outer diameters surrounded a central strength
member 24. The cable 23 is similar to the cable 19 in Fig. 6, except that it has different fiber
counts and outer diameter. An appropriate size of FRP is chosen as the central member 24 in
order to meet tensile and temperature specifications (e.g. GR409 vertical or GR409
horizontal).   The outer pipe material 25 can be PVC PE, FRPE, Polyurethane, Polyamide or
other thermoplastics. Although the cable 22 shows that there are twelve 12 fiber cables 23,
some of the cables 23 can be replaced with fillers which are made of PVC PE, FRPE,
Polyurethane, Polyamide or other thermoplastics.
[55]            Fig. 8 shows an example of a 288 fiber trunk cable 26 for vertical and
horizontal use. Twelve 24 fiber cables 27, with 3.8 mm outer diameters surrounded a central
strength member 29. The cable 27 is same as cable 19 in Fig. 6. An appropriate size of FRP
is chosen as the central member 29 in order to meet tensile specification (e.g. GR409 vertical
or GR409 horizontal).     The outer pipe material 28 can be PVC PE, FRPE, Polyurethane,
Polyamide or other thermoplastics. Although the cable 26 shows that there are twelve 24
fiber cables 27, some of the cables 27 can be replaced with fillers which are made of PVC
PE, FRPE, Polyurethane, Polyamide or other thermoplastics.

[56]             The disclosed embodiments can also be used in optical ground wire (OPGW)
cable. It enables mass splicing, which dramatically reduce the operation time of termination
at difficult locations, such as pylons. Fig. 9 shows an example of a conventional Alma core
type OPGW cable 30. It has three optical units 33 surrounded by an pipe 34. In this
embodiment, the pipe 34 is made of aluminum. The pipe 34 is surrounded by several
aluminum alloy wires 35 and several aluminum clad steel wires 36. The disclosed
embodiments can be incorporated into this OPGW application by replacing the optical units
33 with buffer pipes 32 containing a 12 fiber ribbon 1. The ribbon type is variable. For
example, the size of the ribbons may vary, for example, from 2 fibers to 24 fibers. The buffer
pipe 32 can be made of PE, PP, PBT, alloy of PBT, or other thermoplastics. The 12 fiber
ribbon 1 can be tightly buffered by the pipe or loosely buffered by gel, silicon or air.
[57]             Fig 10 shows an example of a conventional Centra core type OPGW cable 37.
The cable core consists of a hermetically sealed stainless steel pipe 39 with a plurality of
optical fibers 38. The stainless steel pipe 39 is covered by an aluminum pipe 40 and the pipe
40 is surrounded by several aluminum alloy wires 41 and several aluminum clad steel wires
42. The disclosed embodiments can be incorporated into this OPGW application by
replacing the cable core with a stainless steel tube 43 containing one or more 12 fiber ribbons
1. The ribbon type is variable. For example, the size of the ribbons may vary, for example,
from 2 fibers to 24 fibers. Gel, silicon or air can be filled into the stainless steel pipe 43.
[58]             Fig 11 shows an example of conventional Hexa core type OPGW cable 44.
The core consists of three hermetically sealed stainless steel pipes 45, which include a
plurality of fibers, and three aluminum clad steel wires 46 surrounding an aluminum clad
steel wire 46. The core can be surrounded by an aluminum pipe (note shown) and then
aluminum clad steel wires 46 and aluminum alloy wires 47. The disclosed embodiments can
be incorporated into this OPGW application by replacing the hermetically sealed stainless

steel pipes 45 with a stainless steel pipe 48 containing one or more 12 fiber ribbons 1. The
ribbon type is variable. For example, the size of the ribbons may vary, for example, from 2
fibers to 24 fibers. As a result, up to 432 fibers can be in one cable.
[59]             Loose tube cables, sometimes called black jacket cables, with single fibers are
often used as a feeder cable, a distribution cable and a drop cable. Generally, a cable with
relatively higher fiber counts is used as a feeder cable. Ribbon splicing between a feeder
cable and another cable (which is a feeder cable or a distribution cable) would improve
efficiency and reduce cable installation time and installation cost. However, low PMD for
WDM is usually required for feeder cable. A feeder cable with the disclosed ribbons can
satisfy both of these requirements (Ribbon splicing and low PMD).
[60]             A distribution cable is usually laid between a feeder cable and some drop
cables. It is terminated with feeder cable at one of the cable end. For the termination at this
access point, ribbon splicing is efficient. Also, it is terminated with another cable (which is a
feeder cable or a drop cables) at another side of cable end or at the mid pint of the cable. For
the termination at this access point, single-fiber splicing can be required. A distribution cable
that uses the disclosed ribbon can make both ribbon splicing and single-fiber splicing easier.
[61]             Fig. 12 shows an example of a conventional loose tube cable 49. The cable
core consists of five gel-filled buffer pipes 56. The buffer pipes 56 are S-Z twisted around a
central strength member 53, such as FRP. The buffer pipes 56 are surrounded by a water
blocking system 55 and a polyester tape 51. There may also be a rip cord 54. Above the tape
is a polyethylene pipe 50. The pipe material can be PVC, PE, FRPE, Polyurethane,
Polyamide or other thermoplastics. The disclosed embodiments can be incorporated into this
loose tube application by replacing the buffer pipes 56 with a buffer pipe 57 containing one
or more 12 fiber ribbons 1. The ribbon type is variable. For example, the size of the ribbons
may vary, for example, from 2 fibers to 24 fibers. The buffer pipe 57 can be PE, PP, PBT,

alloy of PBT and Polyether, or other thermoplastics. The buffer pipe can filled with gel,
silicon, yam or air.
[62]            Fig. 13 shows an example of a conventional ADSS cable 58 for use in short
spans. The cable core consists of four buffer pipes 64. The tubes are S-Z twisted around a
central strength member 63, such as FRP. The buffer pipes 64 are surrounded by a water
blocking system 65, such as water blocking yam binder. Surrounding the water blocking
system is torque balance aramid yams 61. The aramid yarns 61 help protect the cable from
the high tension needed for aerial installation. There may also be a rip cord 62. A polyester
tape 60 surrounds the aramid yarns 61. Above the tape 60 is a polyethylene outer pipe 59.
The pipe material can be PVC, PE, FRPE, Polyurethane, Polyamide or other thermoplastics.
The disclosed embodiments can be incorporated into this ADSS application by replacing the
buffer pipes 64 with a buffer pipe 66 containing one or more 12 fiber ribbons 1. The ribbon
type is variable. For example, the size of the ribbons may vary, for example, from 2 fibers to
24 fibers. The buffer pipe 66 can be PE, PP, PBT, alloy of PBT and Polyether, or other
thermoplastics. The buffer pipe can filled with gel, silicon, yarn or air.
[63]            Fig. 14 shows an example of a conventional ADSS cable 67 for use in long
spans. The cable core consists of 24 buffer pipes 75. Nine of the pipes 75 are arranged over
a central strength member 68, such as FRP, to form a first layer and fifteen of the pipes 75 are
arranged over the first layer to form a second layer. A water blocking binder 76 is in between
the first and second layers. Surrounding the second layer is a non-hygroscopic core wrap 73
and then a polyethylene inner pipe 70. Surrounding the inner pipe 70 is torque balance
aramid yams 72. The aramid yarns 72 provide supporting during the aerial installation.
There may also be a ripcord 74. Surrounding the aramid yarns 72 is a non-hygroscopic core
wrap 71 and then a polyethylene or track resistant outer pipe 69. The inner and/or outer pipe
material can be PVC, PE, FRPE, Polyurethane, Polyamide or other thermoplastics. The

disclosed embodiments can be incorporated into this ADSS application by replacing the
buffer pipes 75 with a buffer pipe 77 containing one or more 12 fiber ribbons 1. The ribbon
type is variable. For example, the size of the ribbons may vary, for example, from 2 fibers to
24 fibers. The buffer pipe 77 can be PE, PP, PBT, alloy of PBT and Polyether, or other
thermoplastics. The buffer pipe can filled with gel, silicon, yarn or air. In addition, while
this embodiment shows two pipe layers, there may only be one pipe layer.
[64]             Fig. 15 shows an example of a conventional center loose tube cable 78. The
cable core consists of one buffer pipe 80 arranged at the center of the cable. Surrounding the
core is a strength element 82, such as aramid yam. A water blocking system 83 surrounds the
strength member 82. Surrounding the water-blocking system 83 is a polyethylene outer pipe
79. The pipe material can be PVC, PE, FRPE, Polyurethane, Polyamide or other
thermoplastics. The disclosed embodiments can be incorporated into this center loose tube
application by replacing the buffer pipe 80 with a buffer pipe 84 containing one or more 12
fiber ribbons 1. The ribbon type is variable. For example, the size of the ribbons may vary,
for example, from 2 fibers to 24 fibers. The buffer pipe 84 can be ferrous or non-ferrous
metal, PE, PP, PBT, alloy of PBT and Polyether, or other thermoplastics. The buffer pipe can
filled with gel, silicon, yarn or air.
[65]             Fig. 16 shows an example of another conventional center loose tube cable 85.
Two strength members 86 are arranged on opposite sides of a buffer pipe 89 arranged at the
center of the cable. The strength member can be any kind of ferrous or non-ferrous metal,
any kind of FRP or metallic pipe with optical fibers. A water blocking system 87 is next to
the strength members 86 and buffer pipe 89. An outer pipe 88 surrounds the interior
elements. The pipe material can be PVC, PE, FRPE, Polyurethane, Polyamide or other
thermoplastics. There may also be a ripcord 90. The disclosed embodiments can be
incorporated into this center loose tube application by replacing the buffer pipe 89 with a

buffer pipe 91 containing one or more 12 fiber ribbons 1. The ribbon type is variable. For
example, the size of the ribbons may vary, for example, from 2 fibers to 24 fibers. The buffer
pipe 91 can be ferrous or non-ferrous metal, PE, PP, PBT, alloy of PBT and Polyether, or
other thermoplastics. The buffer pipe can filled with gel, silicon, yam or air.
[66]             Fig. 17 shows an example of a conventional logging cable 92. The cable core
consists of one stainless steel pipe 94 arranged at the center of the cable. Surrounding the
stainless steel pipe 94 is a polyethylene outer pipe 93. The pipe material can be PVC, PE,
FRPE, Polyurethane, Polyamide or other thermoplastics. The disclosed embodiments can be
incorporated into this center loose tube application by replacing the stainless steel pipe 94
with a buffer pipe 95 containing one or more 12 fiber ribbons 1. The ribbon type is variable.
For example, the size of the ribbons may vary, for example, from 2 fibers to 24 fibers. The
buffer pipe 95 can be ferrous or non-ferrous metal, PE, PP, PBT, alloy of PBT and Polyether,
or other thermoplastics. The buffer pipe can filled with gel, silicon, yarn or air.
[67]             As mentioned above, although the exemplary embodiments described above
are various types of cables, they are merely exemplary and the scope of the present disclosure
should not be limited thereto, and it could also apply to the stranding of other cables.
[68]             Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations such as
"comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element,
integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other
