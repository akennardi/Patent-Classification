                             ABSTRACT
   A hinge member is provided for use in facilitating
 5 movement of components of a barrier with respect to one
   another and with respect to the hinge when the barrier is
   moved between an open configuration and a closed
   configuration. The hinge member can have a variety of
   different forms including having a single socket or having
10 a double socket. The socket is for receiving an edge of a
   panel. The socket is oriented off centre so as to be
   angularly inclined to the central axis of the hinge
   member. The socket is formed by having two walls of
   different lengths defining the of-set opening there
15 between, which opening is angularly inclined to the
   central axis of the hinge member. The opening can have a
   circular or oval or elliptical profile. The hinge member
   can interconnect two similar barrier components such as
   one panel to another panel, or can interconnect two
20 dissimilar barrier components such as a panel and a
   support. The advantage of the off-setting of the opening
   of the socket is to allow panels of the barrier to be
   folded closer to one another thereby effecting space
   saving when the barrier is in the fully opened
25 configuration.

   FIELD
 5 The present description relates generally to hinges for
   barrier assemblies and to security barriers formed by
   multiple barrier assemblies interconnected to one another
   through hinges, and to methods of installing and operating
   such security barriers to protect secured areas.

   In one form the present description relates to movable
   barrier assemblies and to security barriers formed by
   multiple movable barrier assemblies interconnected to one
   another by hinges, which security barriers are movable
15 between closed configurations for preventing access to
   secure areas, and open configurations allowing access to
   secure areas.
   In one form the present description relates to movable
20 barrier assemblies having a hinge member for
   interconnecting different barrier components of the
   barrier assembly either to one another within the one
   barrier assembly or to similar barrier components of other
   barrier assemblies to form the security barrier of
25 interconnected barrier assemblies, in which the hinge
   member facilitates relative movement of selected barrier
   components with respect to another barrier component
   either of the same barrier assembly or of an adjacent
   barrier assembly.

   The hinge member of the present description finds
   particular application in interconnecting two barrier
   components of one or more barrier assemblies to one
   another for allowing the security barrier to move between
35 a retracted configuration and an expanded configuration in
   which, when the security barrier is in the retracted
   configuration, the barrier components adopt reduced spaced
                                            9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              - 2
   apart spatial relationship to each other so that the
   security barrier occupies less space in the retracted
   configuration.
 5 Although the present description is directed to the
   description of one or other embodiments of a hinge member,
   a barrier component, a barrier assembly or a security
   barrier, it is to be noted that the scope of protection is
   not restricted to the described embodiments, but rather
10 the scope of protection is more extensive so as to include
   other forms, variations, modifications and similar of the
   described embodiments and their application in situations
   and environments other than specifically described.
15 BACKGROUND
   Security barriers are required in increasingly more
   diverse situations, many of which have minimal space for
   the installation of suitable security barriers,
20 particularly high strength barriers of sufficient strength
   to withstand attack by unauthorised persons attempting to
   force their way past the security barriers to gain
   unauthorised access to a secured area protected by the
   security barrier.  Whilst security barriers having
25 sufficient strength to withstand the application of
   considerable force by unauthorised persons, such as for
   example using a tool or other implement, such as a sledge
   hammer, pinch bar, wrecking bar or similar, and are able
   to be used in areas having minimal space availability when
30 in the closed configuration for providing protection for
   the secured area, such security barriers when in the open
   configuration often occupy space at the side of the
   entrance to the secured area which often restricts access
   through the entrance to the secured area even though the
35 security barrier is in the retracted or compact
   configuration.  However, reducing the space occupied by a
   foldable security barrier when in the open retracted
                                            9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              - 3
   configuration sometimes results in the strength of the
   security barrier being compromised when in the closed
   configuration owing to the need to avoid bulky components
   interconnecting various components of the barrier or
 5 barrier assembly in order to be able to fit the security
   barrier into the available space.  If the barrier is
   required to be strong its construction needs to be
   generally robust which usually entails using heavy duty or
   relatively large components which generally require more
10 space thus hindering access when in the open
   configuration.  On the other hand, if the security barrier
   is made of more lightweight material allowing the barrier
   to be folded into a reduced space to provide improved
   access at the entrance of the secured area, the strength
15 of the security barrier is weakened, sometimes to such an
   extent that adequate protection is often not able to be
   provided by the security barrier when in the closed
   configuration.  Therefore, there is a need to provide a
   security barrier which has sufficient strength to provide
20 security when in the closed configuration but which
   occupies a reduced space when in the open configuration.
   However, in the past it has been difficult to provide both
   of the apparently conflicting requirements of the security
   barrier, being strong in the closed configuration but
25 unobtrusive in the open configuration.

   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
   In one form the hinge member is a single hinge or in
   another form is a double hinge.  Typically, the hinge
 5 member interconnects two barrier components, more
   typically two similar barrier components, to one another
   whilst allowing relative movement of one barrier component
   with respect to the other barrier component.         In one form,
   the hinge member interconnects two different barrier
10 components to one another in which one barrier component
   is movable relative to the other barrier component.
   Typically, one of the barrier components is movable in one
   direction by undergoing one type of motion or movement,
   whereas the other of the barrier components is movable in
15 another direction, typically a different direction, by
   undergoing another type of motion or movement.
   In one form of the hinge member where the two barrier
   components are dissimilar, one of the barrier components
20 moves in a first motion and the other of the barrier
   components moves in a second motion in which the first
   motion is different to the second motion.     In one form the
   first motion is a linear motion, typically a reciprocal
   linear motion, more typically a linear motion extending
25 between the edges of the entrance to the secured area, and
   the second motion is a rotary motion, first in one
   direction and then in a opposite direction to define a
   hinged movement, combined with a linear motion, typically
   in accordance with sliding movement of the security
30 barrier, more typically hinged movement simultaneously
   with the sliding movement.
   In one form of the hinge member, one of the barrier
   components undergoes rotary movement and linear movement
35 typically simultaneous respective rotary and linear
   movements as the other of the barrier components undergoes
   linear movement only.
                                            9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              - 9
   In one form the hinge member has a body portion adapted to
   be of a shape convenient for use of the hinge member to
   interconnect the two barrier components whilst allowing
   movement of the barrier components.   Typically, the body
 5 portion is a generally planar body portion, more typically
   extending substantially transversely of the direction of
   movement of the security barrier.   Typically, the body
   portion is of a generally prism shape, more typically in
   the form of a multi-sided prism, such as for example, a
10 triangular prism, a rectangular prism, a pentagonal prism,
   a hexagonal prism or the like.
   In one form the hinge member is provided with an
   engagement arrangement for securely joining the hinge
15 member to the barrier component.  In one form the
   engagement arrangement includes a first engager and a
   second engager. In one form the hinge member is provided
   with the first engager and the barrier component is
   provided with the second engager, in which the first
20 engager and the second engager are complementary to one
   another.
   Typically, the first engager and the second engager are
   complementary to one another so as to be cooperatively
25 engageable with each other to securely attach the hinge
   member to the barrier component.  In one form the
   engagement arrangement is a fixed arrangement in which the
   barrier component and hinge member are not relatively
   movable with respect to each other, but rather are fixed
30 to one another so as to move in unison in response to
   operation of the security barrier between the open and
   closed configurations moving along a substantially linear
   pathway, typically the linear pathway of the barrier.
   Typically, the movement in unison is a linear movement,
35 more typically a reciprocal linear movement corresponding
   to opening and closing of the barrier.
                                             9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              - 10
   Forms of the first engager include projections,
   protrusions, extensions, or similar, in the form of ribs,
   tabs, ridges, bosses, or similar extending outwardly from
   the hinge member. Forms of the second engager include
 5 recesses, depressions, voids, or similar, in the form of
   channels, grooves, rebates, slots, or similar in Denton
   into the barrier component, typically the post, pole or
   upright. The projections of the first engager are received
   in the recesses of the second engager to securely attach
10 the hinge member to the barrier member.
   In one form the hinge member is provided with a single
   socket, or is provided with two sockets in spaced apart
   relationship to each other.   Typically, each socket is
15 provided with an opening. In one form the opening is
   located off-set or angularly inclined to the socket,
   typically the walls forming the socket.   More typically,
   when there are two sockets, the openings are located
   offset from the central axis of the hinge member or are
20 arranged to extend in angularly inclined directions to one
   another, more typically in oppositely inclined or in
   diverging directions from one another so as to extend in a
   direction pointing away from each other.
25 Embodiments of the hinge member in the form of a single
   hinge member are provided with a single socket, whereas
   embodiments of the hinge member in the form of a double
   hinge member are provided with two sockets arranged to
   extend in oppositely inclined directions or in diverging
30 directions.
   Forms of the hinge member have the following dimensions.
   The opening of the socket is in the range of from about
   2mm to about 5mm, typically from 3mm to 4.5mm, preferably
35 from about 3.5mm to 4mm, most preferably 3.86mm.                The
   angle subtended by the opening is in the range from about
   700 to about 890, typically from about 750 to 880, more
                                             9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                                  - 11
   typically about 800 to 870, preferably from about 810 to
   about 850, more preferably 830.
   Forms of the hinge have an aperture or bore, typically a
 5 cylindrical or circular aperture or bore. In one form, the
   diameter of the aperture or bore of the hinge member is in
   the range from about 3mm to about 10mm, typically in the
   range from about 4mm to about 8mm, more typically about
   5mm to about 7mm, preferably about 5.5mm to 6.5mm, more
10 preferably     6mm.
   In    one form the hinge member is  provided with two
   angularly inclined sloping sides located at or towards one
   end or side of the hinge member, typically at or towards
15 the side remote from the side having the opening or pair
   of openings.      In one form the sloping sides are each
   inclined to the apex of the hinge member, typically
   oppositely inclined to one another to extend at or about
   the same angle.      Forms of the angle of inclination of the
20 sloping sides are in the range of from about 200 to about
   600, typically from about 300 to     500, more typically in
   the range of from about 35 to 450, preferably about 380 to
   420,     and more preferably about 40.040.
25 In one form there is a bridge between the sockets of the
   hinge member having two sockets.      In one form the lengths
   of the bridge are in the range of from about 8mm to 15mm,
   typically from about 10mm to 12mm, preferably about
   11.02mm.      In one form the outer edge of the bridge is
30 curved or similar.      Typically the radius of curvature is
   in the range from about 10mm to 20mm, more typically in
   the range from about 12mm to 16mm, more typically from
   13mm to 15mm, preferably about 14.04mm.

   form of posts, poles, support posts, or other
   substantially vertically oriented or extending elongate
   members, typically extending to the height of the barrier.
   Forms of the barrier component include panels, partitions,
 5 segments, sectors, louvres, or similar.
   The support member of the barrier can have any suitable or
   convenient form.          Preferred forms of the support member
   include poles, posts, uprights, beams, rods, studs, door
10 jambs, struts, braces, props or similar elongate rigid
   structural components providing support and strength for
   the barrier.         In one form the support member is a single
   post or opposed post           having a boxlike structure defining
   an internal cavity, typically referred to as a standard
15 member or standard post, in which the shape or profile of
   the internal cavity is substantially square or
   rectangular.
   In one form the support member is a double post in which
20 there are two boxlike structures, each defining respective
   cavities, located contiguously with each other in side by
   side relationship sharing a common wall, typically
   referred to as a derivative of the standard member or
   post, in order to provide increased strength and rigidity
25 to the post to resist deformation when a deforming force,
   such as applied by a tool or implement, such as for
   example a crowbar, sledgehammer, jemmy, pinch bar or
   similar is applied to the post in situations where extra
   strength     is    required  for  increased security        and protection
30 for     a secured area.
   In    one form the post having the enclosed internal cavity
   structure       is  provided with an insert    for   increasing the
   strength     and rigidity      of the post and/or for          enabling the
35 connection of a trolley          assembly to  the top of the support
   post for attaching the trolley assembly to the post in
   which the trolley assembly and/or the support post is
                                                        9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                                    -  13
   suspended from the upper track.          In one form the profile
   of the insert corresponds to the profile of the internal
   cavity of the boxlike structure of the post.                     In one form
   the insert, if provided, extends a short distance
 5 lengthwise into the internal cavity of the support post or
   alternatively lengthwise to a greater distance.                         In one
   form the post and insert combination is provided with an
   internal block, typically in the form of a mounting block,
   for  further     increasing the strength       and rigidity             of the
10 post,    and for   mounting a suitable    fitting       thereto,
   including the trolley assembly.
   In forms, the internal cavity of the box section of the
   post provided with a block is adapted to receive the
15 trolley which is provided with a hanger or similar
   extension for extending between the axle of the wheel
   assembly of the trolley assembly into the upper track,
   including the slot or channel between the opposed flanges.
20 In one form, the panels are not of the same size,
   typically having different widths, more typically there
   are two sets of panels;      the first set being of relatively
   narrower width and the second set being of relatively
   wider width.       The panels can be a half-width panel,
25 sometimes referred to as a starter panel, or a full-width
   panel, often referred to as a standard width panel, in
   which the half-width panel is about half of the size of
   the full-width panel to facilitate compact storage of the
   security barrier when in the folded, open, retracted
30 configuration allowing access through the entrance to the
   secured area.       More typically, apart from the difference
   in width, the profile and cross-section of the half width
   panels and the full width panels, typically the
   longitudinal edges, are the same or similar.
35
   Forms of the panel are provided with plugs for being
   received within the sockets to allow relative movement of
                                                        9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

   the panel with respect to the hinge member and/or to other
   hinge members or panels and/or to the support poles or
   posts.   The plug can have any suitable or convenient form
   or be of any suitable or convenient type, profile, size or
 5 similar.   Typically, the plug is in the form of one or
   more projections or protrusions, more typically the
   projection or projections are located along the edge of
   the panel, typically along the longitudinal edges of the
   panel, even more typically, located along both
10 longitudinal edges of the panel and extending the full
   length of the panels. Forms of the plug include an edge
   section located at or towards either longitudinal edge in
   which the profile of the longitudinal edge is part
   circular, rounded, curved, or similar for engaging with
15 the circular or elliptical shaped socket of the hinge
   member.
   Forms of the barrier    include movable barriers            in     the form
   of screens,   such as mesh screens      or other open screens,
20 grids, roller screens, solid screens, partitions, roller
   doors, hatches, movable shutters, shutter screens,
   concertina screens, doors, concertina doors, louvered
   doors,  gates,  blinds,  curtains,     beams, strengthening beams
   or the like.
25
   Typically, the security barrier can be of any suitable
   form or type and be located anywhere where access to a
   secure area is to be denied or controlled.
30 In one form the movable barrier is a telescopically
   movable barrier, a sliding barrier, a concertina moving
   barrier, a roller barrier, a multi-segment barrier, a
   multi-partition barrier, a multi-panel barrier or similar.
35 In one form the barrier is provided with an upper track
   from which segments of the barrier or selected ones of the
   barrier assemblies are suspended for allowing movement of
                                                   9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

   the security barrier or barrier assemblies lengthwise
   along the track to move between the open and closed
   configurations.
 5 Forms of the barrier include an upper track from which the
   barrier is suspended or retained from above whilst
   allowing movement of the barrier along the upper track to
   move the barrier between the open configuration and the
   closed configuration.     In one form the track is provided
10 with an elongate opening, typically in the form of an
   elongate slot, channel, groove, rebate, opening or similar
   and a pair of internal rails or guides for facilitating or
   guiding movement of a trolley or other wheeled arrangement
   or skid arrangement along the internal rails or guides of
15 the track when the barrier is moving between the open and
   closed configurations.      In one form the internal rails or
   guides are in the form of flanges located on either side
   of the slot or similar.
20 In one form, the trolley is provided with a wheel assembly
   or similar. One form of the wheel assembly includes a pair
   of rollers, roller wheels, wheels, or similar for
   travelling along the internal rails or guides of the upper
   track.   In one form the upper track has a generally C
25 shaped profile or the like comprising two spaced apart
   guides or rails and an opening, typically located
   intermediate the two spaced apart guides or rails. In one
   form the opening is a slot extending between the guides or
   rails.   Typically, the opening of the C-shaped slot faces
30 the barrier which is in the direction of being generally
   downwardly directed or facing towards the floor of the
   location where the security barrier is installed.
   It is to be noted that the upper track and trolley can
35 have any suitable or convenient form depending upon the
   exact nature of the barrier.       The upper track is fixedly
   retained  in place by suitable     fasteners fixing         the track
                                                  9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

   to the ceiling or roof of the location at which the
   barrier is installed.  In one form the upper track is
   fixedly attached directly to the ceiling to depend
   downwardly from the ceiling or is suspended from the
 5 ceiling by a suitable hanger, spacer, hook or similar with
   the track suspended above the barrier.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   One form of a security barrier, generally denoted as 10,
30 will now be described.    Barrier 10 comprises a multitude
   of different barrier components       (to be described in more
   detail later) which are generally movable with respect to
   one another when barrier 10 moves between a closed or
   extended or secured configuration for securing the secured
35 area against unauthorised entry, typically as shown in
   figures  1 and 20, and an open or retracted or folded or
   compact configuration in which barrier 10 is folded upon
                                                  9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              - 19
   itself towards one side of the entrance to the secured
   area protected by the barrier when in the closed
   configuration, typically as shown in figures 6, 21 and 22.
 5 The different barrier components include one or more
   support posts located at spaced apart locations along the
   length of the barrier, typically at either end of the
   barrier, hinge members for joining different barrier
   components to one another, and to the support post or
10 posts, and panels which are movable about the hinge
   members and with respect to each other as the security
   barrier moves between the open configuration and the
   closed configuration.
15 With particular reference to figures 1 to 4 one form of
   barrier 10 will now be described in detail.        Barrier 10
   comprises, in one form, a generally rectangular hollow
   support post 12 which is located at one end of barrier 10
   for supporting barrier 10 in use.  Post 12 can be of any
20 suitable or convenient form for providing structural
   integrity and support for barrier 10.  In one form, post
   12 is provided with an internal cavity for contributing to
   the strength of post 12 by resisting deformation of post
   12 when struck with force by an implement.      One form of a
25 hinge member, being generally known as a single hinge or
   starter hinge, and generally referred to herein as the
   single hinge, is generally denoted as 40, because it has a
   single socket 42 only.  Single hinge 40 interconnects post
   12 and one form of the panels which is a starter panel or
30 half-width panel 80, referred to hereinafter as a half
   width panel.  Two full width panels 86 are interconnected
   to each other by another form of the hinge member, being
   double hinge or intermediate hinge, generally denoted as
   60, which double hinge has two spaced apart sockets 62 for
35 cooperatively engaging with respective edges of panels 86,
   one on either side of hinge 60.
                                            9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                               -  20
   A modified form of full width panel, being panel 90, is
   provided at spaced apart locations along the path of
   travel of barrier 10 to assist in locating and suspending
   barrier 10 in use to provide increased structural
 5 integrity for barrier 10.    Thus, one form of barrier 10
   comprises post 12, half width panel 80, interconnected to
   each other by hinge 40,  and multiple full width panels 86,
   multiple modified full width panels 92 interconnected to
   adjacent panels by respective hinges 60 extending
10 generally alternately from one end of barrier 10 to the
   opposite end of barrier 10 as shown schematically in
   figure 1 which illustrates barrier 10 in an extended,
   closed configuration.
15 It is to be noted that barrier 10 as illustrated in
   figures 1 to 4 is in an expanded closed configuration
   spanning the entrance to the secured area from one edge to
   the opposite edge.   When barrier 10 is to be moved to the
   open configuration post 12 is moved linearly in the
20 lengthwise extending direction of barrier 10 towards the
   opposite end of barrier 10,   resulting in individual panels
   hingedly moving about the respective hinges located at
   both sides of each of the panels, so that the panels can
   be contacted together by being located in folded
25 superposed substantially parallel slightly spaced apart
   relationship to one another at one side of the entrance to
   the secured area where the barrier is to be stored when in
   the fully opened configuration.    When barrier 10 is to be
   moved to the closed configuration barrier 10 is expanded
30 by linearly moving the barrier along the line of the
   barrier at the entrance to the secured area to adopt the
   fully expanded configuration, typically as shown in figure
   1, whereupon the individual panels hingedly move with
   respect to each other to adopt a more or less planar
35 orientation, albeit in a slightly zig-zag conformation
   extending from one side to the other side of the entrance
   to the secured area.
                                              9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                                - 21
   With particular reference to figure 5 one form of post 12
   and hinge 40 will now be described in detail.
 5 Post 12 is suspended from overhead track 14 which is
   fixedly attached to a suitable ceiling or roof support
    (not shown).   Track 14 extends along the path of travel of
   barrier 10 when moving between the retracted opened
   configuration and expanded closed configuration.                 Track 14
10 is provided with a pair of spaced apart flanges 16 along
   which a trolley 18 attached to the upper end of post 12
   travels.    Trolley 18 of post 12 is provided with a wheel
   assembly, including a pair of spaced apart wheels 20,
   which rotatingly travel along spaced apart flanges 16 of
15 track 14.    Wheels 20 are located at either end of axle 22.
   Trolley 18 is fixedly attached to an insert 24 located
   internally within a cavity 13 formed inside post 12 by
   shaft 26 extending downwardly inside cavity 13 of post 12
20 to be fixedly mounted therein in any suitable or
   convenient manner.    Thus, post 12 is suspended from track
   14 by trolley 18 which also allows linear movement of post
   12 along the pathway of movement of barrier 10 when moving
   between the expanded and contracted configurations.
25
   One or both sides of post 12 are provided with a generally
   profiled groove 28.    In one form the profile of groove 28
   has an enlarged internal slot and a relatively smaller
   sized opening at the entrance to the slot.        Groove 28 is
30 for facilitating connection of single hinge 40 to post 12
   by hinge 40 which is provided with a projection. The
   projection can have any suitable or convenient form.
   In one form, the projection is in the form of a rib 44
35 having a profile allowing insertion of the projection into
   groove 28 in any suitable manner, such as for example
   being slidingly received in groove 28 or by being clipped
                                              9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                               - 22
   into groove 28, or by being snap locked into groove 28 so
   that the projection is securely retained within groove 28.
   In one form rib 44 has a shape which is complementary to
 5 the profile of groove 28 having an enlarged head portion
   46 and a narrow neck portion 48 for being received in the
   internal slot of groove 28 to secure hinge 40 to post 12.
   In this form of hinge 40, rib 44 is slidingly received in
   groove 28 to secure hinge 40 to post 12, typically prior
10 to installation of post 12 in position in situ.
   In another form the profile of rib 44 includes a generally
   curved shank portion or hook 47 extending outwardly from
   the surface of hinge 40. Curved shank portion 47 or hook
15 is arranged to curve to one side of hinge 40, to provide
   sufficient clearance on one side of curved shank portion
   47 for being snap- lockingly received in the internal slot
   of groove 28  . In this form the cross-section of curved
   shank portion 47 is constant over its length. In this
20 form, the distal end of hook or curved shank portion 47 is
   inserted through the opening at the entrance to groove 28
   and manipulated by being twisted or slightly transversely
   rotated to fully insert curved shank portion 47 into
   groove 28 to secure hinge 40 to post 12 which has been
25 previously positioned in situ.
   Alternatively, when post 12 is located in situ, hinge 40
   can be clipped into groove 28 using a suitable form of rib
   44.
30
   One form of single hinge 40 will now be described with
   particular reference to figures 7 and 8.     In addition to
   having rib 44 with a curved shank portion 47 in the form
   of the hook,   hinge 40 includes a generally planar main
35 body portion 50 extending in a generally transverse
   direction from one side to the other side of hinge 40.
   The length of body 50 is about equal to or slightly less
                                             9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              -   23
   than the depth of post 12,   so that the edges 52 of hinge
   40 are to some extent protected by post 12 when installed
   in barrier 10.  A channel 54 which extends longitudinally
   along the lengthwise extending axis of hinge 40 is
 5 provided on the opposite side of body 50 to the side
   having rib 44 on each side of transversely extending body
   50.
   A single socket 42 is provided on the same side of hinge
10 40 as spaced apart channels 54.     Socket 42 is formed by a
   relatively shorter length socket wall 56, referred to as
   short side wall 56, located to one side of socket 42,                      and
   a relatively longer length socket wall 58, referred to as
   long side wall 58, located on the other side of socket 42.
15 In one form short side wall 56 is in the form of a
   projection, protrusion, bump or similar.       However short
   side wall 56 can have any suitable or convenient form and
   be of any suitable or convenient size, shape or profile.
20 An opening 59 is defined between the distal end of short
   wall 56 and the distal end of long wall 58 for receiving
   there through an edge of a suitable panel or other barrier
   component for hinged movement within socket 42.                In one
   form the shape of opening 59 is in the form of an open
25 sided substantially circular aperture in which the profile
   of the internal wall forming opening 59 is more or less
   substantially circular or of a more evenly substantially
   continuously curved profile.     It is to be noted that the
   axis of opening 59 extending from the central axis of
30 socket 42 through the midpoint of opening 59 is angularly
   inclined to the transversely extending axis of body 50,
   and also angularly inclined to the central axis of rib 44
   so that in effect socket 40 is oriented off centre from
   the path of travel of barrier 10 when moving between the
35 expanded closed configuration and the retracted open
   configuration.
                                               9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              - 24
   Further, it is to be noted that the off set of opening 59
   or angular inclination of socket 42 facilitates hinged
   movement of half width panel 80  (to be described in more
   detail later) to adopt a generally space saving
 5 orientation when barrier 10 is in a folded concertina
   position or condition to form the open configuration of
   the barrier in which the individual panels of the barrier
   are folded against one another so as to be superposed in
   spaced parallel relationship to one another to occupy a
10 reduced space, such as shown in figure 6.
   In one form, long wall 58 comprises a proximal wall part
   53 angularly inclined to distal wall part 55 which
   terminates in a generally curved end profile 57 along the
15 edge of distal wall part 55.
   It is to be noted that hinge 40 has a constant cross
   section over its entire length.   Socket 42 is for
   receiving an edge of half width panel 80 to allow hinged
20 movement of the half width panel with respect to post 12
   to enable barrier 10 when in the retracted configuration
   to occupy a reduced space by the half width panel being
   able to be folded against hinge 40 due to offset opening
   59 of socket 42, and hence the side of post 12,           as shown
25 more particularly in figure 6.
   Another form of the single hinge or starter hinge, denoted
   generally as 140, is illustrated in figure 17.            Starter
   hinge 140 has a similar configuration to that of hinge 40
30 apart from aperture 159 defined between short side wall
   156 and long side wall 158 being of a more oval or
   elliptical shape having a minor axis extending through the
   open side of aperture 159 and a major axis extending
   substantially perpendicular to the minor axis between
35 short side wall 156 and long side wall 158 as shown in
   figure 17.  It is to be noted that by elongating the
   curvature of the profile of the inner wall of aperture 159
                                             9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              - 25
   in one direction by making the shape of the aperture oval
   or elliptical, the size of aperture 159 can be made larger
   which allows for variations in the width of the
   interlocking panel being received in the aperture to be
 5 accommodated when forming the hinge.   In particular,
   changing the shape of aperture 159 to be elongated, such
   as for example being oval or elliptical allows starter
   panels or half width panels being received in aperture 159
   to sit or lie flat when the barrier is in the open
10 configuration or folded configuration.   Additionally,
   there is greater clearance between the outer profile of
   the edge of the half-width panel or starter panel and the
   inside wall of aperture 159 which assists in installation
   of the barrier and accommodates variations in
15 manufacturing tolerances, including different thicknesses
   of coatings applied to the single hinge or half width
   panel during manufacture.
   Additionally, hinge 140 is provided with a generally
20 circular bore 149 centrally located within hinge 140 at a
   location intermediate aperture 159 and rib 144 in the form
   of a curved shank or hook as shown in figure 17.                Bore 149
   is for assisting in mounting hinge 142 support post 12 by
   receiving therein a suitable fastener, typically in the
25 form of a screw 107, such as for example, No.14 screw or
   similar.
   Another form of the single hinge or starter hinge denoted
   generally as 240 is illustrated in figure 19.           Starter
30 hinge 240 has a similar configuration to that of                hinge
   140 apart from the shape of the connector in the form of
   rib 244. Rib 244 includes enlarged head portion 146 and
   reduced thickness neck portion 148. Rib 244 is of a
   profile complementary to that of groove 28 so that rib 244
35 is slidingly received within groove 28 to securely attach
   hinge 240 to post 12 prior to locating post 12 in situ to
   form the barrier. Aperture 159 defined between short side
                                             9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

   wall 156 and long side wall 158 being of a more oval or
   elliptical shape having a minor axis extending through the
   open side of aperture 159 and a major axis extending
   substantially perpendicular to the minor axis between
 5 short side wall 156 and long side wall 158 as shown in
   figure 19.  It is to be noted that by elongating the
   curvature of the profile of the inner wall of aperture 159
   in one direction by making the shape of the aperture oval
   or elliptical, the size of aperture 159 can be made larger
10 which allows for variations in the width of the
   interlocking panel being received in the aperture to be
   accommodated when forming the hinge.   In particular,
   changing the shape of aperture 159 to be elongated, such
   as for example being oval or elliptical allows starter
15 panels or half width panels being received in aperture 159
   to sit or lie flat when the barrier is in the open
   configuration or folded configuration.   Additionally,
   there is greater clearance between the outer profile of
   the edge of the half-width panel or starter panel and the
20 inside wall of aperture 159 which assists in installation
   of the barrier and accommodates variations in
   manufacturing tolerances, including different thicknesses
   of coatings applied to the single hinge or half width
   panel during manufacture.
25
   Additionally, hinge 240 is provided with a generally
   circular bore 149 centrally located within hinge 240 at a
   location intermediate aperture 159 and rib 244.              Bore 149
   can be provided with a closed bore as shown in the
30 embodiment of the hinge of figures 17 and 21.
   Bore 149 is for assisting in mounting hinge 240 to support
   post 12 by receiving therein a suitable fastener, such as
   for example No.14 screw or similar, optionally having a
35 special size head or oversize head, or an optional washer.
   Another embodiment of the hinge member, in the form of a
                                             9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                               - 27
   double hinge 60 or a hinge having two separate sockets 62
   will now be described with particular reference to figures
   9 and 10.  Hinge 60 is of a generally multi-sided prism
   shape having a generally distorted triangular cross
 5 section including a rounded apex forming one intersection
   of two sides of the triangle located intermediate two
   angularly inclined sides extending from the apex for
   forming two sides of the triangle with two sockets 62
   located along the, in effect, third side of the triangle.
10 Hinge 60 interconnects two full width panels in such a
   manner to allow the two panels to hingedly move with
   respect to each other in opposite directions of rotation
   about hinge 60 when barrier 10 moves between the open and
   closed configurations.
15
   Hinge 60 includes a generally triangular prism body 64
   having a centrally located bore 66 located adjacent the
   apex of the triangle intermediate the two angularly
   inclined sides.   Bore 66 which extends over the full
20 length of the hinge from one end to the other, is for
   receiving therein a suitable fastener, typically in the
   form of a self-tapping screw or similar to retain the
   panels within sockets 62.
25 Hinge 60 includes two sockets 62, one on either side of
   body 64, which are oppositely angularly inclined to one
   another on either side of body 64.   As both sockets 62 are
   substantially identical, apart from being oppositely
   angularly inclined to one another, one socket 62 only will
30 be described in full.   Socket 62 is formed at one side
   thereof by an outer side wall 68 of relatively shorter
   length and at the other side thereof, being the centrally
   arranged side, by an inner sidewall 70 of relatively
   longer length.   An opening 72 is formed between the
35 respective distal ends of outer short wall 68 and inner
   long wall 70.   A partition 74 separates the two sockets 62
   from each other at either side of a central longitudinally
                                             9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              - 28
   extending axis of hinge 60.  Partition 74 includes a
   narrow proximal portion in the form of a web 76 and an
   enlarged distal portion having two outwardly extending
   projections 78 in the form of rounded distal edges.
 5 Projection 78 at one side of hinge 60 forms part of the
   longer inner wall 70 of one socket 62 and projection 78 at
   the other side of hinge 60 forms part of the longer inner
   wall 70 of the other socket 62.   It is to be noted that
   the axis of opening 72 of one socket 62 is inclined to the
10 axis of opening 72 of the other socket 62 so that the
   directions of the respective openings face away from each
   other, so as to be diverging, as well as being angularly
   inclined to hinge 60 and to each other, as shown more
   particularly in figures 9 and 10.
15
   Another form of the hinge will now be described.                A
   modified form of the double hinge is illustrated in figure
   20.  Modified double hinge, generally denoted as 160, is
   provided with two sockets 162 in side by side relationship
20 to one another.  Each socket 162 is provided with an open
   sided aperture 172 in which the openings in the aperture
   172 are oppositely inclined to one another so as to be
   diverging as shown in figure 20.   Each socket 162 is
   formed with a relatively shorter outer wall 168 and a
25 relatively longer inner wall 170.   The shape of apertures
   172 is a substantially oval or elliptical shape having a
   minor axis extending through the open side of aperture
   hundred and 72 and a major axis extending perpendicularly
   to the minor axis between shorter outer wall 168 and
30 longer inner wall 170.  By changing the shape of aperture
   172 to be elongate the size of the aperture is made larger
   by elongating the profile of the inner walls forming the
   aperture.  The change of shape to being oval or elliptical
   allows for variations in the width of the interlocking
35 panels being received within the oval or elliptical shaped
   apertures to assist in installation of the barrier.
   Additionally, the change in shape allows greater
                                             9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                                -   29
   manufacturing tolerances to take into account coatings
   applied to the various components during manufacture to
   assist in installation of the barrier.
 5 Hinge 160 has a centrally located substantially
   cylindrical bore 166 to assist in mounting the hinge to
   the barrier during installation of the barrier.                  In one
   form the size of bore 166 is selected so as to receive a
   suitably sized fastener therein, such as for example a No.
10 14 screw.
   One form of the panel   for forming one of the barrier
   components of barrier   10 will    now be described with
   particular reference to figure 11 which form of the panel
15 is a half-width panel or starter panel 80 for mounting to
   adjacent support post 12 for facilitating compact storage
   of barrier 10 when in the opened or retracted
   configuration.    Half-width panel, generally denoted as 80,
   includes a generally planar central section 82 having an
20 obverse face on one side and a reverse face on the
   opposite side, and a generally cylindrical rod 84 located
   along either edge at the sides of central section 82.                           It
   is to be noted that rod 84 forms one part of the coupling
   for coupling the panel to the hinge.       Rod 84 is received
25 in socket 42 of hinge 40 for facilitating hinged movement
   of panel 80 with respect to post 12, and more particularly
   with respect to hinge 40.      It is to be noted that half
   width panel 80 is connected to post 12 by hinge 40,
   particularly when provided with an oval or elliptical
30 shaped socket, so as to allow the barrier when in the open
   configuration to occupy a reduced space since half width
   panel 80 can be rotated back against the side of post 12
   due to offset opening 59 of hinge 40 which, in turn,
   allows the full width panels 86 to adopt a generally
35 superposed substantially parallel position in contiguous
   relationship with each other when barrier 10 is in the
   folded configuration such as for example as shown in
                                                 9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              - 30
   figure 6.  If half-width panel 80 is not connected
   directly to hinge 40, but rather a full-width panel 86 is
   connected directly to hinge 40, the amount of extension of
   the full width panel from the plane of post 12 would be
 5 about double the amount of extension of the half width
   panel so that the space occupied by the full width panels
   in folded configuration would extend further outwardly
   from one side of the plane of post 12 and thus, barrier 10
   would occupy a greater space, particularly extending to
10 one side only of post 12, thereby obstructing the entrance
   to the secured area to a greater extent than if a half
   width panel 80 is used.  Thus, the use of a half-width
   panel allows the barrier, when in the open configuration,
   to extend about equally on either side of the plane of
15 movement of barrier 10 so as to occupy a reduced space as
   shown more particularly in figure 6.
   Another form of the panel of barrier 10 will now be
   described with reference to figure 12.  This form of panel
20 is a full-width panel, generally denoted as 86, and forms
   the majority of interconnected panels of barrier 10,                  as
   shown more particularly in figure 1 and in figure 6.
   Panel 86 is provided with a central section 88 having an
   obverse face on one side and a reverse face on the other
25 side.  Panel 86 is symmetrical about the central
   longitudinal axis.  A generally cylindrical solid rod 90
   is formed as the edge of panel 86 along either
   longitudinal side of panel 86 to form part of the coupling
   interconnecting panels 86 to hinges 60 by rod 90 being
30 received within sockets 62 for allowing hinged movement
   thereabout as the central longitudinal axis of rod 90 is
   coincident with central longitudinal axis of socket 62.
   A further embodiment of the panels forming barrier 10 will
35 now be described with particular reference to figures 13
   to 16.  The further embodiment of the panel is a modified
   full-with panel, generally denoted as 92, which is similar
                                            9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

   to panel 86 but additionally is provided with a receiver
   for use in connecting barrier 10 to track 14 in use,
   typically using a trolley or similar.
 5 Panel 92 includes a first segment 94 located towards one
   side thereof and a second segment 96 located towards the
   other side thereof.  A cylindrical solid rod 98 extends
   along the outer edge of each segment 94,   96 for hingedly
   coupling panel 92 to socket 62 of hinge 60 by rod 98 being
10 received through the opening of socket 62 to be contained
   coaxially within socket 62.   A receiver, in the form of a
   generally cylindrical bore 100 extends longitudinally
   along the central lengthwise extending axis of panel 92
   from the upper end in use to the lower end in use.                  Bore
15 100 is for receiving a generally hollow cylindrical tube
   102 therein extending for about the entire length of panel
   92. A trolley, such as for example, similar to trolley 18
   of post 12 is mounted to the upper end of tube 102 so that
   barrier 10 can be additionally supported by panel 92 being
20 suspended from track 14 by means of trolley 18,
   particularly been supported at spaced apart locations as
   trolley 18 travels along track 14 when barrier 10 is being
   moved between the opened and closed configurations.                    The
   trolley located at the upper end of panel 92, can take any
25 suitable or convenient form.   In one form, the trolley is
   the same as or similar to trolley 18 of post 12.                However,
   modifications to the trolley are possible depending upon
   the precise nature of barrier 10 and/or the location of
   panel 92 within barrier 10,  and the location in which
30 barrier 10 is installed.
   In one form the lower end of shaft 26 of trolley 18 is
   provided with a threaded portion for being threadingly
   received in the upper end of tube 102, which is provided
35 with a complementary threaded portion for cooperative
   engagement with each other.
                                             9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                              -   32
   The lower end in use of bore 100 is provided with a
   counter bore 104 or similar section for receiving therein
   a suitable threaded fastener 106 for threadingly engaging
   with a complementary threaded portion provided at the
 5 lower end in use of tube 102.     Counter bore 104 is of a
   size and profile corresponding to the size and profile of
   head 108 of fastener 106 so that when fastener 106 is
   connected to tube 102, head 108 is located flush with the
   lower end of bore 100 of panel 92 so as to not extend
10 outwardly as a projection or protrusion from the lower
   edge of barrier 10, thereby allowing movement of panel 92
   when barrier 10 is moved.
   Operation of one form of barrier 10 will now be described
15 in detail.  When barrier 10 is installed to extend between
   post 12 at one end and a similar post 12 at the other end,
   similar to the configuration shown in figures 1 to 4,
   hinge 40 is fixedly connected to post 12 by whatever form
   of rib 44 is provided on hinge 40. Rib 44 of hinge 40 is
20 securely received in groove 28 of post 12 and rod 84 along
   one edge of half-width panel 80 is connected to hinge 40
   through socket 42.  Rod 84 along the other edge of panel
   80, is received in socket 62 of hinge 60 located
   intermediate adjacent first panel 86 so that panel 80 is
25 connected to first panel 86 via hinge 60. First panel 86
   in turn is connected to another panel 86 by hinge 60
   interconnecting two adjacent panels 86 to one another,
   which other panel 86 in turn is connected to modified
   panel 92 via a further hinge 60 and so on in a regularly
30 repeating arrangement over the length of barrier 10 from
   one side to the opposite side.
   When barrier 10 is moved to the open configuration such
   that the barrier is in the retracted or folded
35 configuration panels 86, 92 hingedly move with respect to
   each other to adopt a folded configuration as shown more
   particularly in figure 6.    It is to be noted that the
                                               9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

                               - 33
   angular inclination or orientation of sockets 62 of hinges
   60 allow panels 86, 92 to be aligned in substantially
   parallel slightly spaced apart relationship to each other
   to extend equally on either side of a centreline through
 5 barrier 10 or aligned with the path of movement of barrier
   10 to adopt a compact configuration or condition, as shown
   more particularly in figure 6.   Having half width panel 80
   connected directly to hinge 40 contributes to the compact
   arrangement of the panels being in substantially parallel
10 slightly spaced apart relationship to each other since one
   face of panel 80 is able to move sufficiently because of
   the short length of short side 56 of socket 42 to allow
   panel 80 to extend almost substantially perpendicularly or
   transversely to the path of movement or line of barrier 10
15 thus allowing barrier 10 to adopt a folded configuration
   in which all of the panels are in substantially slightly
   inclined   interconnected relationship to one another.
   One form of the barrier will now be described with
20 reference to figures 20 to 22.   This form of barrier,
   generally denoted as 110, includes starter hinge 140
   fixedly connected to support post 12 at one end of the
   barrier.   One side of starter hinge 140 which is the side
   containing rib 144 is received within a complementary
25 shaped groove 28 at the side of post 12 facing starter
   hinge 140.   A first edge 84 of half width panel 80 is
   pivotally received in opening 159 of starter hinge 140 for
   retaining this side of half width panel 80.         The second
   edge 84 of half width panel 80 is pivotally received
30 within one of the openings 172 of intermediate or double
   hinge 160.
   The other of the openings 172 of double hinge 160
   pivotally receives the first edge 90 of full width panel
35 86.  The second edge 90 of the same full width panel 86 is
   pivotally received in one of openings 172 of another
   double hinge 160.   A first edge 90 of the next full width
                                             9799451_1 (GHMatters) P103508.AU.1 19/12/17

   panel 86 is pivotally received in the other of openings
   172 of this next double hinge 160.  The second edge 90 of
   the same full width panel 86 is pivotally received in one
