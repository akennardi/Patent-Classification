                   MOTOR SYSTEM FOR DUAL VOLTAGE DEVICES
   BACKGROUND
   [0001]       The invention relates to power tools, and more particularly to dual
   voltage power tools. It is often desirable for power tools, small appliances, and other
 5 devices that include an electric motor to have the option to operate either with a battery
   or connected to an electrical outlet. These "corded/cordless" products are attractive
   because they do not have the limitations of a single power source. A corded tool for
   example, is not portable and cannot be used in places where electrical outlets are not
   available. On the other hand, a cordless tool has a limited runtime and may have lower
10 performance than a corded device.
   [0001a]      JP810329051 relates to a screw tightening machine and control method
   therefor. According to a machine translation of the abstract of this document the screw
   tightening machine is provided with a first motor, a second motor, a driver bit
   connected to the rotating shaft of the second motor, and an electromagnetic clutch
15 disposed between the first motor and the driver bit. The first motor and the second
   motor are disposed in series coaxially, and the electromagnetic clutch is disposed
   between the rotating shaft of the first motor and the rotating shaft of the second motor.
   The shell diameter of the screw tightening machine body can be decreased, so it is
   possible for a worker to hold the screw tightening machine easily, thereby improving
20 workability.
   [0001b]      EP1043829 relates to a hybrid AC/DC motor. According to the abstract of
   this document there is provided a motor for a power tool adapted to be powered by
   either and AC power source or a DC power source. The motor includes a permanent
   magnet field having an armature disposed within the field. The armature includes a
25 shaft having a DC commutator disposed at one end of the shaft. The DC commutator is
   coupled to a first armature winding. An AC commutator is disposed coaxially over a
   portion of the DC commutator and is coupled to a second armature winding. A first pair
   of brushes are disposed on the DC commutator for coupling power from a DC power
   source to the first armature winding. A second pair of brushes couple rectified AC
30 power to the second armature winding. A power module including an AC/DC selector
                                                                   9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

                                               -  2
   switch enables a user to select where the AC or DC power is to be used to power the
   tool.
   [0001c]       US8076873 relates to hybrid outdoor power equipment. According to the
   abstract of this document the hybrid power equipment comprises a user-selectable
 5 power selection switch for switching between DC or AC power, a boost and conserve
   feature for increasing speed of the working elements as necessary, and a motor or a
   plurality of motors for moving working elements. Running the OPE at the conserve
   setting prolongs battery pack duration per charge. The motor may comprise a dual coil
   commutator configuration. Power supply and control systems allow the user to select
10 operation of the plurality of motors or dual coil commutators in either series or parallel
   configuration depending on the power source.

                 a second motor disposed in the housing and coupled to the first motor such
   that the first motor drives the output shaft and does not drive the second motor when in
20 a first power mode, and the second motor drives the first motor and the output shaft
   when in a second power mode; and
                 a battery electrically coupled to the first motor such that the battery powers
   the first motor in the first power mode, and,
                 wherein the first motor charges the battery in the second power mode.

   supported by the housing for rotation about an axis. The power tool further includes a
   first motor disposed in the housing and a second motor disposed in the housing and
   coupled to the first motor. The first motor drives the output shaft and does not drive the
                                                                      9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

   supply to rotate the tool element. A second motor is selectively rotationally coupled to
   the first motor and the tool element and operable in response to an AC power supply to
   rotate the first motor and the tool element. The power tool further includes a coupling
   mechanism disposed between the second motor and the first motor. The coupling
10 mechanism is operable in a first mode to decouple the rotation of the first motor and the
   second motor when DC power is supplied to the first motor, and operable in a second
   mode to couple the rotation of the first motor and the second motor when AC power is
   supplied to the second motor.
   [0004]        In one form, there is a power tool including a housing and an output shaft
15 supported by the housing for rotation about an axis. The power tool also includes a
   battery terminal selectively operable to receive a DC power supply from a battery and a
   receptacle selectively operable to receive an AC power supply from an AC power
   source. The power tool further includes a motor. The motor is operable in a first power
   mode, in response to receipt of the DC power supply, to rotatably drive the output shaft.
20 The motor is also operable in a second power mode, in response to receipt of the AC
   power supply, to rotatably drive the output shaft. The power tool also includes a
   mechanical interlock movable between a first position in which the interlock inhibits
   the flow of the AC power supply to the motor and a second position in which the
   interlock inhibits the flow of the DC power supply to the motor.

 5 [0019]        Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be
   understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of
   construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description
   or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments
   and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be
10 understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of
   description and should not be regarded as limiting.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0020]        FIG. 1 illustrates a power tool according to an embodiment of the
   invention. As shown in the drawings for the purposes of illustration, the invention is
15 embodied in a string trimmer 10; however, the features of the invention described
   herein are equally applicable to other types of power tools and electric appliances.
   [0021]        The string trimmer 10 includes a shaft 14 having a rear handle 18 at its
   upper end and a forward handle 22 spaced from the rear handle 18 to facilitate two
   handed operation of the string trimmer 10. The forward handle 22 includes a flange 26
20 operable to permit adjustment of the position of the forward handle 22 on the shaft 14
   and/or the orientation of the forward handle 22 relative to the shaft 14. In other
   embodiments, the forward handle 22 may be fixed to the shaft 14 or integrally formed
   as a part of the shaft 14.
   [0022]        With continued reference to FIG. 1, the shaft 14 comprises an upper tube 30
25 and a lower tube 34 in a telescoping arrangement. A locking mechanism 38 is disposed
                                                                     9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

                                               -  6
   on an intermediate portion of the shaft 14, circumscribing the interface between the
   upper and lower tubes 30, 34. The locking mechanism 38 is rotatable in a first direction
   to permit telescopic movement of the upper tube 30 and the lower tube 34, thereby
   permitting extension or contraction of the shaft 14. The locking mechanism 38 is
 5 rotatable in an opposite direction to inhibit telescopic movement of the upper tube 30
   and the lower tube 34, thereby locking the shaft 14 at a particular length. In the
   illustrated embodiment, the locking mechanism 38 is configured as a collar; however,
   the locking mechanism 38 may take any form, such as a cam lever or a notch and detent
   system. Alternatively, the shaft 14 may be formed as a single piece and may not be
10 adjustable.
   [00231        At its lower end, the string trimmer 10 includes a head portion 42 that
   includes a housing 46 and a string hub 50 disposed on the underside of the housing and
   defining an axis 54 (FIG. 1). The string hub 50 may include an internal bobbin or spool
   (not shown) and may be configured for bump-feed, fixed line, or automatic
15 feed operation. Alternatively, the string hub 50 may have any other suitable
   configuration. A length of flexible line extends radially outward from the string hub 50
   to form a cutting element 58. A cowl 62 partially surrounds a lower periphery of the
   housing 46 to shield an operator of the string trimmer 10 from the cutting element 58
   and any debris produced during operation.
20 [0024]        With reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the head portion 46 includes a first motor
   66 supported by the housing 46 and aligned with the axis 54 of the string hub 50. The
   first motor 66 has an output shaft 70 that extends through both ends of the motor 66 and
   that is coupled to the string hub 50 to transmit torque to the string hub 50 (FIG. 3). In
   the illustrated embodiment, the first motor 66 is a direct current (DC) motor, such as a
25 brushed or brushless permanent-magnet DC motor. The first motor 66 is configured to
   receive power from a rechargeable battery 74 (e.g.,lithium-ion, nickel
   metal hydride, nickel-cadmium, etc.) (FIG. 2). The head portion 42 also includes a
   second motor 78 supported by the housing 46 and arranged coaxially with the first
                                                                    9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

   motor 66. Alternatively, the second motor 78 may be offset from the first motor 66
   and/or oriented at an angle relative to the axis 54. In addition, some constructions may
   include one or both of the first motor 66 and the second motor 78 that is arranged in an
   offset position with respect to the axis 54 or that are arranged at an oblique angle with
 5 respect to the axis 54. In the illustrated embodiment, the second motor 78 is an
   alternating current (AC) motor, such as a universal AC motor or an AC induction
   motor. The second motor 78 is configured to receive power from a high-voltage, AC
   power source 82, such as a conventional wall outlet. In other embodiments, the second
   motor 78 may be a DC motor and the string trimmer 10 may include a rectifier circuit
10 (not shown) to convert AC power from the high-voltage power source 82 to DC power
   usable by the second motor 78.
   [0025]        The second motor 78 includes an output shaft 86 selectively coupled for
   rotation to the output shaft 70 of the first motor 66 via a coupling member 90. The
   coupling member 90 may be any structure operable to selectively couple the output
15 shaft 86 of the second motor 78 to the output shaft 70 of the first motor 66, such as a
   friction clutch, a centrifugal clutch, a roller clutch, and the like. Specific embodiments
   of the coupling member 90 are described in detail herein.
   [00261        With reference to FIG. 2, the string trimmer 10 is capable of operating in a
   first power mode (i.e., a cordless mode) in which the first motor 66 draws power from
20 the battery 74. In the first power mode, the coupling member 90 permits relative
   rotation between the output shaft 70 of the first motor 66 and the output shaft 86 of the
   second motor 78, decoupling the first motor 66 from any rotational drag associated with
   the second motor 78. Accordingly, in the first power mode, the first motor 66 need only
   produce enough torque to drive the string hub 50 at a suitable working speed.
25 [00271        With continued reference to FIG. 2, the string trimmer 10 is also capable of
   operating in a second power mode (i.e., a corded mode) in which the second motor 78
   draws power from the AC power source 82 through a power cable 84. In the second
                                                                      9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

                                                -   8
   power mode, the coupling member 90 couples the output shaft 86 of the second motor
   78 with the output shaft 70 of the first motor 66 for rotation. The second motor 78
   drives the string hub 50 through the first motor 66. Accordingly, to overcome the added
   rotational drag of the first motor 66, the second motor 78 must produce more torque
 5 than the first motor 66 produces in the first power mode in order to drive the string hub
   50 at the suitable working speed.
   [00281        In the illustrated embodiment, the string trimmer 10 includes a battery
   charging circuit 94 operable to recharge the battery 74 when the string trimmer 10 is
   operated in the second power mode (FIG. 2). Because the output shaft 70 of the first
10 motor 66 is rotated by the second motor 78 in the second power mode, the first motor
   66 may act as a DC power supply (i.e., a generator) to supply a charging current to the
   battery 74. In other embodiments, the first motor 66 may not act as a DC power supply,
   and a rectifier circuit (not shown) may be included to recharge the battery 74 directly
   from the AC power supply 82. In still other embodiments, the string trimmer 10 may
15 not include any battery charging circuitry 94, and the battery 72 may be recharged using
   an external charging apparatus (not shown).
   [0029]        Specific embodiments of the coupling member 90 will now be described. In
   the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 3-5, the coupling member 90 takes the form of a
   clutch mechanism 98 including a driving member 102 and a driven member 106. The
20 driven member 106 is fixed to the output shaft 70 of the first motor 66 (e.g., by a press
   fit, key, snap ring, pin, etc.) such that rotation of the driven member 106 corresponds
   with rotation of the output shaft 70 and, therefore, with rotation of the string hub 50.
   The driven member 106 includes a plurality of recesses 110 shaped to receive a
   corresponding plurality of teeth 114 projecting from an axial surface of the driving
25 member 102. The clutch mechanism 98 includes an externally-threadedtube 122,
   (referred to herein as a lead screw 122), that is fixed to the output shaft 86 of the second
   motor 78 by any suitable means (e.g., press-fit, key, snap ring, pin, etc.). The driving
   member 102 includes internal threads 126 corresponding to the external threads of the
                                                                     9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

                                                 -  9
   lead screw 122 such that relative rotation between the lead screw 122 and the driving
   member 102 translates the driving member 102 along the axis 54. Translation of the
   driving member 102 toward a disengaged position of the clutch mechanism 98 is
   bounded by a shoulder 130 of the second motor 78. Translation of the driving member
 5 102 toward an engaged position of the clutch mechanism 98 is bounded by the driven
   member 106. The clutch mechanism also includes a washer 134 secured to the output
   shaft 86 by a retaining ring 138 (e.g., a snap ring). A biasing member 142 is constrained
   between the washer 134 and the driving member 102 to bias the driving member 102
   towards the disengaged position of the clutch mechanism 98.
10 [00301         FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate the disengaged and the engaged positions of the
   clutch mechanism 98, respectively. In the engaged position of the clutch mechanism 98
   (shown in FIG. 4), the teeth 114 are engaged with the recesses 110 to couple the driving
   member 102 and the driven member 106 for rotation. In the disengaged position of the
   clutch mechanism 98 (shown in FIG. 3), the driving member 102 is axially spaced from
15 the driven member 106, decoupling the first and second motors 66, 78 such that relative
   rotation between the driving member 102 and the driven member 106 is permitted.
   [00311         FIG. 6 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the coupling member 90. In
   this embodiment, the coupling member 90 takes the form of a one-way bearing 146
   (i.e., a roller clutch). The one-way bearing 146 includes an outer race 150 coupled to
20 the output shaft 86 of the second motor 78, and an inner race (not shown) coupled to the
   output shaft 70 of the first motor 66. The output shafts 70, 86 may be coupled to
   the one-way bearing 146 in any suitable manner, such as with cooperating splines,
   a press-fit, a key and keyway, conventional fasteners, and the like. In other
   embodiments, the outer race 150 may be coupled to the output shaft 70 of the first
25 motor 66, and the inner race may be coupled to the output shaft 86 of the second motor
   78.
                                                                    9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

                                               - 10
   [00321       A plurality of rollers (not shown) is disposed in angled channels (not
   shown) between the inner race and the outer race 150. The rollers and channels are
   configured such that the inner race may slip relative to the outer race 150 in a first
   direction (e.g., clockwise), but the rollers bind the inner race and the outer race 150 in a
 5 second direction (e.g., counterclockwise). The selective slipping/binding of the one
   way bearing 146 couples the output shaft 86 of the second motor 78 with the output
   shaft 70 of the first motor 66 for rotation in the first direction and allows relative
   rotation between the two output shafts 70, 86 in the second direction.
   [00331       In operation, a user may desire to operate the string trimmer 10 in the first
10 power mode (i.e., the cordless mode) when no power outlets are conveniently available.
   The first motor 66 draws DC power from the battery 74 in order to provide torque to the
   string hub 50 and rotate the cutting element 58 at a sufficient speed to cut down grass or
   other vegetation. The coupling member 90 permits relative rotation between the output
   shaft 70 of the first motor 66 and the output shaft 86 of the second motor 78, decoupling
15 the first motor 66 from any resistance associated with the second motor 78 and
   optimizing battery life.
   [0034]       When the battery 74 becomes depleted or when a power outlet is otherwise
   available, the user may desire to operate the string trimmer 10 in the second power
   mode (i.e., the corded mode). The second motor 78 draws power from the AC power
20 source 82, and the coupling member 90 couples the output shaft 86 of the second motor
   78 with the output shaft 70 of the first motor 66 for rotation. The second motor 78
   provides torque to the string hub 50 through the coupling member 90 and the output
   shaft 70 of the first motor 66. When driven by the second motor 78, the first motor 66
   may act as a DC power supply, to generate power through the battery charging circuit
25 94 in order to recharge the battery 74.
   [00351       FIG. 7 illustrates a string trimmer 1010 according to another embodiment
   of the invention. This embodiment employs much of the same structure as the
                                                                      9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

   embodiments of the string trimmer 10 described above in connection with FIGS. 1
   6. Accordingly, the following description focuses primarily upon the structure and
   features that are different than the embodiments described above in connection with
   FIGS. 1-6. Reference should be made to the description above in connection with
 5 FIGS. 1-6 for additional information regarding the structure and features, and possible
   alternatives to the structure and features of the string trimmer 1010 illustrated in FIG. 7
   and described below. Structure and features of the embodiment shown in FIG. 7 that
   correspond to structure and features of the embodiments of FIGS. 1-6 are designated
   hereinafter in the 1000 series of reference numbers.
10 [00361       The string trimmer 1010 includes a shaft 1014 having a rear handle 1018 at
   its upper end and a forward handle 1022 spaced from the rear handle 1018 to
   facilitate two-handed operation of the string trimmer 1010. At its lower end, the string
   trimmer 1010 includes a head portion 1042 that includes a housing 1046 and a string
   hub 1050 disposed on the underside of the housing and defining an axis 1054 (FIG. 7).
15 A length of flexible line extends radially outward from the string hub 1050 to form a
   cutting element 1058.
   [00371       With reference to FIG. 8, the head portion 1042 includes a motor 1154
   supported by the housing 1046 and aligned with the axis 1054 of the string hub 1050.
   The motor 1154 has an output shaft 1158 that is coupled to the string hub 1050 to
20 transmit torque to the string hub 1050. In the illustrated embodiment, the motor 1154 is
   configured as a dual-commutator motor, including a DC commutator (not shown)
   associated with a DC armature (not shown), and a rectified AC commutator (not shown)
   associated with an AC armature (not shown). Accordingly, the motor 1154 is able to
   selectively receive power from a rechargeable battery 1074 or from a high-voltage, AC
25 power source 1082, such as a conventional wall outlet. Of course, the string trimmer
   1010 could employ the two-motor arrangement of the string trimmer 10 of Figs. 1-6 if
   desired. Alternatively, the string trimmer 10 could employ the motor 1154 of the string
   trimmer 1010 of Figs. 7-13.
                                                                    9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

   [00381        The string trimmer 1010 is capable of operating in a first power mode (i.e.,
   a cordless mode) in which the motor 1154 draws power from the battery 1074. With
   reference to FIG. 10, the rear handle 1018 of the string trimmer 1010 includes a battery
   terminal 1162 disposed within a battery receiving portion 1166 of the rear handle 1018.
 5 The battery 1074 is electrically connected to the battery terminal 1162 when the string
   trimmer 1010 is operated in the first power mode. The string trimmer 1010 is also
   capable of operating in a second power mode (i.e., a corded mode) in which the motor
   1154 draws power from the AC power source 1082 through a power cable 1084. The
   rear handle 1018 includes a receptacle 1170 for receiving the power cable 1084. The
10 power cable 1084 (and the AC power source 1082) is electrically connected to the
   receptacle when the string trimmer 1010 is operated in the second power mode.
   [0039]       FIG. 9 illustrates a wiring diagram for the motor 1154. The motor 1154
   includes high voltage terminals 1174a, 1174b electrically connected to a first set of
   brushes (not shown) associated with the rectified AC commutator. The motor 1154 also
15 includes low voltage terminals 1178a, 1178b electrically connected to a second set of
   brushes (not shown) associated with the DC commutator. A first power circuit 1182
   electrically connects live and neutral poles 11 86a, 11 86b of the receptacle 1170 to the
   high voltage terminals 1 174a, 1 174b of the motor 1154 through a full-bridge rectifier
   1190. The rectifier 1190 converts AC current supplied by the AC power source 1082
20 into a DC ripple current. A power conditioner (e.g., a capacitor; not shown) may be
   included to attenuate the amplitude of the ripple. A second power circuit 1194
   electrically connects positive and negative poles 1 198a, 1 198b of the battery terminal
   1162 to the low voltage terminals 1 178a, 1 178b of the motor 1154. The second power
   circuit 1194 may include a pair of diodes 1202a, 1202b configured to protect the battery
25 1074 from any backflow current.
   [0040]       With continued reference to FIG. 9, the first power circuit 1182 includes a
   first switch 1206 movable between a first position (i.e., a closed position) connecting
   the live pole 1 186a to the power circuit 1182 and a second position (i.e., an open
                                                                    9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

                                              -  13
   position) disconnecting the live pole 11 86a from the power circuit 1182. The first
   switch 1206 is configured as a normally open switch and moves to the closed position
   in response to the AC power source 1082 being connected to the receptacle 1170.
   Similarly, the second power circuit 1194 includes a second switch 1210 movable
 5 between a first position (i.e., a closed position) connecting the positive pole 1 198a to
   the power circuit 1194 and a second position (i.e., an open position) disconnecting the
   positive pole 1 198a from the power circuit 1194. The second switch 1210 is configured
   as a normally open switch and moves to the closed position in response to the battery
   1074 being connected to the battery terminal 1162. The first switch 1206 and the
10 second switch 1210 are synchronized, such that the position of the first switch 1206
   corresponds with the position of the second switch 1210. Accordingly, an electrical
   connection between either the AC power source 1082 and the receptacle 1170 or the
   battery 1074 and the battery terminal 1162 triggers both the first switch 1206 and the
   second switch 1210 to move to the closed position. In another arrangement, the
15 switches 1206, 1210 are connected to a trigger or other user actuated mechanism such
   that power can only be delivered when the user actuates the trigger or other mechanism.
   In this arrangement, the user' s actuation of the tigger or other mechanism closes both
   switches 1206, 1210 while the release of the trigger opens the switches 1206, 1210.
   [0041]        With reference to FIGS. 10 and 12, the rear handle 1018 includes a
20 mechanical interlock 1214 movable between a first position (FIG. 10) in which the
   interlock 1214 physically blocks access to the receptacle 1170 and a second position
   (FIG. 12) in which the interlock 1214 physically blocks access to the battery terminal
   1162. The interlock 1214 allows only one of the battery 1074 and the AC power source
   1082 to be connected to the string trimmer 1010 at any given time. Accordingly, the
25 string trimmer 1010 is operable in the cordless mode only when the interlock 1214 is in
   the first position and in the corded mode only when the interlock 1214 is in the second
   position. In other embodiments, the interlock 1214 may be configured as an electrical
   interlock, such as a switch.
                                                                    9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

                                             -  14
   [00421       With reference to FIGS. 11 and 13, the interlock 1214 is configured as a
   generally flat door, slidable within a track 1218 formed in the rear handle 1018. A first
   detent 1222 (FIG. 11) and a second detent 1226 (FIG. 13) project from the track 1218 in
   positions corresponding with the first and second positions of the interlock 1214,
 5 respectively. A third detent 1230 projects from a surface 1234 of the interlock 1214 and
   is configured to engage with the first detent 1222 when the interlock 1214 is in the first
   position and to engage with the second detent 1226 when the interlock 1214 is in the
   second position. Interference between the third detent 1230 and the first detent 1222
   provides tactile feedback that the interlock 1214 has reached the first position and
10 inhibits the interlock 1214 from inadvertently moving out of the first position.
   Similarly, interference between the third detent 1230 and the second detent 1226
   provides tactile feedback that the interlock 1214 has reached the second position and
   inhibits the interlock 1214 from inadvertently moving out of the second position. In
   other embodiments, any number or configuration of detents may be used. Still other
15 embodiments may not include any detents.
   [00431       With reference to FIGS. 10 and 12, a plurality of raised ribs 1238 extends
   from the surface 1234 of the interlock 1214 to facilitate manipulation of the interlock
   1214 between the first and second positions. In other embodiments, a handle, lever, or
   button may be included to manipulate the interlock 1214 between the first and second
20 positions. In still other embodiments, the interlock 1214 may be automatically movable
   between the first and second positions in response to insertion or removal of the battery
   1074 and/or the power cord 1084.
   [0044]       In operation, a user may desire to operate the string trimmer 1010 in the
   first power mode (i.e., the cordless mode) when no power outlets are conveniently
25 available. The user first positions the mechanical interlock 1214 in the first position to
   permit an electrical connection between the battery 1074 and the battery terminal 1162.
   In response to the electrical connection between the battery 1074 and the battery
   terminal 1162, the first and second switches 1206, 1210 move to the closed position,
                                                                    9803106_1 (GHMatters) P95685.AU.1 20/12/17

   power from the battery 1074 in order to provide torque to the string hub 1050 and rotate
   the cutting element 1058 at a sufficient speed to cut down grass or other vegetation.
   [0045]        When the battery 1074 becomes depleted or when a power outlet is
 5 otherwise available, the user may desire to operate the string trimmer 1010 in the
   second power mode (i.e., the corded mode). The user disconnects the battery 1074 from
   the string trimmer 1010, and the first and second switches 1206, 1210 move to the open
   position. The user then positions the mechanical interlock 1214 in the second position
   to permit access to the receptacle 1170. Next, the user plugs the power cable 1084 into
10 the receptacle 1170 to provide an electrical connection between the AC power source
   1082 and the receptacle 1170. The first and second switches 1206, 1210 move to the
   closed position, electrically connecting the AC power source 1082 to the motor 1154.
   The motor 1154 draws power from the AC power source 1082 in order to provide
   torque to the string hub 1050 and rotate the cutting element 1058 at a sufficient speed to
15 cut down grass or other vegetation.
