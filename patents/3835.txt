                                    ABSTRACT
The redundancy controller is a device that is placed between a primary and
a secondary control gear and selects the secondary control gear upon
failure of the primary control gear.
Failure of the primary control gear is deemed to be an output failure, where it
is unable to supply the LED source with the necessary signals, voltage and
current, to operate it successfully.
The method of switching between control gear and ensuring that each
control gear element is completely isolated when not in use can be
achieved using mechanical relays, requiring 4 Pole, Double Throw, contacts
or possibly with two series connected 2 Pole, Double Throw, relays or even
with four series connected 1 Pole, Double Throw contact relays. The use of
other electronic switching devices may also be utilised with a trade off on
cost and reliability, such as solid state relays.
Mechanical relays have long-life switching cycles in the order of over 100,000
operations and are not prone to damage due to electrical surge. The
implementation of a redundancy device must be such that the MTBF is far
greater than that of the control gear it is switching.

                                        Revision 1
                                   DESCRIPTION
The redundancy controller is a device that is placed between a primary and
a secondary control gear and selects the secondary control gear upon
failure of the primary control gear.
Background Information
Lighting fixtures utilised in Commercial, Industrial and residential installations
commonly consist of two key components, a light source and control gear.
The light source may be that of gas discharge, tungsten halogen, flurorescent
or new high efficacy solid state lighting sources known as Light Emitting
Diodes, LED.
The control gear may be passive or electronic depending on the specifics of
the light source it is controlling. The control gear provides the appropriate
signals, voltage and current, to operate the specific light source. Each light
source requires different signals for control and are usually designed
specifically for an individual light source.
Typically, in a lighting fixture the lifetime is determined by the failure of one or
both of the components, and is usually specified on the basis of the
component with the shortest lifetime, or mean-time before failure, MTBF.
Traditional light sources, not being LED, have been readily accepted at the
limiting factor in lighting fixture life-time and are normally replaceable by an
appropriate installer. The control gear in traditional fixtures in nearly all cases
will outlast many lighting source changes over the period of a fixtures usual
life.
In application were cost of replacement has been a factor in traditional
lighting fixtures, some light sources were fitted with redundancy or a
secondary light source to ensure long-life performance and time between
maintenance intervals. However, these dual element lighting sources are
expensive and in some cases required specialised control gear.
With the improvement in efficacy of White Light LED sources, these have
taken a precedence in many market segments for lighting due to superior
performance of the light source over time. This makes LED based light fixtures

near maintenance free when it comes to requirements to replace the light
source and in many cases the lighting fixture containing the LED is non
serviceable and sealed. However, the control gear utilised for LED is usually
based on an electronic design that is now the limiting factor on lifetime of an
LED light fixture.
Electronic control gear usually consists of circuitry to reduce the online mains
incoming power to a suitable drive for the LED light source and is dependent
on the configuration of the LED light source and other factors in the design.
The electronic circuits contain many components and it is usually those
components subject to degradation in performance due to heat that set the
MTBF. Careful design of a light fixture containing LED can ensure optimal life
time by underrunning or limiting the control gear to reduce effective heat
within the lighting system, this impacts however on the overall lumen output
of the fixture and as such may negate energy savings as more fixtures will be
required in a lighting design.
The method of redundancy in a lighting fixture is not new, as mentioned
above in the application within a light source having a secondary lighting
element.
However, in an LED system, the redundancy is pointless for the light source as
it's useful life is already beyond the fixtures mechanical design life. Hence the
implementation of a redundant control gear device that can effectively
activate secondary control gear component upon failure of the primary
control gear will effectively extend the useful life of the LED light fixture by
nearly double.
Scope of Invention
The redundancy controller is a device that is placed between a primary and
a secondary control gear and selects the secondary control gear upon
failure of the primary control gear.
Failure of the primary control gear is deemed to be an output failure, where it
is unable to supply the LED source with the necessary signals, voltage and
current, to operate it successfully.
The method of switching between control gear and ensuring that each
control gear element is completely isolated when not in use can be
achieved using mechanical relays, requiring 4 Pole, Double Throw, contacts
or possibly with two series connected 2 Pole, Double Throw, relays or even
with four series connected 1 Pole, Double Throw contact relays. The use of
other electronic switching devices may also be utilised with a trade off on
cost and reliability, such as solid state relays.

Mechanical relays have long-life switching cycles in the order of over 100,000
operations and are not prone to damage due to electrical surge. The
implementation of a redundancy device must be such that the MTBF is far
greater than that of the control gear it is switching.

Functional Description of a Method
A 4 Pole relay is the key component utilised in the design to provide the
switching function between the primary and secondary control gear. The
relay DC coil is feed by a shunt resistor string from the output of the primary
driver and is selected such that the resistors form a voltage divider with the
series relay and values calculated to ensure the correct operating current
and voltage for the relay coil. The capacitor element C] across the relay
ensures a clean switching of the relay contacts.
The 4  Pole, Double Throw relay has the contacts as follows;
    -  Normally Open ] - NO]
    -  Common1-CM1
    -  Normally Closed 1 - NC]
    -  Normally Open ] - N02
    -  Common 2- CM2
    -  Normally Closed 1 - NC2
    -  Normally Open 3 - N03
    -  Common 3- CM3
    -  Normally Closed 3 - NC3
    -  Normally Open 4 - N04
    -  Common 4- CM4
    -  Normally Closed 4 - NC4
An incoming switched Active (mains) is connected to the NC4 contacts of
the relay and the permanent Neutral (mains) is connected to the NC3
contacts of the relay. This connection is also connected to the incoming
mains terminals of the primary control gear, Driver 1. The CM4 and CM3
contacts are connected to the Output Terminals of the redundancy device
named Active D2 and Neutral D2, which are connected to the input of the
secondary driver. Refer to Figure ] and 2.
The NO] and N02 relay contacts are connected to the incoming primary
driver LED drive outputs D] + and D] -. Similarly, the NC] and NC2 relay
contacts are connected to the incoming secondary control gear LED drive
outputs D2+ and D2-. The relay contacts CM] and CM2 are connected to
the redundancy controller LED output LED+ and LED- respectively, which then
are connected to the LED light source.
Basic operation is upon switched Active being turned ON, the primary control
gear is powered and the secondary control gear is also powered, however

within a short period of time, as the primary driver output is increasing in
voltage, the relay coil shall be energised and will switch the contacts over,
meaning the CMx contacts are now connected to the NOx contacts of the
relay, switching the secondary control gear OFF and at the same time
disconnecting the secondary control gear output from the LED light source.
During this start-up sequence, it should be noted that the primary driver
outputs are not connected to the LED light source until the relay coil switches,
hence the use of a series resistor string R5 and R6 to feed the LED source
ensures no inrush current that may limit the life of the control gear.
Upon failure of the primary control gear, defined by limited or no output to
drive the LED light source, the relay is unable to operate, this will leave the
relay contacts in the NCx position which connects the secondary control
gear to the incoming Active, Neutral supply and its output D2+ and D2- to the
LED+ and LED- respectively, powering the LED light source.
A remote mounted LED indicator can be fitted into the circuit in the
appropriate position to indicate externally to the fixture if the secondary
control gear is operating, allowing maintenance personnel to inspect
potential primary control gear failures.

Additional Notes to the Invention
  1. Use of mostly passive components to ensure long-life.
  2. Complete isolation of the secondary control gear when the primary
      control gear is in operation.
  3. In the advent of a relay failure, either in the ON state (contacts
      welded) or in the OFF state (coil damage), a control gear is selected to
      connect to the LED light source.
  4. The primary control gear may be selected to operate at a lower output
      current considering lower lumen deprecation of the LED light source,
      over the useful life of the primary control gear the lumen deprecation
      will increase and the Led light source will have lower lumen output. The
      secondary control gear may be selected to operate at a higher output
      current that will provide compensation for the lumen deprecation
      upon failure of the primary control gear. This feature is unique in this
      design.
  5. Remote IoT (internet of things) monitoring of the redundancy controller
      to provide maintenance information of the primary control gear
      failures, thus allowing maintenance personnel to utilise predictive
      schedules for optimal change-over of the primary driver before the
      secondary driver failure.
