                               Snow Tiger Worm Farm Patent               1
TITLE OF THE INVENTION: Snow Tiger Worm Farm
TECHNICAL FIELD:        Environmental Waste and Disposal
ABSTRACT:               Worm Farms are an environmentally friendly way
                        to dispose of organic waste.
                        Most available worm farms require assembly, are
                        sold without worms in the farm and are too large to
                        be used in small space dwellings.
                        Snow Tiger Worm Farms are small, cost effective,
                        fully functional worm farms.
                        The worm tea and castings made by the worms can
                        help fertilize your plants and help them grow.

Snow Tiger Worm Farm Patent 2
                                               Snow Tiger Worm Farm Patent                 1
PART 1   DESCRIPTION
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:
1.       Field of Invention
[0001]   The present invention relates to the disposal of organic waste.
[0002]   Specifically, the invention applies to the invention of a miniature fully functional
         worm farm.
[0003]   The size of the worm farm can be increased to suit the user.
[0004]   Worm farms allow users to dispose of most organic wastes including but not
         limited to bread, fruit, vegetables, etc.
[0005]   Most commercially available worm farms require assembly by the user.
[0006]   Most commercially available worm farms require the additional purchase of
         worms or for the user to add worms themselves.
[0007]   The requirement to assemble the worm farm and source the worms is a barrier to
         uptake of this environmentally friendly waste disposal system.
[0008]   Most commercially available worms farms are large.
[0009]   This makes them difficult to use in an urban or apartment environment.
[0010]   In addition, a small worm farm of a 1-2 litre size is more appealing to children.

                                            Snow Tiger Worm Farm Patent              2
2.     Description of the Prior Art
[0011] A number of commercially available worm farms exist including inground worm
       farms and a variety of tiered worm farms.
3.     Summary of the Invention
[0012] Snow Tiger Worm Farms are fully functional worm farms in a 0.5-2 litre size, 10
       14L size and 18-22L size.
4.     Description of the Invention
[0013] The worm farm consists of the following elements with the bucket size the only
       variable :
[0014] A worm tea collection bucket which includes, but is not limited to, a handle.
[0015] A worm housing bucket with holes in the bottom of the bucket which allows the
       worm tea to seep through and which includes, but is not limited to, a handle.
[0016] A lid for the worm housing bucket with holes to allow air entry into the worm
       farm for the worms to breathe.
[0017] The worm housing bucket sits inside the worm tea collection bucket.
[0018] The worm housing bucket may or may not be lined with worm bedding which
       consists of various material including but not limited to paper, coco coir,
       cardboard, manure, etc.

                                                  Snow Tiger Worm Farm Patent               3
[0019]      The worm housing bucket may be filled to a variable amount with various
            materials including but not limited to soil, sand, earth, potting mix, etc.
[0020]      The worms live in the soil or other material.
[0021]      The food inserted into the worm housing bucket may or may not be covered with
            a worm blanket of various materials including but not limited to, paper towels,
            cotton, other industrial materials, etc.
[0022]      Additional tiers of worm housing buckets may be added to the worm farm.
[0023]      The additional empty worm housing bucket sits inside the existing worm housing
            bucket containing the worms or vice versa.
[0024]      When new food is added to the new tier of worm housing bucket, the worms in
            the existing worm housing bucket migrate to their new home leaving their
            castings behind.
5.     Summary of Invention: Technical Problem
[0025]      Currently commercially available worm farms require assembly and acquisition
            of worms separately by the consumer.
[0026]      Currently commercially available worm farms are large and are not able to be
            used in Apartments or smaller dwellings.
[0027]      Currently commercially available worm farms are large and not easy for children
            to use or care for.
[0028]      Currently commercially available worm farms are messy and attract rodents,
            insects and other pests.

6.     Summary of Invention: Solution to Problem
[0029]        Snow Tiger Worm Farms are fully functional worm farms which are all inclusive
              of worms and require no assembly.
[0030]        These worm farms are small and can fit into apartments or small dwellings, and
              can be cared for by children.
7.     Summary of Invention: Advantageous Effects of Invention
[0031]        The worm farm is purchased with worms included
[0032]        No assembly is required
[0033]        The worm farm is small and can be kept in apartments or small dwellings
[0034]        The worm farm is small and can be maintained by children.
[0035]        The worm tea produced by the farm can be used as fertilizer.
[0036]        The worm castings produced by the farm can be used as fertilizer.
8.     Description of Embodiments
[0037]        Various embodiments of this invention follow:
[0038]        Various shapes such as round, triangular, rectangular etc.
[0039]        Various sizes such as greater than 22 Litres.

                                                   Snow Tiger Worm Farm Patent                s
9.             Industrial Applicability
[0040]         The worm farm is provided to children to assist them in learning how to care for
               worms and how to dispose of organic waste in an environmentally friendly
               manner rather than disposal to landfill.
[0041]         The worm farm can be kept in small dwellings and apartments, providing an
               alternative waste disposal system to divert organic waste from landfill.
