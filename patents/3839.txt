   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 1.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
15 having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.                        Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
20 volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.                      Herein the term "processor" is used to refer
   generically to any device that can process game play
   instructions in accordance with game play rules and may
25 include:               a microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable
   logic device or other computational device, a general
   purpose computer                      (e.g. a PC) or a server.   That is a
   processor may be provided by any suitable logic circuitry
   for receiving inputs, processing them in accordance with
30 instructions stored in memory and generating outputs (for
   example on the display).                       Such processors are sometimes
   also referred to as central processing units (CPUs).                        Most
   processors are general purpose units, however, it is also
   know to provide a specific purpose processor using an
35 application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field
   programmable gate array (FPGA).

                                                - 12
   The gaming machine 100 has hardware meters 104 for
   purposes including ensuring regulatory compliance and
   monitoring player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface
   105 for communicating with peripheral devices of the
 5 gaming machine 100.                    The input/output interface 105 and/or
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
   data for use with the input/output interface or the
   peripheral devices.                    A random number generator module 113
10 generates random numbers for use by the processor 102.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   reference to random numbers includes pseudo-random
   numbers.
15 In the example shown in Figure 2, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107                    (which provide a game play
   mechanism),                   a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
20 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.                     Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation.                    For example, while buttons or touch
25 screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game, any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used.                     For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
30 the game.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
35 information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus

   controller, central controller, server or database.                  In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -               i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
 5 communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.                The memory 103 includes RAM
10 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                 The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                 The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.                 The mass storage device
15 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
20 Figure 4 shows a gaming system 400 schematically and shows
   that a gaming machine 410 has a number of components
   mounted within a cabinet 415.                 The gaming machine 400 is
   generally constructed in a similar fashion to the gaming
   machines 10,100 described above but various components are
25 not shown to facilitate description of the gaming system.
   Components of those gaming machines 10,100 may be found in
   gaming machine 400 or varied in accordance with gaming
   machines known in the art.
30 Mounted within the cabinet 415 is a game controller unit
   420 having a main board 422 and a back plane 421.                 As
   indicated above in relation to Figure 2, the game
   controller unit 420 comprises a processor and memory which
   are mounted to the main board 422.                 Backplane 421 allows
35 power to be connected to the main board 422 and also
   provides the primary means for connecting the main board
   422 to other components of the gaming machine 410
   10352556_1(GHMaters) P83009.AU.3

                                                  - 14
   including the button deck 423 and the touch screen 424.
   The game controller unit 420 also has a video output 425
   to enable the game controller 420 to output video data to
   an electronic display which is provided by first liquid
 5 crystal display 426 and a second liquid crystal display
   427.          In the embodiment, video data is output in a
   component video format but persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that other analogue video formats compatible
   with the displays 426, 427 may be employed such as
10 composite video or s-video as may digital formats such as
   HDMI         (high-definition multimedia interface).
   It will be apparent from Figure 4 that the video output
   425 is connected to two video cables 431, 432.                       Each of
15 these video cables are connected to the respective first
   inputs of a first video switch 461 and a second video
   switch 462.                      The outputs of the video switches 461,462 are
   connected by video cables 481, 482 respectively to the
   video inputs of the first liquid crystal display 426 and
20 the second liquid crystal display 427 respectively.
   The second inputs of the first switch 461 and the second
   switch 462 are connected by video cables 471, 472 to the
   video output 441 of an external controller 440 of the
25 gaming system which is located outside the cabinet.                       The
   video cables 471, 472 providing a second communications
   link to the external controller 440.                       The external
   controller 440 is preferably located close to the gaming
   machine 410, for example in cabinetry surrounding a bank
30 of gaming machines to enable it to service the plurality
   of gaming machines of the bank as described below in
   relation to Figure 5.                      In the embodiment, a separate
   control line 433, 434 is provided between the game
   controller unit 420 and the switches 461,462 to enable
35 control of the switches.                      In another embodiment control
   lines may be provided between the external controller 440
   and the switches 461, 462.                       In another embodiment, one or
   10352556_1(GHMaters) P83009.AU.3

                                             - 15
   more of the video cables 431, 432, 471, 472 can also carry
   a control line.
   It will be appreciated that the first switch 461 and the
 5 second switch 462 provide a switching mechanism 460 which
   allows for the selective control of the video source for
   each of the first display 426 and the second display 427.
   The game controller unit 420 is also connected via a first
10 communications link 491 to the external controller 440.
   In the embodiment, the game controller 420 has an output
   428 in the form of an Ethernet port connecting the gaming
   machine to a network 450 and hence to an Ethernet port 442
   of the external controller 440.                  The communications link
15 491 enables direct communication between the game
   controller unit 420 and the external controller.                  The
   purpose of the direct communication is to enable both the
   game controller unit 420 and the external controller unit
   440 to generate game events and for these to be displayed
20 on displays 426, 427.                 In order to achieve this, the game
   controller 420 and the external controller 440 communicate
   with one other to enable synchronisation of the generation
   and display of game events by one another and to
   synchronise control of the video switches and hence the
25 displayed input.                 The link 491 also enables communication
   from the game controller unit of inputs made by the player
   using either the button deck 423 or the touch screen 424
   which are relevant to game events being generated by the
   external controller 440.
30
   In one embodiment, the communications link 491 uses a
   TCP/IP and XML base protocol.                  One technique which can be
   used is to use the gaming standards association G2S
   protocol with extensions to existing XML messaging to
35 enable the relevant functions.

                                      - 16
   An advantage of connecting the gaming machine 410 and the
   external controller 440 in this manner is that it allows
   normal gaming machine functions to be carried out until an
   event occurs on one of the game controller unit 420 or the
 5 external controller 440 such as a trigger event.           Once the
   trigger event occurs, the video for display is sourced
   from the external controller 440.           A player can then
   interact with external controller 440, for example by
   touching the relevant part of touch screen 424 and this
10 player input can be sent to the external controller 440.
   As illustrated in Figure 6, the external controller 600 is
   implemented by a processor implementing instructions
   stored in a memory 640 in an analogous fashion to the game
   controller shown in Figure 2.           Other features analogous to
15 those shown in Figure 2 can also be incorporated within
   the external controller 600.           The processor 605 of the
   external controller 600 implements a number of modules.
   Events are generated by the external controller game event
   controller 610 based on communications with the game
20 controller unit via a communication module 620 over
   communication link 491.          Display controller 630
   communicates with the switches and hence the displays
   426,427 via the second communication link provided by the
   video cables 471, 472.
25
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that control of
   the displays 426, 427 is one form of control of an audio
   visual output which can achieved by this technique and
   that audio outputs may be controlled (additionally or
30 alternatively) in the same manner.           The audio output maybe
   an analogue audio signal or a digital audio signal such as
   pulse coded modulation (PCM) which could be transmitted,
   for example, using an HDMI cable.
35 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there are
   a number of configurations that can be used.           For example,
   the game controller unit 420 may use one or both of the
   10352556_1(GHMaters) P83009.AU.3

                                            - 17
   first and second displays 426, 427.                Similarly, the
   external controller 440 may use one or both of the
   displays 426, 427.                In one embodiment, the game control
   unit uses both displays whereas the second external
 5 controller 440 only uses one of the displays.                In
   embodiments where both of the controllers 420, 440 only
   use one display, they may use the same display.
   In one example, the game provided by the gaming machine
10 410 may be a spinning reel game such as are known in the
   art where the player selects, depending on the specific
   implementation a number of win lines or reels to play and
   a wager to place per win line or reel.                The game
   controller then determines a game outcome by spinning the
15 reels to a stop and comparing the symbols on the reels
   against the selected win lines and a pay table to
   determine whether to make an award to the player.                 In such
   an embodiment, the spinning reel game may provide a base
   game and there may be an opportunity to trigger a feature
20 game from the base game.                The trigger condition may be one
   of several trigger conditions known in the art such as a
   symbol combination occurring within the base game or a
   random determination result.
25 In such an embodiment, the external controller 440 may act
   as a feature controller for carrying out the feature game.
   Accordingly, once the trigger condition occurs, the game
   control unit 420 communicates with the external feature
   controller 440 and it takes over control of the first and
30 second displays 426, 427 for playing of a feature game.
   Outcomes of the feature game may be displayed on second
   display 427 while the first display 426 is used to display
   items requiring a player to make selections using the
   touch screen 424.                The player makes selections with the
35 touch screen 424 and the game controller unit 420 passes
   the selections by a first communication link 491 to the
   external controller 440.                The game event controller 610
   10352556_1(GHMaters) P83009.AU.3

                                              - 18
   processes the selections in accordance with instructions
   stored in the memory 640 and determines what to display on
   the second display 427 and display data is output via
   display controller 630 to the relevant display.                  Any
 5 awards are communicated via the communication module 620
   to the game controller unit 420 so that it can update
   relevant meters.
   The base game is a part of the game which is carried out
10 each time the player makes a wager, typically irrespective
   of the wager, whereas other parts of the game will only be
   carried out occasionally for example if a condition is met
   such as a trigger occurring or if an ante bet is placed
    (depending on the specific embodiment).
15
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a feature
   game involves some additional element of game play which
   usually only occurs when a trigger condition is met.
   Types of feature games include:                 those where a series of
20 free game events are awarded such as free games or re
   spins          (where some reels are held while others are re
   spun); games where the symbols on the reel are changed;
   and "second screen" games where game play is totally
   different to the base game, for example where the player
25 makes selections in a "pick a box type" game.
   In another example, the external controller may be a bonus
   controller which is arranged to randomly determine whether
   to make awards to one of a plurality of connected gaming
30 machines as shown in Figure 5.                  Referring to Figure 5 the
   external controller 540 is connected by a first
   communication link in the form of network 550 to each of a
   first gaming machine 510A, second gaming machine 510B and
   an eighth gaming machine 510C.
35
   Each gaming machine has a display 520 and a game
   controller 530.                  The external controller is connected to
   10352556_1(GHMaters) P83009.AU.3

                                             - 19
   each of these displays via switches                 (not shown in Figure
   5) by a first video cable 560A, second video cable 560B
   and a third video cable 560C respectively.
 5 In such an embodiment, the external controller 540 may
   randomly determine whether to make an award to one
   connected gaming machines 510.                  Once the external
   controller 540 determines to make an award to one of the
   gaming machines it communicates to the relevant one of the
10 game controllers 520.                 The communication is primarily so
   that the game controller 520 can advise the external
   controller 540 when it may take over control of the
   display.                 However, the communication may be for other
   purposes, for example, to establish whether the relevant
15 gaming machine 510 is eligible based on eligibility
   criteria, such as having placed a wager within a defined
   period.                Once the game controller 520 advises the external
   controller 540 that it can take over control, the external
   controller 540 takes over the display by controlling the
20 switching mechanism and displays the bonus award on
   display 520 of the relevant gaming machine.                  It will be
   appreciated that such a bonus award may or may not require
   further player interaction.                  Where player interaction is
   required, input from the relevant input device of the
25 relevant gaming machine is passed to the external
   controller 540 as described above in relation to Figure 4.
   It will be appreciated in such embodiments, that the
   external controller 540 may synchronise display of the
30 bonus award across the plurality of gaming machines 510,
   display it only on the participating gaming machine,
   display it on both displays of a winning machine while
   only on a secondary display of non-winning gaming machines
   etc.
35
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there are
   a number of advantages of certain embodiments of the
   10352556_1(GHMaters) P83009.AU.3

                                                - 20
   invention.                    One advantage, the main display of the gaming
   machine may be shared between the game controller and the
   external controller and be under control of both of the
   game controller and the external controller for both video
 5 and user input.                    Another advantage is the touch screen of
   the main display may be used to provide control signals to
   the external controller.
   Further, user input for multiple games can be sent to the
10 external controller and acted upon with resulting shared
   and/or individual video output and sound.
   As the game controller unit 420 is placed in the middle of
   touch interactions and is in communication with the
15 external controller 440, it is aware of the games state at
   all times and can take over control of events when and if
   required (and/or desired).                     The game controller can also
   provide game replay.
20 A further advantage is that the technique enables new
   categories of games to be played at a gaming machine 410,
   including multiplayer games with user input and
   participation.                    The technique can also be used to access
   other systems.
25
   In addition to the above described embodiments, the
   external controller could be a jackpot controller.                     In
   other embodiments, additional switches may be provided in
   conjunction with the input devices so that control of the
30 input devices can be shared between the game controller
   and the external controller in a manner analogous to
   control of the displays.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
35 invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
