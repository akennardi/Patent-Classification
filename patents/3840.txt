                                      formula I,
15 wherein R and R' are independently a thiazoline ring or a hydroxyl.
   Cardenolide is a type of steroid. Cardenolides are derivatives of cardenolide
   and can be found in many plants, including many in the form of cardenolide
   glycosides. Cardenolides can also be found in calotropis gigantea.
20 Cardenolides are C(23)-steroids with methyl groups at C-10 and C-13 and a
   five-membered lactone at C-17.
   In an example embodiment, the cardenolide administered is uscharin and has
   formula II:

   Cardenolides treat autoimmune disease by inhibiting differentiation of T helper
   cells, including T helper 17 (Th17) cells, Type 1 T helper (Th1) cells, and Type
   2 T helper (Th2) cells, from nafve CD4+ T cells.
30
   In an example embodiment, the autoimmune disease is mediated by T helper
   17 (Th17) cells and the cardenolide treats the autoimmune disease by
   inhibiting differentiation of Th17 cells. In a further example embodiment, the
   cardenolide reduces interleukin 17 (IL-17) production.

                                                     8

   In an example embodiment, the cardenolide treats the autoimmune disease
   by reducing expression of retineic-acid-receptor-related orphan nuclear
   receptor gamma t (RORyt) which regulates differentiation of Thl7 cells.
 5 In an example embodiment, the autoimmune disease is mediated by Type 1 T
   helper (Th1) cells and the cardenolide treats the autoimmune disease by
   inhibiting the differentiation of Th1 cells. In a further example embodiment, the
   cardenolide also reduces interferon gamma (IFN-y) production.
10 In an example embodiment, the autoimmune disease is mediated by Type 2 T
   helper (Th2) cells and the cardenolide treats the autoimmune disease by
   inhibiting the differentiation of Th2 cells. In a further example embodiment, the
   cardenolide also reduces interleukin 4 (IL-4) production.
15 The following examples will provide experiments and data showing that
   cardenolides can be used in the treatment of an autoimmune disease.
   Example 1 Effects of uscharin, calactin and calotropin as cardenolides on
   RORyt luciferase reporter activity
20
   1.1 Procedure
   1.1.1 Lightswitch Luciferase reporter assay
   To evaluate retineic-acid-receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t
   (RORyt) luciferase reporter activity, RORyt LUCPorterTM stable reporter cells
25 were used. The reporter cells (5x10 4 /well) were plated in 96-well plate in
   triplicate in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium with 10%
   fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 pg/mL)
   and puromycin (3 pg/mL) overnight. The cells were incubated with 100nM,
   250nM and 500nM uscharin, calactin, calotropin, or 10pM digoxin for 16
30 hours.100pL Assay Solution was then added to the wells. The mixture was
   incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes and transferred into
   96-well white plates before reading. The luciferase activity was analyzed by a
   Sirius luminometer (Bertold Detection System GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany).
                                              9

   1.2 Results
   Figure 1A showed a graph, 100, illustrating the effect of 10pM digoxin and
   10OnM, 250nM, and 500nM uscharin on RORyt luciferase reporter activity.
   Figure 1A showed that uscharin significantly inhibited RORyt luciferase
 5 reporter in a dose-dependent manner. Figure 1B showed a graph, 120,
   illustrating the effect of 10pM digoxin and 100nM, 250nM, and 500nM calactin
   on RORyt luciferase reporter activity. Figure 1B showed that calactin
   significantly inhibited RORyt luciferase reporter in a dose-dependent manner.
   Figure 1C showed a graph, 140, illustrating the effect of 10pM digoxin and
10 100nM, 250nM, and 500nM calotropin on RORyt luciferase reporter activity.
   Figure 1C showed that calotropin significantly inhibited RORyt luciferase
   reporter in a dose-dependent manner.
   Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C showed that uscharin, calactin, and calotropin
15 significantly inhibited RORyt luciferase reporter and showed similar effects to
   digoxin, a well-known RORyt antagonist.
   Example 2 Effect of uscharin, calactin and calotropin on the protein
   expression of RORyt in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells
20
   2.1 Procedure
   2.1.1 Transfection of human RORyt plasmid to HEK 293 cell line
   The transfection assay was preformed according to Lipofectamine LTX
   (Invitrogen, USA) manufacturer instructions. In brief, HEK293 cells were
25 seeded in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS at
   4x105 cells per well. Five hundred micro liter Opti-MEM Reduced Serum
   Media containing 2.5 pg of DNA was added to the cells to be transfected, and
   then 2 pL of PLUS was added into the above diluted Opti-MEM:DNA solution,
   gently mixed and incubated for another 5 minutes at room temperature.
30 Subsequently, lipofectamine LTXTM Reagent was added to the above solution,
   and then mixed gently and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to
   form DNA-lipofectamine LTX Reagent complexes. Finally, 500 pL of the DNA
   lipofectamine LTX Reagent complexes was directly added to each well
                                            10

   containing cells and mixed gently. The cells were incubated at 3 72C in a C02
   incubator for 24 hours.
   2.1.2 Western blotting assay
 5 The cells were then incubated with the indicated compounds at different
   concentrations for 6 hours. The cells were lysed with
   radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 1x protease inhibitor
   mix to harvest total cellular proteins, and the protein concentration was
   calculated by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit. The total cellular proteins were
10 then subjected to electrophoresis in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE) and transferred to
   nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in a Tris
   buffered saline-0.1% Tween 20 buffer, the membrane was subsequently
   incubated with specific primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
15 conjugated secondary antibodies. An enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL)
   detection system was used to detect the antibody-bound proteins on the
   membrane.
   2.2 Results
20 Figure 2A showed a western blot, 200, illustrating the effect of 10pM digoxin
   and 100, 250, and 500 nM uscharin on RORyt overexpression. Figure 2A
   showed that uscharin inhibited RORyt overexpression in a dose-dependent
   manner.
25 Figure 2B showed a western blot, 220, illustrating the effect of 1OpM digoxin
   and 100, 250, and 500 nM calactin on RORyt overexpression. Figure 2B
   showed that calactin inhibited RORyt overexpression in a dose-dependent
   manner.
30 Figure 2C showed a western blot, 240, illustrating the effect of 10pM digoxin
   and 100, 250, and 500 nM calotropin on RORyt overexpression. Figure 2C
   showed that calotropin inhibited RORyt overexpression in a dose-dependent
   manner.

   Example 3 Flow cytometry assay for determining the effects of uscharin,
   calactin and calotropin on T helper 17 (Thl7) cell differentiation
   3.1 Method
 5 3.1.1 Thl7 cell differentiation
   Naive CD4+ T cells were sorted by magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) from the
   spleen of C57BL/6 mice (8-14 weeks). CD4+ T cells (5x105 cells/well) were
   activated with 2 pg/ml of plate-bound anti-mouse CD3 (Biolegend, San Diego,
   USA), and 5 pg/ml of anti-mouse CD28 (Biolegend) into 24-well-plates. For
10 Th1 7 differentiation, cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of 1 ng/ml
   recombinant human transforming growth factor-p (TGF-p1, Biolegend), 50
   ng/ml recombinant mouse interleukin-6 (IL-6, Biolegend), and 5 ng/ml
   recombinant mouse interleukin-23 (IL-23, Biolegend), and 10 pg/ml anti
   mouse interleukin-4 (IL-4, Biolegend) with or without indicated compounds.
15
   3.1.2 Flow Cytometry
   For polarization of Th17, the cells were re-stimulated in complete RPMI 1640
   containing 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), 1pg/ml ionomycin, and
   1xBrefeldin A (Biolegend) for 4 hours. After 1 hour of incubation, 1xMonensin
20 (Biolegend) was added and incubated for 4 hours. The cells were collected
   and washed with Staining Buffer (BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA), and
   then stained with PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-mouse CD4 (Biolegend). The cells were
   then fixed for 15 minutes with fixation buffer (BD Biosciences), permeabilized
   with BD Wash buffer (1x; BD Biosciences), and stained with PE anti-mouse
25 interleukin 17A (IL-1 7A) (Biolegend). The cells were analyzed by BD FACS
   Aria III, and the acquired data was analyzed using FlowJo software.
   3.2 Results
   Figure 3A showed a flow cytometric analysis, 300, illustrating the effect of
30 1OpM digoxin and 10OnM, 250nM and 500nM uscharin on Th1 7 differentiation
   and IL-1 7 production. Figure 3B showed a graph, 320, illustrating the effect of
   1OpM digoxin and 100nM, 250nM and 500nM uscharin on Th1 7 differentiation
   and IL-1 7 production. As shown in figure 3A and figure 3B, the ratio of
                                            12

   interleukin 17 (IL-17) production in non-treatment cells was 0.73%. In Th17
   polarizing conditions, the ratio of IL-1 7 production rose to 61.3%, while digoxin
   reduced IL-17 production to 36.9%. 500nM uscharin reduced IL-17 production
   to 25.6% while 10pM digoxin reduced IL-17 production to 36.9%, indicating
 5 that uscharin had a better inhibitory effect on IL-1 7 production than digoxin.
   Figure 4A showed a flow cytometric analysis, 400, illustrating the effect of
   10pM digoxin and 100nM, 250nM and 500nM calactin on Thl7 differentiation
   and IL-1 7 production. Figure 4B showed a graph, 420, illustrating the effect of
10 10pM digoxin and 100nM, 250nM and 500nM calactin on Th17 differentiation
   and IL-1 7 production. As shown in figure 4A and figure 4B, 500nM calactin
