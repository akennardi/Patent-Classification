         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to vitamin K3 drug intermediates 2- menadione synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         2- menadione which mainly promotes the synthesis of thrombin in animal, and
   promotes the synthesis of plasma coagulation factor in the liver as the hemostatic
10 agent, can be used as a vitamin K3 drug intermediate. Most of the existing synthesis
   methods    are using     the  process   that toluene   quinone    and   butadiene   gets
   2-methylnaphthalene hydroquinone by cyclization, then oxidized by chromic acid.
   The toluene quinone dissolved in glacial acetic acid through butadiene, to the required
   quantity below 20 'C. After the closed static 20h, heated for the rest of the butadiene
15 to escape, continue to heat to about 110 'C, then reflux for 3 h, and then recover
   glacial acetic acid about 30% at vacuum distillation. Then cool it below 40 'C, slowly
   add the mixture of chromic acid and the equal amount of water, keep the temperature
   at 65-70 0C, generate menadione after keeping for one hour at 70-80 'C. This method
   of production requires chromic acid as reactant, resulting in environmental pollution,
20 it is necessary that the temperature is heated to 110 "C during reaction process, the
   reaction energy consumption is high, and the synthesis method is complicated.
   Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthesis method.
