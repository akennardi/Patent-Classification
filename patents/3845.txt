                                    ABSTRACT
          A renal therapy machine includes a blood filter including a plurality of
porous fibers, a blood circuit in communication with the blood filter, a dialysate
circuit in communication with the blood filter, and at least one pump or valve
positioned and arranged to purge air from the blood filter into the dialysate
circuit, as a physiologically compatible solution, other than dialysate, is moved
across the porous fibers of the blood filter.
          The machine is configured to perform a priming sequence in which (i)
the physiologically compatible solution primes the blood circuit and is flowed
within the fibers and through pores in the fibers of the blood filter, and (ii) the at
least one pump or valve purges air, via the dialysate circuit, from the blood filter
into the dialysate circuit.

         BACKGROUND
                 [0001] The present disclosure relates generally to medical treatments.
   5    More specifically, the present disclosure relates to medical fluid treatments,
        such as the treatment of renal failure and fluid removal for congestive heart
        failure.
                 [0002] Hemodialysis ("HD") in general uses diffusion to remove waste
       products from a patient's blood. A diffusive gradient that occurs across the
  10   semi-permeable dialyzer between the blood and an electrolyte solution called
       dialysate causes diffusion. Hemofiltration ("HF") is an alternative renal
       replacement therapy that relies on a convective transport of toxins from the
       patient's blood. This therapy is accomplished by adding substitution or
       replacement fluid to the extracorporeal circuit during treatment (typically ten to
 15    ninety liters of such fluid). That substitution fluid and the fluid accumulated by
      the patient in between treatments is ultrafiltered over the course of the HF
      treatment, providing a convective transport mechanism that is particularly
      beneficial in removing middle and large molecules (in hemodialysis there is a
      small amount of waste removed along with the fluid gained between dialysis
 20   sessions, however, the solute drag from the removal of that ultrafiltrate is not
      enough to provide convective clearance).
               [00031 Hemodiafiltration ("HDF") is a treatment modality that combines
      convective and diffusive clearances. HDF uses dialysate to flow through a
      dialyzer, similar to standard hemodialysis, providing diffusive clearance, In
25    addition, substitution solution is provided directly to the extracorporeal circuit,
      providing convective clearance.
               [0004] Home hemodialysis ("HHD") is performed in the patient's home.
     One drawback of home hemodialysis has been the need for a dedicated water
     treatment, which includes equipment, water connection and drainage. Installing
30   and using those components is a difficult and cumbersome task that can
                                                 1a

  require a patient's home to be modified. Nevertheless, there are benefits to
  daily hemodialysis treatments versus bi- or tri-weekly visits to a treatment
  center. In particular, a patient receiving more frequent treatments removes
  more toxins and waste products than a patient receiving less frequent but
5 perhaps longer treatments. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved HHD
  system.

                                               SUMMARY
              [0005] The present disclosure provides a home hemodialysis ("HHD") system. In
    one embodiment, the home system includes a mobile cart and integral bag manager. A latch
    is pulled out to unlock door of the system instrument. The door can be opened to expose a
    latch hook and peristaltic pump heads.
              [0006] The instrument accepts a disposable unit which in one embodiment is loaded
   from above and slid to the right. The disposable unit pivots towards the machine interface,
   which allows peristaltic tube loops of the disposable unit to fit over peristaltic pump heads of
   the instrument. Also, supply lines of the disposable unit are passed over individual pinch
   valve plungers.
             [0007] The pinch valve plungers pinch the supply tubes against a pinch valve strike
  plate. The valve assembly is in one embodiment a motor-driven cam operated pinch valve
  subassembly. The motor in one embodiment is a stepper motor.
             [0008] The system in one embodiment includes a bellows or bladder that compresses
  a cassette against the instrument door using a pressure plate and gasket. These apparatuses
  are structured to accommodate an inline inductive heater provided with the disposable
  cassette. The bellows is air actuated in one embodiment. The instrument includes a primary
  coil that inductively heats conductive heating disks located within the cassette, which in turn
 heat fluid flowing through the cassette.
            [0009] A multi-peristaltic pump race retracts and extends in one embodiment
 illustrates to facilitate loading of the peristaltic tubes of the cassette onto the peristaltic pump
 heads. The race is then moved towards the tubes for operation.
           [00101 The system in one embodiment includes a manual blood pump operator, which
 allows the patient or caregiver to move the blood pump head manually,
           [0011] The system includes a bag management system having shelves that fold up,
out of the way, and down, sequentially for placement of supply bags. The system in one
embodiment supports up to five, six liter solution bags. The bags can be dual chamber bags.
The shelves in an embodiment are provided with sensors that allow detection of whether the
bags have been (i) loaded or not and (ii) opened or not for therapy. The sensors in one
embodiment are capacitive sensors placed on opposite ends of the shelves.
          [0012] The disposable cassette in one embodiment connects fluidly to a heparin
syringe for the injection of heparin into the blood circuit.          The syringe fits into a luer
connector assembly, which in turn is loaded into a syringe pump. The assembly is turned in
                                                   2

      the syringe pump to lock the syringe in the syringe pump for treatment.            The assembly
      accommodates large syringes, such as fifty to sixty milliliter syringes, which can lock directly
      into the syringe pump. In one embodiment, the heparin line passes through the side of the
     cassette. Here, heparin can enter at the blood pump outlet just prior to the dialyzer inlet.
               [0013] The system also includes a retractable saline bag support rod. The saline in
     one embodiment connects to the cassette near the heparin line. A saline valve is located on
     each side of the blood pump to control the flow of saline to same.
               [0014] A dialyzer inlet pressure sensor interface in one embodiment doubles as a flow
     control valve. The cassette can also form an integral venus air separation chamber.
              [0015] Priming is performed in one embodiment via gravity.           Gravity primes the
    venous line, the arterial line and the air trap (drip chamber).
             [0016] In another embodiment, priming is preformed via a combination of pumping
    dialysate and a physiologically safe fluid, such as saline.         In particular, a hemodialysis
    machine can include a blood circuit, a dialysate circuit, a dialyzer placed in communication
    with the blood circuit and the dialysate circuit; and a priming sequence in which dialysate is
   used to prime a first portion of the dialysate circuit and a physiologically compatible solution,
   other than dialysate, is used to prime a second portion of the dialysate circuit, the dialyzer and
   the blood circuit.     The first portion of the dialysate circuit includes a recirculation loop
   primed by a dialysate supply pump in one embodiment. The second portion of the dialysate
   circuit can then be located at least substantially between the recirculation loop and the
   dialyzer, and which is primed by at least one of a blood pump and a downstream dialysate
  pump.       In one embodiment, a volumetric balancing unit separates the first and second
  portions of the dialysate circuit.
            [0017] The cassette in one embodiment uses balance tubes to balance fresh and spend
  dialysate flow. The balance tubes have outlets at the top of the tubes when mounted for
  operation to allow air to leave the tubes. The cassette also employs diaphragm valves that
  operate with a compliance chamber that seals against backpressure.
           [0018] For instance, a hemodialysis machine can include a dialysis instrument having
 at least one peristaltic pump actuator and first and second pneumatic valve actuators. The
 instrument operates with a disposable cassette, the disposable cassette including a rigid
 portion, with at least one peristaltic pump tube extending from the rigid portion for operation
with the at least one pump actuator.           The rigid portion defines first and second valve
chambers in operable connection with the first and second valve actuators, respectively, the
first and second valve chambers communicating fluidly with each other, at least the first
                                                   3

      valve chamber communicating fluidly with a compliance chamber, the compliance chamber
      absorbing energy from a pneumatic closing pressure applied to close the first valve chamber,
      so as to tend to prevent the pneumatic closing pressure from opening an existing closure of
      the second valve chamber.
               [0019] The machine in one embodiment includes a vacuum applied to the compliance
      chamber to absorb the energy from the pneumatic closing pressure applied to close the first
     valve chamber.
              [0020] In the above example, a flexible membrane can be sealed to the rigid portion,
     the pneumatic closing pressure applied to the membrane to close the first valve chamber.
    Here, the compliance chamber is formed in part via a portion of the flexible membrane,
    wherein the flexible membrane portion is configured to absorb the energy from the pneumatic
    closing pressure. The cassette can alternatively include a flexible diaphragm located on an
    opposing side of the rigid portion from the flexible membrane, the compliance chamber
    formed in part via the flexible diaphragm, the flexible diaphragm configured to absorb the
    energy from the pneumatic closing pressure.
             [0021] The disposable cassette can have multiple compliance chambers operating
   with different sets of valve chambers. The compliance chamber aids both upstream and
   downstream valves.       The compliance chamber overcomes a backpressure applied by the
   closing of the second valve chamber to the first valve chamber, to allow the first valve
   chamber to close properly.
            [0022] In another compliance chamber embodiment, the dialysis instrument has a
  pump actuator and first and second valve actuators. A disposable cassette is operable with
  the dialysis instrument, the disposable cassette including a pump portion operable with the
  pump actuator, the first and second valve chambers communicating fluidly with each other, at
  least the first valve chamber communicating fluidly with a compliance chamber, the
 compliance chamber negating a first backpressure due to a pneumatic closing pressure used
 to close the first valve chamber to help to ensure the pneumatic pressure applied to the first
 valve chamber will close the first valve chamber against a second backpressure from an
 existing closure of the second valve chamber. Here, a pneumatic pressure applied to the
 second valve chamber can be the same as the pneumatic pressure applied to the first valve
 chamber. The first backpressure would exist around an outside of a port of the first valve
chamber if not for the compliance chamber, the second backpressure existing inside the port.
As before, the compliance chamber is further configured to tend to prevent the pneumatic
pressure applied to the first valve chamber from opening the closed second valve chamber.
                                                 4

       And, the machine in one embodiment includes a vacuum applied to the compliance chamber
       to ensure the pneumatic pressure applied to the first valve chamber will close the first valve
       chamber.
               [0023] In a further compliance chamber embodiment, the dialysis instrument has a
      pump actuator and first and second valve actuators. The disposable cassette is operable with
      the dialysis instrument, the disposable cassette including a pump portion operable with the
      pump actuator, and first and second valve chambers operable with the first and second valve
      actuators, respectively, the cassette further includes a compliance chamber in fluid
     communication with the first and second valve chambers, the compliance chamber defined at
     least in part by a rigid wall of the cassette and a diaphragm located on an opposing side of the
     rigid wall from the first and second valve chambers.        The rigid wall in one embodiment
    defines first and second apertures that allow the first and second valve chambers to
    communicate fluidly, respectively, with the compliance chamber. The cassette can include a
    flexible membrane located on an opposing side of the cassette from the diaphragm, the
    membrane for closing the first and second valve chambers. Again, the compliance chamber
    can aid at least one of: (i) maintenance of an existing closure of the second valve chamber
   when the first valve chamber is closed; and (ii) a proper closure of the first valve chamber at
   a time when the second valve chamber is already closed. In one embodiment, the aiding is
   provided via a vacuum applied to the compliance chamber.
             [0024] In still a further compliance chamber embodiment, a dialysis instrument has a
   pump actuator and first and second valve actuator. A disposable cassette is operable with the
   dialysis instrument, the disposable cassette including a pump portion operable with the pump
   actuator, and first and second valve chambers operable with the first and second valve
  actuators, respectively. A compliance chamber is placed in fluid communication with the
  first and second valve chambers, the compliance chamber defined by in part by a flexible
 membrane used to close at least one of the first and second valve chambers, the valve
 chambers each defining an aperture for fluid communication with the compliance chamber.
 The disposable cassette can include a rigid wall, the first and second valves chambers
 extending from the rigid wall towards the flexible membrane, wherein the apertures of the
 first and second valve chambers are formed in the rigid wall, and wherein the rigid wall also
forms a third, larger aperture to allow fluid flowing through the valve chamber apertures to
communicate fluidly with the flexible membrane of the compliance chamber, Again, the
compliance chamber aiding at least one of: (i) maintenance of an existing closure of the
second valve chamber when the first valve chamber is closed; and (ii) a proper closure of the
                                                    5

     first valve chamber at a time when the second valve chamber is already closed. Again, the
     aiding can be provided via a vacuum applied to the compliance chamber.
                 [0025] It is therefore an advantage of the present disclosure to properly seal valves in
    fluid communication with one another.
                 [0026] It is another advantage of the present disclosure to provide an efficient priming
    technique that combines the use of dialysate and another physiologically safe fluid, such as
    saline.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
          [00104] Referring now to the drawings, Fig. 1 illustrates one embodiment of a system
 10 sitting idle with its dust cover (not illustrated) removed. A handle 12 for a cart 14 is
located in a lowered position to minimize the space that system 10 consumes. Shelves 16 for
the supply bags (shown below) are also shown in a lowered or "down" position, which
minimizes the height of system 10.
         [00105] System 10 is programmed in an introductory state to instruct the user to open
a door 18 shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 illustrates a close-up view of system 10 with a latch 34
                                                  10

     pulled out to unlock door 18. Once door 18 is unlocked as seen in Fig. 3, it swings open, e.g.,
     about forty-five degrees, and is held in the open position by a stop (not seen), so that a
     disposable set (shown below) can be loaded or unloaded.
             [00106] Fig. 3 illustrates instrument 20 of system 10 with door 18 held in the open
    position, exposing multiple peristaltic pump heads 22, a latch hook 24, inductive heater coil
    26 and a slotted area 28 for the blood lines (not illustrated) to run to and from the patient.
    Ultrasonic air bubble detectors and optical blood/saline/air detectors are integrated into the
    molded slotted area 28 just above a cutout in the slot for the venous and arterial line clamps.
    The cutout located in slotted area 28 accommodates the venous and the arterial line clamps.
    Figure 16 shows the venous and arterial line clamps 76 in the closed position, in which the
   clamps extend through a respective cutout. In an alternative embodiment, the inductive
   heater coil 26 is retracted into the system to facilitate loading.
            [00107] In Fig. 4, door 18 is not shown for clarity to illustrate latch 34 and latch hook
   24, wherein latch 34 mechanically engages latch hook 24 to hold door 18 closed against the
   main portion of instrument 20. One suitable latch assembly is shown and described in Figs.
   11 and 13 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,065, "System and Methods for Control of Pumps Employing
  Electrical Field Sensing", the pertinent portions of which are incorporated herein expressly
  by reference.
           [00108] As seen in Fig. 5, once door 18 has been opened, system 10 prompts the user
  to load the disposable set. A cassette 40 of the disposable set is lowered into the bag of
  instrument 20 and moved to the right (with respect to the orientation of instrument 20 in Fig.
  4). Cassette 40 is loaded starting at the upper left side of open door 18, so that the patient's
 blood lines extending downwardly from cassette 40 do not interfere with the loading
 procedure. The patient's left hand can grasp a dialyzer 36 connected to cassette 40, while the
 patient's right hand can grasp a tubing bundle 38 formed by the supply and drain lines. Single
 handed loading is also possible, e.g., using right hand only grasp bundle 38 to move both
 cassette 40 and dialyzer 36.
          [0100] As seen in Figs. 6 and 7, door 18 pivots cassette 40 forward towards a cassette
interface 50 of instrument 20 when an opening 42 in cassette 40 is located directly over the
inductive heater transformer coil 26. In an alternative embodiment, transformer coil 26 is
retracted to facilitate loading of cassette 40. In such case, coil 26 is then extended into
operating position after cassette 40 is loaded against interface 50. A bezel (not shown)
provides locating stops for stopping cassette 40 in the vertical and horizontal directions.
                                                 11

                 [0101] As cassette 40 mates with the cassette interface 50, the peristaltic pump tubing
       loops 44 of cassette 40 slip over the vertically aligned pumping heads 22. A pump race 46 is
       retracted automatically upwardly when door 18 is opened to provide clearance between the
      pump heads 22 and pump race 26 to facilitate the loading of pump tubing 44 and cassette 40.
                [0102] Fig. 8 illustrates the supply lines 38a to 38e of bundle 38 (number of supply
      lines 38 can vary) passing over retracted pinch valves 48.         System 10 also retracts pinch
      valves 48 automatically when door 18 is opened to facilitate the loading of bundle 38 and
     cassette 40 against interface 50 of instrument 20. System 10 opens and closes pinch valves
     48 in a controlled manner, eliminating the need for manual clamps on supply lines 38a to 38e.
     Fig. 9 is shown with supply lines 38 removed to more clearly illustrate pinch valve plungers
     48.
               [0103] Fig. 10 further illustrates pinch valve   4 8/supply
                                                                           line 38 interaction,    Pinch
    valves 48 pinch supply lines 38 closed against a strike plate 52. In Fig. 10, four pinch valves
    48 for supply lines 38b to 38e are pinching a respective supply line closed against strike plate
    52, while a fifth pinch valve 48 is retracted, allowing supply line 38a to be open.
              [0104] Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate a pinch valve subassembly 60, in which three of the
    five plungers 48 are extended (closed state). Clamp heads 54 are connected to a pinch valve
   body 62 of subassembly 60, Fig. 13 is shown with body 62 removed to illustrate springs 56
   that spring load pinch valve plungers 48, e.g., so as to be normally closed.              Springs 56
   preload pinch valve plungers 48, allowing for variations in the wall thickness of supply tubes
   38. Fig. 13 also illustrates that clamp heads 54 are formed with cam followers 58, which ride
  on associated cam lobes 62 coupled to a camshaft 64 (Figs. I1 and 14). A motor 66, e.g., a
  stepper motor, is coupled to a drive camshaft 64. Fig. 14 illustrates that in one embodiment,
  the individual cam lobes 62 each define apertures configured fit onto a keyed portion 68 of
 shaft 64. Fig. 14 further illustrates the interaction of cam followers 58 and cam lobes 62.
             [0105] Fig. 15 illustrates that when cassette 40 is loaded into instrument 20 of system
 10, blood lines 72 and 74 exit to the lower left of door assembly 90 with venous and arterial
 line clamps 76 (Fig. 16) open initially. Fig. 16 illustrates that venous and arterial line clamps
 76 pinch bloodlines 72 and 74 against housing portion 78 of instrument 20 to close bloodlines
 72 and 74. During normal operation, system 10 operates clamps 76 independently as needed.
Fig. 17 is shown with housing portion 78 and door assembly 90 removed to more fully
illustrate venous and arterial line clamp subassembly 70. A strike part of housing portion 78
seen in Fig. 16 is located between the venous and arterial lines 72 and 74 and pinches the
lines together with the clamping levers 76 when closed.
                                                    12

               [0106] Fig. 18 illustrates the venous and arterial line clamp subassembly 70 less a
       housing 77 shown in Fig. 17, in which clamps 76 are in the open position. Subassembly 70
       includes bellows 80 that hold clamps 76 open during normal operation. Subassembly 70 also
      allows for an Allen wrench 82 with a T-handle 84 to be used to operate a worm gear 86 that
      is coupled operably to a cam 88, which cooperate to manually open both the venous and
      arterial line clamps 76 if need be. In an alternative embodiment, subassembly 70 includes
      dual worm gears and a split cam, so that the venous and arterial line clamps 76 can be
     manually operated independently. Fig. 19 illustrates the placement of the T-handle Allen
     wrench 82 with respect to instrument 20 when the venous and arterial line clamps 76 are
     operated manually. In one embodiment, system 10 causes an, e.g., red, flag (not illustrated)
     to protrude when the clamps 76 have been opened manually. The flag retracts when the
     manual override is not engaged.
              [0107] Fig. 20 illustrates an exploded view of the door assembly 90 taken from inside
    instrument 20. A pair of bellows or bladders 92a and 92b pushes a plate 94 having a gasket
    96 to press the cassette 40 (not seen here) against the disposable interface 50 (not seen here).
    A space between bladders 92a and 92b is provided to accommodate the inductive heater coil
    26 extending from disposable interface 50. Alternatively, instrument 20 provides a single
   bellows (bladder) to press cassette 40 against the disposable interface 50, which has an
   internal opening to accommodate heater coil 26 extending from disposable interface 50.
             [0108] In an alternate failsafe embodiment (not illustrated), the bellows 92a and 92b
  are replaced by a cavity with a diaphragm that is connected sealably to front pressure plate
   18. Springs are located between front pressure plate 18 and the back wall of the cavity and
  press cassette 40 against disposable interface 50, except when a vacuum is present within the
  cavity. In the alternative embodiment, system 10 can also introduce positive pressure into the
  cavity to increase the sealing force.
            [0109] Fig. 21 illustrates system 10 with the door cover 98 (Fig. 20) removed.
 Pneumatic lines 102a and 102b to bellows 92a and 92b, respectively, are shown teed together
 before the exiting door 18 through a hollow hinge 104. A vertical metal bar 106 completes a
 circuit for the inductive heater transformer primary coil 26 when the door 18 is closed against
 interface 50 of instrument 20. Fig. 22 is also shown with door 18 removed to illustrate the
inductive heating system including transformer coil 26 and a wave-shaped disk or disks 108
located in disposable cassette 40, which form a secondary coil that heats dialysis fluid due to
i2R losses. Fig. 23 removes cassette 40 to show inductive heater 100 more clearly. Heater
100 transfers energy from the inductive coil of the transformer 26 into wave washers 108a
                                                   13

       and I08b that are located within cassette 40. Washers 108a and 108b in turn heat dialysate as
       it flows through cassette 40.
                [01101 Fig. 24 illustrates the front of the instrument 20 with door assembly 90 and
       device housing hidden to expose a mechanism 110 that extends and retracts triple peristaltic
      pump race 46. Mechanism 110 includes four idler gears 112 that tie geared triple cams 114
      together to move race 46 to extend (towards tubing 44) and retract (from tubing 44)
      smoothly. Mechanism 110 is configured such that race 46 extends towards tubing 44 only
     after door 18 is closed and latched to preclude the operator from being exposed to any
     moving components. The centers of pump heads 22 are aligned to provide clearance between
     the pump heads and triple race 46 when the race is retracted.
               [0111] Fig. 25 illustrates the backside of the retractable triple peristaltic pump race 46
     and mechanism 110 for moving race 46.              Cams 114 are located at each end of race
     mechanism 110 and race 46. A middle cam 114 is also provided. Each idler gear 112 (Fig.
     12) includes a shaft 113 that transmits rotational motion from the idler gears to all three cams
     114 simultaneously. Cams 114 each include lobes 116 that rotate simultaneously and in
    concert within large rounded end slots 118 to simultaneously and evenly extend and retract
    race 46. Shafts 113 of idler gears 112 (Fig. 24) maintain the horizontal orientation of the
   peristaltic pump race 46 as the race moves up and down.
              [0112] Fig. 25 illustrates the cam lobes 116 rotated simultaneously and in concert
   upwardly, pushing the pump race 46 away from gear motors 120 that are coupled to pump
   heads 22. The open parts of the horizontally stabilizing idler guide slots are above the shafts
   113 of idler gears. Fig. 26 illustrates the cam lobes 116 rotated simultaneously and in concert
   downwardly, pushing pump race 46 towards the pump gear motors 120 coupled to pump
  heads 22. The open parts of the horizontally stabilizing idler guide slots 122 are now below
  the shafts 113 of idler gears 112.
             [0113] Fig. 27 illustrates molded support bosses 124 secured to instrument 20 that
  support shafts 113 of the idler gears 112 and support the shafts 115 of cams 114 on one end.
  A bar (not shown here but shown in Fig. 71), which mounts to bosses 124, supports the shafts
  113 of gears 112 and shafts 115 of cams 114 on their other ends. A motor (not illustrated)
 that drives cams 114, which operate the retractable pump race 46, is attached to any of the
 shafts 115 of any of cams 114. Attaching the motor to the shaft of center cam 114 may be
preferred so that clearance in the gear train is symmetric with respect to outer cams 114.
            [0114] Figs. 28 and 29 illustrate that system 10 includes a crank 130 that is connected
to the blood pump head 22 to operate the head manually.                  Manual return of the blood
                                                     14

       contained within the extracorporeal circuit is necessary in the event of a failure of system 10
       or after an extended power failure. It is typically necessary to manually operate the venous
       and arterial line clamps 76 (from a failed closed state) before being able to return the blood in
      extracorporeal circuit to the patient. Fig. 29 also illustrates that door 18 in one embodiment
      defines an opening or aperture 132 through which manual crank 130 for the blood pump 22
      can be inserted with the door closed. Crank 130 includes a large gripping handle 134 and
      crankshaft 136, which is sufficiently long to allow the user to easily turn blood pump head
      22. In an alternate embodiment, manual crank 130 is built into the door assembly 90 and is
     accessible to engage pump head 22 when door 18 is opened and hinged away from machine
     interface 50.
              [0115] As seen in Fig. 30, in one bag management embodiment, system 10 prompts
     the user initially to fold up all of bag shelves 16 except for the bottom shelf 16. The user is
    then able to break a peel seal of a dual chamber bag (if used), place the first solution bag 140
    on bottom shelf 16 and connect the bag to the bottom supply line 38e extending from
    disposable cassette 40, as shown in Fig. 31. When shelf sensors 138 detect that the bag has
    been placed onto first shelf 16 and that the peel seal 142 has been broken, system 10 prompts
    the user to place a second bag 140 on the second lowest shelf 16, and so on. System 10
   continues to prompt the user to place solutions bags 140 onto shelves 16 and connect the bags
   to supply lines 38 until all of shelves 16 are filled, as shown in Fig. 32.
             [0116] As shown in Fig. 32, a peel seal 142 of dual chamber bag 140 present on the
  top shelf 16 is not broken, a condition which sensors 138 can sense, causing system 10 to
  instruct the user to break peel seal 142 before continuing with treatment. One such sensor
  arrangement and peel seal open check is described in U.S. Patent Application No.
  11/773,742, entitled "Mobile Dialysis System Having Supply Container Detection", filed
 July 5, 2007, assigned to the assignee of the present disclosure, the pertinent portions of
 which are incorporated herein expressly by reference. Fig. 33 illustrates all solution bags 140
 with peel seals 142 broken, such that treatment can continue.
            [0117] Fig. 34 illustrates one embodiment for the placement of the capacitive sensors
 138 that detect the presence of the solution bags, whether peel seal is broken, and perhaps
even whether the same solution is present in each bag 140. Other sensors or combinations of
sensors can be used alternatively, including optical sensors, inductive sensors, bar code
readers, radio frequency identification ("RFID") tags and cameras.
           [0118] Fig. 35 illustrates a luer connection assembly 144, which is located on an end
of a heparin line 146, which in turn is connected to disposable cassette 40. A heparin syringe
                                                   15

      148 ranging in size from ten milliliters to sixty milliliters, can be connected to luer
      connection assembly 144 of the disposable set and is inserted with the plunger 150 pointing
      down into a syringe pump 152 as shown in as shown in Fig. 36. The luer connection
     assembly 144 is then rotated to lock the syringe in place as shown in Fig. 37. Syringe 148,
     for sizes larger than 30 milliliters, is inserted with the plunger 150 pointing down into a
     syringe pump 152 as shown in as shown in Fig. 38.          The integral grip 149 on the larger
     heparin syringes is rotated forty-five degrees to lock the syringe 148 into the syringe pump
     152 as shown in Figs. 37 and 38 versus grip 149 shown in Fig. 36.
             [0119] Syringe pump 152 is shown in more detail in Fig. 39. Pump 152 includes a
    stepper motor 154, gears 156, guide rails 158 and a concave push plate 160 that self-centers
    on the end of the syringe plunger 150. Air exits syringe 148 above the heparin and is purged
    during the priming of the extracorporeal circuit because syringe 148 is inverted for use.
    Stepper motor 154 increments 0.9 degrees per step in one implementation. Pump 152 and
    assembly 144 are sized to accept nearly any size of syringe 148. The user inputs the syringe
   stroke length and syringe stroke volume into system 10. System 10 can thereafter detennine
   the volume of heparin to be delivered.
            [0120] Smaller syringes 148 are visible through a window 162 in the side of the pump
   as shown in Fig. 40. Larger syringes housings are visible since they are not inserted into
   syringe pump 152 and remain outside of instrument 20 as illustrated in Fig. 38.        Should a
  saline or dialysate bag leak, or be spilled, onto instrument 20, the liquid could flow into the
  heparin pump and out the opening in side window 162 but would not flow inside the
  instrument, where the fluid could damage instrument 20.
           [0121] Figs. 41 and 42 illustrate that heparin line 146 passes through an air bubble
 detector 164 to cassette 40. System 10 introduces heparin into the patient's blood stream at
 the outlet 166 of the blood pump just before the blood passes into the dialyzer. The internal
 volume of the heparin line is essentially that of a very small diameter tube of minimum
 length. A diaphragm actuated pinch valve 165 (plunger only shown in Fig. 41), which does
 not add to the internal volume of the heparin line, can be provided to block the flow of
heparin to cassette 40.
          [0122] Fig. 43 illustrates a support rod 168 that collapses into instrument 20 when not
in use. Support rod 168 supports a saline bag 170 that is used for priming system 10 and
rinsing blood back to the patient at the end of the therapy.            Alternatively, rod 168 is
detachable from instrument 20 when not in use.
                                                 16

               [0123] Figs. 43 and 44 illustrate that saline line 172 enters instrument 20 adjacent to
      the entry of heparin line 164 (see also Fig. 41). Fig. 45 illustrates that two saline flow control
     valves 174a and 174b are located on each side of blood pump tubing loop 44. The center port
     from each of the valves feeds directly into blood flow into, or coming from, the blood pump
     as shown in Fig. 46. The third saline valve 174c is located on the backside of cassette 40 as
     seen in Figs. 45 and 46 and is positioned to put saline directly into a venous air separation
     (drip) chamber 176. The saline valve 174a on the blood pump outlet, and the saline valve
     174b leading to dialyzer 36, are opened sequentially to gravity prime the arterial blood line
    and the venous drip chamber 176 as illustrated later in Fig. 54.
              [0124] As seen in Fig. 47, a normally evacuated dialyzer inlet line pressure transducer
    interface 178 is pressurized so that it operates as a flow control valve, preventing saline from
    backflowing into the dialyzer or filter 36. The gravity head from the saline bag causes saline
   to flow into the blood circuit and into the reversed rotating pump inlet 180 (the outlet under
   normal operating flow) when saline valve 174a is opened. The reversed flow blood pump
   head 22 draws saline from the saline bag and pumps it through reversed flow outlet 182 (the
   inlet under normal operating conditions) and down the arterial line 186.
             [0125] As seen in Fig. 48, the venous line 184 and arterial line 186 are connected in
   series during priming so that air is purged from both lines via venous line drip chamber 176
   shown in Fig. 49. Standard connections 188 (Fig. 48) can be used to connect the venous line
   184 and arterial line 186 in a closed loop. Gravity prevents air from being drawn from the
  saline bag as long as the bag contains saline.           Saline flows slowly into the venous air
  separation chamber 176 in a "reverse" direction (from normal blood flow) during priming.
            [0126] In Fig. 49, the inverted-U shaped venous air separation chamber 176 has a
  vent port 190 located at its top, so that air can gather there and be vented to the drain. Fig. 50
  shows a valve 196 located on the opposite side of the cassette 40 from vent port 190, which is
 opened whenever air needs to be vented from the chamber. A second vent valve 192 also
 shown in Fig. 50 can be placed optionally in series with first vent valve 196 and operated
 sequentially so that predetermined volumetric increments of air can be vented from system 10
 to a controlled vent volume 194 shown in Fig. 51. As seen in Fig. 51, port 190 connected to
the center of the cassette-based diaphragm valve 196 communicates with air separation
chamber 176 so that the "dead" volume needed for these apparatuses is minimized. Valve
196 seals well against the pressure present in the venous air separation chamber. Saline bags
can be replaced during a therapy since they can be primed directly into the drip chamber 176
using the third saline valve 174c (Fig. 49).

                    [0127] FIG. 52 is a schematic of one embodiment of a fluid
         management system associated with the disposable set. In general, the fluid
         management system includes a blood circuit 210 and a dialysate circuit 220.
         System 10 operates the disposable set to provide the hemodialysis therapy.
   5     Set 200 of FIGS. 53A and 53B illustrates an embodiment of a disposable set
        200 operable with system 10. Disposable set 200 includes cassette 40, filter
        36, pump tubes 44, supply tubes 38, balance tubes 202, arterial line 184 and
        venous line 186, etc., discussed herein.
                   [0128] Once disposable set 200 has been loaded into the hemodialysis
 10     system 10, dialysate bags 140 have been connected, the saline bag 170 (FIG.
        43) has been connected and the heparin syringe 148 has been loaded, system
        10 primes itself automatically starting with the blood side circuit. The heparin
        pump plunger 150 is moved forward until heparin is detected by heparin line air
       detector AD-HL shown in FIG. 52. Heparin valve V-H is then closed. Next,
 15    saline is flowed from the saline bag 170 into the blood side circuit 210 as
       illustrated in FIG. 54, first through valve V-SA and then through valve V-SDC. A
       level sensor L-ATB in the AIR TRAP drip chamber detects saline flow into the
      drip chamber 176 and determines when to close valves V-SA and V-SDC.
                  [0129] As shown in FIG. 55, the post pump blood valve V-PPB is then
20    closed, V-SV is opened and PUMP-Blood pumps saline in a reverse flow
      direction, Pressure sensor P-VL and level sensor L-ATB are used to determine
      when to open air vent valves V-AVB-P and V-AVB-S. The blood pump pushes
      the saline backwards down the arterial line and into the venous line. When
      saline reaches the venous air separator (drip chamber 176), the air will be
25   separated from the fluid and will be discharged into a drain line 206 through
     vent valves V-AVB-P and V-AVB-S until the air separation chamber 176 is
     flooded with saline.
                 [0130] Next, as seen in FIG. 55, saline is flowed up into the bottom of
     dialyzer 36 and up through its hollow fibers. Valve V-PPB is controllably
                                                 18

    opened so that the air that exits the top of the dialyzer 36 flows into the priming
    loop, becomes separated in air trap 176 and discharged to drain 206. Saline is
    also flowed through pours of the fibers of dialyzer 36 to fill the housing of
    dialyzer 36. System 10 monitors the pressure in the venous line using pressure
 5  sensor P-VL to maintain the blood side circuit 210 at a controlled pressure
    during priming.
             [0031] As seen in FIG. 56, spent dialysate pump, PUMP-DS and
   valves V-DS, V-B1-SI, V-B1-SO and V-DD vent air from the dialyzer housing to
   drain 206. Valves V-DI-VEN, CK-VEN, V-Di-FIL, V-DI-PRE and CK-PRE are
10 opened controllably to allow a predetermined volume of saline to be pushed
   into the dialysate circuit 220, purging air from
                                           182

     associated dialysate lines. A second saline bag 170 can be replaced during a therapy by
     selecting "replace saline bag", causing the saline line to be primed automatically into the air
     trap 176.
             [0132] As shown in Fig. 56, dialysate valve V-DBl that is associated with the
     dialysate bag on the top shelf is opened so that dialysate can flow into the inlet of dialysate
    PUMP-DF.       PUMP-DF pushes the dialysate through the inline fluid heater and into a
    dialysate side air trap 208. Dialysate flows out the bottom of the air trap 208, through valve
    V-Fl and into balance tube B2, through valve V-B2-FI, pushing fluid out the other side of
    balance tube B2. The fluid exiting the other side of balance tube B2 flows through valve V
    B2-SO and into the dialysate recirculating circuit 203 through valve V-DR. The recirculating
    circuit 223 tees into the supply line circuit 205 at the inlet to PUMP-DF.        Pump-DS is
   operating at the same time drawing air, dialysate and/or saline from the blood side of the
   dialyzer, though the dialysate side of the dialyzer, into the remainder of the dialysate circuit.
   PUMP-DS pushes the fluid through valve V-BI-SI and into balance tube B], pushing fluid
   out the other side of balance tube Bl.     The fluid exiting the other side of balance tube BI
   flows through valve V-B I -FO and valve V-DI-FIL into the dialysate side of the dialyzer 36.
            [0133] Fig. 57 is similar to Fig. 56 except the roles of balance tubes 202 BI and B2
  are reversed. As fluid enters the dialysate circuit 220, the pressure in the circuit increases,
  forcing air to be discharged under pressure to drain line 206 through open vent valves V
  AVD-P and V-AVD-S.
           [0134] Fig. 58 illustrates balance tubes 202. Instrument 20 includes pairs of optical
  sensors (not shown) operable with balance tubes 202 to determine an end of travel of a
 separator 212 located within each balance tube 202. The optical sensors in one embodiment
 are reflective, so that an emitter and receiver of each sensor can be on the same (e.g., non
 door) side of balance tube 202.        The sensors alternatively include emitters and receivers
 located on opposite sides of balance tubes 202. Outlets 214 on both ends of both balance
tubes 202 are at the balance tube tops when mounted for operation as shown if Fig. 58, so that
air will pass through the balance tubes and not become trapped in the tubes as long as system
 10 is level. Mechanical stops 216 limit the movement of separators 212 to that visible to the
optical sensors.
          [0135] Fig. 59 illustrates HHD system 10 performing hemodialysis.          Here, fresh
dialysate is pushed from balance tubes 202 to dialyzer 36 via valve V-DI-FIL, while spent
dialysate is removed from dialyzer 36 via valve V-DS to balance tubes 202.

       blood circuit 210 during therapy.
                 [0140] FIG. 64 illustrates one embodiment for recirculating fresh
      dialysate through Fluid Heater and recirculating circuit 223 and balance tubes
      B1 and B2 to remove UF. In FIG. 64, pump-DF pumps fluid in a loop that
20    includes Fluid Heater since valve V-DBY is open. Valve V-Fl is closed so no
     fresh dialysate is delivered to balance chambers 202. Pump-DS pulls spent
     fluid from the dialyzer 36 through valve V-DS and pushes the spent fluid
     through valve V-B1-SI and into the right side of balance tube B1.      Fresh fluid
     then flows from the left side of balance tube B1 through valves V-B2-FI and
25   V-B2-FI and into the left side of balance tube B2. Spent fluid then flows out the
     right side of balance tube B2 through valves V-B2-SO and V-DD and into the
     drain line. In this manner, a volume of spent fluid is sent to drain 206 without a
     corresponding volume of fresh fluid delivered from supply bags 140 to either
     balance chamber B1 or B2.

            [0143] FIGS. 67A to 67C illustrate a cassette interface assembly 250,
   which houses, among other items, cassette interface 50, door latch 24, heater
   26, a bellows bladder 252 and an internal module 260. Internal module 260 is
10 bounded by interface plate 50 and a back
                                          ,)nn

     plate 254.    Internal module 260 houses a plurality of gaskets 256, a pneumatic valve
      assembly 258, a pinch valve assembly 262, and a plurality of manifold plates 264.
              [0144] All or most all of the valves, pressure sensors, level sensors, etc., can be
     removed without disassembly of subassembly 250. The inductive heater mechanism 26 and
     bellows bladder 252 (different from bladder 92 above) require removal of internal module
     260. To this end, four screws 266, each with a spring 268, fix a housing 270 of subassembly
     250 to internal module 260. Internal module 260 can be unbolted from screws 266, so that
     springs 268 push internal module 260 forward and out of the housing 270. Power and control
    connections (not shown) to subassembly 250 are also disconnected to remove internal module
    260 completely.
             [0145] As seen additionally in Figs. 68 to 70, four springs 268 on the backside of
    subassembly 250 retract the internal interface module 260 when bellows bladder 252 is not
    pressurized by pushing screens away from housing 270 and pulling interface module 260
    along with the screws. When the bellows bladder 252 is pressurized, internal module 260 is
   pushed forward and applies pressure to cassette 40, pushing the cassette against a door
   gasket, which seals fluid pathways on both the front side and the rear side of the cassette 40.
   The membrane gaskets 256 on the internal module 260 mate up against the faceplate 50 of
   the interface module 250. The faceplate 50 is configured so that it can support a vacuum
   between the cassette sheeting and pressure sensors, liquid level sensors, etc., bringing the
  sensors into intimate contact with the cassette sheeting and the fluid on the other side of the
  sheeting. System 10 is also configured to port a vacuum between the cassette sheeting and
  the thin sections of the membrane gasket 256 above the valves. This vacuum can be used to
  detect holes, tears or slits in the cassette sheeting before, and during a therapy.
           [01461 Fig. 71 is a view of the backside of system 10 with the cover removed. The
 open space houses interface assembly 250, hinged shelves 16, peristaltic pump motors 120 a
 pneumatic pump, a power supply, battery and electronics that operate the system.
           [0147] Fig. 72 illustrates system 10 operating alternatively with an online dialysate
 generation system 300. System 300 generates dialysate online or on-demand, eliminating
 bags 140, shelves 16 and multiple supply tubes 38. A single supply tube 38 feeds from
generation system 300 to instrument 20. Water inlet line 302 and drain lines 304 lead to and
from generation system 300, respectively.
          [0148] Figs. 73A, 73B and 74 illustrate a cassette 40 diaphragm valve chamber
configuration 280, which solves an inherent problem with diaphragm valves have when
attempting to seal against downstream pressure because the pressure that is trying to seal off
                                                   21

      the valve is acting on an area that is just slightly larger than an area upon which the
      downstream pressure is acting. The difference between the two areas is the area defined by
     the top of the "volcano". Also, if the downstream fluid volume is completely fixed when the
     diaphragm valve closes, further movement of the diaphragm is prevented after the initiation
     of the seal because of the incompressibility of the trapped fluid. The result is that the
     downstream pressure equals the valve sealing pressure. Diaphragm valve configuration 280
     provides a diaphragm valve that can seal against both upstream and downstream pressure via
     a connection of two diaphragm valve chambers 282 and 284 placed in series. Diaphragm
    valve chambers 282 and 284 are connected fluidly via a compliance chamber 286, which
    allows sheeting seals 288 of the cassette sheeting to close around respective volcano ports
    290 of both valve chambers 282 and 284.
            [0149] Chamber configuration 280 in both Figs. 73A and 73B includes a rigid middle
    or base wall 281 from which valve ports 290 and the valve chamber walls extend upwardly.
    Wall 281 defines an aperture 283 for each valve chamber 282 and 284. Fluid communicates
   between valve chambers 282 and 284 and compliance chamber 286 via apertures 283.
           [0150] Fig. 73A shows a cross-section of two diaphragm valve chambers 282 and 284
   with an integral compliance chamber 286, wherein the diaphragms can readily close seals 288
   to ports 290. Here, a vacuum is applied to a lower diaphragm 289 at the compliance chamber
   286. Diaphragm 289 is flexible and has a relatively large cross-sectional area to absorb the
  kinetic energy created by a pneumatic valve actuator applying a positive pressure Pa, such
  that the positive sealing pressure applied to one valve chamber 282 or 284 is much less likely
  to harm an existing seal of a fluidly connected upstream or downstream valve chambers. The
 negative pressure pulls sheeting 288 down around ports 290 and allows valve chamber 282 or
 284 to be sealed against the backpressure applied by its own sealing pressure (around the
 outside of port 290) plus backpressure from a fluidly connected upstream or downstream
 valve chamber residing up through the center of port 290,
          [0151] Compliance chamber 286 as seen in Fig. 73B is configured a little bit
 differently and uses a portion of the membrane or sheeting seals 288 of valve chambers 282
and 284 to provide a compliant material covering a relatively large cross-sectional area 292
of chamber 286. Here, a vacuum applied to sheeting 288 at chamber 286 negates the positive
pressure Pc applied around the outside of ports 290 and expands the relatively large area 292
of the valve seal sheeting, pulling sheeting 288 down around the outside of port 290. The
configuration of Fig. 73B is advantageous in one respect because positive and negative
                                                22

      pressures are applied to the same side of the cassette at chamber configuration 280, such that
      associated pneumatics can be located on a single side of the cassette..
              [0152] By changing the pressure seen at compliance chamber 286 from a positive
      pressure when the valve chambers 282 and 284 are open to a negative value after the valve
      chambers results in that only the liquid side center of the volcano port 290 is exposed to high
      positive pressure. The liquid annular area of valve chambers 282 and 284 on the outside of
      volcano ports 290 sees the applied vacuum, which allows the air sealing pressure on the
     outside of the cassette to seal against backpressures that would have otherwise forced it open.
     This allows valve chambers 282 and 284 to seals well in both upstream and downstream
     configurations.
             [0153] In one example, suppose the total seal area of valve chambers 282 and 284 is
     one square inch and that the sealing area at the top of volcano port 290 is 0.1 square inch over
    the volcano. A positive ten psig air pressure would then apply an external force of 10 lbs to
    the entire valve chamber 282 or 284. A backpressure on the annular fluid side of the
    associated port 290 from the applied ten psig pressure plus a backpressure the backpressure
   up through the center of port 290 from a downstream sealed valve would exert almost the
   same opposite "unsealing" force of ten pound (only difference would be the small annular
   area of port 290 at the top, which is a function of the port wall thickness and the diameter of
   the tube), resulting in a potentially leaky valve chamber 282 or 284. A higher positive
   pressure, e.g., twenty psig, could be applied to valve chamber 282 or 284 forcing sheeting
   288 to seal to port 290 against the 10 psig backpressure, however, the noise generated to
  create the twenty psig air pressure could objectionable to the user. There would also be no
  redundancy in the different valve pressures.
            [0154] Back to back valve chambers 282 and 284 of Figs. 73A and 73B, on the other
 hand, separated by an applied negative pressure, e.g., 5 psig vacuum, both seal independently
 well. The ten psig air pressure would still apply 10 lbs external force to seal both valves 282
 and 284, however, the 10 psig pressure at the center of the volcano port 290 and the -5 psig
 pressure on the annular area around the volcano would apply a total pressure of ten psig * 0.1
 sq in + (- 5 psig) * 0.9 sq in = -3.5 lbs. The net force to close the valve would be 13.5 lbs so
that valve would seal very well.
          [0155] It may be possible to not use a separate vacuum and instead rely on the
expansion of the flexible part of the compliance chamber 286 to absorb energy from the
backpressure from one valve chamber 282 or 284 applied to the other valve chamber 282 or
284. Here, apertures 283 allow the pressurized fluid inside chambers 282 and 284 and
                                                  23

    around ports 290 to communicate with fluid inside compliance chamber 286 and expand
    diaphragm 289 or sheeting area 292, allowing the backpressure around ports 290 to dissipate.
            [0156] Valves V-DI-PRE, CK-PRE, V-DI-VEN and CK-VEN in Fig. 52 (and other
    flow schematics) and valve chambers 282 and 284 of valve configuration 280 of cassette 40
    shown in Fig. 74 are constructed as shown schematically in Figs. 73A and 73B and can seal
    against higher pressure in either direction. That is, not only does compliance chamber 286
   serve to not disrupt an existing upstream or downstream first valve chamber closure when a
   second valve chamber in fluid communication with the first valve chamber is opened,
   compliance chamber 286 also aids in the closure of a first valve chamber when a second
   valve chamber in communication with the first valve chamber (upstream or downstream) has
   been closed previously, which could otherwise create positive fluid pressure against which
  the closure of the first valve chamber would have to fight.
           [0157] Fig. 75 illustrates that system 10 in one embodiment includes a wide pump
  head 22 that drives two dialysate pump segments 44 to mix two solutions in a ratio that is
  approximately equal to the ratio of the tube inside diameters squared (mix ratio = (ID /ID2) ),
                                                                                           1  2
  assuming the wall thicknesses of tubes 44 is the same. For a 1:1 mix ratio, consecutive
  segments of tubing from the same roll of tubing can be taken to provide segments of the same
  wall thickness and good mixing accuracy. Mixing accuracy is optimized because the inlet
 pressure on the supply lines is controlled within about four inches of water column by the bag
 manager, the tubing inner diameter is controlled during the manufacture of the disposable set,
 the pump race diameters are the same and the pump actuator rotational speed is the same for
 the parallel tubing segments. System 10 also ensures that an initial supply fluid temperature
 of each of the different dialysis fluids in tubes 44 is within a few degrees of each other.
         [0158] It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the
presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of
the present subject matter and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore
intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.
