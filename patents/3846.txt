   Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments of the Invention
15
   Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary aspects of the present invention that
   are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference
   numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.
20 FIG. 1 shows a telecommunications connection cabinet 100 such as might be mounted on a
   pedestal or other mount in an area where fiber optic connectivity for customers is desired.
   Cabinet 100 provides a location for outside plant fiber optic cables to be connected to fiber
   optic distribution cables. The distribution cables are then lead to customer equipment to
   provide fiber optic service and connectivity at the customer's location. A typical
25 arrangement for providing service to customers might include utilizing a splitter to break
   the signal from an outside plant (OSP) cable into a plurality of distribution cables, each
   distribution cable providing a connection to a particular piece of customer equipment. A
   common splitter might separate the optic signal within the OSP cable into thirty-two
   individual signals and also combine those thirty-two signals into the OSP cable in a bi
30 directional communication configuration. Cabinet 100 is similar in nature to that disclosed
   in the commonly-owned U.S. Patent Application serial no. 10/613,764, filed on July 2,
   2003, entitled "Telecommunications Connection Cabinet," the disclosure of which is

                                                                  -6
   incorporated herein by reference.
   A plurality of cables 108 connected to the customer equipment may be directed into
   cabinet 100. One or more OSP cables 106 may be directed into cabinet 100 to a splice
 5 arrangement, such as a splice tray or panel 110. OSP cables 106 may be spliced within
   splice panel 110 to a secondary cable 104. Secondary cable 104 is directed from splice
   panel 110 to a first cable management structure 112 and lead to a splitter 102 within a
   splitter mounting area 103. Splitter 102 separates the optical signal transmitted over OSP
   cable 106 and secondary cable 104 into up to thirty-two signals directed into an equal
10 number of fiber distribution cables 114. Cables 114 are directed from splitter 102 through
   cable management area 112 and into a second cable management and slack storage area
   116 including a plurality of cable slack storage spools 117. From slack storage area 116,
   cables 114 may be directed to either a connector holder within an excess cable storage area
   118 or to an adapter within an adapter array 120. Each of these cables 114 are preferably
15 terminated with a fiber optic connector.
   Within excess cable storage area 118, a plurality of connector holders 122 are installed
   within mounting slots in a bulkhead 124. Connector holder 122 (described in further detail
   below) includes a plurality of openings for receiving and releasably holding the fiber optic
20 connector. The openings in connector holder 122 preferably do not provide a continuous
   optical path but rather house and protect a polished end face of an optical fiber within each
   cable 114 which is mounted to the terminal fiber optic connector. This protection may be
   provided in combination with an endcap, such as shown in commonly-owned U.S. Patent
   Application serial no. 10/610,325, filed on June 30, 2003, entitled "Fiber Optic Connector
25 Holder and Method," the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
   Alternatively, connector holder 122 may enclose and protect the polished end face of the
   connector terminating cable 114 without the need for a protective endcap.
   Within adapter array 120, a plurality of fiber optic adapters 123 are mounted which receive
   the connector terminating cable 114. The connector of cable 114 is received within an
30 opening in a front side of an adapter 123. Adapter 123 also includes an opening on an
   opposite rear side which is adapted to receive a connector terminating one of the customer

    l:\hml\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\IIML\16239378_l.docx-2 01 2018
                                                                  -7
   equipment cables 108. Adapters 123 within adapter array 120 may optically connect one of
   the cables 114 to one of the cables 108, for transmission of an optical signal from OSP
   cable 106 to the customer equipment connected to that cable 108. Such cable terminating
   connectors and adapters 123 are well known in the industry. As shown in FIG. 1, the
 5 connectors are SC connectors and it is anticipated that other types, formats, styles and sizes
   of telecommunications connectors may be used.
   Cabinet 100 includes a front 126, a pair of opposing sides 128, a rear wall 130, a base 132
   and a top 134, all cooperating to define an interior 136 within which the various
10 components described above are mounted. The components are accessible through an
   opening 140 in front 126 which may be closed off by a pair of doors 138.
   Referring now to FIG. 2, an alternative embodiment 200 of a telecommunications
   connection cabinet includes the same components as cabinet 100. Some of the components
15 are altered in appearance or location but the functional characteristics are similar to cabinet
    100. Cabinet 100 includes a pair of adapter array panels 121, and each panel 121 includes a
   total of four rows of eighteen adapters 123, or seventy-two adapters 123. Cabinet 200
   includes three such adapter array panels, totaling two hundred sixteen adapters 123. Both
   cabinets 100 and 200 include a single bulkhead 124 within excess cable storage area 118.
20 Each bulkhead 124 includes openings for mounting three rows of three connector holders
    122. Each connector holder 122 includes a total of eight openings for receiving, storing
   and protecting eight cable connectors of cables 114, providing total storage for up to
   seventy-two connectors.
25 Referring now to FIG. 3, a bulkhead 224 is shown with nine openings 226 in a front face
   228 including a rear surface 229, and one connector holder 122 positioned within one of
   the openings 226. A pair of opposing sidewalls 230 extend rearward from opposite ends of
   front face 228 to a pair of mounting flanges 232. Mounting flanges 232 include fastener
   openings 234 for mounting bulkhead 224 to one of a cabinet 100 or 200, or a similarly
30 configured cabinet. Bulkhead 224 is similar to bulkhead 124 in FIGS. 1 and 2, except
   configured so that front face 228 would be angled toward one side of the cabinet within

    l:\hml\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\IIML\16239378_l.docx-2 01 2018
                                                                  -8
   which it is mounted. Angling of bulkheads including devices for receiving fiber optic
   connectors is known in the industry and provides for improved cable management and
   density of installation while aiding in bend radius protection, among other advantages. As
   shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, above, bulkhead 124 has equal length sidewalls 230 so that
 5 bulkhead 124 is not angled toward either side of cabinet 100 or 200.
   Each opening 226 includes a first or top end 227 and a second or bottom end 225. A pair of
   ears 236 are positioned one each in a pair of opposing sides extending from top end 227 to
   bottom end 225, the ears 226 cooperating with a keying feature 238 on connector holder
10  122 to orient connector holder 122 within opening 226. Connector holder 122 includes a
   releasable latch 240 at one end and a tab 242 on the opposite end (shown in FIGS. 4 to 6,
   below) which cooperate to releasably hold connector holder 122 within opening 226. It is
   desirable that the direction of force that may be applied to connector holder 122 by tension
   in cables 114 be controlled to prevent accidental release of connector holder 122 from
15 opening 226. Keying features 238 and ears 236 cooperate to ensure that connector holder
    122 is properly oriented within opening 226 to resist accidental release caused by such
   cable tension.
   Openings 226 within front face 228 of bulkhead 224 (and bulkhead 124) are sized to also
20 receive up to eight adapters 123 when connector holders 122 are not in position. This
   allows bulkheads 124 and 224 to provide additional space for optically connecting cables
    114 with customer equipment cables 108 for added connection capacity with cabinets 100
   and 200, as well as similarly configured cabinets.
25 Referring now to FIGS. 4 to 13, connector holder 122 includes a housing 160 with eight
   openings 150 for receiving and releasably holding connectors of cables 114. As described
   above, cables 114 are terminated by an SC style connector and openings 150 are
   configured to receive and releasably hold an SC connector. As shown in FIGS. 4 to 6,
   openings 150 extend through housing 160 from a front 162 to a rear 164 and can each
30 receive a connector of a cable 114 with a dust cap about the polished end face of the
   optical fiber held by cable 114 and the connector. Such a dust cap is shown in the above-

    l:\hml\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\IIML\16239378_l.docx-2 01 2018
                                                                  -9
   referenced and incorporated U.S. Patent Applications. Alternatively, openings 150 might
   be close-ended so that the polished end face of the connector can be protected from
   contamination with or without a dust cap.
 5 Housing 160 includes a first end or top 152 and a second end or bottom 154. Releasable
   latch 240 is mounted to top 152 and tab 242 is in bottom 154. Extending between top 152
   and bottom 154 along sides 166 of housing 160 are rails 156. Keying feature 238 is
   positioned along rail 156 and extends beyond a rear face 158 of rail 156. A portion of
   housing 160 extending beyond rear face 158 of rail 156 is sized to fit within opening 226.
10 When inserted within opening 226, rear face 158 of rail 156 engages front face 228 and
   keying feature 238 engages one of the ears 236 to properly orient top 152 and bottom 154
   of housing 160.
   To insert housing 160 within opening 226, bottom 154 is first positioned within opening
15 226 through front face 228 so that a locking face 243 of tab 242 is behind front face 228 at
   bottom end 225 and engages rear surface 229 of front face 228. Top 152 is then inserted
   within opening 226. A ramped face 244 of releasable latch 240 engages top end 227 of
   opening 226 and deflects to permit ramped face 244 and locking face 241 of releasable
   latch 240 to pass through opening 226. Locking face 241 of releasable latch 240 engages
20 rear surface 229. Opposing both locking faces 241 and 243 are rear faces 158 of rails 156,
   which are engaging front face 228. Both keying features 238 engage ears 236 of opening
   226. Releasable latch 240 includes a finger tab 246 which may be depressed to retract
   locking face 241 so that locking face 241 disengages from rear surface 229 and permits
   removal of housing 160 from opening 226. Housing 160 is configured to be inserted
25 through front face 228 of bulkheads 124 or 224 when cabinet 100 or 200 is access through
   opening 140 in front 126.
   Referring now to FIGS. 7 to 13, housing 160 of connector holder 122 includes an
   orientation slot 170 and latching arms 168 within each opening 150. Latching arms 168
30 cooperate with latching features of an SC style adapter to allow such connectors to be
   releasably held within openings 150. For other styles and types of connectors, different

    l:\hml\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\IIML\16239378_l.docx-2 01 2018
                                                                  - 10
   latching features might be included within opening 150 to permit these connectors to be
   releasably held. Orientation slot 170 may cooperate with an orientation feature on the
   exterior of an SC connector to orient all connectors within openings 150 in the same
   fashion. Such orientation of connectors is not essential for SC connectors, which have
 5 generally symmetrical latching features, but may be desirable for other connectors with
   different latching configurations.
   Referring now to FIG. 14, splitter 102 includes a housing 172 with a cable entry 174 for
   secondary cable 104 and a pair of cable exits 176 for cables 114. As shown, each cable exit
10  176 allows for up to sixteen cables 114 to exit housing 172. Terminating each cable 114 is
   a connector 180 with a polished end face 182, shown as an SC connector. Other sizes and
   layouts of cable exits are anticipated. Different numbers of cables 114 may exit housing
    172, depending on the connection requirements to be satisfied and the optical splitter
   arrangement within splitter 102. Mounted to one side of housing 172 is a releasable latch
15  178 to hold splitter 102 within splitter mounting area 103 of cabinet 100 or 200, or
   similarly configured telecommunications connection cabinets.
   FIG. 14A shows a fiber optic device module 202 similar in layout to splitter 102 with
   secondary cable 104 and a plurality of cables 114. Secondary cable 104 may be a single
20 strand cable and module 202 may include a splitter to connector cable 104 with cables 114,
   such as described above with regard to module 102. Alternatively, cable 104 may be a
   multi-strand cable and module 202 may serve only as a fan-out module separating the
   strands into cables 114. Each of the cables 114 are terminated by a connector 180 and each
   connector 180 is inserted within a connector holder 122. Such a module 202 may be used
25 in the method of adding connection capacity described below.
   A method of adding connection capacity to cabinet 100 might include installing a
   preconfigured splitter 102 in combination with one or more connector holders 122. It is
   desirable to provide for easy field expansion of connection capacity within cabinet 100 so
30 that cabinet 100 does need to anticipate the ultimate connection configuration for a

                                                                  - 11
   enough connection capacity to serve the immediate need forecasted for a customer area
   and allow for incremental expansion as more connections are needed in the area. The
   following method of adding connection capacity to cabinet 100 is also applicable to
   cabinet 200 and may be used to initially configure cabinet 100 prior to installation or to
 5 expand the capacity of cabinet 100 in the field.
   To increase connection capacity within cabinet 100, a splitter 102 preconfigured with a
   cable 104 and thirty-two cables 114 terminated by connectors 180 is used. The splitter 102
   is mounted within splitter mounting area 103 and the free end of cable 104 is led into cable
10 management structure 112 and to splice panel 110. In splice panel 110, the free end of
   cable 104 is spliced into an end of an OSP cable 106. This splice optically connects OSP
   cable 106 to each of the cables 114, Connectors 180 of cables 114 are pre-inserted within
   four connector holders 122. Cables 114 are led from splitter 102 through cable
   management structure 112 to second cable management structure 116 where excess cable
15 length may be retained within the cable slack storage arrangement. Since splitter 102 may
   be preconfigured for use with different cabinets as well as cabinet 100, the length of cables
    114 of splitter may be longer than required for cabinet 100 and this excess length may be
   held about the cable slack storage spools 117 (see FIG. 1).
20 From second cable management area 116, cables 114 and connector holders 122 with
   connectors 180 inserted are positioned within excess cable storage area 118. Each
   connector holder 122 is simply snapped into one of the openings 226 of bulkhead 124.
   Addition of extra connection capacity is now completed. When a customer connection is
   required, a customer equipment cable 108 is led into cabinet 100 and terminated with a
25 connector 180. This connector is inserted within a rear opening of an adapter 123 within
   adapter array 120. Alternatively, when cabinet 100 is installed, the rear of all adapters 123
   in adapter 122 may have customer equipment cables 108 prewired and these cables led to
   the customer premises in anticipation of future customer hookups. When such a prewired
   customer desires a live connection, a cable 114 merely needs to be inserted into the front of
30 the appropriate adapter 123. One of the cables 114 within excess cable storage area 118 is
   selected and its connector 180 is removed from connector holder 118. The selected cable

    l:\hml\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\IIML\16239378_l.docx-2 01 2018
                                                                  - 12
    114 is re-routed within second cable management area 116 as needed to provide a desired
   length of cable and the connector 180 is inserted within the appropriate adapter 123 in
   adapter array 120. If connector 180 of the selected cable 114 includes a dust cap to protect
   the polished end face of the fiber, this dust cap is removed prior to insertion into the
 5 adapter 123.
   Splitter 102 includes thirty-two cables 114 and connectors 180, inserted within four
   connector holders 122 when splitter 102 is installed. As these cables 114 and connectors
    180 are transferred into adapter array 120, some or all of the connector holders 122 may be
10 emptied of all connectors 180. When this happens, the empty connector holder 122 may be
   removed from excess cable storage area 118 and discarded or recycled. Removal of these
   empty connector holders 122 would free openings 226 in bulkhead 124 to permit connector
   holders of additional splitters 102 to be installed and more capacity to be added to cabinet
    100.
15
   If a connection to customer equipment needs to be terminated, the connector 180 of the
   appropriate cable 114 may be removed from the adapter 123. The cable 114 is then
   rerouted within the cable management structure 116 and the connector 180 inserted within
   an opening 150 of a connector holder 122 within excess cable storage area 118.
20
   Splitter mounting area 103 of cabinet 100 includes spaces to mount up to four splitters 102,
   while cabinet 200 provides spaces to mount up to eight splitters 102. Thus configured,
   cabinet 100 has a capacity to connect up to split up to four OSP cables into thirty-two
   cables 114 each, or up to a total of one hundred twenty eight cables 114. Within adapter
25 array 120 there are a sufficient number of adapters 123 to permit connection of each of
   these cables 114 to a corresponding customer equipment cable 108.
   However, cabinet 200 has the capacity to split up to eight OSP cables into thirty-two
   cables 114 each, or up to a total of two hundred fifty-six cables 114. Adapter array 120 in
30 cabinet 200 only provides a total of two hundred sixteen adapters 123 for receiving
   connectors from cables 114. Once adapter array 120 has been fully populated with cables

    l:\hml\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\IIML\16239378_l.docx-2 01 2018
                                                                  - 13
    114, there may be up to forty excess cables 114 within excess cable storage area 118 which
   are not provided with an adapter 123 for connection with a customer equipment cable 108.
   As shown in FIGS. 4 to 13, housing 160 of connector holder 122 with eight openings 150
 5 has generally the same footprint as an array of eight adapters 123. When adapter array 120
   has been fully populated with cables 114 from splitters 102, connector holders 122 may be
   removed from openings 226 in bulkhead 124 and up to eight adapters 123 may be
   positioned in each opening 226. By fully filling five of the openings in bulkhead 124 with
   adapters 123, an additional forty cables 114 can be connected with customer equipment
10 cables 108, effectively increasing the capacity of adapter array 120 so that the forty excess
   cables 114 may be utilized. Even with five of the openings 226 in used by adapters 123,
   there are still openings 226 remaining for connector holders 122 so that cables 114 can be
   stored when connections with customer equipment cables are eliminated or changed.
