CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]      This application claims priority from US 14/869,038 filed on 29 September
2015, the contents of which are to be taken as incorporated herein by this reference. The
present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application No.
<removed-apn> filed on 16 September 2016, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated
herein by reference.
FIELD
[0002]      One or more embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate to
systems and methods for detecting an operative condition of a machine.
BACKGROUND
[0003]      Some industrial machines (e.g., locomotives, trucks, earth-moving equipment,
windmills, and the like) include assemblies (e.g., mechanical drive trains) that operate
within environments such that they endure one or more of thermal stress, torsional stress,
and shock and vibration. It may be desirable to monitor a condition of an assembly so that
the assembly may be replaced or repaired before severe or permanent damage is sustained.
[0004]      Sometimes, fluid lubricants may provide lubrication and cooling to increase
performance of the machine and/or to increase the lifetime operation of the machine. In
one example, speed control from a traction motor or other provider of mechanical power
may be accomplished with a gear train or drive train. Gear trains may include at least two
gears that engage each other. For instance, teeth of a first gear (e.g., pinion gear) may
engage teeth of a larger gear at a gear mesh. Gears may be lubricated by a lubricant (e.g.,
oil) to reduce the friction between the gears and to facilitate the dissipation of heat that is
generated during operation. In order for the gears to be suitably lubricated, a designated
amount of lubricant is available for use by the gears.
[0005]      A gear train may include a gear case that surrounds one or more parts of the
gear train. The gear case has a reservoir for holding the lubricant. At least one of the
gears may move through the reservoir to lubricate the gear and consequently the gear
mesh. At least one of the gears may be coupled to a shaft that projects out of the gear
                                              1

case. To prevent leakage from the reservoir or the gear case, the interface between the
shaft(s) and the gear case is sealed. In one embodiment the gear train may include a U
tube coupled to the axle, and may have a reservoir for grease.
[0006]      The sealed interfaces may be exposed to harsh conditions. For example, gear
trains may be exposed to large differences in temperature, humid environments, dry
environments, abrasive dirt or grime, and/or challenging vibratory states.              These
conditions may cause a failure in the sealed interface thereby resulting in leakage of the
lubricant. When an insufficient supply of lubricant is available for the gears, the machine
may be susceptible to gear train or rolling element bearing damage that results in a locked
axle condition.
[0007]      In addition to having a sufficient amount of lubricant, it may be desirable for
the lubricant to have a sufficient quality during operation. For example, lubricants in a
reservoir can become contaminated by water, metallic particles, and non-metallic particles.
Contaminated fluids may lead to damaged parts or a decreased performance of the
machine. In addition, the lubricant may age due to repetitive thermal and viscous cycles
resulting in the loss of fluid properties such as viscosity.
[0008]      Conventional methods of inspecting fluids of a machine include visual
inspection of the fluid (e.g., dipsticks) or a sensor that is directly wired to a system.
However, these methods may not be practical and/or may have limited capabilities. For
example, due to the configuration of some machines, it may be difficult to visually inspect
the fluid. Also, hardwired sensors may not be suitable for machines that frequently move
and/or are exposed to harsh conditions.
[0009]      Battery life is a concern for wireless devices that are, for example, difficult to
access. Larger batteries may have longer life, but may not be suitable for applications that
have space constraints. Limitations on the capabilities of various sensors have restricted
their use. These limitations may include thermal resistance and current draw. Naturally,
the amount of current a sensor uses may not be as relevant if power can be supplied by a
wire, but in wireless systems the amount of current draw may prohibit sensors from use
entirely.  Additionally, the thermal capabilities for some sensors have precluded their
consideration for many applications. Accordingly, existing sensing devices often, if not
always, use a low temperature sensor with low power combination, particularly for
                                                2

wireless sensing applications.     Conversely, low and high temperature sensors with high
power combinations have been available for wired power applications.
[0010]      It may be desirable to have a system and method for inspecting machines that
differs from those that are currently available.
[0011]      The discussion of the background to the invention included herein including
reference to documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is included to explain
the context of the present invention.       This is not to be taken as an admission or a
suggestion that any of the material referred to was published, known or part of the
common general knowledge in Australia or in any other country as at the priority date of
any of the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0033]      One or more embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate to
systems and methods for detecting an operative condition of a machine.        Embodiments
described herein include various systems, assemblies, devices, apparatuses, and methods
that may be used in a connection with obtaining one or more measurements of a machine.
The measurement(s) may be representative or indicative of an operative condition of the
machine.
[0034]      As used herein, an "operative condition of the machine" may refer to an
operative condition of the machine as a whole or an operative condition of a component
(e.g., element, assembly, or sub-system) of the machine. The term "operative condition"
relates to a present state or ability of the component and/or a future state or ability. For
example, the measurement may indicate that a component is not functioning in a sufficient
manner, is damaged, is likely to be damaged if it continues to operate in a designated
manner, is not likely to perform appropriately under designated circumstances, and/or is
likely to cause damage to other components of the machine.
[0035]      As an example with respect to vehicles, one or more measurements obtained
from a vehicle may indicate that a lubricant in the component (e.g., drive train, gearbox,
                                               6

engine, and the like) is low or has an insufficient quality. Embodiments set forth herein
may generate an operating plan that is based on the measurement(s).       For instance, the
operating plan may include instructions to disable an axle or to limit tractive and/or
braking efforts of the axle. The operating plan may indicate which element of the gearbox
should be replaced and/or how the machine is to be operated until the gearbox is replaced.
Such operating plans are described in greater detail below.
[0036]       The measurement may be one of a plurality of measurements that are analyzed
according to embodiments described herein.      For instance, embodiments may comprise
analyzing multiple measurements that were obtained at different times from a single
sensor to determine an operative condition of the machine. By way of example, a series of
measurements from a single sensor in a gear case may indicate that a lubricant level has
substantially changed and, thus, the gear case is leaking.     Embodiments may include
analyzing measurements from a plurality of sensors of the same type.         For example,
machines may include multiple gearboxes. Vibration measurements from the gearboxes
may indicate that one of the gearboxes is operating differently than the others and, thus,
may be damaged or in need of maintenance.            Embodiments may include analyzing
different types of measurements to determine an operative condition of the machine. For
example, the vibration measurements may be analyzed in light of the speed at which the
gears are driven and/or current environmental conditions. Additional measurements or
factors are set forth below.
[0037]       The measurements may be wirelessly transmitted from a device to a reader,
which may be referred to as a receiver. For example, radio waves representative of the
measurement(s) may be transmitted from a transmitter (e.g., antenna) of the wireless
device to a remote reader. The reader may be a handheld reader (e.g., capable of being
carried in a single hand by a technician) or an otherwise movable reader.          In some
embodiments, the reader may have a fixed position. For example, for embodiments in
which the machine is a vehicle, the reader may have a stationary position along a
designated path that is traversed by the vehicle (e.g., railroad tracks, weighing stations,
tollbooths).   When a vehicle passes the reader, the reader may interrogate one or more
wireless devices to obtain measurements. Remote readers may also be located on-board
the vehicle. For example, a vehicle may have a control system that receives data from
                                             7

multiple sources, including one or more wireless devices that communicate the
measurements to the control system.
[0038]      The measurement may be detected or obtained by a sensor when the device
having the sensor is interrogated by the reader. Alternatively or additionally, the sensor
may     obtain   data   at    designated   intervals  (e.g.,  one   measurement/hour,   one
measurement/minute, and the like) and/or when a designated event occurs. For example,
measurements may only be obtained after the vehicle has been interrogated or after the
vehicle has remained stationary for a certain amount of time (e.g., ten minutes). In some
embodiments, the wireless device includes a storage unit (e.g., memory) where multiple
measurements may be stored or logged. The wireless devices may include a power source
that is integral to the device. Examples of electrical power sources include batteries and
energy harvesting devices. Energy harvesting devices convert energy in the surrounding
environment, such as kinetic energy (e.g., vibrations), thermal energy, and electromagnetic
energy. In particular embodiments, the wireless devices may include or be coupled to a
vibratory energy harvesting device that converts kinetic energy into electrical energy.
[0039]      The foregoing description of certain embodiments of the inventive subject
matter may be understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings. To the
extent that the figures illustrate diagrams of the functional blocks of various embodiments,
the functional blocks are not necessarily indicative of the division between hardware and
circuit. Thus, for example, one or more of the functional blocks (for example, controllers
or memories) may be implemented in a single piece of hardware (for example, a general
purpose signal processor, microcontroller, random access memory, hard disk, and the
like).   Similarly, the programs may be stand-alone programs, may be incorporated as
subroutines in an operating system, may be functions in an installed software package, and
the like. The various embodiments are not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality
shown in the drawings.
[0040]      Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a system 100 formed in accordance with
one embodiment.         The system may obtain one or more measurements that are
representative of an operative condition of a machine 102. The machine may include one
or more components, elements, assemblies, or sub-systems. The machine may be motive
or may be non-motive.          Suitable motive machines or vehicles may include on-road
vehicles and off-highway vehicles (e.g., vehicles that are not designed or allowed by law
                                                8

or regulation to travel on public roads, highways, and the like). Off-highway vehicles
include locomotives, mining vehicles, construction equipment, agricultural equipment,
industrial equipment, marine vessels, and the like. In some cases, the vehicle may be part
of a vehicle consist in which multiple vehicles are linked directly or indirectly to one
another in a common vehicle system (e.g., a train or a platoon of trucks).            In some
embodiments, the machine may be an automobile or truck.                A suitable non-motive
machine may be, for example, a wind turbine or a power-generating turbine.
[0041]      The operative condition may relate to a health or status of a designated
component of the machine.        Non-limiting examples of such components include a
gearbox, a gear case, a U-tube, an air compressor, a turbo-charger, or a drive train. The
measurement may be analyzed to determine, for example, that a component is damaged, is
operating improperly (e.g., insufficiently or not at all), and/or is operating in a manner that
will lead to or cause greater damage to the component or other component of the machine.
[0042]      In particular embodiments, the operative condition may be determined based
on an amount and/or a quality of liquid used by the machine and/or a vibratory state of the
machine. For instance, in some embodiments, the component may be a gear case that has
a reservoir for storing a lubricant liquid.   A low level or quantity of the liquid in the
reservoir may indicate that the gear case is damaged. In particular, a low level or quantity
may indicate that the gear case is leaking the liquid. In other embodiments, a component
may have a particular vibratory state(s) when the component is operating properly. For
example, a mechanical element may oscillate in a known or expected manner during
operation. However, if the mechanical element is damaged or operating improperly, the
mechanical element may have a different vibratory state.
[0043]      As shown, the system may include a wireless device 104 that can wirelessly
communicate data signals to a remote reader 106.          The data signals may represent the
measurement(s) obtained by the wireless device 104. To this end, the wireless device may
include a sensor 108, a processing unit 110, and a transmitter 112.              The sensor is
configured to measure an operating parameter of the machine and thereby obtain a
measurement. In some embodiments, the sensor includes a detector or transducer 114 and
an activator 116. The activator may provide a stimulus (e.g., sound waves, light, electric
current, etc.) that causes a response by a component-of-interest or is affected by the
component-of-interest.     The detector may detect the response that is caused by the
                                               9

stimulus or the affect that the component-of-interest has on the stimulus. For example, the
stimulus may be sound waves that are detected to determine a liquid level (e.g., sonar).
The stimulus may be light signals that are projected by a laser into a liquid to determine
how much of the light signals are absorbed by the liquid.         Another stimulus may be
electric current. In other embodiments, the sensor does not include the activator. Instead,
the detector may detect sound, vibrations, light, temperature, electrical properties, or other
properties that occur in the environment without a stimulus provided by an activator.
[0044]        The processing unit is operably coupled to the sensor. The processing unit is
configured to receive measurement signals from the sensor and process the measurement
signals to provide data signals. The processing unit may be an analog-to-digital converter
(ADC). Alternatively or in addition to the ADC, the processing unit may include a logic
based device that transforms the measurement signals into data signals. The data signals
may then be configured to be transmitted to the reader by the transmitter. For example,
the processing unit may be a computer processor, controller (e.g., microcontroller) or other
logic-based device that performs operations based on one or more sets of instructions (e.g.,
software). The instructions on which the processing unit operates may be stored on a
tangible and non-transitory (e.g., not a transient signal) computer readable storage
medium, such as a memory. The memory may include one or more types of memory,
such as hard drives, flash drives, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, and the like. Alternatively, one
or more of the sets of instructions that direct operations of the processing unit may be
hard-wired into the logic of the processing unit, such as by being hard-wired logic formed
in the hardware of the processing unit.
[0045]      The transmitter may be coupled to the processing unit and can wirelessly
communicate the data signals to the reader. In some embodiments, the transmitter is a
transceiver, which transmits the data signals and receives other signals.        These other
signals may include interrogation signals from the reader.
[0046]      In some embodiments, the sensor, the processing unit, and the transmitter are
localized within and/or attached directly to the machine such that the sensor, the
processing unit, and the transmitter are proximate to each other and form a single device.
The sensor, the processing unit, and the transmitter may be in a localized spatial region of
the machine that is separate from a computing system that controls operation of the
machine. For example, the processing unit and the transmitter may be integrated with the
                                             10

same component such that the processing unit and the transmitter have fixed positions
with each other.      The processing unit and the transmitter may be at least partially
integrated onto a common container (e.g., circuit board) and/or positioned within a
common container or housing that is coupled to the machine. The common container may
not be coextensive with the machine and, instead, may be a separate component that is
attached to or disposed within the machine-of-interest. By way of example only, some or
all of the components of the processing unit and the transmitter may be located less than
50 centimeters (cm) from each other. In various embodiments, depending on the types of
components selected and the relevant application, the components may be less than 20 cm
of each other, 10 cm of each other or, within 5 cm of each other.
[0047]      In some embodiments, the processing unit and the transmitter may be part of a
common radio frequency identification (RFID) unit (e.g., tag, chip, card, and the like).
Optionally, the sensor may also be part of the common RFID unit. In other cases, the
sensor is separate from, but operably coupled to, the RFID unit and is only a short distance
from the RFID unit. For example, the sensor may be located within 50 cm of the RFID
unit and communicatively coupled via wires or wireless communication. The RFID unit
may be formed in accordance with RFID technology, which may include integrated circuit
technology. For example, the RFID unit may be an electronic circuit that is capable of
wireless communication.      In some instances, the RFID unit may satisfy one or more
established RFID standards and/or guidelines, such as standards and guidelines formed by
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC), ASTM International, the DASH7 Alliance, EPCglobal, the Financial
Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) (all of which are incorporated herein by
reference).
[0048]      In certain embodiments, the wireless device is not physically and electrically
connected (e.g., not connected by wires or other conductors) to any of the one or more
computers or other controller-based units in the machine. For example, in the context of
trains, the wireless device may be partially disposed within a reservoir and/or attached to a
wall that defines the reservoir and is not physically electrically connected to the computing
system that controls operation of the train. In such embodiments, the data signals from the
wireless device may be wirelessly transmitted from the wireless device to, for example, a
reader that is on-board or off-board.       More specifically, the data signals may not be
                                              11

transmitted via wire/cables or other physical electrical connections.        In one or more
embodiments, at least portions of the processing unit and the transmitter may be directly
connected to a wall that defines the reservoir (e.g., a wall that bears a pressure of and/or
contacts the liquid in the reservoir) and/or to a structure immediately connected to the wall
(e.g., support structure of the reservoir, gear case, or the like).
[0049]      Various forms of wireless communication may be transmitted and received by
the wireless device.     For example, the transmitter may receive and/or transmit radio
signals, optical signals, signals based on sound, or signals based on magnetic or electric
fields. In particular embodiments, the transmitter is configured to receive and/or transmit
radio signals in one or more radio frequencies.       The wireless signals may be transmitted
along a narrow radio band. In narrow band transmission, a single carrier frequency is
used. Alternatively, the wireless signals may be transmitted within a spectrum of radio
frequencies. For example, in spread spectrum transmission, the signals may be transmitted
over a number of different radio frequencies within a radio band. The data signals may be
modulated for transmission in accordance with any one of a number of modulation
standards, such as frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS), direct-sequence spread
spectrum (DSSS), or chirp spread spectrum (CSS).
[0050]      One wireless communication standard that may be used by embodiments
described herein is IEEE 802.15.4 (incorporated by reference).            The IEEE 802.15.4
standard may operate within one of three frequency bands: (1) 868.0-868.6 MHz; (2) 902
928 MHz; or (3) 2400-2483.5 MHz. A number of channels may be used in each of the
frequency bands. Embodiments may also use frequency bands that are associated with
RFID technology, such as 120-150 kHz, 13.56 MHz, 865-868 MHz, 902-028 MHz, 2450
5800 MHz, or 3.1-10 GHz.           Ultra wideband (UWB) may also be used.            In some
embodiments, a transmission range of the data signals and/or the signals from the reader is
in a range of from about 1 centimeter to about 20 meters. In other embodiments, the
transmission range may be greater, such as up to 100 meters or more.
[0051]      Various embodiments may be based on or consistent with RFID technology.
For example, the wireless device may be a passive sensor, a semi-passive sensor, or an
active sensor. A passive sensor may not include a power source. Instead, the power may
be based on inductive coupling or backscatter coupling with the reader. A semi-passive
sensor may include a power source for only designated functions. For example, a battery
                                                12

and/or an energy harvesting device may be used to increase the transmission distance. The
passive and semi-passive sensors may be particularly suitable for when the reader is
present (e.g., within transmission range so that the sensors can be powered by the reader).
An active sensor may include a power source for powering multiple functions (e.g.,
detection, reception, and transmission).   Active sensors may be used in embodiments in
which the reader can only receive data signals and not transmit interrogation signals.
[0052]      The reader may be operably connected to a control system 118 having a signal
processing or diagnostic module 120 and, optionally, a planning module 122. Like the
processing    unit, the   modules   may    be   a  computer    processor,  controller  (e.g.,
microcontroller), or other logic-based device that performs operations based on one or
more sets of instructions. The instructions on which the modules operates may be stored
on a tangible and non-transitory (e.g., not a transient signal) computer readable storage
medium, such as a memory. Alternatively, one or more of the sets of instructions that
direct operations of the modules may be hard-wired into the logic of the modules. The
module may be located on separate devices (e.g., separate processors) or may be located
on common processor.
[0053]      The signal-processing module may determine, based on the data signals
received by the reader, whether the machine is operating improperly.            The signal
processing module may determine whether the machine is operating properly or
improperly by analyzing the data signals that are representative of the measurements. For
example, the signal-processing module may use a look-up table or other databases that
provides acceptable ranges of operation. If the measurement based on the data signals is
not within the range, the signal-processing module may determine that the machine is not
operating properly.    In some cases, based on the measurement(s), the signal-processing
module may be able to determine whether a particular component of the machine is in
need of maintenance, repair, or replacement or whether the machine requires an overhaul
of a sub-system.
[0054]      Based on the measurement(s), the signal-processing module may request that
an operating plan be generated by the planning module. The operating plan may improve
the performance of the machine and/or to limit the performance of the machine to prevent
damage or additional damage. The operating plan may include instructions for replacing,
                                              13

maintaining, modifying, and/or repairing a designated component or components of the
machine.
[0055]       The operating plan may be based on the operative condition, which is at least
partially a function of the measurement(s) obtained.            For instance, if a capacitive
measurement indicates that the liquid level is less than sufficient, but a substantial amount
remains in the gear case, then the operating plan may include instructions for refilling the
liquid at a first facility and then resealing the gear case at a second facility located further
away.     However, if a capacitive measurement indicates that the liquid level quickly
reduced to little or no measurable amount of liquid, then the operating plan may instruct
that the gear case be replaced at a designated facility.
[0056]       In the context of a locomotive or other vehicle, the operating plan may include
instructions for controlling tractive and/or braking efforts of the vehicle. In particular, the
operating plan may be partially based on the measurements of the operative condition of
the machine. The instructions may be expressed as a function of time and/or distance of a
trip along a route.      In some embodiments, travel according to the instructions of the
operating plan may cause the vehicle to reduce a stress on a component-of-interest of the
machine than the component would typically sustain during normal operation.                  For
example, the operating plan may instruct the vehicle to reduce horsepower delivered to an
axle, to intermittently drive the axle, or to disable the axle altogether. The vehicle may be
autonomously controlled according to the operating plan or the instructions of the
operating plan may be presented to an operator of the vehicle so that the operator can
manually control the vehicle according to the operating plan (referred to as a vehicle
"coaching mode").
[0057]       In some embodiments, the operating plan that is generated when it is
determined that the machine is operating improperly is a "revised" operating plan that
supersedes or replaces another operating plan.          More specifically, due to the newly
acquired measurements, the control system may determine that the currently-implemented
operating plan should be modified and, as such, may generate a revised operating plan to
replace the other.
[0058]       Operating plans may be optimized to achieve designated goals or parameters.
As used herein, the term "optimize" (and forms thereof) are not intended to require
maximizing or minimizing a characteristic, parameter, or other object in all embodiments
                                                14

described herein. Instead, "optimize" and its forms may include increasing or decreasing
(as appropriate) a characteristic, parameter, or other object toward a designated or desired
amount while also satisfying other conditions. For example, optimized stress levels on a
component may not be limited to a complete absence of stress or that the absolute
minimum amount of stress. Rather, optimizing the stress level may mean that the stress is
controlled, while also satisfying other conditions (e.g., speed limits, trip duration, arrival
time). For example, the stress sustained by a component may be controlled so that the
vehicle may arrive at its destination without the component being severely damaged.
[0059]      The planning module may use at least one of vehicle data, route data (or a route
database), part data, or trip data to generate the operating plan. The vehicle data may
include information on the characteristics of the vehicle. For example, when the vehicle
system is a rail vehicle, the vehicle data may include a number of rail cars, number of
locomotives, information relating to an individual locomotive or a consist of locomotives
(e.g., model or type of locomotive, weight, power description, performance of locomotive
traction transmission, consumption of engine fuel as a function of output power (or fuel
efficiency), cooling characteristics), load of a rail vehicle with effective drag coefficients,
vehicle-handling rules (e.g., tractive effort ramp rates, maximum braking effort ramp
rates), content of rail cars, lower and/or upper limits on power (throttle) settings, etc.
[0060]      Route data may include information on the route, such as information relating
to the geography or topography of various segments along the route (e.g., effective track
grade and curvature), speed limits for designated segments of a route, maximum
cumulative and/or instantaneous emissions for a designated segment of the route, locations
of intersections (e.g., railroad crossings), locations of certain track features (e.g., crests,
sags, curves, and super-elevations), locations of mileposts, and locations of grade changes,
sidings, depot yards, and fuel stations. The route data, where appropriate, may be a
function of distance or correspond to a designated distance of the route.
[0061]      Part data may include, for example, historical data or proprietary data regarding
the lifetime operability of a component.        The data may include baseline data for a
designated speed and/or load on the machine.          Additional factors may be part of the
baseline data. For example, if the lubricant has a designated quantity in the gear case, the
part data may include data from identical components that operated with an approximately
                                               15

equal lubricant level.     The data may include how long the component is capable of
operating at a designated speed.
[0062]       Trip data may include information relating to a designated mission or trip, such
as start and end times of the trip, start and end locations, route data that pertains to the
designated route (e.g., effective track grade and curvature as function of milepost, speed
limits), upper cumulative and/or instantaneous limits on emissions for the trip, fuel
consumption permitted for the trip, historical trip data (e.g., how much fuel was used in a
previous trip along the designated route), desired trip time or duration, crew (user and/or
operator) identification, crew shift expiration time, lower and/or upper limits on power
(throttle) settings for designated segments, and the like. In one embodiment, the planning
module includes a software application or system such as the Trip OptimizerTM system
developed by General Electric Company.
[0063]       Figure 2 is a side view of a drive train (or final drive) 150 in accordance with
one embodiment. The drive train includes a traction motor 152, a first (or pinion) gear
 154, a second gear 156, and a base portion or shell 160 of a gear case 158. A top portion
or shell 162 of the gear case is shown in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 2, the first gear and
the second gear engage each other at a gear mesh 164. During operation of the drive train
the traction motor drives the first gear by rotating an axle (not shown) coupled to the first
gear about an axis of rotation 166.        The first gear may be rotated, for example, in a
counter-clockwise direction as viewed in Figure 2. Due to the engagement at the gear
mesh 164, the first gear rotates the second gear in a clockwise direction about an axis of
rotation 168.    The second gear is coupled to an axle (not shown) that rotates with the
second gear. The axle of the second gear is coupled to wheels (not shown) that are rotated
with the axle. The wheels engage a surface (e.g., rails or tracks) to move the machine.
[0064]       The gear case includes a reservoir 172 that holds a lubricant liquid 180 (e.g.,
oil). The gear case has a fill or inlet port 186 and a drain or outlet port 188. The liquid
may be provided to the reservoir through the fill port and drained through the drain port.
[0065]       As shown in Figure 2, the second gear has teeth 176 along an edge 174 of the
second gear. When the liquid is held within the gear case, the liquid may have a fill level
 184. Figure 2 illustrates a first fill level 184A and a second fill level 184B. The second
fill level is lower than the first fill level. In some embodiments, when the drive train is
operating properly, the quantity of the liquid correlates to the first fill level such that the
                                                16

edge of the second gear is sufficiently submerged within or bathed by the liquid.
However, when the fill level is lowered to, for example, the fill level, the edge and teeth
may be insufficiently lubricated. Such circumstances may occur when the gear case has a
leak.
[0066]      Figure 3 is a partially exploded view of the gear case and illustrates the base
and top portions before the base and top portions are coupled to the drive train to surround
the first and second gears. As shown, the gear case may include first and second gear
receiving openings 190, 192 that are sized to receive the first and second gears (Figure 2),
respectively. The gear-receiving openings may be defined by opening edges 193-196 and
the base and top portions may engage each other along case edges 197, 198.
[0067]      When the drive train is fully constructed and operational, the opening edges
engage the portions of the drive train along salable interfaces.       The case edges may
couple to each other along a salable interface.         During operation of the drive train,
however, the interfaces may become damaged or worn such that the interfaces are no
longer sufficiently sealed. For example, when the drive train is part of a locomotive, the
opening edges or the case edges may become worn, damaged, or separated such that the
liquid is permitted to escape the reservoir. Accordingly, the amount of liquid may reduce
such that the fill level lowers.
[0068]      Embodiments described herein may detect that the amount of liquid has
reduced. In addition, due to the wear, damage, or separation of the base and top portions,
the gear case (or portions thereof) may exhibit different vibratory characteristics.     For
example, a gear case that is sufficiently sealed with respect to the drive train and has a
sufficient fill level may exhibit a first vibratory state when the drive train is driven at a
first speed. However, a gear case that is insufficiently sealed with respect to the drive
train and/or has an insufficient fill level may exhibit a second vibratory state that is
different than the first vibratory state when the drive train is driven at the first speed.
Embodiments described herein may detect and measure the different vibratory states. In
certain embodiments, a wireless device, such as those described herein, is at least partially
disposed within the reservoir and/or directly attached to a portion of the gear case. For
example, at least a portion of the wireless device may be directly secured or affixed to a
wall of the gear case, such as the wall that defines the reservoir. In some embodiments,
                                               17

the wireless device is not physically and electrically connected to other components of the
machine, such as a computing system that controls operation of the machine.
[0069]      In addition to liquid level and vibrations, embodiments may detect other
characteristics. For example, other measurements may relate to a quality (e.g., degree of
contamination) of the liquid. Contaminants may include water, metallic particles, and/or
non-metallic particles. Furthermore, embodiments are not limited to the drive train or a
gear case of the drive train. For example, measurements that may be obtained for a drive
train may also be obtained for a turbo-charger, an air compressor, an engine, and the like.
Other components of a machine may also be measured by wireless devices described
herein.
[0070]      Figures 4-6 illustrate sensors 202, 212, 222, respectively. The sensors, which
may be transducers in some embodiments, may be a portion of some wireless devices
described herein. Each of the sensors may measure (e.g., detect) a designated property or
characteristic in the environment proximate to the sensor and provide a signal that is
representative of the measured property or characteristic.       The signal provided by the
sensor may be the measurement.
[0071]      Various types of measurements may be obtained by the sensors.           Some non
limiting examples include a capacitance of a liquid, a temperature of a liquid and/or
temperatures of certain parts of a machine, a fluid conduction of a liquid, a dielectric
constant of a liquid, a dissipation factor of a liquid, an impedance of a liquid, a viscosity of
a liquid, or vibrations of a mechanical element. A measurement may be directly obtained
(e.g., temperature) by the sensor, or a designated measurement may be obtained after using
information provided by the sensor to calculate the designated measurement.                  For
example, the viscosity of the liquid may be calculated based on multiple level
measurements obtained by a sensor.
[0072]      Embodiments may include a single wireless device that measures and
communicates only a single measurement (e.g., capacitance) or multiple measurements
(e.g., inductance (L), capacitance (C), and resistance (R) or "LCR"). In one embodiment,
a single wireless device may measure and communicate multiple types of measurements
(e.g., capacitance of the liquid, temperature of the liquid, temperature of the sensor, shock
and/or vibration of the gear case, and the like). In one embodiment, the wireless device
may have multiple sensors and these may be of multiple types.
                                                18

[0073]       In the illustrated embodiment, the sensor may measure a capacitance of a
liquid, such as a lubricant in a tank (e.g., gear case). Such a sensor may be referred to as a
capacitive level probe. For reference, a cross-section 201 of the level probe is shown in
Figure 4. The level probe extends lengthwise between a leading end 208 and a trailing end
210.   The level probe includes an inner or measurement electrode 204 and an outer or
reference electrode 206.      As shown, a space 205 exists between the inner and outer
electrodes. A capacitance of the material that exists within the space may be measured by
the level probe.     The material may be one of, or a combination of, a liquid and a gas.
Other suitable materials may include liquids and/or gases that include suspended solids or
dissolved materials.     Suitable liquids may include polar liquids (e.g., water), non-polar
liquids (e.g., oil), or combinations thereof (e.g., emulsions). In some embodiments, a wall
of the tank that holds the liquid may be used as the reference electrode.
[0074]        The level probe may be immersed into the liquid held by the tank.            For
example, the leading end may be inserted into the liquid.             As the leading end is
submerged, the liquid may flow into the space thereby changing a ratio of liquid to gas
within the space. As such, the measured capacitance may change as the level of the liquid
within the space changes. If the liquid is a lubricant, the measured value of capacitance
decreases as an amount or level of the liquid decreases.       As an amount or level of the
liquid increases, the measured value of capacitance may increase.
[0075]        The level probe may determine a quality of the liquid. More specifically, the
level probe may detect an amount or percentage of contaminations in the liquid based on
capacitance measurements.        For example, contaminant detection may be based on a
dissipation factor of a dielectric of the liquid.      In general, the dissipation factor is a
function of an applied frequency, a liquid temperature, a composition of the liquid (e.g.,
the desired composition of the liquid), and contaminants. The dissipation factor may be
substantially independent of the base capacitance or liquid level.
[0076]       In some cases, movement of the machine may cause a displacement of the
liquid which may introduce an error in the measurements.               Accordingly, in some
embodiments, the level probe is only activated when the machine or component thereof is
at rest (e.g., inactive). To this end, an accelerometer or other inertial type sensor may be
part of or operably coupled to the wireless device that includes the level probe.         The
                                                19

accelerometer may determine that the machine is in an inactive or stationary state such
that measurements may be obtained by the level probe.
[0077]      As shown in Figure 5, the sensor includes a body float 214 and a reed switch
216.   The body float includes a cavity 218 that is sized and shaped to receive the reed
switch. The body float floats along the reed switch (e.g., vertically) based on a level of the
liquid in the reservoir. The body float includes a permanent magnet 220, and the reed
switch includes a magnetically actuated switch or switches (not shown). As the body float
moves up and down, the permanent magnet may activate or deactivate the switch (e.g.,
close or open a circuit, respectively, in the reed switch). The activated switch indicates
that the body float is at a designated level and, consequently, that the liquid is at a
designated level.
[0078]      As described above, one or more embodiments may include a sensor system
that includes an accelerometer.     Figure 6 illustrates one such sensor system, which is
referenced as an accelerometer 222. A suitable accelerometer may be a micro-electro
mechanical system (MEMS) tri-axis accelerometer. The accelerometer may be used for a
variety of functions, from movement to impact to vibration.               For example, the
accelerometer may be coupled to a mechanical element, such as a tank to determine
whether the mechanical element has remained stationary for a designated amount of time.
In some embodiments, other measurements (e.g. liquid level) may be obtained in response
to an external trigger, such as a determination that the mechanical element has remained
stationary for the designated amount of time.
[0079]      Alternatively or additionally, the accelerometer may detect vibratory states
experienced by the mechanical element.        For example, the accelerometer may obtain
numerous shock and vibrations measurements per second in each of x-, y-, and z-axes.
For example, the accelerometer may be able to log hundreds or thousands of data points
per second in each of the x-, y-, and z-axes.
[0080]      Figure 7 is a schematic diagram of a wireless device 300 formed in accordance
with one embodiment. The wireless device includes sensors 301-304, a processing unit
306 (e.g., microprocessor), a transmitter 308, an internal clock 310 (e.g., real-time clock
crystal), and a memory 312 (e.g., non-volatile memory). The wireless device has a device
body 315, which may include a printed circuit board (PCB) or a die (e.g., semiconductor
wafer) in some embodiments. In the illustrated embodiment, the device body includes the
                                              20

sensors, the processing unit, the transmitter, the internal clock, and the memory.         In
alternative embodiments, however, the wireless device may have multiple bodies (e.g.,
multiple dies) that are coupled to each other and/or the components described herein may
be separate from the device body. The sensors may be operably coupled to the device
body through, for example, wires 316.        In other embodiments, the sensors may be
wirelessly coupled to the device body.
[0081]      A suitable sensor may be a level probe, such as the level probe described with
respect to Figure 4. The sensor may be inserted into a liquid (e.g., lubricant) of a machine.
The sensor may be a thermometer that can obtain a temperature of the liquid. The sensor
may be an accelerometer, or may be another thermometer that can determine a
temperature of the device body of the wireless device. Each of the sensors 301-304 may
be communicatively coupled to the processing unit and can communicate signals to the
processing unit. The signals may be representative of a property or characteristic detected
by the sensor.
[0082]      The processing unit may store or log data (e.g., data based on the signals
obtained from the sensors) in the memory. In some embodiments, the processing unit may
query the sensors and thereby request measurements from the sensors. The queries may
occur at determined times or in response to an occurrence of a designated event.          For
example, the queries may occur once an hour as determined by the internal clock until, for
example, the wireless device is interrogated by a reader (not shown). At such an event, the
processing unit may query the sensors for numerous data points. For example, the data
points may be provided almost continuously after interrogation. The processing unit may
receive data from the memory. The data received from the sensors and/or the memory
may be transformed into data signals that are communicated by the transmitter to the
reader.
[0083]      The wireless device 300 may be characterized as an active or semi-passive
device. For example, the wireless device 300 may include a power source 320, such as a
battery (e.g., lithium thionyl chloride battery) and/or kinetic energy harvesting device.
The wireless device 300 may utilize the power source 320 to increase the transmission
range of the transmitter 308.    In such embodiments, the reader may be located tens or
hundreds of meters away from the wireless device 300. In addition to the transmitter 308,
                                             21

the power source 320 may be used to supply power to other components of the wireless
device 300, such as the sensors 301-304 or the processing unit 306.
[0084]      Figure 8 is a schematic diagram of a wireless device 350 formed in accordance
with one embodiment. The wireless device 350 may be a passive device such that the
wireless device 350 is powered by inductive or backscatter coupling with the reader (or
some other non-internal power source).        As shown, the wireless device 350 includes
sensors 351-354, a processing unit 356, and a transmitter 358. The wireless device 300
has a device body 365 that includes, in the illustrated embodiment, the sensors 353, 354,
the processing unit 356, and the transmitter 358. The device body 365 may be formed by
integrated circuit technology. For example, the device body 365 may include one or more
printed circuit boards (PCBs). The sensors 351 and 352 may be operably coupled to the
device body 365 through, for example, wires 366.        Similar to the wireless device 300
(Figure 7), the sensors 351-354 may be a level probe, external thermometer, an
accelerometer, and an internal thermometer, respectively.
[0085]      In some embodiments, the processing unit executes fewer calculations or
conversions of the signals from the sensors 351-354 than the processing unit (Figure 7).
For example, the processing unit may be an ADC that converts the analog signals from the
sensors 351-35 to digital signals. The digital signals may be the data signals that are then
transmitted by the transmitter. In the illustrated embodiment, the processing unit may only
query the sensors after being interrogated by a reader (not shown). More specifically, the
interrogation signals from the reader may power the processing unit to query the sensors
and transmit the data signals.
[0086]      Figure 9 is a cross-section of a portion of a wireless device 400 attached to a
wall 402 of a tank 401 that may be secured to a machine. Depending on the type and
purpose of the tank, different fluids may be contained within. Suitable fluids may include
lubricant, fuel, coolant, exhaust gases, and the like. A fill port 404 in the wall is defined
by interior threads 406 of the wall as shown in Figure 9. The fill port may provide access
from an exterior 408 of the tank to a reservoir 410, which may be used for holding the
fluid.
[0087]      As shown, the wireless device includes a sensor 412, a device body 414, and an
intermediate cable portion 416 that joins the sensor and the device body. The wireless
device may include a coupling component 418 that may be secured to the device body 414
                                               22

through one or more fasteners 420 and attached to the wall. In the illustrated embodiment,
the coupling component includes complimentary threads 422 that complement and
rotatably engage the threads of the wall.      In other embodiments, suitable methods of
attaching the coupling component to the tank may be used, such as latches, interference
fits (e.g., plugs), and/or adhesives.
[0088]        To assemble the wireless device, the coupling component may be rotatably
engaged to the wall. The sensor and the cable portion may be inserted through an opening
424 of the coupling component and the fill port. As shown, the coupling component has a
mating face 428 that faces in a direction away from the wall. The cable portion has a
mating end 426 that is located in the exterior of the tank and may be pressed toward the
mating face with a gasket 430 located therebetween. The device body has a cable opening
432 that receives an end of the cable portion. The device body may be secured to the
cable portion and the coupling component using the fasteners.          As shown, the cable
portion includes a fill channel 436 that permits access to the reservoir. During operation,
the fill channel may be closed with a plug 438 at the mating end of the cable portion.
[0089]        The sensor may be the same as the level probe described in Figure 4. A trailing
end 440 of the sensor may be as shown in Figure 9. The trailing end is coupled to wires
442 that communicatively couple the sensor to the device body. In other embodiments,
the sensor 462 may be similar or identical to the sensor shown in Figure 5. The cable
portion may surround and protect the wires from the surrounding environment. As shown,
the wires terminate at a contact ring 444 along the device body. The sensor may transmit
signals to the device body through the wires and the contact ring. The device body may
process and transmit data signals that represent measurements obtained by the sensor. The
device body may include an integrated circuit unit 415.           Although not shown, the
integrated circuit unit of the device body may have a processing unit, power source,
internal clock, additional sensors, and/or a transmitter, such as those described above. In
some embodiments, the integrated circuit component may be an RFID unit or a low power
Wi-Fi device.
[0090]        Figure 10 is a cross-section of a portion of a wireless device 450, which is
coupled to a wall 452 of a tank 451. The wireless device may include similar features as
the wireless device described with reference to Figure 9. For example, the wireless device
may include a sensor 462, a device body 464, and an intermediate cable portion 466 that
                                              23

joins the sensor and the device body.         The wireless device may include a coupling
 component 468 that secures directly to the device body and the cable portion through one
 or more fasteners 470. In the illustrated embodiment, the coupling component is rotatably
 engaged to the wall in a similar manner as other coupling components.
 [0091]      To assemble the wireless device, the coupling component may be rotatably
 engaged to the wall.     The sensor and the cable portion may be inserted through the
 coupling component and a fill port of the wall. The device body may be encased within a
mating end 476 of the cable portion. As shown, the coupling component has a mating face
478 that faces in a direction away from the wall. Accordingly, the cable portion and the
 device body may be secured to the coupling component using the fasteners. A cover body
480 may be positioned over the cable portion to hold the device body between the cover
body and the coupling component. The cable portion may not include a fill channel that
permits access to the reservoir.
 [0092]      A trailing end 490 of the sensor is shown in Figure 10.       The trailing end is
 coupled to wires 492 that communicatively couple the sensor to the device body.           As
 shown, the wires terminate at contacts 494, 495 that are coupled to the device body. The
 device body may include an integrated circuit component, which, in the illustrated
 embodiment, is a RFID unit. The sensor may transmit signals to the integrated circuit
 component through the wires.
 [0093]      Figure 11 is a cross-section of a portion of a wireless device 500. The wireless
 device may be similar in some respects as other the wireless devices described herein.
However, as shown in Figure 11, the wireless device utilizes a sensor and a coupling
 component that can attach to a wall of a tank, which is a gear case in this illustrated
 embodiment. The wireless device includes a device body 530 that is operably coupled to
the sensor through a base support 510 and an intermediate beam 512. The base support is
 disposed within an opening 514 of the coupling component. The beam extends between
 and joins the sensor and the base support. The beam may be fabricated from, for example,
 stainless steel and may provide a passageway 516 for wires 518 that communicatively
 couple the device body and a sensor 502.
 [0094]      The base support includes a mating face 520 that faces away from the tank 508.
 The mating face has contacts 524, 525 thereon. The contact may be a contact pad, and the
 other contact may be a ring contact that extends around the contact pad. The device body
                                               24

may be rotatably engaged to a coupling component 504.           The device body includes a
mounting surface 532 that faces the mating face and has corresponding contacts that are
configured to engage the contacts. More specifically, when the device body is rotated to
engage the coupling component, the mounting surface of the device body may advance
toward the mating face so that the contacts of the device body press against and engage the
contacts.
[0095]      Accordingly, the device body may be communicatively coupled to the sensor.
Similar to the device bodies described above, the device body may include an integrated
circuit component 515 having a processing unit and a transmitter (not shown). Optionally,
the integrated circuit component may include a memory, an internal clock, and one or
more other sensors. The integrated circuit component may transform the signals from the
sensor (or memory or other sensors) into data signals.        The data signals may then be
transmitted to a reader (not shown).        In some embodiments, the integrated circuit
component is formed as an RFID unit.
[0096]      Figure 12 is a cross-section and Figure 13 is a front view, respectively, of a
portion of a wireless device 550. The wireless device may include a sensor (not shown)
and a device body 552 that are communicatively coupled through wires 554. The device
body is secured to a faceplate 556 that is coupled to an exterior surface of a tank 560
(Figure 13). Figures 12 and 13 illustrate an embodiment in which no electrical contacts
are required along the device body 552 to electrically join the sensor.       Instead, wires
(Figure 12) from the sensor may extend through potting 562 that mechanically couples the
sensor to the tank 560. Like the wireless device 400 (Figure 9), the wireless device may
permit access to a fill port 566 through a plug 568. Although not shown, the device body
may include an integrated circuit component, such as those described above, that
processes data signals and transmits data signals. The integrated circuit component may
be an RFID unit that is directly coupled to one of the wires.
[0097]      Figure 14 is a schematic view of a rail vehicle, in this embodiment the rail
vehicle is a locomotive 600, and illustrates a plurality of components of the locomotive
that may include one or more wireless devices, such as the wireless devices described
herein. For example, the locomotive may include a plurality of drive trains 601 that each
has a gear case 602.     The locomotive may include an engine 604, a turbo-charger 606
operably coupled to the engine, and an air compressor 608. Each of the components may
                                              25

have one or more of the wireless devices described herein operably coupled thereto. For
example, the gear cases and the engine may have at least one of the wireless devices
described above. In particular, each of the gear cases and the engine may have a reservoir
that includes a liquid lubricant. The turbo-charger and the air compressor may use, for
example, an accelerometer.
[0098]      As shown, the locomotive may include an on-board control system 610. The
control system can control the tractive efforts and/or braking efforts of the locomotive and,
optionally, other locomotives that are directly or indirectly coupled to the locomotive.
Operations of the control system may be based on inputs received from an operator of the
locomotive and/or remote inputs from, for example, a control tower, a dispatch facility, or
the like. In addition, the control system may receive inputs from various components of
the locomotive. In some cases, the inputs may be data signals received through wireless
communication.     For example, the wireless devices of the gear cases, the engine, the
turbo-charger, and the air compressor may wirelessly communicate data signals to the
control system. The control system may include a reader 612 for receiving the wireless
data signals. The control system may include a signal-processing module and a planning
module that are similar to the signal-processing and planning modules described in Figure
 1. The planning module may generate operating plans for the locomotive based on the
inputs received.
[0099]      Figure 15 illustrates a system 700 in accordance with one embodiment for
obtaining data signals from one or more wireless devices. Figure 16 illustrates a flowchart
of a method 750 that may be executed or performed by the inventive system. In some
embodiments, a locomotive may execute or perform the method. The system and the
method may employ structures or aspects of various embodiments discussed herein. In
some embodiments, certain steps of the method may be omitted or added, certain steps
may be combined, certain steps may be performed simultaneously, certain steps may be
performed concurrently, certain steps may be split into multiple steps, certain steps may be
performed in a different order, or certain steps or series of steps may be re-performed in an
iterative fashion. Likewise, the system is not required to include each and every feature of
each and every embodiment described herein.
[00100]     With respect to Figure 15, the system includes a vehicle system 702 (e.g., train)
including a locomotive consist 704. The locomotive consist may include at least one
                                              26

locomotive that is linked (physically or logically) to one or more rail vehicles.         For
example, Figure 15 shows the locomotive consist including first and second locomotives
706, 708 and a rail car 710. In other embodiments, the vehicle system may include more
rail cars. Each of the locomotives may include a plurality of components that are each
monitored by one or more wireless devices. For example, each of the locomotives may
include an engine, a turbo-charger, an air compressor, and a plurality of gear cases, such as
those described herein.
[00101]    As shown in Figure 15, the vehicle system is approaching a designated reading
location 715. The reading location is a maintenance facility in the illustrated embodiment.
However, the reading location may be a variety of other locations that are capable of
receiving wireless data signals from the locomotives. For example, the reading location
may be a depot, fuel station, wayside location, rail yard entry point or exit point,
designated sections of the track(s), and the like. The reading location includes a plurality
of readers 716.    Each of the readers is communicatively coupled (e.g., wirelessly or
through communication wires) to a control system 720. Alternatively or additionally, a
handheld reader 724 may be carried by an individual and used to receive the data signals.
The reader may communicate data signals with the control system.
[00102]     The control system may include a signal-processing module and a planning
module, such as the signal-processing and planning modules described in Figure 1. For
example, the control system may generate operating plans that include instructions for
operating the vehicle system and other similar vehicle systems.
                                             27

[00103]     The method may include receiving (at 752) data signals from one or more of
the wireless devices of a machine.      In the illustrated embodiment, the machine is the
vehicle system or one of the locomotives. However, embodiments described herein are
not necessarily limited to locomotives. The machine may have one or components with
moving mechanical elements or parts. For example, the machine may have a drive train,
engine, air compressor, and/or turbo-charger. The data signals may be representative of a
measurement of an operative condition of the component.            By way of example the
measurement may be at least one of a vibration measurement, a capacitance of a liquid, a
temperature of a liquid, a fluid conduction of a liquid, a dielectric constant of a liquid, an
impedance of a liquid, or a viscosity of a liquid.          In particular embodiments, the
measurement is representative of a vibratory state of a gear case or of a liquid condition of
a lubricant held in the gear case.
[00104]     The receiving operation (at 752) may include receiving the data signals at one
or more fixed readers having stationary positions.      For example, the readers may have
fixed positions with respect to tracks 730.      The readers may be located at designated
distance from the tracks so that the readers are capable of receiving the data signals. The
receiving operation (at 752) may include receiving the data signals through one or more
movable readers, such as the handheld reader. In an alternative embodiment, as described
above, the receiving operation may occur with an on-board control system.
[00105]     The method may include determining (at 754), based on the data signals,
whether the component of the machine is operating improperly. For example, the control
system may analyze the data signals and, optionally, other inputs to determine whether the
component is operating sufficiently. If the component is operating improperly, the method
may include generating (at 755) an operating plan and/or a shopping or maintenance plan
that is based on the data signals. The operating plan may be a new (or revised) operating
plan that can replace a currently-implemented operating plan. The method may include at
least one of providing maintenance (at 756) to the component or replacing (at 758) an
element of the component.
[00106]     In an embodiment, a system (e.g., a monitoring system) is provided that
includes a sensor that can be disposed within a reservoir of a machine having moving parts
that are lubricated by a liquid in the reservoir. The can measure liquid to determine a
quantity or quality of the liquid in the reservoir. The system may include a device body
operably coupled to the sensor. The device body has a processing unit coupled to the
                                              28

sensor that can generate first data signals that are representative of the measurement of the
liquid. The device body includes a transmitter that can wirelessly communicate the first
data signals to a remote reader.
[00107]     With reference to Figure 17, a sensor device 800 is shown that includes a
housing 802 and a dipstick portion 804. The dipstick portion has a distal tip 806 spaced
from the housing.     The housing includes a base portion 810 and a cap portion 812. A
series of fasteners 814 secure the cap portion to the base portion.
[00108]      The dipstick portion has a plurality of apertures 820 disposed along the length
of the dipstick portion. These apertures function as vent holes to relieve pressure as oil
flows into an interior chamber 822 of the dipstick portion (described in more detail with
reference to Figure 18). The apertures 820 are referred to as vent apertures herein. In the
illustrated embodiment, at least some of the vent apertures are defined on opposite sides of
the dipstick portion. The vent apertures on opposite sides may be axially offset relative to
each other along a length of the dipstick portion to structurally strengthen the dipstick
portion by reducing weakness or failure points. The vent apertures may be the same size,
as shown, or may have different sizes relative to each other.           The number, size and
placement of the vent apertures may be determined at least in part on application-specific
parameters. The dipstick portion also defines at least one fluid entry aperture 824 that is
located proximate to the distal tip. Each fluid entry aperture is configured to provide an
access opening that allows fluid into the interior chamber of the dipstick portion.
[00109]      The housing is configured to be coupled to a tank or reservoir that contains a
fluid. When oriented in an upright manner during operation, the dipstick portion rests
with the distal end near or in a volume of fluid to be tested. In one embodiment, fluid that
contacts the dipstick portion may flow into the interior chamber through the at least one
fluid entry aperture. The pressure in the dipstick portion is relieved by a corresponding
loss of gas through the vent apertures.      The release of gas allows the fluid within the
interior chamber to rise to a level that corresponds to a fluid level of the fluid within the
tank or reservoir.
[00110]     With reference to Figure 18, the dipstick portion of the sensor device is shown
as a cross-sectional cutaway with superimposed circles 820, 824 indicating where vent and
fluid entry apertures, respectively, may be disposed. The dipstick portion may include a
cylindrical outer tube 840 that houses a concentrically disposed wire 842 in an insulated
sleeve 844.    The sleeved wire is surrounded by a chemically resistant and electrically
                                               29

 isolated inner tube 846 (e.g., a non-conductive tube). The inner tube may be formed of
 one or more plastics or other polymers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or the like.
At least one o-ring washer 848 may be placed around an electrode 850. A spacer member
 852 provides sealing and support for the o-ring around the electrode. Another spacer 860
 is disposed at the distal tip to secure and support a distal end of the electrode and to seal
the bottom end of the tube. Thus, fluid that enters the interior chamber flows through a
 fluid entry aperture. Suitable materials for use as the spacer members may include one or
more plastics or other polymers, such as PTFE and/or polyetheretherketone (PEEK). A
volume or void 856 is defined radially between an outer surface 858 of the electrode and
 an inner surface 862 of the outer tube 840. Fluid that enters the interior chamber of the
 dipstick portion flows through the volume.        Silicone elastomers, such as SYLGARD
 (commercially available from Dow Coming) may be used as needed.
 [00111]     The cap portion and the base portion may be formed of metal. While not
 shown, brazing the joints between the cap portion and the base portion creates a stronger
joining of the metal components than welding. Fasteners rather than tack welds have been
used, too, in high impact environments to prohibit the housing from being damaged. The
 electronics package may be potted, or set, within the housing to reduce the effect of impact
 forces and shocks on the components inside the housing.
 [00112]     A stray capacitance control structure may be employed on the sensor device.
In one embodiment, a GIl plate may be added to reduce or eliminate stray capacitance.
 The plate may be disposed between the housing and the dipstick portion. For example, the
plate may be secured to the base portion of the housing.             Alternatively, the stray
 capacitance control structure may be curved to extend at least partially around a perimeter
 of the housing to at least partially surround the electronic package held in the housing. In
 another alternative embodiment, the electronic package may be secured within the cap
portion of the housing, and the stray capacitance control structure is a plate that extends
 across and is held at an interface defined between the cap portion and the base portion of
the housing. Suitable materials for the stray capacitance control structure may include
multi-layer ceramic capacitors or other materials with suitable permissivity values. Due to
the stray capacitance control structure, the capacitance of the electronic package may be
 isolated from the sensor capacitance.      Alternatively, the capacitance of the electronic
package may be compensated for instead of being isolated or reduced relative to the sensor
 capacitance.
                                               30

[00113]     In the illustrated embodiment, the electrode is a continuous sensor that is
elongate and extends at least a majority of the length of the dipstick portion.             The
continuous sensor may operate to provide a signal through the sleeved wire. An electrical
characteristic (e.g., magnitude, signal strength, amplitude, etc.) of the electrical signal may
be proportional to the amount of surface area of the electrode that contacts the fluid. That
is, when the fluid level is high, a greater proportion of the electrode is in contact with the
fluid than when the fluid level is low, and the resulting signal through the wire may be
stronger. Alternatively, the sensor may include a series of discrete electrodes mounted on
a support instead of, or in addition to, the elongate electrode. The electrodes may be
spaced apart along an axial length of the dipstick portion. In such an arrangement, each
electrode may be configured to signal when a fluid level is high enough to contact the
respective electrode. Thus, one could judge a fluid level by noting which of the electrodes
are transmitting a signal indicating contact with a fluid. Optionally, multiple wires may be
used to transmit electrical signals from the multiple electrodes, or a multiplexer may be
used to transmit the information along a single wire. The electrical characteristic of the
electrical signal from the sensor may change based on the number of electrodes that
contact the fluid. For example, the signal strength may increase at generally discrete
levels or amounts with an increasing number of electrodes signaling contact with the fluid.
[00114]     In another embodiment, in addition to the presence and quantity of fluid in the
volume in the tube, the sensor may be used to measure other parameters of the fluid.
These other parameters may include one or more of temperature, pressure, conductivity,
resistance, viscosity, and turbidity of the fluid. Still other parameters may include the
presence or absence of certain contaminants or constituents, such as carbon, water, oil or
petroleum products and/or by-products, sulfur, metals, minerals, and biological materials.
The presence of contaminants or constituents may be used to determine the health and/or
age of the fluid. For example, the petroleum products and/or by-products may indicate
degradation of the fluid used to determine the age of oil, gasoline, or another petroleum
based fluid. The concentration of water may indicate the health of the petroleum-based
fluid. For instances where the fluid is a gas, the measured parameters may include the
content of oxygen, nitrogen oxide, sulfur compounds, organo-phosphates, cyanates, and/or
the like.
[00115]     With additional reference back to Figure 17, the wire communicates with an
electronics package (not shown) disposed within a cavity inside of the cap and base
                                              31

portions of the housing. The electronics package may include, for example, one or more
of the wireless devices disclosed herein for transmission of the electrical signals generated
by the one or more sensors.         In various embodiments, the electronics package also
includes an accelerometer, a clock, an electro-magnetic sensor (such as a Hall Effect
sensor), and/or an RFID sensor. These devices may be used to wake the sensor device
from a "sleep" or "off' mode for the sensor device to collect data and/or transmit the
collected data. The clock may allow the sensor device to collect data and/or transmit the
collected data at a selectively determined time interval. The time interval may be based on
a frequency of need or on a desired battery life/power use rate.
[00116]     In a fleet setting, for example, the wireless device of the electronics package
may wake and transmit an electrical signal at times that are offset from times that other
wireless devices of the vehicle or machine, on which the sensor device is coupled, transmit
respective electrical signals, or at different frequencies than the other wireless devices.
This system of staggering communications may alleviate frequency bandwidth constraints,
and may reduce the chance of interference between multiple devices. In one embodiment,
the wireless device first checks if there is another wireless device transmitting at a
specified frequency or range of frequencies before transmitting data.
[00117]     Alternatively, or in addition, the wireless device may transmit in response to a
trigger or stimulus. Suitable triggers may be based on the type of devices present on the
electronics package.     For example, if an accelerometer is disposed on the electronics
package, a shock (e.g., an impact force) on the sensor device that exceeds a designated
threshold may be the trigger. The trigger may be initiated by a tap on the wireless device.
Furthermore, the trigger may be based on movement of the sensing device, such as
rotating or shaking the sensor device. If the sensor device is coupled to a vehicle, then
when the vehicle moves or stops,            or if the vehicle goes over a bump, the
collection/transmitting process may be triggered. If an electro-magnetic sensor is present,
a magnetic or an electric field may be employed as desired to trigger the wireless device to
collect and/or transmit sensor information.       Similarly, if an RFID sensor is present,
passing an RF transmitter may wake the sensor device.
[00118]     In one aspect, the transmitter may be energized by the reader when the reader
interrogates the transmitter. In one aspect, the system includes a power source that can
supply power to the transmitter for transmitting the data signals. The power source may
include, for example, a battery and/or energy harvesting device.      The sensor may be at
                                               32

least partially submerged in the liquid. The measurement is at least one of a capacitance
of the liquid, a temperature of the liquid, a fluid conduction of the liquid, a dielectric
constant of the liquid, an impedance of the liquid, or a viscosity of the liquid. The device
body may be affixed to a wall of the machine in which the wall at least partially defines
the reservoir. The sensor and the device body collectively form a first wireless device.
The system may include a second wireless device that can obtain and wirelessly
communicate second data signals that are representative of a measurement of a different
reservoir.
[00119]     In one aspect, the sensor may be disposed in a gear case of a locomotive, the
gear case having the reservoir.        The transmitter is included in a radio-frequency
identification (RFID) element.      The sensor, the processing unit, and the transmitter
collectively form a first wireless device. The system may include a second wireless device
that can obtain and wirelessly transmit data signals that are representative of a
measurement of a different reservoir.       The system may include a signal-processing
module. The signal-processing module may determine, based on the data signals, whether
the machine is operating improperly by comparing the data signals of the first wireless
device to the data signals of the second wireless device.
[00120]     In an embodiment, the fluid is gear box lubricant and the sensor/electrode
measures the amount of lubricant present. During operation, the wireless device of the
sensor device may transmit to a vehicle controller and/or to an off-board service center the
lubricant level value. In response to receiving a sensor reading indicating a low lubricant
condition in a gearbox being monitored by the sensor device, the vehicle controller may
respond by removing a supply of power and/or torque to the axle for the associated
gearbox. In a multi-axle system, the vehicle may continue along a trip or mission using
other powered axles.      This isolation of axles associated with gearboxes having low
lubricants may be advantageous in a locomotive that may be in a consist with other
locomotives.    Other activities may be initiated in response to detecting a low lubricant
condition, such as requesting or scheduling maintenance for the vehicle (e.g., entering a
shopping order where maintenance or repair services are scheduled).         Furthermore, the
vehicle may be directed to detour from a prior mission to travel to a repair and
maintenance shop for adding lubricant or otherwise addressing the low lubricant issue.
[00121]     In one aspect, the data signals are configured to be transmitted to a handheld
reader.   In another aspect, the data signals are configured to be transmitted to a fixed
                                             33

reader located along a railway track. In yet another aspect, the data signals are configured
to be transmitted to an on-board reader located on a locomotive. The sensor includes a
multi-conductor capacitive sensor configured to detect a capacitance of a fluid. The fluid
may function as a dielectric, wherein a level of the fluid affects the capacitance detected.
In another aspect, the sensor includes a body float and a position transducer configured to
