Detailed Description
The present             invention describes                    an automated               structure         for
reception           of     modular         constructions,               automation            system        and
method         of    operation           thereof         and     operating           method,        wherein
the       structure             comprises             a    lower          structure            (1)      which
contains an opening                     (4) for accommodation of a fixed shaft,
comprised           by     the     element          of    attachment            of      the   shaft        with
the      exterior           (11),     where,          preferably,            a   lifting        mechanism
may      be    coupled         to    the      structure            (45)     and      the    fixed       shaft
for      attachment           to    the exterior              (5)     located,           preferably,          on
the      side      sections        of said           lower     structure            (1)    and may also
be located on the cover of the modular constructions, which
is     coupled to an upper structure                            (3) with joint and support
 (6),      by     means       of    the      lifting        mechanism             (2)     of   the      lower
bearing          (7),     of     the upper            bearing        (8),      of    the    lower       latch
 (9),      of    the     upper       latch         (10),     of     the     support         bars       of   the
lifting         mechanism            (35)      and      of   the      support          piece       (36)     and
which       allows        the movement               of said upper             structure           (3)   .  The
axial        movement           and      the       upper      structure             (3)     are     managed
through            an     automated             system         based         on       a    programmable
automaton             and      a    set       of      sensors          and      actuators,             namely
anemometers              and      frequency             inverters            that        control        these
movements. Thus, the present invention allows to receive on
said      lower       structure           (1)      through        the     element         of attachment
of the shaft with the exterior                              (11) where it can be coupled
to      the    structure            (45)      being       accomplished               the    fixation          to
the      exterior,           modular          constructions,                for      example        houses,

                                                                                                         11
making        them    to    move,       for     example,          according          to    the      solar
orientation, in order to make them energy efficient.
Additionally,             a    structure            (45)       can     be    coupled          to      said
element of          attachment of the                 shaft with          the exterior               (11),
which remains fixed regardless of whether or not there is a
rotation         movement,        fixation          to     the exterior           being       achieved
through         the    fixed       shaft        (5)      in    that      the     structure            will
remain         likewise        fixed        and      will       be     introduced           into       the
modular construction where                        it will be placed.                  In this way,
it     is    possible       to   create        different           spaces      in     the     interior
of        the    aforementioned                modular           construction,               also       of
different dimensions, as the rotation movement takes place.
The      automation        system        is   based        on   a programmable              automaton
and       a    set   of      sensors         and      actuators,           in     particular            an
anemometer           and       frequency             inverters            that       control           the
rotation         motor      (28)     and     the motor           that     operates         the      upper
structure          (14)     as   well       as    the      motors       (32    and      33)     placed,
respectively,            in     the     lower        (9)     and      upper      (10)      locks       and
that       determine       the     a   rotation           axis     of   the    upper        structure
 (14)      which    may,      for     example,           correspond         to     the     summer       or
winter        movements        and    by means           of    said     lower       (9)    and      upper
 (10)       latches      a    set      of     limit         switches        of    protection            in
particular           the      upper         (8)     and       lower       (7)     bearings.            The
automation system illustrated by the flowchart in figure 10
uses       a  software        developed          in    Ladder        logic     and      designed        so
that each of the features that                            implements can be invoked by
higher          level       systems          such         as     computers,             tablets         or
smartphones           and     has     3     modes      of     operation,          which        are     now
explained:
Mode       1: Automatic

                                                                                                       12
In    this mode,         that      will    the usual           mode of          operation,         the
lower     structure          (1)    and   the upper           structure           (3)    will    move
in     such   way     as      to    obtain      the      maximum         use      of     the    solar
energy. Depending on the intended configuration, the system
allows lifting of only the upper structure                                    (3),    only rotate
the entire structure or both movements combined. Similarly,
in    the   context        of this       automatic           mode,      it     is     possible       to
configure whether the upper structure                               (3) executes a summer
movement,       in    which the aim is              to create           shadow on the main
facade,      or a winter movement,                   in    which the purpose                 is    not
to create        shadow        on the     facade,         while      the upper            structure
 (3)    remains       perpendicular             to     the      sun's        position;          these
movements         are     illustrated           in    figures          1,      2,     14   and     16,
respectively.          These configurations                   can also be             carried out
in    the manual        mode      through       interaction            with       a programming
graphical console. The motor movements are monitored by the
variators and automaton so that any anomaly is immediately
detected       and      leads       to   a    stop       of     the       system        that     will
require human intervention.
By     way   of    example,         the    two     motors          (14)      that      ensure      the
lifting      of the upper            structure         (3)    must move synchronously
and     any discrepancy,             even    if    minimum will be                  detected       and
the     system      stops        until    the      cause       of     the      discrepancy           is
resolved. Alternatively, we can opt for just one motor                                            (14)
applied      to    a   lifting        mechanism          (2)    for      lifting         the    upper
structure        (3),     placed in        the centre of the larger section.
When      the     anemometer           measures          the       wind        speed       above        a
predetermined value                the automation             system will             collect      the
upper     structure          (3)   and will        close       all     the      latches       (8   and
9) through action on the motors                         (14, 32 and 33)               in order to
ensure      the    structural          safety       of     the      upper       structure         (3).

                                                                                              13
Accordingly,           the      system     enters      the   maintenance        mode       from
which it will emerge if the condition that led to switch to
this mode         is   no longer present.              If an    authorised user acts
on     the     monitoring          and    programming        graphical      console         and
requests         a    change        in    configuration         or    a   predetermined
positioning           for     the     house    or    facade,       when    in     automatic
mode, the system will change into manual mode.
The       automatic         movement        is   therefore         done     through         the
management           by     said      automation         system      that     takes        into
consideration            variables        such   as    the    sunlight     and     the    time
of the day.
Mode 2:        Manual
In the manual mode,                 the monitoring of the operation of                      the
system         can    be      carried       out    and      its    behaviour         can     be
configured.          There       are    a   number      of   configurable        positions
for     the lifting of             the upper structure            (3) and rotation           of
the      chassis        to     which      the   user       can    give    an      order      of
positioning;          the system will carry out all necessary checks
and will position the lifting of the upper structure                                    (3) or
the     rotation       of     the    chassis,     this      at  a   speed    faster       than
the one used in the automatic mode of solar tracking.
Mode 3:        Maintenance
The      system      goes      into    maintenance         mode    whenever       an     error
occurs         or    when        the     speed     of      the    wind     is      above       a
predetermined              value.        If    an      error      occurs       the       human
intervention           is     mandatory      and    the     resolving     of     the     error
will      take    the     system      into manual        mode.    In  the    case      of   the
emergency         procedure         caused    by high       speed    of  the     wind,      the

                                                                                                   14
system will return to the automatic mode if after a period
of time the situation is resolved.
Next,      the    axial      movement        and     the   movement           of   the      upper
structure        (3) will be explained:
Axial movement
The     lower      structure           (1)    contains         an      opening         (4)       for
accommodation of a fixed shaft, comprised by the element of
attachment         of    the      shaft    with       the    exterior          (11),      where,
preferably,          the     structure         (45)     and    the      fixed      shaft         for
attachment        to the exterior              (5)    can be      coupled,        whereto         in
turn    is   coupled preferably               the rotating mechanism                     (27)     or
other      similar,       and      that,    by      action     of     the     motor       of     the
rotation mechanism               (28)   on the drive          sprocket          (29)     and the
pinions      (30),      by means        of   a     chain    (not      shown)      allows         the
axial      movement       of     the    whole       structure        up    to    at     least       a
radius      of   1800.      In    a   preferred        embodiment,           the method           of
operation        presents          a   lower       structure         (1)     in    its      axial
movement       aided by the guiding wheels of the shaft                                (12)      and
by   the     set     of    supporting         wheels      of     the      lower      structure
 (13) .    This     last      set,     also      preferred,          is     arranged         in     a
circle      around the          entire     fixed      shaft      (5)     that moves           in    a
trough placed on the ground (not shown).
Upper structure            (3)
In   order      that     the    upper     structure         (3),      starting        from       the
opening position,              such as      shown      in  figure        1    (winter)        or 2
 (summer),       can move in          the closed position                in    figure       3    (up
to   approximately            14:00      hours)       and    return         to    the      opened
position       (approximately 20:00 hours) in figures 1 and 2, in

                                                                                                         15
accordance with the height of the sun and direction of its
light,     the     automation           system          controls          the    electric          motor
that    drives         the     upper       structure            (14),       which         drives       the
spindle      (16)      and,     through         the nut          (15)      and    the connecting
rods    (19),     which        will     lift        the     upper        structure          (3)    since
they    are     coupled         to     it.      This       movement          implies         that      the
lower latch          (9)    is    unlocked,            something that the automation
system     will      do     simultaneously                by    activating            the     electric
motor     that     operates         the      lower        latch        (32)    which,        in    turn,
will    activate          the     latching           pin     of      the     lower        latch       (31)
keeping the upper latch                    (10)       locked.         In   this movement,              the
lower     bearing         (7),     through          its     fixed        and   mobile         elements
 (22   and    21)      serves       as    a     shaft       and       support        to    the     upper
structure        (3)     to     which       it      is    connected           by     means       of    the
support     piece         (36) .    This       movement           is     specially         useful       in
the summer, at sunrise and sunset, when the position of the
sum    is    lower,          therefore           the       inclination             of      the     upper
structure       (3) must be greater, as shown in Figure 2, and it
can    go   up    to     a     maximum         of     90    degrees,          creating          private
external       spaces,         however,          in     a   preferred          application,             it
can go up        to     60 degrees,            creating         covered        external           spaces
and shaded areas, measured from the lower bearing                                            (7).
In   the case        of the so called winter movement,                                   wherein       the
degree of inclination                  of the upper              structure           (3)    needs not
to be     so great         in    order       to keep the              inside temperature                of
the modular          construction adequate,                     the opening movement                    of
the upper       structure           (3)    only differs                by the       fact     that      the
automation         system         commands            the     upper        latch         (10)     to    be
unlocked by activating the electric motor that operates the
upper     latch       (33)     which      activates            the      latching          pin    of    the
upper     latch        (34)     keeping         the      lower        latch      (9)      locked.       In
this case the upper bearing                          (8),    by means of its fixed and

                                                                                           16
mobile      elements       (25   and   24),    serves      as   a   shaft       and    upper
structure        (3)   support     in   conjunction        with     a support piece
 (36).     This     movement     has    maximum      amplitude          of    60   degrees
measured       from     the    upper    bearing      (3)    and    it      is    specially
useful in the winter, that is, when the position of the sun
is   lower,     therefore       the inclination          of the upper            structure
 (3)    must   be    greater,      as   shown    in    figure       1,     allowing      the
incidence of the sun on the facade which results in heating
of the interior of the modular construction.
The movement of the upper structure                      (3) can also be carried
out     in   the     opposite     direction       to     that    presented          in   the
figures,      by modifying the direction                 of the connecting              rods
 (19),    displacing the lifting mechanism                    (2) to the centre of
the side section and placing a duplication of the remaining
elements        responsible          for     the    movement           of      the     upper
structure        on    the    opposite      side    of    the     same       section,     in
response to the needs of countries near the equator.
It should be noted that the supporting bars of the lifting
mechanism        (35) allow assisting the lifting mechanism                           (2) to
withstand         the     forces      exerted     during        the      movements        of
opening and closing of the upper                    structure         (3).     The entire
upper       structure        (3)   is    preferably        produced           in   lattice
format,      thus     allowing     reduction      of weight         and increase          of
robustness.
In     a   preferred       embodiment,        the    automated          structure        for
reception         of   modular       constructions          can     execute         a   3600
rotation.
In    another       preferred      embodiment,        the     automated          structure
for reception of modular constructions can be programmed so

                                                                                              17
that     this      modular        construction,           for    example        a      house,
executes      a 1800       movement      according        to   the movement           of    the
sun    in    that    location        and    return      to    the     starting         point,
making its return during the night.
Additionally,          the mode       of   operation        described       above        could
be    applied,      with     the    necessary       alterations,          to    a    simpler
structure with the aim of reducing production costs and in
order to provide a more accessible product.
This    way,     the    automated        structure        can   be     sized      to     allow
only opening and            closing      movements        of   the upper         structure
 (3),   without      side     sections       (46) .   In    this    case     the lifting
mechanism      (2)     will be positioned on one of the ends of the
side     sections       of    the    lower     structure         (1),    and      a pillar
 (42),   which contains an upper bearing                      (9) on its upper end
in    such    way    as    to    enable     the    articulation           of   the       upper
structure       (43)     without      side     sections       (46),     as    well       as  an
upper beam        (43)     as   a support.       To   control       the movements            of
opening and closing, the programmable automaton should act
only      on   the      electrical         motor       that      drives       the        upper
structure        (14).      The    angle      of    inclination          of    the       upper
structure      without        side     sections       (3)    remains       the      same     as
previously explained, however, the embodiment now described
only allows the winter movement.
Furthermore,        if    necessary,       for the purposes             of project,          to
place     the opening         (4)   for    accommodation          of a     fixed shaft,
comprised      by the       element       of   attachment         of   the    shaft       with
the exterior          (11)    where    preferably         the   structure          (45)     and
the    fixed shaft         for attachment         to    the exterior          (5)     can be
coupled at one of the ends of the lower structure                                   (1),    the
automated structure should be rebalanced. To this end it is

                                                                                     18
used the fixation of support pillars                     (42)   at the side ends
of the     lower     structure       (1),    which    connect    the upper      beams
 (43)   and cross        members     (40)     coupled to      supporting pillars
of    cross   members        (44).    Further,      counter    weights     (41)    are
applied      at    each     end    of     the   shorter      side   of  the     lower
structure      (1)    in   order to ensure the balance              of the entire
automated structure, thus eliminating the supporting wheels
of the structure           (13),   the guiding wheels of the shaft                (12)
being     able    to    be    replaced      by   a   solution     similar     to   the
crane system or other.
