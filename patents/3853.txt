Jewellery Box with Rotating Holder
Description
The invention is a box that when opened or closed rotates a ring or other item of
jewellery at or around 90 degrees.
The internal lining of the box has a rigid plastic backing and includes two folded
arms that support a ring holder. When the box is opened or closed the arms
change their angle.
When closing the box, the arms move towards each other to create a pinch point.
As a result, the ring holder attached to the arms is forced to twist. When opening
the box, the arms move apart, making the ring holder twist. These arms are
located at the back of the box near the box hinge point.
Behind the internal lining arms is a hinge cover that fixes onto the base of the
box and covers the area behind the arms. The hinge cover folds open as the box
is opened.
The ring holder is folded to form a half circle with a flat section in the middle. It
includes two arms with slotted cuts for added flexibility. These arms pass
through the slot in the internal lining arms attaching with adhesive. In the
middle of the ring holder is a single slot with two half-circle slots at each end.
Behind the ring holder is soft foam to hold a piece of jewellery firmly. The ring
holder also includes a plastic backing for greater rigidity.
