   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
35 arranged to permit a player to move objects during a game
   to variable locations.   Gaming machines of the embodiment
   employ a touch screen display and allow a player to move
                                               10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

                              - 5
   an object by maintaining continuous contact with the
   screen.  This can allow a player to move objects without
   requiring buttons corresponding to all of the possible
   outcomes or enable the player to have a sensation of
 5 greater tactile interaction with objects in the game.
   General Description of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of forms. In a first
10 form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided wherein all
   or most components required for implementing the game are
   present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
15 wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
20 wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
25 operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
30 envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.   For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
35 machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
                                              10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

   skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
 5 several core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
10 input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
15 credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54 and a game
   play mechanism 56 that enables a player to input game play
   instructions, in particular for the player to input a
   wager.
20
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
25 display. Typically, the game play instructions are stored
   as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:          a
30 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
35 machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which is
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
                                              10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   gameplay.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
 5 mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   A reading device may also be provided for the
10 purpose of reading a player tracking device, for example
   as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking device
   may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any other
   portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.

   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.       Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
20 panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
25 display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.   Displays of the embodiment are
30 fitted with a touch screen.   The top box 26 may also
   include a display, for example a video display unit, which
   may be of the same type as the display 14, or of a
   different type.

   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.  Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
 5 which is in data communication with the processor 102.
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
10
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
15 machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
20 random numbers for use by the processor 102.        Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
25 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 comprise one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and buttons 107, a card and/or ticket reader 108, a
   printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism
   110 and a coin output mechanism 111.  Additional hardware
30 may be included as part of the gaming machine 100, or
   hardware may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
35 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
                                              10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

                              - 9
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
 5 an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.             The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.             The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
10 some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
15
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
20
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
25 two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
30 implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
35 network 201.  The displays 204 may, for example, be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
                                              10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

                              - 10
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
 5 In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game.  With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
10 collectively provide a game controller.   A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.   Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
15 game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to carry out
   at least the accounting functions of the Jackpot.                 A
   loyalty system 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
20 most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller.                 The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
25 these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
30 computer input and output components.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
35 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
                                               10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

                              - 11
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming
 5 systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
10 accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.  For example, the game
15 server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of games servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
20 may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
25 A gaming system is shown in more detail in Figure 6.                     As
   shown in Figure 6, display 54 includes a touch screen 56A
   to thereby provide a touch screen display.     As shown in
   Figure 3, various modules 621,622,623 are implemented by
   processor 62 executing code stored in memory 64. Other
30 implementations, such as dedicated circuits, are possible.
   The game controller 60 comprises a display controller 621
   which controls the display on the basis of display data
   641 to display at least one player moveable object to a
35 player of a game.  A contact monitor 622 is arranged to
   monitor the output of the touch screen 56A to determine
   that a contact has been detected by the touch screen
                                               10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

                              - 12
   display at a first position and that the contact has been
   maintained to a second position.
   Contact monitor 622 provides data describing the second
 5 position to the display controller 621 which determines a
   new location for the moveable object from the second
   position data and controls the display to display the
   moveable object at the new location.   In the embodiment
   the display controller 621 controls the display so that
10 the object moves along a trajectory from the current
   position to the new position, the trajectory being defined
   by the maintained contact.
   The new location can be derived from the second position
15 in a number of different ways.   For example, it can
   correspond exactly to the new position or it can be the
   closest of a set of available positions specified by
   moveable object data 641.
20 In an embodiment wherein movement of the movable object to
   the second location has an effect on game outcomes, the
   display controller 621 sends data to the outcome generator
   623 specifying the new location of the object.           When the
   outcome determiner 623A of outcome generator 623 is ready
25 to determine the outcome of the game, the outcome
   determiner 623A determines the game outcome based on rule
   data 642 and the final new location of the moveable
   object.  If a prize corresponds to the game outcome, the
   outcome generator 623 generates a prize based on prize
30 data 643. In most embodiments, outcome generator 623
   generates part of a game outcome based on rule data 642
   prior to operation of the outcome determiner 623A.                  For
   example, if the game outcome includes some form of random
   selection to which the movement of the moveable object is
35 applied, the random outcome is generate under control of
   the game outcome generator 623.
                                               10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

                               - 13
   It will be appreciated that the outcome determiner 623A
   may evaluate the game outcome in a number of different
   ways.  In one example, the outcome determiner 623A is
   arranged to receive a player instruction via the player
 5 interface 56A that indicates the player wishes the outcome
   generator 623 to evaluate a game outcome.     In another
   embodiment, the outcome generator 623 determines that the
   movement of the object to the new position meets a
   condition specified in the rule data 642 for evaluation of
10 the game outcome.   Example conditions are that the object
   has been moved to a specified position, the object has
   been moved a specified number of times, or in the case
   where there are a plurality of moveable objects, that a
   specified number of moveable objects have been moved.
15
   The flow chart of Figure 7 corresponds to the two latter
   possibilities.   At step 710 a counter is set to zero after
   the game begins.   The counter can be used to monitor
   either the number of times that an object is moved or the
20 number of objects that are moved.    At 720 the number of
   moveable objects are displayed.    At step 730 the game
   determines whether a moveable object has been touched.                          If
   the answer is "No" the game waits 735.    If the answer is
   "Yes" the method involves determining whether contact is
25 maintained for the duration of movement from the first
   position to a second position 740.    If the answer is "No"
   the gaming machine waits 735 as the object is not being
   moved.  If the answer is "Yes" the display controller
   displays the object at the new location 750 and the
30 counter is incremented 760.    At step 770 it is determined
   whether the counter has reached a maximum.      If the answer
   is "No" the method reverts to step 730 to determine
   whether the moveable object is touched.    If the answer is
   "Yes" and the maximum number of objects or the maximum
35 number of moves has been made, the game outcome is
   evaluated at step 780 by the game outcome determiner 623A.

                               - 14
   The embodiment allows a player to "drag and drop" an
   object which enables the player to make complex or
   multifaceted decisions in a simple move.   This is faster
   and enables greater variety in selection than available
 5 one pick decision.
   Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that the
   method of the embodiment could be embodied in program
   code.  The program code could be supplied in a number of
10 ways, for example on a computer readable medium, such as a
   disc or a memory  (for example, that could replace part of
   memory 103) or as a data signal  (for example, by
   downloading it from a server).
15 A person skilled in the art will appreciate the various
   modifications may be made to the invention without
   departing from the scope of the invention described
   herein, some variations will be apparent from the
   following examples.
20
   Example 1 - Open the Safe
   Referring to Figure 8, in this game the player enters a
   feature of a gaming machine 800 and is asked to touch the
25 screen and move an indicator on a dial 810 to a position
   which will open a safe.   The stopping position which
   corresponds to opening the safe can be store as rule data
   642 or generated, for example, randomly under control of
   outcome generator 623.
30
   The player, as represented by hand 820, moves the
   indicator to any position from 0 to 99.   The movement is
   made by rotating the indicator on the touch screen either
   clockwise 830A or anticlockwise 830B by maintaining
35 contact with the touch screen until the visual image
   shifts to the desired stopping position.   This has an
   advantage of simulating a turning motion.    Further a large
                                               10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

                              - 15
   number of buttons to enable one hundred selections to be
   made is not required.
   Example 2 - Choose the bet
 5
   Figure 9 shows an exemplary display 900 of a spinning reel
   930 type game.  In this example, the player selects the
   amount to be bet by sliding an object in the form of an
   indicator 925 up and down a scale 920 until the desired
10 bet amount has been identified.   The same process is used
   to allow the player to move an indicator 915 to select the
   number of lines 910 the player wishes to play.             The bet
   amount and number of lines specify the player's wager.
   Once the wager has been made, the outcome generator 323,
15 selects stopping positions for each reel using a random
   number generator.  Outcome determiner 623A then evaluates
   the outcome based on prize data and the wager to determine
   whether to make an award to the player.   If an award is
   made, the credit and win meters are updated.
20
   In prior art, the setting of the bet or lines would have
   been made by using the touch screen or physical buttons to
   increase and decrease bets by repeated touching of the
   buttons which increment or decrement the bets.           This has
25 the disadvantage of requiring repeated hits by the player
   which can be irritating.
   An alternative implementation in the prior art would have
   required the player to press one button which was labelled
30 with a defined bet amount.   This has the disadvantage of
   limiting choices to the number of buttons which can
   physically fit onto a space.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that this
35 example can be extended to operating a slider to buy a
   number of "ways" in a game where win lines are provided by
   all combinations of row and column positions as disclosed
                                               10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

                              - 16
   in AU 684233.
   Example 3 - Match the hat
 5
   Referring to Figures 10A to 10C there are shown exemplary
   displays 1000 of a matching game.   In this selection
   method, the player is offered the opportunity to match
   various hats 1020 with various bodies 1010.       The player as
10 represented by hand 1030 moves the hats 1020 to the
   different bodies 1010 by dragging each hat to the desired
   body.  The player is given a choice of ten hats 1020 and
   five bodies 1010 and is asked to dress each body with a
   hat.  The prize paid in the feature is evaluated by
15 comparing the hat/body combinations selected by the player
   against criteria already set down in the game software.
   The first arrangement is shown in figure 10A which shows
   all of the available hats and 1020 and bodies 1010.                    The
20 player selects a moveable object in the form of hat 1020G
   as indicated by hand 1030.   As shown by line 1040 in
   Figure 10B, the player drags hat 1020G onto the head of
   body 1010D by moving their finger across the screen while
   maintaining contact with the screen.   The machine is
25 arranged so that once the hat 1020G is close enough to the
   body 1010, the hat will "snap" to the correct position on
   the body and the display is altered to show the new
   location.
30 The final location is shown in Figure 10C.     The game
   requires the players to make selection of each of the hats
   for each body until all bodies have a hat.     Once all
   bodies have a hat 1020 the outcome determiner 623A will
   determine the game outcome based on the game rules.
35
   In the prior art, matching several objects with other
   objects would have been very time consuming as each object
                                               10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

                               - 17
   to be moved would have required a button to be pressed to
   indicate which object to move, followed by pressing a
   button  (touch screen or physical) for the object to be
   moved to.   This example reduces the time taken for
 5 finalising selections and is more intuitive.
   Example 4 - Maze
   Referring to Figure 11, in this style of game, the player
10 as represented by hand 114 is asked to select a pathway
   through a maze.   The player is shown the maze and then
   must draw their finger along a pathway to indicate which
   pathway they are choosing.
15 A person skilled in the art will appreciate that rather
   than a finger, the player may be provided with a stylus or
   similar to touch the screen.    In the maze game, the
   intention for the player is to move along a path from a
   starting point represented by an image of a leprechaun
20 1120 on the exemplary display 1100 to an end point where
   there is a pot of gold 1130.    The player wins a thousand
   credits for getting to the end point and a hundred credits
   for any of the displayed shamrocks 1150 the player
   encounters on the path.   The game rules specify that the
25 player may only proceed in a single direction through the
   maze and accordingly if they encounter a dead end, the
   game is over.   In a variation, the game ends when the
   player first encounters a credit awarding object which may
   be the shamrock or the pot of gold 1130.
30
   A token 1110A represents the position of the player in the
   maze.  In this game, the player is allowed to release the
   object as often as desired in order to reassess their
   position (provided they have not reached an end point).
35 Figure 11B shows a player as represented by the hand 1140A
   moving object.   As the player moves the token 1110C
   through the maze a line 1160 representing the direction in
                                                10378564_1 (GHMatters) P71541.AU.5

                              - 18
   which the player is moved is shown on the screen to
   represent the players pathway.   It will be appreciated
   that this method allows the player to move swiftly and
   intuitively through the maze.   For example, a player is
 5 not required to make a new direction selection each time
   the player wishes to turn a corner of the maze.
   In the claims which follow and in the preceding
   description of the invention, except where the context
10 requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
   "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
   i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but
   not to preclude the presence or addition of further
15 features in various embodiments of the invention.
