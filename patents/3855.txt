ABSTRACT:
        An image projection device is disclosed having a body defining an aperture that includes a
slide frame receiving slot that is transverse to the aperture and a magnifying lens positioned in
alignment with the aperture at the front of the body. The image projection device can be attached to
a mobile device and uses the camera flash of the mobile device to provide the light source to
illuminate a slide transparency. The mobile device can identify a particular slide transparency
through information encoded on the slide frame in order to coordinate audio or video output with
the projected slide.

                                IMAGE PROJECTION DEVICE
   This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, the
   entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

   FIELD
   [0001] The present disclosure relates generally to an image projection device. More
   particularly, the disclosure relates to an image projection device that uses a light source
10 external to the device for illumination.
   BACKGROUND
   [0002] Image projection devices that utilize a light bulb to illuminate a slide
15 transparency or film in combination with a lens to enlarge the image onto a viewing
   surface are well known. Slide projectors         for viewing     35mm slides came into
   widespread use during the 1950s for home entertainment and educational uses. These
   slide projectors included an electric incandescent light bulb or other light source, a
   condensing lens or reflector to direct light onto the slide, a slide holder, and a focusing
20 lens. Slide projectors have fallen out of use in favor of more convenient digital media
   shown on a projection screen using a video projector or displayed on a large video
   monitor.
   [0003] Flashlight projectors are a novelty or toy item that use a flashlight as the light
25 source to illuminate a slide transparency. These devices typically include a mechanism
   to attach to the flashlight, a mechanism to mount the slide in position, and optics to
   focus and enlarge the slide image. Examples include U.S. Patent No. 2,445,651 , U.S.
   Patent No. 2,478,336, and U.S. Patent No. 5,321 ,449.
30 [0004] Mobile devices, such as smart phones, digital cameras and tablet computing
   devices, can also be equipped with an image projector. This type of technology
   typically uses a liquid crystal on silicon display with a light source, such as a light
   emitting diode (LED), for example, to illuminate the display. Adding an image
   projector to a mobile device can significantly increase the costs of producing the
35 mobile device. For example, U.S. Patent No. 7,874,683 discloses the use of a
   transmissive liquid crystal panel and an LED light source that are integrated within the

                                            IA
  mobile device. The LED light source illuminates the transmissive liquid crystal panel
  and an external projection lens, which can be removably fitted or integral with the
  mobile device, magnifies and projects the image from the transmissive liquid crystal
  panel onto a screen.

       WO 2017/214710                                                   PCT/CA2017/000152
   [0005]         U.S.  Patent Application No. 2015/0323160 discloses an entertainment
   accessory device that can be coupled to a smartphone to position a projection member in
  the path of light from the LED of the smartphone. The entertainment device can include
   multiple projection members of different colors or effects integrated onto a rotating dial to
   allow a user to create multiple different types of lighting projections and effects. The
  entertainment device can also respond to sounds, such as music, to change light effects.
  The projection member can be engraved or have a graphic design printed thereon. This
  design does not allow for the projection of photograph quality images because of the
   integration of the graphics with the projection member and the lack of conditioning of the
  LED light source.
  SUMMARY
  [0006]         According to a first aspect, an image projection device is provided that can be
  used in association with a mobile device having a camera flash. The image projection
  device comprises a body defining an aperture, the body having an attachment mechanism
  to attach to the mobile device and align the aperture with camera flash; a slide frame
  receiving slot within the body, the slide frame receiving slot is transverse to the aperture;
  and a magnifying lens aligned with the aperture, the magnifying lens positioned at a front
  end of the body. A slide transparency contained in a slide frame can be positioned with the
  slide frame receiving slot and the camera flash illuminates the slide transparency and the
  magnifying lens enlarges the illuminated slide transparency to project upon a projection
  surface. The image projection device can also include a focus adjustment mechanism
  containing the magnifying lens to allow for translation of the magnifying lens axially with
  respect to the aperture. The focus adjustment mechanism can include a telescoping
  mechanism or a screw-type mechanism.
5 [0007]         The image projection device can further include a motor and can be
  electrically coupled to the mobile device to obtain instructions. The motor can be coupled to
  the focus adjustment mechanism to allow the mobile device to provide instructions to the
  motor to adjust focus based on a projected image detected by the camera. Alternatively, or
  using an additional motor, a motor can be coupled to the slide frame using a gearing
  mechanism to advance the slide frame upon instructions from the mobile device.
                                                -2-

          WO 2017/214710                                                 PCT/CA2017/000152
     [0008]        The image projection device can be attached to the mobile device using a
     removable adhesive, such as a nano-suction material, for example. The attachment
     mechanism can also be a clamp or a mobile device case, such as a protective mobile
     phone case.
  i  [0009]        The slide frame receiving slot of the image projection device can be
     configured to accept any shape of slide frame, including rectangular and circular-shaped
     slide frames. The slide frame receiving slot can have a flexible detent for interacting with a
     notch or depression on the external surface of the slide frame to aid alignment of the slide
    frame with the aperture.
     [0010]        The image projection device can also include a camera opening that is
    aligned with a camera of the mobile device to allow the camera of the mobile device to
    capture an encoding block on the slide frame. The body can also include a light channel
    that is coupled to the aperture to allow light from the camera flash to enter the camera
    opening.
     [0011]        According to another aspect, a slide frame is provided that comprises one or
     more slide transparencies and encoded information associated with a corresponding slide
    transparency. The encoded information can be in an encoding block adjacent to the slide
    transparency. The encoding block can encode information using a barcode, a color, and a
    near-field wireless communication tag. The encoded information can also be encoded in
    the image of the slide transparency, such as by embedding a barcode into the slide image.
    [0012]         According to a third aspect, a method of operating image projection device
    and mobile device is provided. The method includes identifying a change in the encoding
    information detected by the slide decoder; associating the change in the encoding
    information with an event; and triggering the event. The event can be any one or more of
5   change the video display of the mobile device, audio playback from a speaker of the mobile
    device, operating the camera flash. The slide decoder can be a camera of the mobile
    device or a near-field communication sensor, for example.

  DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS
  [0024]         It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, where
5 considered appropriate, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a
  thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments described herein. However, it will
  be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments described herein
  may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods,
                                                 -4-

         WO 2017/214710                                                  PCT/CA2017/000152
   procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the
  embodiments described herein. Furthermore, this description is not to be considered as
   limiting the scope of the embodiments described herein in any way, but rather serves as
   merely describing some of the possible methods of implementation.
   [00251         Referring now to FIG. 1, shown is a rear view of a typical mobile device 100
   illustrating a camera flash 102 and a camera aperture 104 that can be used with
  embodiments of the image projection device described herein. Typically, mobile device 100
   includes a video display on the front surface of mobile device 100 (not shown) opposite the
  rear surface 106. Some embodiments of the image projection device could also be
  configured to work with a camera flash on the front facing surface of mobile device 100.
  Mobile device 100 can include any handheld computing device that includes a camera flash
   102, and can include smart phones, tablet computers, digital cameras, and potentially
  laptops.
  [0026]          Camera flash 102 is typically a light emitting diode flash, and can be
  controlled by mobile device 100 through a combination of software and hardware. Camera
  aperture 104 typically includes optics and a CMOS-based image sensor to capture digital
  images. The camera can similarly be controlled through a combination of software and
  hardware operating on mobile device 100.
  [0027]          Embodiments of the image projection device can be configured to work with
  any mobile device 100 that uses a camera flash 102. The orientation of camera flash 102
  and camera aperture 104 can vary based on the manufacturer of the mobile device. For
  example, some mobile devices orient the camera flash 102 and camera aperture 104 on
  the middle of the rear surface in a vertical or top-bottom orientation. Some embodiments of
  the image projection device described herein can be designed to attach to a specific device
5 based on the dimensions of the mobile device and orientation of the sensors. Other
  embodiments can use other attachment mechanisms that do not rely on particular
  dimensions of mobile device 100 or the orientation of camera flash 102 and camera
  aperture 104. In some embodiments, the image projection device described herein should
  not obstruct camera aperture 104.
                                                -5-

      WO 2017/214710                                                PCT/CA2017/000152
[00281         Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 2A, shown is an image projection device 200
attached to the mobile device 100 of FIG. 1 with FIG. 2A providing a cross-sectional view of
 image projection device 200 along line A--A. Body 202 of image projection device 200
attaches to mobile device 100 and has an aperture 210 that is aligned with camera flash
 102. A slide transparency 402 is aligned with aperture 210 and is illuminated by camera
flash 102. Magnifying lens 240 enlarges illuminated slide transparency 402 onto a
projection surface, such as a wall, ceiling, or projection screen.
[0029]         Body 202 of image projection device 200 preferably includes an attachment
mechanism 220 to attach body 202 to mobile device 100. Attachment mechanism 220 can
include a mechanical clamp, as shown in FIG. 2A, that can be made of a resilient material
to accommodate the thickness of mobile device 100. In some embodiments, projection
device 200 can be embodied in a traditional protective mobile phone case that serves as
the attachment mechanism, such as those cases that surround the edge and/or rear
surface of the mobile phone. In some embodiments, attachment mechanism 220 can
comprise a butterfly clip that is separate from body 202. The butterfly clip can be spring
biased and can include gripping material, such as a soft rubber or similar high-friction
material, on the surface of the clip that engages with mobile device 100 to limit slipping or
movement of image projection device 200.
[0030]         Preferably, attachment mechanism 220 comprises a removable adhesive that
is attached to body 202 to allow placement and removal of image projection device 200 on
rear surface 106 of mobile device 100. Removable adhesive can include nano-suction
material that is attached to the mating surface of body 202. The surface of nano-suction
material has thousands of microscopic craters that work by creating many partial vacuums
between the adhesive and the rear surface 106 of mobile device 100. Nano-suction
material is not pressure sensitive, can rebond repeatedly, and leaves no residue on the
mobile device. To remove image projection device 200 from mobile device 100, you simply
pull off or twist to break the bond. Wiping nano-suction adhesive material with wet tissue
will remove debris from the craters and rejuvenate the suction properties.
[0031]         Body 202 further provides a slide frame receiving slot 230 that is shaped to
receive a slide frame (such as those shown in FIGS. 4-6) that contains any number of slide
                                              -6-

     WO 2017/214710                                                  PCT/CA2017/000152
transparencies. The slide frame can be round, rectangular or any other shape, and slide
frame receiving slot 230 will have a corresponding shape to accommodate the slide frame.
 Slide frame receiving slot 230 is transverse to aperture 210 in order to position slide frame
transparencies within aperture 210. The slide frame is positioned with slide frame receiving
slot 230 to align one of the slide transparencies with camera flash 102 and aperture 210.
Camera flash 102, under control of mobile device 100, illuminates the slide transparency
402 within aperture 210. Slide frame receiving slot 230 can be formed within body 202, as
shown in FIG. 2A, or in a channel on the rear-facing surface of body 202. The position of
slide frame receiving slot 230 with respect to body 202, camera flash 102, and magnifying
lens 240 can be selected to optimize image projection quality.
[0032]          Magnifying lens 240 is aligned with aperture 210 and positioned at the front of
body 202 of image projection device 200. Magnifying lens 240 is positioned between the
illuminated a slide transparency and the projection surface. Magnifying lens 240 enlarges
the slide transparency that is illuminated by camera flash 102 for projection onto a
projection surface, such a wall or ceiling, for example. Although a simple biconvex lens is
shown for illustration purposes, a person skilled in the art would provide the appropriate
lens design to provide magnification and projection of a slide transparency. This can
include compound lens designs involving more than one lens.
[0033]          Some embodiments of image projection device 200 can further include a
focus adjustment mechanism 260 that houses magnifying lens 240. Focus adjustment
mechanism 260 can allow translation of magnifying lens 240 axially with respect to aperture
210 to change the distance between an illuminated slide transparency 402 and magnifying
lens 240 in order to alter the magnification or focus of the projected image. Focus
adjustment mechanism 260 can include a telescoping arrangement or a screw-type
arrangement that allows for movement of magnifying lens 240. In a compound lens design
that utilizes two or more lenses, only one of the lens may be moveable by focus adjustment
mechanism 260.
[0034]          Preferred embodiments of image projection device 200 can also include a
flash conditioner 250 that is aligned with, or positioned within, aperture 210 between
camera flash 102 and a slide transparency. Flash conditioner 250 is positioned on opposite
                                              -7-

       WO 2017/214710                                                   PCT/CA2017/000152
  side of slide frame receiving slot 230 from magnifying lens 240 such that the optical path
  from the camera flash 102 passes through flash conditioner 250, followed by a slide
  transparency, and finally magnified by magnifying lens 240. Flash conditioner 250 can
  assist with providing proper and full illumination of slide transparency 402. Flash
   conditioner 250 can include, for example, a light diffusing material or an optical condenser,
  such as a collimation lens (e.g. a plano-convex lens), or a combination thereof. For
  example, a plano-convex lens can be used so that incoming LED light beams from camera
  flash 102 are formed into parallel light beams as they hit the slide transparency so the
  projected image can have improved clarity. In embodiments used to project photographic
  quality slides, a flash conditioner should be used to obtain reasonable clarity of the
  projected image.
  [0035]        Aperture 210 can have a variety of shapes. Aperture 210 can be round to
  accommodate a round magnifying lens 240, for example. Aperture 210 can also be shaped
  similar to the shape of the slide transparencies on the slide frame, which can be round,
  rectangular, or any other shape, so that slide transparency 402 completely fills aperture
  210. Aperture 210 can also be conically shaped, or similarly have an increasing size, from
  the rear surface of body 202 adjacent to camera flash 102 to the front surface of body 202.
  [0036]        Some embodiments of image projection device 200 can also be electrically
  powered to provide further functionality. Electrical power can be obtained through coupling
  with mobile device 100, such as through a USB charging port or a Lightning connector for
  devices produced by Apple, for example. Other embodiments of image projection device
  200 can further comprise a battery to provide electrical power. In some embodiments, body
  202 can include a battery that provides supplemental power to mobile device 100 through
  the charging port. For example, image projection device 200 can be embodied in a mobile
  phone case that includes a supplemental battery similar to those produced by mophie inc.
  A supplemental battery can also be beneficial to assist with the increased power demand
  from the sustained use of camera flash 102.
  [0037]        Image projection device 200 can also be coupled with mobile device 100 by a
  communication interface. For example, mobile device 100 can provide instructions
) regarding slide advancement or focus adjustment. This can be over the same interface as
                                               -8-

       WO 2017/214710                                                   PCT/CA2017/000152
  the power supply (e.g. micro USB or Lightning), or another interface if image projection
   device 200 is self-powered (e.g. headphone/microphone jack of mobile device 100,
  wireless communication, such as Bluetooth or NFC).
   [00381        In some embodiments, image projection device 200 can include a slide
  decoder that can be used to identify the slide frame, and may further identify a particular
  slide transparency within aperture 210. The slide decoder can include electronics requiring
  power. A slide decoder can include a near-field wireless communication (NFC) transceiver
  that can read one or more wireless tags embedded in a slide frame, for example. The
  decoded information that identifies the slide transparency 400 and/or slide frame 402 can
  be communicated to mobile device 100 over the communication interface. Other methods
  of encoding information onto a slide frame and slide transparencies, and the respective
  method decoding with a slide decoder embodiment, are discussed with respect to FIGS. 4
  6.
  [0039]         In other embodiments of image projection device 200, a slide decoder can be
  provided by mobile device 100, either alone or in conjunction with slide decoding
  functionality provided by image projection device. For example, an NFC transceiver of
  mobile device 100 can identify a particular slide frame and a slide decoder on image
  projection device 200 can identify a particular slide transparency. FIGS. 3-6 provide
  examples where camera of mobile device 100 can serve as the slide decoder.
  [0040]         Electrically powered embodiments of image projection device 200 can include
  a slide advancement motor that is coupled to the slide frame (e.g. using a gearing
  arrangement). Slide advancement motor can move the slide frame within the slide frame
  receiving slot 230 to position the next slide transparency. Image projection device 200 can
  include buttons to control the slide advancement motor, such as forwards and backwards
5 buttons. In other embodiments, mobile device 100 can provide instructions to slide
  advancement motor to control which slide transparency is within aperture 210.
  [0041]         Electrically powered embodiments of image projection device 200 can also
  include a focus adjustment motor that can be coupled to focus adjustment mechanism 260
  to adjust position of magnifying lens 240. Again, this can be controlled by buttons on image
) projection device 200 or by mobile device 100. Camera of mobile device 100 can capture
                                               -9-

      WO 2017/214710                                                 PCT/CA2017/000152
the projected image and mobile device 100 can determine whether the captured image is in
focus, for example, by using an edge detection algorithm. Mobile device 100 can provide
 instructions to the focus adjustment motor based on this information. Mobile device 100 can
 periodically monitor the projected image using the camera to maintain focus of the
 projected image. Mobile device 100 can also rely on information from onboard motion
sensors/accelerometers to consider whether to reevaluate focus adjustment with the focus
adjustment motor.
[0042]          Some embodiments of image projection device 200 can also include
electronic stabilization to eliminate or reduce the effects of hand movements on the
projected image. Electronic stabilization embodiments can include a handle that contains
motion sensors (e.g. accelerometers), and the handle would be coupled to body 202 of
image projection device 200 via one or more motors to provide 3 degrees of freedom of
movement. When movement is detected by motion sensors, the handle can control the
motors to counteract the movement to maintain body 202 in a stable position.
[0043]          Referring now to FIGS. 3A and 3B, shown is are front and rear exploded
perspective views of an image projection device 300 for accepting circular-shaped slide
frames, such as that shown in FIG. 4. Body 302 of image projection device 300 defines an
aperture 310 that intersects with a slide frame receiving slot 330. Attachment mechanism
320 is a nano-suction material that is attached to the rear surface of body 302 of image
projection device 300.
[0044]          Slide frame receiving slot 330 contains a slide frame alignment mechanism
332 for engaging with the center of a rotary slide frame 400. The center of a circular slide
frame 400 can have a hole, depression, protrusion, axle that mates with slide frame
alignment mechanism 332 to position circular slide frame 400 in position and allow for

 [0046]         The embodiment in FIGS. 3A and 3B relies on the camera of mobile device
 100 to provide some slide decoding functionality. Body 302 is designed to cover the
camera module of mobile device 100 and includes a camera opening 380 and light channel
 382 in the rear surface of body 302. The slide frame receiving slot 330 is open to camera
opening 380 to allow a slide encoding block 410 (see FIG. 4) of slide frame 400 to be
captured by the camera of mobile device 100. Light from camera flash 102 is transmitted
via light channel 382 into camera opening 380 to allow camera of mobile device 100 to
capture slide encoding block 410 associated with the currently illuminated slide
transparency 402. Light channel 382 can be free space or any light transmissive material
(e.g. clear plastic or glass).
[0047]          Referring now to FIG. 4, shown is a front view of a circular-shaped slide frame
400 designed to work with the image projection device 300 illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B.
Slide frame 400 includes slide encoding information in an encoding block 410 adjacent
corresponding slide transparencies 402. Encoding information in encoding block 410 can
identify slide transparency 402 that is being projected to mobile device 100 to allow mobile
device 100 to coordinate with the projected image (e.g. playing associated media such as
audio, e.g. song, audio dialogue, sound effects, etc., video on mobile device video display
e.g. book text, movie clips).
[0048]          Slide frame 400 can include notches or depressions 404 that mate with
corresponding structure within slide frame receiving slot 330. This can provide mechanical
feedback to the user to indicate slide transparency 402 is in proper alignment. For example,
slide frame receiving slot 330 can have a flexible detent within the slot that mates with
notch/depression 404 on the slide frame 404 to align the slide frame within the aperture
310. The flexible detent can be flexible plastic or spring based. Other embodiments can
have a rigid detent and the slide frame can be comprised of a flexible material to allow
movement and alignment of slide transparency 402 within aperture 310. In some
embodiments, audible feedback (e.g. a clicking noise) can be made when detent engages
with notch/depression 404. Some embodiments of slide frame 400 can include a notch with
a moderate slope on one edge and a much steeper slope on the other edge that engages
with a pawl or detent within slide frame receiving slot to restrict movement of slide frame
400 in a single direction (e.g. using a ratchet/pawl mechanism).

   [0049]         Encoding information that is encoded within encoding block 410 can identify
   slide transparency 402 that is currently being projected. Many different encoding methods
   of encoding information into encoding block 410 can be used. For example, in FIG. 4,
  encoding block 410 is a color transparency that can be detected by the camera of mobile
  device 100 when used in the embodiment of image projection device 300. Light from
   camera flash 102 can pass through light channel 382 to illuminate the color transparency
  encoding block 410 and the color can be determined by mobile device 100 through its
  camera. Each slide transparency 402 on slide frame 400 can have a unique color
  associated with it.
  [0050]          Referring now to FIG. 5, shown is an embodiment of a rectangular slide frame
  500 that includes an encoding information in an encoding block that is within each slide
  transparency 502 itself (i.e. rather than in an encoding block separate 410 separate from
  slide transparencies 402 as in FIG. 4). FIG. 5 illustrates a number of different encoding
  methodologies, but preferably only a single type of encoding is used for a slide frame. In
  the first two example slide transparencies, the encoding block encodes information using a
  barcode embedded in slide transparency 502 that can be detected by a camera of mobile
  device 100 when slide transparency 502 is projected onto a projection surface. The
  encoding block can include a barcode of any type (including linear barcodes, 2-D barcodes
  such as QR codes, or barcodes that include color). For example, a linear barcode 512 and
  a QR code 514 are shown embedded in the slide transparencies 502 of FIG. 5. Slide frame
  500 includes depressions 504 that can engage a detent or pin in a slide frame receiving
  slot to aid in aligning slide frame 500 within aperture of image projection device.
  [0051]          In some embodiments, the encoding information can include the slide
  transparency image itself, such that mobile device 100 can use image processing to
5 identify the projected image from a number of possible slide transparencies. In these
  embodiments, encoding block can also be considered to be the slide transparency 502
  itself. For example, mobile device 100 can process the projected image obtained by the
  camera to obtain a signature for the projected image, and then compare this signature to
  signatures from a database, either on mobile device 100 or on a network connected server,
) to identify the particular slide transparency or the events that should be triggered by the
  mobile device 100. A cartoon sun 515, provided as an example, can result in a unique
                                                - 12-

       WO 2017/214710                                                    PCT/CA2017/000152
  signature to assist in identifying the particular slide transparency to mobile device 100. For
  example, an edge detection algorithm can be used to identify the projected slide on the
   projection surface, and then a further edge detection algorithm can be used on the
   identified projected slide to obtain an edge detection matrix that can be compared with the
   edge matrices of known slide transparencies.
   [0052]         Encoding information in an encoding block can be unique to all possible slide
  transparencies (i.e. a globally unique identifier) or only unique to the slide transparencies
  on a given slide frame (e.g. identifies the slide numbers 1 through 10). Depending on the
  encoding methodology used, it may be difficult to have globally unique identifiers for each
  slide transparency. For example, if the color encoding methodology is used, such as in FIG.
  4, it may only be possible to accurately encode a fixed number of colors that can be
  detected due to the distance of the encoding block to the camera, amount of light, and
  variability between      mobile device cameras from         various manufacturers.    In these
  embodiments without globally unique encoding information in encoding block 410, slide
  frame 400 can include a slide frame encoding block 420 that uniquely identifies slide frame
  400 so that a particular slide transparency 402 can be uniquely identified by the
  combination of encoding block 410 and slide frame encoding block 420. Slide frame
  identifier 420 can include written text on slide frame 400 (requiring user to identify slide
  frame to mobile device 100 through an input device) or can also include a near-field
  communication (NFC) tag that is detected by an NFC sensor of the mobile device 100, for
  example.
  [0053]          Referring now to FIG. 6, shown is a rectangular slide frame 600 with encoding
  blocks adjacent to each slide transparency 602. Again, multiple encoding methodologies
  are shown on slide frame 600 for illustration purposes. Slide frame 600 is designed such
5 that the encoding block is positioned near the slide decoder of mobile device 100, such as
  the mobile device camera or NFC transceiver. Directly focusing on the encoding block
  (rather than the projected encoding block in FIG. 5) can limit the resolution (or amount of
  information encoded) that can be reliably detected by the mobile device camera. Mobile
  device 100 can configure the camera to focus on the closely positioned encoding block.
  Slide frame 600 also includes a number of protrusions 606 that can mate with a
  corresponding depression within slide frame receiving slot to assist in the alignment of slide
                                                - 13-

    frame 600 within the aperture of image projection device. Examples shown in FIG. 6
     include encoding information with color using a color transparency 616, encoding
     information in a barcode, such as a linear barcode 617 and a QR code 618, and encoding
     information in an NFC tag 619.

     device 700 that can include a processor 710, a memory 720, a rear camera flash 730, a
     rear-facing camera 740, a display 750, a speaker 760, a slide decoder 770, and an input
     device 780. A communication interface 790 can be provided to allow mobile device 700 to
     communicate with other computing devices (including computerized embodiments of image
     projection device, for example) either wired or wirelessly, or over a communication network.
    As noted above, communication interface 790 can include the charging port of mobile
    device 700, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. Mobile device 700 can execute programs stored in memory
    720 using processor 710 to interact (receive input and output) from the other components
     illustrated in FIG. 7. Rear camera flash 730 and rear-facing camera 740 can be positioned
    on the rear surface of mobile device 700, such as that shown in FIG. 1. Mobile device 700
    can control rear camera flash 730 to operate as a projection light source for the image
     projection device 200 shown in FIG. 2. Examples of mobile device 700 can include mobile
    computing devices, such as mobile phones, laptop computers or tablet computing devices.
     [0055]         Mobile device 700 can provide audio and video through speaker 760 and
    display 750. Users can interact and provide input to mobile device 700 through input device
    780, which can include a keyboard, buttons, or a touch screen interface. Input received
    through input device 780 can be used to initiate sending instructions to a coupled image
    projection device (e.g. advance to next slide, adjust focus, etc.).
    [0056]          Slide decoder 770 can decode the encoding information in an encoding block
5   (such as encoding block 410 or slide frame encoding block 420) on a slide frame to assist
    in identifying a particular slide transparency. Slide decoder 770 can include rear-facing
    camera 740. Slide decoder 770 can also be a wireless receiver, such as a near-field
    communication transceiver.

  image projection device 200. Method 800 can be used to coordinate the playback of
  multimedia that corresponds to the slide transparency that is currently being projected. First
  at step 802, the slide frame is identified. This step can utilize slide decoder 770 of mobile
  device 700 to decode a slide frame encoding block, such as slide frame encoding block
  420. In other embodiments, this step can include the user of mobile device 700 providing
  an input through input device 780 to identify the slide frame, for example, by selecting a
  certain application associated with the slide frame or selecting a certain story within an
  application that is associated with the slide frame. In other embodiments, identifying the
  slide frame can also include slide decoder 770 decoding the encoding block associated
  with anyone of the slide transparencies.
  [0058]          Next, at step 804, a change of the slide transparency that is illuminated or
  projected is detected. This can include detecting a change in the encoding block associated
  with a slide transparency that is detected by slide decoder 770. This step can also include
  mobile device 700 receiving an instruction to advance the next slide from input device 780
  or a communication from image projection device 200 through communication interface 790
  that the slide frame has been advanced. Image projection device 200 can also include a
  switch within slide frame receiving slot 230 that is triggered each time the slide frame is
  advanced, and this switch information can be communicated to mobile device 100 in order
  to detect the change in step 804.
  [0059]         At step 806, an event on mobile device 100 is triggered that is associated with
  the currently illuminated slide transparency. The event on mobile device 100 can relate to
  the playback of audio through speaker 760 or updating display 750. The event can also be
  related to operation of rear camera flash 730, such as, toggling it off and on to simulate
  lightning, for example.
5 [0060]         An example of the operation of image projection device 200 and method 800
  can include usage for a children's story or song. A slide frame can contain a series of
  image transparencies that are associated with the children's story or song, and the mobile
  device runs a companion application that assists with the story telling (e.g. audio such as
  music and story narrative, story text displayed on mobile device display). The companion
) application activates the camera flash of the mobile device to illuminate the slide
                                               -15-

transparencies and receives information to identify the slide transparency and/or slide
frame through a slide detection module (e.g. using a camera or an NFC sensor of the
 mobile device). Mobile device detects the change in the encoding information when the
 slide is advanced and triggers an event in the companion application executing on the
 mobile device (e.g. turning book page, starting audio book audio associated with the book
 page, playback of sound effects or story narrative). The companion application can also
allow a user to select a language and the companion application can obtain the associated
content or story in the selected language.
