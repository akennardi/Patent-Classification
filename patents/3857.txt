 5 [0034] When it is necessary to execute the wheel self-propelled and automatic sweeping
   functions during the operation of the machine, users simply pull the lift-up handle 21 to
   drive the trigger 11 to rotate, so that the rotating seat 40 and second gear 42 of the
   transmission gearbox 12 attached to each other can rotate synchronously, so as to drive
   first wheel 6 and second wheel 7 to rotate by the first belt 15.      In the meantime, the
 0 conveyance of the chain 26 and the second belt 31 drives the rotary brush body 34 to
   rotate, so as to achieve the self-propelled effect of the wheel and the automatic sweeping
   function of the brush 36. The steel wire 49 combs a lawn and separate garbage such as
   the dead leaves tangled in a bush, so that the garbage including the dead leaves is passed
   through the vacuum pipe 4 and sucked to the interior of the vane 46 before cutting or
 5 crushing the garbage. After the garbage is crushed, it enters into the deposit box 5. The
   structural design of this disclosure is very clever and capable of achieving the self
   propelled effect and the automatic sweeping function. The application is very convenient
   and capable of reducing the degree of fatigue of the manual operation. In the meantime,
   the automatic sweeping function can separate the garbage attached on the ground, the wet
20 leaves attached to the ground. The automatic combing function can comb the garbage
   including the dead leaves tangled deeply with the bush. The internal garbage crushing
   function thoroughly crushes the garbage with a larger surface and improves the collection
   efficiency of the collection bag. The vacuum pipe 4 can suck the garbage scattered in
   corners, ditches, flowers, or any place where other machines cannot reach. The machine
25 of this disclosure has a powerful blowing-suction performance, and the suction function
   of the vacuum pipe 4 may be switched to the blowing function to blow and collect the
   garbage scattered in fragmented areas, and such function is integrated with the vent, so
   that the garbage may be sucked into the vent and passed through an air passage, and
   finally inputted into the garbage deposit box 5. The application is very convenient.
30 [0035]While this disclosure has been described by means of specific embodiments,
                                                9

numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art
without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention set forth in the claims.
