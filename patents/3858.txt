   A cleaning head for cleaning a submerged surface is
   disclosed.  The cleaning head comprises at least one
 5 cleaning member arranged to cause material on the
   submerged surface to separate from the submerged surface
   when the cleaning head is disposed on the submerged
   surface during use and the cleaning member moves relative
   to the submerged surface, and at least one suction
10 aperture through which material separated from the
   submerged surface by the at least one cleaning member is
   drawn away from the cleaning head when  a negative
   pressure is generated at the suction aperture.  For each
   cleaning member, at least one suction aperture is disposed
15 such that the cleaning member rotates around the suction
   aperture as the cleaning member moves relative to the
   submerged surface, and material separated from the
   submerged surface by the cleaning member is drawn through
   the suction aperture.

                     A MARINE CLEANING  SYSTEM
   Field of the Invention
 5 The invention relates to a marine cleaning system, in
   particular for cleaning an underwater portion of a vessel
   hull or other structure.
   Background of the Invention
10
   It is known that a tendency exists for an underwater
   portion of a vessel hull or structure to become
   increasingly fouled over time to the extent that
   eventually a significant layer of material, including in
15 some circumstances living organisms, accumulates on the
   underwater portion of the vessel hull or structure.
   If such fouling is not removed from the vessel hull or
   structure, significant problems can occur, including
20 damage to the vessel hull or structure and, in the case of
   a marine vessel, a reduction in seafaring performance of
   the vessel.   In addition, some living organisms can be
   noxious and, if transported to other locations,  can be
   dangerous to local species.
25
   Uncontrolled in-water cleaning can release chemical and
   biological contaminants into the local environment, and
   for example may stimulate the release of reproductive
   propagules, or plant and animal fragments capable of
30 regeneration.
   In order to avoid release of such contaminants into the
   local marine environment, conventional vessel hull
   cleaning techniques have involved removing the vessel from
35 the water, and subsequently cleaning the vessel hull.
   However, this approach is expensive and time consuming.

                                 -2
   In AU2012244227 a cleaning head is disclosed for cleaning
   a submerged surface.   The cleaning head has a body
   portion, a skirt portion extending around a periphery of
   the body portion, and rotatable brushes or scrapers that
 5 contact and move relative to the submerged surface to
   cause material on the submerged surface to separate from
   the submerged surface.   Separated material is drawn away
   from the cleaning head through a suction aperture by a
   pump.

   Description of an Embodiment of the Invention
10 Referring to the drawings, in Figure 1 there is shown a
   marine cleaning system 10 for cleaning a submerged portion
   of a vessel or other structure in situ.
   The present embodiment is described in relation to
15 cleaning a vessel hull, although it will be understood
   that other applications are envisaged.
   The system 10 includes a cleaning head 14,  in this example
   arranged during use to be disposed on an underwater
20 portion of a vessel hull 12 and configured so as to
   separate fouling material from the vessel hull 12.
   The system 10 also includes a device for generating a
   negative pressure in a space defined between the cleaning
25 head 14 and the vessel hull 12 so that material that is
   separated from the vessel hull by the cleaning head 14 is
   discouraged from passing into the surrounding marine
   environment and instead is drawn away from the cleaning
   head 14.   In this example, the device for generating
30 negative pressure is a conventional suction pump 16 of the
   type configured to operate in a marine environment.   The
   suction pump 16 may be hydraulically or electrically
   powered.
35 In a marine environment, the fouling material present on a
   vessel hull 12 is typically predominantly of biological
   type, although other types of material may also be

                               -11
   present.
   The system 10 also includes a separation device 18
   arranged to receive a slurry of water and material
 5 separated from the vessel 12 and to separate the water and
   material from each other, and a disinfection device 20
   arranged to substantially disinfect the water that has
   been separated from the material.
10 It will be understood that the separation device 18 and
   the disinfection device 20 may take any suitable form, and
   in this example the separation device 18 is of a type
   manufactured by Baleen Filters Pty Ltd, for example a
   B1010S Baleen filter, and the disinfection device is of a
15 type manufactured by Berson Milieutechniek BV, for example
   a Berson inline 450 UV disinfection device.   The
   disinfection device may in addition or alternatively
   include a chemical based disinfection component.   Flow
   meters and other volume measuring devices may also be
20 included in order to improve water treatment quality.
   The system 10 also includes a power unit 22 arranged to
   provide components of the system with the required
   electrical and/or hydraulic power.
25
   In this example, the separation device 18,  the
   disinfection device 20 and the power unit 22 are disposed
   above the waterline 32, for example on a jetty 30,   and the
   suction pump 16 is disposed below the waterline 32.
30
   During use, the cleaning head 14 is disposed adjacent a
   portion of the vessel hull 12 desired to be cleaned and
   the suction pump 16 is activated so that a slurry
   containing water and material separated from the vessel
35 hull 12 by the cleaning head 14 is drawn away from the
   cleaning head 14 and caused to move up to the separation
   device 18 through an extraction conduit 19.   At the

                               -12
   separation device 18, solid material separated from the
   slurry collects in a solids collection bin 36 and water
   filtered from the slurry passes through the disinfection
   device 20 and back to the surrounding marine environment
 5 through an outlet pipe 34.
   While the present example is described in relation to a
   vessel hull 12, it will be understood that the system is
   applicable to any structure having a part which is
10 submerged and therefore susceptible to fouling.   It will
   also be understood that while the present example is
   described in relation to cleaning bio-fouling from a
   vessel hull or submerged structure, the system is also
   applicable to cleaning other types of fouling that may
15 build up on structures submerged under water, or indeed in
   other fluid environments, for prolonged periods of time.
   Referring to Figures 2 and 3, the cleaning head 14 is
   shown in more detail.
20
   The cleaning head 14 in this example includes first and
   second body portions 40, 42 that are moveably connected to
   each other so that the profile defined by the first and
   second body portions 40, 42 is adjustable.   In this
25 example, the first and second body portions 40,  42 are
   connected to each other by a hinge 44 that enables the
   first and second body portions 40,  42 to pivot relative to
   each other.  This enables the first and second body
   portions 40, 42 to generally conform to the curvature of a
30 structure such as a vessel hull 12.
   A periphery defined by the first and second body portions
   40, 42 is provided with a skirt portion 46,  in this
   example of bristle like configuration.   The purpose of the
35 skirt portion 46 is to provide a seal of sufficient
   efficacy between the first and second body portions 40,    42
   and a surface of a structure intended to be cleaned.    In

                               - 13
   this regard, the seal should be sufficiently efficacious
   that the negative pressure generated by the suction pump
   16 causes material separated from the surface to be drawn
   away from the surface through the cleaning head 14 with
 5 minimal egression of material past the skirt portion 46 to
   the surrounding marine environment.    This is important
   because biological material separated from the surface of
   the vessel hull 12 has the potential to cause undesirable
   consequences to the surrounding environment.
10
   As shown more particularly in Figure 3, the cleaning head
   14 includes one or more cleaning members arranged to cause
   material on the surface of the vessel 12 to separate from
   the surface.  In this example, two counter rotating
15 cleaning members are provided and each cleaning member is
   in the form of a rotatable brush 48.
   In this example, the brushes 48 are caused to rotate by at
   least one first hydraulic motor 50, although it will be
20 understood that other arrangements for causing rotation of
   the brushes 48 are envisaged.    In this example, 2 first
   hydraulic motors 50 are provided, with each rotatable
   brush having an associated first hydraulic motor 50.
25 The cleaning head 14 also includes a suction pipe 52 that
   extends from the cleaning head 14 to the suction pump 16.
   The suction pipe 52 conveys the slurry of water and
   material separated from the surface away from the cleaning
   head 14 during use.  Extending from the suction pipe 52
30 are first suction conduits 54 in communication with the
   suction pipe 52 and extending to respective first suction
   apertures 56 disposed at opposite sides of the cleaning
   head 14.  Also extending from the suction pipe 52 are
   second suction conduits 58 in communication with the
35 suction pipe 52 and extending to respective second suction
   apertures 60 disposed at an end of the cleaning head 14
   remote from the suction pipe 52.    In this example, the

                               -14
   first and second suction apertures 56,  60 are disposed
   adjacent the rotatable brushes 48.
   In an example, the first hydraulic motors(s) 50 may
 5 include a pump assembly arranged to increase efficiency in
   the cleaning head by pushing the slurry of water and
   material separated from the surface towards the suction
   apertures 56, 60.
10 In this example, the cleaning head 14 also includes a
   drive mechanism arranged to urge the cleaning head to move
   in a direction parallel to the hinge 44 during use.   In
   this example, the drive mechanism includes a second
   hydraulic motor 62 connected to a reduction gearbox 64 and
15 arranged to drive movement of the cleaning head 14.
   The drive mechanism includes a first drive shaft 66
   connected to the reduction gearbox 64 and a first drive
   wheel 68 mounted on the first drive shaft 66.   The first
20 drive shaft 66 is connected through a universal joint 70
   to a second drive shaft 72, and a second drive wheel 74 is
   mounted on the second drive shaft 72.
   Since the first and second drive shafts 66,  72 are
25 connected together through the universal joint 70,
   rotation of the first drive shaft 66 causes rotation of
   the second drive shaft 72 and thereby rotation of the
   first and second drive wheels 68,  74.  During use, when
   the first and second drive wheels 68, 74 rotate, contact
30 between the first and second drive wheels 68, 74 and the
   surface being cleaned causes the cleaning head 14 to move
   in a direction generally parallel to the hinge 44.
   It will be understood that the universal joint 70 ensures
35 that the drive mechanism is able to cause the cleaning
   head 14 to move for a wide range of angles between the
   first and second body portions 40,  42.

                                 - 15
   A non-driven rear wheel 76 is also provided.
   The wheels 68,  74, 76 may be of any suitable
 5 configuration, and in this example each wheel comprises a
   wheel body and metal wire 78 wound around the wheel body.
   In this example, the cleaning head 14 also includes a flow
   control device 80 arranged to control the flow of
10 hydraulic fluid to the second hydraulic motor 62 and
   thereby the speed of rotation of the second hydraulic
   motor 62, the speed of rotation of the first and second
   drive wheels 68,  74 and the speed of movement of the
   cleaning head 14.
15
   The first and second hydraulic motors 50,      62 are supplied
   with hydraulic fluid through hydraulic conduits 92 that
   extend from the first and second hydraulic motors 50,      62
   to the power unit 22 disposed above the waterline 32.
20
   In an example, the hydraulic power may be derived from a
   salt water hydraulic power system arranged to provide
   pressurised salt water to the first and second hydraulic
   motors 50,  62.  This arrangement has advantages in that a
25 return line is not  required.
   In this example, the cleaning head 14 also includes first
   and second height adjustment devices 84,      86 arranged to
   facilitate adjustment of the distance between the first
30 and second body portions 40,    42 and the surface to be
   cleaned.   The height adjustment devices 84,     86 facilitate
   modification of the position of the drive wheels 68,      74
   and the non-driven wheel 75 relative to the first and
   second body portions 40,  42.      In this way, the degree of
35 compression of the skirt portion 46 during use is
   adjustable, and as a consequence the efficacy of the seal
   formed between the skirt portion 46 and the surface being

                                - 16
   cleaned is adjustable.   The effect of this is that the
   pressure differential between the surrounding marine
   environment and the space defined by the cleaning head 14
   and the surface being cleaned is adjustable as required,
 5 and therefore the amount of water passing into the space
   defined by the cleaning head 14 and the surface is
   controllable.
   In this example, the cleaning head 14 also includes
10 buoyancy members 90 that assist the cleaning head to
   remain in contact with the surface to be cleaned.
   The system 10 may also include an auxiliary cleaning head
   100 connectable to the suction pump 16 and usable by an
15 operator to manually clean material from a surface.      Such
   an auxiliary cleaning head 100 may include a skirt portion
   102 of similar configuration to the skirt portion 46 of
   the cleaning head 14, may provide a negative pressure
   region adjacent the surface to be cleaned, and may or may
20 not include cleaning members that actively remove material
   from the surface.
   The system 10 may also include a safety mechanism 104
   configured such that positive input from an operator is
25 required in order to activate the rotatable brushes 48
   and/or the drive mechanism.    In the absence of such
   positive input, operation of the rotatable brushes    48
   and/or the drive mechanism ceases.    The safety mechanism
   may be of a type conventionally referred to as a    'dead
30 man's control' wherein operation ceases if the operator is
   incapacitated or otherwise unable to operate the cleaning
   head 14.
   During operation, an operator places the cleaning head 14
35 adjacent a surface to be cleaned such that the skirt
   portion 46 contacts the surface, and activates the system
   so that the brushes  48 begin to rotate and a negative

                                - 17
   pressure is generated in the space defined by the first
   and second body portions 40,   42 and the surface to be
   cleaned.  As material is separated from the surface by the
   brushes 48, the material becomes entrained in surrounding
 5 water and a slurry containing the water and separated
   material is sucked through the suction pipe 52 by the
   suction pump 16 up to the separation device 18,   in this
   example disposed on the jetty 30.    The separation device
   receives the slurry, separates water from the slurry and
10 feeds the separated water into the disinfection device 20.
   Solid material separated from the slurry passes into a
   solids collection bin 36, and water passing through the
   disinfection device 20 is disinfected and recycled back to
   the marine environment through the outlet pipe 34.
15
   It will be appreciated that the cleaning system enables an
   operator to substantially clean material from a submerged
   surface, in particular a surface of a vessel hull 12, in
   situ, because substantially all of the material removed
20 from the surface is transported away from the surface
   without leeching into the surrounding water.    Removal of
   the vessel from the water in order to effect cleaning is
   not necessary.
25 In a variation of the above embodiment, in addition to or
   instead of the rotatable brushes   48, the cleaning members
   may include one or more rotatable cleaning elements
   arranged to scrape material from the surface to be treated
   during use.
30
   In a further variation of the above embodiment, in
   addition to or instead of the rotatable brushes 48,   the
   cleaning members may include one or more cleaning elements
   arranged to generate a fluid current adjacent the surface
35 to be treated that causes material to be released from the
   surface during use substantially without touching the
   surface.

                               - 18
   For example, in Figures 4 to 8 an alternative cleaning
   member 90 that includes a plurality of cleaning elements
   92 is shown.  The cleaning elements 92 in this example are
 5 removably disposed on a rotatable disc portion 94,   in this
   example by engaging bolts with fixing apertures 93
   provided on the disc portion 94.
   In this example, the cleaning member 90 is arranged such
10 that suction may be applied directly to a location between
   the cleaning member and a surface to be cleaned during
   use, and for this purpose the disc portion 94 includes a
   central aperture 95 through which suction may be applied
   during use.
15
   A cleaning element 92 is shown more particularly in
   Figures 5 to 8.  The cleaning element 92 in this example
   includes fixing apertures 96 that facilitate fixing of the
   cleaning element to the disc portion 94,  the fixing
20 apertures 96 being recessed on an upper side of the
   cleaning element, as shown in Figure 8.
   In this example, the cleaning element 92 includes a key
   portion 97 that engages with a corresponding recess or
25 aperture in the disc portion 94.
   The cleaning element 92 also includes a foot portion 98
   extending outwardly and that, in this example, defines a
   wedge shaped portion that tapers at an angle a shown in
30 Figure 6 of approximately 45'.   At an opposite side of the
   cleaning element to the foot portion 98 is a cut out
   portion 99 that in this example defines a space of
   approximately the same shape and size as the foot portion
   98.
35
   The cleaning elements 92 are disposed on the disc portion
   94 and the disc portion is disposed and moved during use

                                - 19
   such that as the disc portion 94 rotates the cut out
   portion 99 follows the rotational path defined by the foot
   portion 98,  and the foot and cut out portions 98,  99 move
   relative to a surface to be treated with the foot and cut
 5 out portions 98,  99 closely adjacent and spaced from the
   surface.   Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is
   believed that this arrangement causes a positive pressure
   region to be produced adjacent the foot portion 98 and a
   negative pressure  region to be produced adjacent the cut
10 out portion 99, and this in turn causes a fluid vortex
   effect adjacent the surface that causes material disposed
   on the surface to be removed.
   It will be understood that the alternative cleaning member
15 90 enables material to be removed from a surface to be
   treated substantially without touching the surface, and
   this may be particularly useful in situations wherein
   contact with the surface is likely to cause damage, or in
   situations wherein the surface is coated with a substance
20 such as silicone or copper oxide that is desired to be
   maintained on the surface or that would be toxic if
   removed.
   In this example, the cleaning elements 92 are formed of
25 nylon material, although it will be understood that any
   suitable material is envisaged.
   An alternative embodiment of a cleaning head 88
   incorporating the alternative cleaning member 90 is shown
30 in Figures  9 to 13.  Like and similar features are
   indicated with like reference numerals.
   In this example, each cleaning member 90 is rotatably
   mounted in a housing 140,  as shown more particularly in
35 Figures 9 to 12.   Each housing 140 includes a fluid outlet
   pipe 142 in fluid communication with the suction pump 16
   and a drive aperture 144 arranged to rotatably receive a

                               -20
   drive shaft 146.
   Each drive shaft 146 is connected to a pressure imparting
   device arranged to produce a region of reduced pressure
 5 centrally of the housing 140.   In this example, the
   pressure imparting device includes an impeller 148.
   The impeller 148 in this example includes a disc portion
   150 integral with a hollow central raised section 152
10 provided with alternate wall portions 154 and apertures
   156.  The impeller 148 also includes externally disposed
   blades 158 that serve to move fluid as the impeller 148
   rotates, and a central aperture 159 defined by the central
   raised section 152 and in fluid communication with the
15 apertures 156.
   The impeller 148 is connected to the disc portion 94
   through resilient members 160,  in this example springs,
   that serve to allow the disc portion 94 and thereby the
20 cleaning member 90 to resiliently move relative to the
   impeller 148.  The central aperture 159 of the impeller
   148 and the central aperture 95 of the disc portion 94
   substantially align when the disc portion 94 and the
   impeller 148 are connected together.
25
   During use, the drive shaft 146 is caused to rotate by a
   first hydraulic motor 50, in this example in an anti
   clockwise direction indicated in Figure 11, which causes
   the impeller 148 to rotate and thereby generate a negative
30 pressure region inside the central raised section 152 of
   the impeller 148.  At the same time, the cleaning member
   90 also rotates thereby causing material to be removed
   from a surface adjacent the cleaning elements 92.
35 It will be understood that the negative pressure region at
   the central raised section 152 of the impeller 148 causes
   material removed from the surface to be drawn into the

                               -21
   impeller 148 and through the apertures 156 in the impeller
   148 to the fluid outlet pipe 142.
   In this way, in addition to the negative pressure
 5 generated between the cleaning member 90 and the surface
   to be cleaned by the suction pump 16,  a negative pressure
   is also generated by the action of the impeller 148 which
   enhances the suction force applied to the slurry adjacent
   the cleaning member 90.
10
   It will also be understood that generating a negative
   pressure at the cleaning head in addition to generating a
   negative pressure using a remote suction pump enables
   lighter and less expensive conduit to be used between the
15 suction pump 16 and the cleaning head 14,  88.
   As shown in Figure 13, the alternative cleaning head 88 in
   this example includes 2 alternative cleaning members 90,
   each mounted in a respective housing 140.   The alternative
20 cleaning members 90 and associated drive motors are
   arranged so that the cleaning members  90 counter rotate
   during use.
   In this example, the circumferential wall 160 of each
25 housing is provided with a skirt portion, in this example
   of bristle like configuration, the purpose of which is to
   improve a seal with the surface 12 of the structure
   intended to be cleaned.
30 It will be appreciated that during use the alternative
   cleaning head 88 provides a first chamber defined by each
   housing 140 and the surface 12 to be cleaned, and a second
   chamber defined with the surface 12 to be cleaned that
   encloses the first chamber.   This configuration provides
35 dual protection against egress of material from the
   cleaning head 88 to the surrounding water during use.

                               -22
   While the alternative cleaning head 88 is described in
   relation to a cleaning member 90 provided with cleaning
   elements 92, it will be understood that features of the
   alternative cleaning head 88 may be incorporated into the
 5 cleaning head 14 shown in Figures 2 and 3 where
   appropriate.  For example, the cleaning head 14 may
   incorporate an arrangement for generating negative
   pressure at the cleaning head 14, for example using an
   impeller configuration of the type shown in Figures 9 to
10 13 to generate suction generally centrally of the
   rotatable brushes 48.
   The cleaning system 10 may also include an enclosure that
   can be used to remove fouling on and adjacent appendages
15 of a vessel, such as anodes, transducer housings,  suction
   grates and recesses.
   The enclosure includes a frame member, a pair of support
   hoops at longitudinal ends of the enclosure, and a pair of
20 end plates.  The frame member, the support hoops and the
   end plates provide structural integrity for transparent
   top, side and end walls.  In this embodiment, the
   transparent walls are formed of Perspex material, although
   it will be understood that other suitable materials are
25 envisaged.
   The top wall includes a top support bar in which elongate
   top apertures are formed, and attached inwardly of the
   enclosure over the top apertures is a sealing strip.   The
30 sealing strip is formed of resilient material, such as
   rubber, and includes a longitudinal slit.
   Similarly, the side and end walls also include side
   apertures formed in side bars, end apertures, and
35 associated sealing strips and longitudinal slits.
   The frame member may also be provided with one or more

                                -23
   sealing members, for example formed of rubber material,
   which assist in providing a good seal between the
   enclosure and a vessel during use.
 5 The purpose of the apertures and sealing strips is to
   enable a cleaning nozzle  (not shown) to be disposed in the
   space defined by the enclosure without overly compromising
   the relative negative pressure environment in the space.
10 The enclosure also includes a pipe stub in communication
   with the space inside the enclosure, the pipe stub
   disposed on one of the side support bars and facilitating
   connection to a suction hose of the cleaning system.
15 In this example, the frame member, the support hoops, the
   side plates and the support bars are formed of aluminium
   material, although it will be understood that other
   suitable materials are envisaged.
20 During use, the enclosure is disposed over an appendage
   that is desired to be cleaned and a suction hose  (not
   shown) is attached to the pipe stub so as to create a
   relative negative pressure environment inside the
   enclosure.  A suitable high pressure cleaning nozzle is
25 then inserted through one of the apertures and used to
   clean fouling from at and around the appendage(s).
   Fouling material that is separated from the vessel is
   drawn out of the enclosure, and for example caused to move
   up to the separation device 18 through the extraction
30 conduit 19.
   It will be appreciated that the transparent walls provide
   a user with good vision during a cleaning operation, and
   the configuration of the enclosure allows regions of a
35 vessel hull adjacent appendages to be cleaned whilst
   minimising egression of fouling material into the
   surrounding marine environment outside of the enclosure.

   Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a
   skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the
