           DURING NON-ACUTE PERIODS FOLLOWING CNS NEUROLOGICAL INJURY
                                        FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         [001]  The field of the invention relates to treatment of central nervous system
neuroinjury. More specifically, the invention is directed to the administration of a neuregulin
[e.g., glial growth factor 2 (GGF2)] to a subject during the non-acute or chronic period following
traumatic neuroinjury.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         10021  Central nervous system ( CNS) injuries to are a serious health problem. This
category of injury includes events such as ischemic injury, hemorrhagic injury, penetrating
trauma and non-penetrating trauma. CNS injuries generally heal incompletely leaving the
subject with some degree of permanent dysfunction ranging from extremely mild to death. The
residual dysfunction may include motor, sensory, cognitive, emotional and autonomic
abnormalities.
         10031  A key category of CNS neuroinjury comprises brain injury. Brain injury is a
devastating condition that results in some degree of permanent disability including motor,
sensory and cognitive deficits and emotional instability such as post traumatic stress disorder,
attention deficit disorder, depression and emotional lability. Common causes of brain injury
include ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, closed
head injury (acceleration / deceleration, concussion and rotational), penetrating brain injury (gun
shot wounds and other projectiles).
         [0041  Stroke is the third-leading cause of death and the main cause of disability in the
western world. Stroke, therefore, presents a large socioeconomic burden. The etiology of a
stroke can be either ischemic, which is the case in the majority of strokes, or hemorrhagic. An
ischemic stroke can be caused by a clot that forms elsewhere in the body and travels via the
bloodstream to the brain (embolic stroke) or by a blood clot that forms inside the artery of the

        WO 2010/019275                                                             PC2T/ S2009/004692
brain (thrombotic stroke). After massive cell death in the immediate infarct core due to lack of
glucose and oxygen, the infarct area expands for days, owing to secondary mechanisms such as
glutamate excitotoxicity, apoptotic mechanisms, and generation of free radicals. Following
neuroinjuries (e.g. an ischemic event ) animals and people may recover function over several
days, weeks and months without any therapeutic. All too often, this recovery however is only
partial and animals and people suffer from permanent disability which may include motor,
sensory and cognitive deficits.
         10051 Risk factors that increase the likelihood of an individual having a stroke are well
known. These include, and are not limited to, risk factors that can not be changed: advanced age,
heredity, ace, gender, prior history of stroke or heart attack; and risk factors that can be changed,
treated or controlled: high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, carotid or other
artery disease, atrial fibrillation, other heart disease, sickle cell disease, high blood cholesterol,
poor diet, and physical inactivity and obesity.
         [0061    To date, the non-palliative treatment of ischemic stroke is confined to
therapeutics administered in the acute phase following a stroke. The acute phase ranges from the
time of onset of the neuroinjury (e.g., stroke) to approximately six hours post-neuroinjury. The
acute phase is followed by the semi-acute phase, which ranges from approximately six hours to
two days post-neuroinjury. Accordingly, current non-palliative therapeutics are used in an
attempt to reverse the occlusion of blood flow, restore oxygenation of the brain and limit the
extent of lost brain structure. Other than tPA for acute use, there are no drugs are approved for
the treatment of stroke. Patients remain with some level of dysfunction that at best may improve
somewhat endogenously for approximately 60 days. This recovery may only be augmented by
physical therapy. Unfortunately, many patients are left with permanent disability with little hope
for improvement.
         10071  At present, the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for the treatment of ischemic stroke is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). tPA is a serine
protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin then breaks fibrin which is a component
of the clots that occlude the vessels in the brain and cause strokes. It is ideally administered
within three hours from the onset of symptoms. Generally, only 3% to 5% of individuals who
suffer a stroke reach the hospital in time to be considered for this treatment. Ideally, tPA is
administered within the first three hours post-occlusion, but may be administered by some
                                                     2

        WO 2010/019275                                                            PCT/US2009/004692
clinicians as late as six hours post-occlusion. Unfortunately, the vast majority of patients who
experience a stroke fail to reach the hospital in time to be considered for this treatment. For
those patients who arrive at the hospital within the efficacious temporal window, tPA is
administered in an attempt to reverse the occlusion of blood flow, restore oxygenation of the
brain and limit the extent of lost brain structure. However, there are some significant
contraindications that limit the ongoing use of tPA. After an initial period of about 3 to 6 hours,
at most, tPA can cause intracerbral bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. For such reasons, tPA is
limited to administration during the acute phase in order to achieve any therapeutic efficacy.
         1008]   To date no other therapy has been approved for the treatment of stroke. Other
experimental therapies such as arterially delivered pro-urokinase are under investigation as
potential means for disrupting clots and restoring blood flow. The scientific literature has,
however, described many agents that have proven beneficial for protecting brain matter and
restoring function in experimental animal models of stroke. All these agents focus on reducing
acute cell death, inflammation, and apoptosis and must, therefore, be delivered within hours
(some up to 24 hours) after the ischemic event. Heretofore, it is generally accepted that treatment
for CNS injury such as stroke is required acutely. (Abe et al., 2008, J Cereb Blood Flow Metab. Jul
23, Epub ahead of print, Sun et al., 2008, Stroke Jul 10, Epub ahead of print, pages not available
yet); Dohare et al., 2008, Behav Brain Res. 193(2):289-97; Belayev et al., 2001, Stroke
32(2):553-60).
         10091   Such agents have not, however, been shown to limit damage to the brain, restore
function or enhance recovery following stroke when administered after a lag time of several
hours, at most in some experimental animal models about one day following stroke. The only
therapy known to show efficacy days and weeks after a stroke is palliative or rehabilitative, such
as occupational or physical therapy. Indeed, the present inventors are not aware of any agents or
drugs that have been shown to enhance recovery days or weeks following stroke.
         [00101 After an acute occlusion, there is often a localized area of destroyed brain matter
that is surrounded by a penumbral zone that will die within hours if circulation is not restored.
The time to death of this penumbral zone can be extended by a few hours in experimental models
with neuroprotectants, such as NMDA antagonists, calcium channel blockers, radical scavengers
and trapping agents, anti-apoptotics, caspase inhibitors, parp inhibitors, etc. For this purpose a
"neuroprotectant" is something that can save neurons before they die from the variety of insults

presented to them in the acute phase.     After 24 to 48 hours, however, there is little hope for
protecting cells from necrotic death and, while apoptotic death continues for several days (See
Figure 1 the therapeutic window for anti-apoptotic therapies has not proven to be much wider
than acute protective therapies [Schulz et al., 1998, Cell Death Differ. 5(10):847-57; Komjati et
al., 2004, Int J Mol Med. 13(3):373-82].
         10011] Neuregulin exhibits neuroprotective properties which, like other agents described
above, have shown benefit in reducing the disability seen if delivered to animals within hours
after stroke. See United States Application Serial Number 09/530,884, the entire contents of
which are incorporated herein by reference.
         [00121 In view of the prevalence of neuroinjury, particularly with regard to stroke, there
is a need for therapeutic agents that can be administered efficaciously to subjects to limit damage
to the brain, restore function and/or enhance recovery following neuroinjury.
         [0013] Neuregulins (NRGs) and NRG receptors comprise a growth factor-receptor
tyrosine kinase system for cell-cell signaling that is involved in organogenesis in nerve, muscle,
epithelia, and other tissues (Lemke, Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 7:247-262, 1996 and Burden et al.,
Neuron 18:847-855, 1997). The NRG family consists of four genes that encode numerous
ligands containing epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like, immunoglobulin (Ig), and other
recognizable domains. Numerous secreted and membrane-attached isoforms function as ligands
in this signaling system. The receptors for NRG ligands are all members of the EGF receptor
(EGFR) family, and include EGFR (or ErbB 1), ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4, also known as HERI
through HER4, respectively, in humans (Meyer et al., Development 124:3575-3586, 1997; Orr
Urtreger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 1867-71, 1993; Marchionni et al., Nature
362:312-8, 1993; Chen et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 349:389-400, 1994; Corfas et al., Neuron 14:103
 115, 1995; Meyer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:1064-1068, 1994; and Pinkas-Kramarski
et al., Oncogene 15:2803-2815, 1997).
         [00141 The four NRG genes, NRG-1, NRG-2, NRG-3, and NRG-4, map to distinct
chromosomal loci (Pinkas-Kramarski et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:9387-91, 1994;
Carraway et al., Nature 387:512-516, 1997; Chang et al., Nature 387:509-511, 1997; and Zhang
et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:9562-9567, 1997), and collectively encode a diverse array
of NRG proteins. The gene products of NRG-1, for example, comprise a group of approximately
 15 distinct structurally-related isoforms (Lemke, Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 7:247-262, 1996 and Peles
                                                   4

 and Yarden, BioEssays 15:815-824, 1993). The first-identified isoforms of NRG-1 included Neu
 Differentiation Factor (NDF; Peles et al., Cell 69, 205-216, 1992 and Wen et al., Cell 69, 559
 572, 1992), heregulin (HRG; Holmes et al., Science 256:1205-1210, 1992), Acetylcholine
 Receptor Inducing Activity (ARIA; Falls et al., Cell 72:801-815, 1993), and the glial growth
 factors GGF1, GGF2, and GGF3 (Marchionni et al. Nature 362:312-8, 1993).
          [00151 The NRG-2 gene was identified by homology cloning (Chang et al., Nature
 387:509-512, 1997; Carraway et al., Nature 387:512-516, 1997; and Higashiyama et al., J.
 Biochem. 122:675-680, 1997) and through genomic approaches (Busfield et al., Mol. Cell. Biol.
 17:4007-4014, 1997). NRG-2 cDNAs are also known as Neural- and Thymus-Derived Activator
 of ErbB Kinases (NTAK; Genbank Accession No. AB005060), Divergent of Neuregulin (Don
 1), and Cerebellum-Derived Growth Factor (CDGF; PCT application WO 97/09425).
 Experimental evidence shows that cells expressing ErbB4 or the ErbB2fErbB4 combination are
 likely to show a particularly robust response to NRG-2 (Pinkas-Kramarski et al., Mol. Cell. Biol.
 18:6090-6101, 1998). The NRG-3 gene product (Zhang et al., supra) is also known to bind and
 activate ErbB4 receptors (Hijazi et al., Int. J. Oncol. 13:1061-1067, 1998).
          [00161 An EGF-like domain is present at the core of all forms of NRGs, and is required
 for binding and activating ErbB receptors. Deduced amino acid sequences of the EGF-like
domains encoded in the three genes are approximately 30-40% identical (pairwise comparisons).
Further, there appear to be at least two sub-forms of EGF-like domains in NRG-1 and NRG-2,
which may confer different bioactivities and tissue-specific potencies
          [0017] Cellular responses to NRGs are mediated through the NRG receptor tyrosine
kinases EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. High
affinity binding of all NRGs is mediated principally via either ErbB3 or ErbB4. Binding of NRG
ligands leads to dimerization with other ErbB subunits and transactivation by phosphorylation on
specific tyrosine residues. In certain experimental settings, nearly all combinations of ErbB
receptors appear to be capable of forming dimers in response to the binding of NRG-1 isoforms.
However, it appears that ErbB2 is a preferred dimerization partner that may play an important
role in stabilizing the ligand-receptor complex. ErbB2 does not bind ligand on its own, but must
be heterologously paired with one of the other receptor subtypes. ErbB3 does not possess
tyrosine kinase activity, but is a target for phosphorylation by the other receptors. Expression of

        [00181 The present invention presents a novel method for treating following neuroinjury
in a mammal. The method is based on the observation that therapeutic benefits of a polypeptide
that contains an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) domain can be achieved by
administering a therapeutically effective amount of the polypeptide to a mammal; in certain
embodiments the treatment is performed at or after hour 1, hour 2, hour 8, hour 12, hour 24, hour
30, hour 36 hour 42, day 2 or later following neuroinjury. In one embodiment of the invention
treatment is initiated after the acute window post-injury. In one embodiment of the invention
treatment is initiated after the semi-acute window post-injury. In one embodiment of the
invention treatment is initiated during and yet continues after the acute window post-injury. In
one embodiment of the invention treatment is initiated during and yet continues after the semi
acute window post-injury.
        [00191 Accordingly, the present invention comprises administration of a polypeptide (or
nucleic acid encoding same) that contains an EGF-like domain to the mammal starting at day 1,
2 or 3 even up to and including days 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 days; a week or more than
one week, two weeks or more than two weeks post-neuroinjury; three weeks or more than three
weeks post-neuroinjury; four weeks or more than four weeks post-neuroinjury; one month or
more than one month post-neural injury; two months or more than two months post-neural
injury; three months or more than three months post-neural injury; four months or more than four
months post-neural injury; five months or more than five months post-neural injury; six months
or more than six months post-neural injury.. In accordance with the present invention the EGF
like domain is encoded by a neuregulin gene. Administration in accordance with the invention
comprises administration of a peptide comprising an EGF-like domain, or a nucleic acid
molecule encoding same, in an amount effective to treat the chronic phase following neuroinjury
in the mammal

in a mammal is presented. Treatment in accordance with the invention can begin within an acute
or semi-acute period but includes at least one, two three, four, five, six or more than six
treatments beyond the acute or semi-acute period, respectively.
         [00211 A method of the invention comprises administering a polypeptide comprising an
epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) domain to said mammal, wherein said EGF-like domain
is encoded by the neuregulin (NRG)-I gene, and said administering is performed at least two or
three or four days after the ischemic event, although treatment can begin within the acute or semi
acute time frame, and in a therapeutically effective amount sufficient to promote neurorecovery
during the chronic phase following an ischemic event in said mammal.
         10022] In particular embodiments of the invention, the neuregulin gene may be the NRG
1 gene, the NRG-2 gene, the NRG-3 gene or the NRG-4 gene. A neuregulin polypeptide of the
invention may, in turn, be encoded by any one of these four neuregulin genes; a neuregulin
polypeptide of the invention may, in turn, be encoded by a variant or homologue of any one of
these four neuregulin genes. See Figures 6A-6D for the amino and nucleic acid sequences of full
length human GGF2 an isoform of NRG- 1..
         [00231 In an aspect of the invention, suitable mammals include, but are not limited to,
mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys or pigs. In a more particular embodiment of the invention, the
mammal is a human.

signifies 98-102% of the specified value.      In one embodiment "about" signifies 95-105% of the
specified value.
         [00251 Post-injury, the "acute phase" ranges from the time of onset of the neuroinjury
(e.g., stroke) to approximately six hours post-neuroinjury. The acute phase is followed by the
"semi-acute phase", which ranges from approximately six hours to two days post-neuroinjury. In
one embodiment the "semi-acute phase" ranges from approximately six hours to three days post
neuroinjury. The period following the semi-acute phase is referred to as the "chronic phase"
post-neuroinjury. The post-acute phase includes both the semi-acute and chronic post-injury

derived from, for example, a bacteriophage, adenovirus, retrovirus, poxvirus, herpesvirus, or
artificial chromosome, that is used to transfer a polypeptide (e.g., a neuregulin) coding sequence,
operably linked to a promoter, into a host cell, such that the encoded peptide or polypeptide is
expressed within the host cell.
         100281 The terms "neuroinjury" and "injury" are often used interchangeably herein.
"neurotrauma" is one embodiment of a "neuroinjury" and may generally be considered a
synonym . A "neuroinjury" is an injury that causes some destruction or death of neurological
tissue. A neuroinjury generally has as sequelae some loss, e.g., a diminution of mental, sensory
or muscle function.
          [0029] A "neuroprotectant" is something that can save neurons before they die from the
variety of insults presented to them in the acute or semi-acute post-injury phase. After an acute
occlusion, there is often a localized area of destroyed brain matter that is surrounded by a
penumbral zone that will die within hours if circulation is not restored. The time to death of this
penumbral zone can be extended by a few hours in experimental models with "neuroprotectants",
such as NMDA antagonists, calcium channel blockers, radical scavengers and trapping agents,
anti-apoptotics, caspase inhibitors, parp inhibitors, etc. For this purpose a "neuroprotectant" is
something that can save neurons before they die from the variety of insults presented to them in

the nervous system restores its functioning towards a normal state following injury, disease,
infection or other disruption of the nervous system, the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerves.
        [00341 By "operably linked" is meant that a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide (e.g., a
cDNA) and one or more regulatory sequences are connected in such a way as to permit gene
expression when the appropriate molecules (e.g., transcriptional activator proteins) are bound to

in the 5' or 3' or internal regions of the native gene.
         [00371 The term "therapeutically effective amount" is intended to mean that amount of a
drug or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system,
animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other
clinician. A therapeutic change is a change in a measured biochemical characteristic in a
direction expected to alleviate the disease or condition being addressed. More particularly, a
"therapeutically effective amount" is an amount sufficient to decrease the symptoms associated
with a medical condition or infirmity, to normalize body functions in disease or disorders that

         [00381 As used herein, the term "treating means obtaining recovery following a
neuroinjury where there would otherwise be none; accelerating the rate of natural recovery
following a neuroinjury; or promoting recovery to a higher functioning level. Without being
bound by theory, in the chronic post-injury window it is not contemplated that there will be an
ability to lessen any further neurological death, i.e., it is understood in that the nerves have died
by the time the chronic window occurs. However, treatment in accordance with the invention
comprises during the chronic period, e.g., lessening a decrease function or viability of tissue
(e.g., muscle or bone) that would otherwise occur in the tissue served by the comprised nerve. In
addition, treatment in accordance with the invention comprises during the chronic period, e.g.,
lessening of atrophy (e.g., of muscle or bone) that would otherwise occur in the tissue served by
the comprised nerve.
         100391 By "transformed cell" is meant a cell (or a descendent of a cell) into which a DNA
molecule encoding a neuregulin or polypeptide having a neuregulin EGF-like domain has been
introduced, by means of recombinant DNA techniques or known gene therapy techniques.

                              DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
         [0056] As indicated herein, the non-palliative treatment of ischemic stroke has heretofore
been confined to therapeutics administered in the acute phase following a stroke.
         [0057] Immediate cell death due, at least in part, to oxygen deprivation is observed
during the acute phase. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1, the occlusion of blood flow results in
release of intracellular stores of free radicals, glutamate, and calcium and sodium that are
understood to destroy brain tissue and expand the area of the lesion.
         [00581 The semi-acute phase, from approximately six hours to two days (or three days by
some definitions) post-neuroinjury, is characterized by continued free radical release, glutamate
dumping, calcium and sodium release, oxygen deprivation of the occluded region, and
                                                        12

       WO 2010/019275                                                            PCT/US2009/004692
immediate localized cell death. To date, there are no known clinically approved agents for use in
humans during the semi-acute phase following a stroke.
        [00591 As depicted in Figure 1, the limited window for pharmaceutical post-neuroinjury
therapy is at least partially explained by the pathophysiology and temporal progression of the
injury. Within minutes, e.g., of an occlusion, neurons at the core of the infarct are destroyed. In
the hours after the occlusion, free radicals, excitotoxic and inflammatory agents are
released/produced and these molecules continue to destroy brain tissue and expand the area of
the lesion. The extent of the injury can be limited, as described above, by restoring blood flow
(using a clinically approved clot-buster, i.e., tPA) and thus achieving re-oxygenation of the
affected area.
         [00601 As indicated by the scientific literature, various compounds appear to exhibit
efficacy in the acute and semi-acute periods. However, after the 24, 36 or 48 hour marks post
CNS neuroinjury, potential therapies progressively lose the ability to treat the injury . In fact,
some of the therapeutics modalities, such as tPA, that have an effect in the acute period begin to
have serious, life-threatening contraindications as time occurs post-injury.
         [006.11 Days, weeks or months after an ischemic event, during the chronic phase post
stroke, therapies must be aimed at promoting neurorecovery.         The promotion of neurorecovery
following a traumatic event such as stroke in the central nervous system involves distinctly
different physiologic phenomena and therapeutic strategy than employed in the pre-chronic
window. The pre-chronic treatments generally involve agents that aim to restore blood flow and
reduce acute cell death. In contrast, a therapeutic agent that can be efficaciously administered at
48 hours or more, or 72 hours or more post-injury is differentiated from acute phase therapeutics
by its ability to restore function without altering the size of the ischemic lesion. In one
embodiment, treatment in accordance with the invention begins after essentially complete post
injury death of an ischemic CNS lesion; by "essentially complete post-injury death of an
ischemic CNS lesion is intended that the CNS cell death that is directly consequent to the
ischemic event will have transpired, other cell death due to age or therapy (whether or not the
therapy is designed to address the ischemia) is not within the scope of this definition.
          100621 As shown herein, the present inventors demonstrated that neuregulins are
effective in restoring neurological function during the chronic phase of a neurotraumatic injury.
 In one embodiment, the neurotraumatic injury is an ischemic stroke. As described herein, the
                                                    13

        WO 2010/019275                                                         PCT/US2009/004692
present inventors have made the surprising discovery that neuregulin is effective when dosing is
initiated during the chronic phase following an ischemic event. Even more surprising is the
discovery that neuregulin is effective even when dosing is initiated as late as 7 days after the
ischemic event.
         100631 The present data shows that the favorable outcomes achieved have not come
about by the same mechanisms found to be effective in immediate post-ischemic treatment.
Neuregulin treatment during chronic phase following stroke does not alter the size of the
ischemic lesion (see Table 1). This clearly demonstrates that the acute and semi-acute phases of
the pathophysiology are complete at these phases, and neuregulin administered during the
chronic phase is promoting neurorecovery, rather than establishing reperfusion and protecting
neurons.

         [0064] As indicated above, neuregulins are polypeptides encoded by the NRG- 1, NRG-2,
NRG-3 or NRG-4 genes and possess EGF-like domains that allow them to bind to and activate
ErbB receptors. Holmes et al. (Science 256:1205-1210, 1992) have shown that the EGF-like
domain alone is sufficient to bind and activate the pl85erbB2 receptor. Accordingly, any
polypeptide product encoded by the NRG- 1, NRG-2, NRG-3 or NRG-4 gene, or any neuregulin
 like polypeptide, e.g., a polypeptide having an EGF-like domain encoded by a neuregulin gene or
cDNA (e.g., an EGF-like domain containing the NRG-1 peptide subdomains C-C/D or C-C/D',

as described in USPN 5,530,109, USPN 5,716,930, and USPN 7,037,888; or an EGF-like
domain as disclosed in WO 97/09425) may be used in the methods of the invention. A
composition of the invention may be in unit dosage form. Kits comprising compositions of the
invention and/or instructions in accordance with the invention are within the scope of the present
invention as well.
         [00651 Compositions of the invention may be administered to patients with a
pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient. Conventional pharmaceutical practice
is employed to provide formulations or compositions to administer such compositions to patients
or experimental animals. Although intravenous administration is preferred, any appropriate route
of administration may be employed, for example, parenteral, subcutaneous, intramuscular,
intracranial, intraorbital, ophthalmic, intraventricular, intracapsular, intraspinal, intracisternal,
intraperitoneal, intranasal, aerosol, oral, or transdermal (e.g., by applying an adhesive patch
carrying a formulation capable of crossing the dermis and entering the bloodstream) or topical
 administration.
         10066] Therapeutic formulations may be in the form of liquid solutions or suspensions;
 for oral administration, formulations may be in the form of tablets or capsules; and for intranasal
 formulations, in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols. Methods well known in the art
 for making formulations are found in, for example, "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences."
 Formulations for parenteral administration may, for example, contain excipients, sterile water, or
 saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, or
 hydrogenated napthalenes. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for administering
 molecules of the invention include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps,
 implantable infusion systems, and liposomes. Formulations for inhalation may contain
 excipients, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example,
 polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or may be oily solutions for
 administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel.
          [00671 As a further aspect of the invention there is provided the present compounds for
 use as a pharmaceutical especially in the treatment or prevention of the aforementioned
 conditions and diseases. Also provided herein is the use of the present compounds in the
 manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of one of the aforementioned
 conditions and diseases.

         [00681 With respect to intravenous injections, dose levels are generally in a range from
one value in the following list to a higher value in the list: about 0.001 mg/kg, about 0.01 mg/kg,
about 0.1 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, and about 10 mg/kg. The dosing periodicity is generally in
regular time intervals of from about every 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours. In an alternative embodiment,
the dosing periodicity is generally in regular time intervals of from about every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
days. In an alternative embodiment, the dosing periodicity is generally in regular time intervals
of from about every 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 weeks. After a period of such dosing, less frequent dosing
such as monthly, every three months, every four months, or yearly can be employed.
         100691 Transdermal doses are selected to provide essentially identical, similar or lower
physiologic levels (plasma, tissue, CSF) than are achieved using injection doses.
         [0070] The compounds of the invention can be administered as the sole active agent or
they can be administered in combination with other agents, including other compounds that may
be found to demonstrate the same or a similar therapeutic activity and that are determined to be
safe and efficacious for such combined administration. Other such compounds contemplated for
use in the treatment of acute or semi-acute neuroinjury include hematopoietic factors (e.g., G
CSF and/or GM-CSF); substances that have thrombolytic activities, e.g., tPA, streptokinase,
urokinase, and/or Ancrod; antiplatelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), clopidogrel
(Plavix), aspirin combined with extended release dipyridamole (Aggrenox); anticoagulants such
as warfarin (Coumadin) or Heparin; and/or substances that interfere with apoptotic signaling
(e.g. inhibitors of caspases) or progesterone. It is understood, however, that the above
compounds are administered for preventive purposes in advance of stroke (e.g., for antiplatelet
agents or anticoagulants), or during the acute phase following stroke (tPA).
         100711 In order to evaluate the motor, sensory or cognitive deficits that are effectively
treated in accordance with the present invention, several tools are available in the art. Well
known indicia for monitoring treatment efficacy include Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE), Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS), Functional Impairment Measure
(FIM, Barthel Test, Fugl-Meyer Motor Score, Wolf Motor Function Test, Jebsen-Taylor hand
function test, Nottingham Health Profile Part 1 and Motor Assessment Scale (MAS), Sodring
Motor Evaluation Scale (SMES), the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Barthel Activities of Daily
Living (ADL), and other clinical tests such as measures of affect, speech, swallowing, cognition,

motor coordination, strength, sensation and autonomic function, as well as survival rates and
hospitalization rates may be used to assess disease progression.
        [00721 Following injury, disease, infection or other disruption of the nervous system, the
brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerves do not function properly due to any combination of gross
destruction, apoptosis, disrupted pathways and synapses, inflammation, altered chemical
environment, changes in cell metabolism and changes in cellular transcription and translation.
As used herein, the term "neurorecovery" is used to refer to the process by which the nervous
system restores its functioning towards a normal state. This process may occur by correction,
circumvention, reversal or elimination of any of the causes noted above.
        [00731 Furthermore, it is now believed that significant neurorecovery can occur through a
process known as 'plasticity' whereby the nervous system forms new connections to compensate
or adapt to other changes. Injuries of the CNS cause disruption of local and long-range
connections resulting in disrupted function and disability. Plasticity is an event where new
connections are formed between existing neurons. Plasticity has been shown to be a mechanism
of neurorecovery in CNS systems including the visual system (Pizzorusso et al.,) and the spinal
cord (Fawcett JW (2009) Brain 132:1417-1418.). In plasticity, new synapses are formed or
existing synapses are strengthened, weakened or removed to allow existing structures and
systems to compensate for those that have been destroyed or disrupted in the injury. Other forms
of plasticity may include altering the neurochemistry of existing cells to changes the direct
synaptic signaling and paracrine signaling. Plasticity may also take the form of altering receptor
levels to make neurons and other cells more or less sensitive to direct synaptic or paracrine
signaling. These processes are well accepted as mechanism of learning and memory.

         Example 1:      Materials and Methods:
        Animal Preparation:
         [00761 Fifty (50), adult, male Sprague-Dawley were used for the study (10 extra animals
were ordered). All rats were housed and handled for behavioral assessment for seven (7) days
prior to surgery for acclimation purposes. At the end of the handling period, rats were
randomized and assigned to different groups. Rats were given a unique identification number by
tail marking. Ten extra rats were also handled.
         Surgical Preparation:
         Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO), Tamura Model:
         [00771 This surgical injury model in the rat is a well accepted model of stroke in the field
(Tamura et al, 1981, J Cereb Blood Flow Metab. l(1):53-60; Tamura et al, 1981, J Cereb Blood
Flow Metab. 1(1):61-9). Focal cerebral infarcts were made by permanent occlusion of the
proximal right middle cerebral artery (MCA) using a modification of the method of Tamura et al.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-400 g at the time of surgery) were anesthetized with 2-3%
halothane in the mixture of N 20:0 2 (2:1), and were maintained with 1-1.5 % halothane in the
mixture of N 2 0:0 2 (2:1). The temporalis muscle was bisected and reflected through an incision
made midway between the eye and the eardrum canal. The proximal MCA was exposed through
a subtemporal craniectomy without removing the zygomatic arch and without transecting the
facial nerve. The artery was then occluded by microbipolar coagulation from just proximal to the
olfactory tract to the inferior cerebral vein, and was transected. Body temperature was
maintained at 37.5'C ± 0.5'C throughout the entire procedure. Cefazolin (40 mg/kg; Baxter, Lot

       1001031         GGF2 production: One vial of GGF2 at 2.2x 106 cells/mL was thawed into
100mls of Acorda Medium 1 (see Table 2) and expanded until reaching sufficient numbers to
seed production vessels. Cells were inoculated into the production media Acorda Medium 2 (see
Table 3) at 1.0 x 105 cells/mL in two liter vented roller bottles. Roller bottles are maintained at
37*C for 5 days and then reduced to 27'C for 26 days. The roller bottles are monitored for cell
count and general appearance but they are not fed. Once viability is below 10% the cells are spun
out and conditioned media harvested and sterile filtered.

        [001121          Basic FGF:
        The bFGF (PeproTech Inc., 100-18B, Lot 1206CY08 G2407) was reconstituted as
directed by PeproTech to a stock solution of 0.1 mg/ml and stored at -20'C before use. On the
day of the injection, 100 pg/ml of BSA (Roche Diagnostics, Lot 12403328 exp. Mar 31, 2008)
solution was made as diluent, to make a final bFGF concentration of 20 gg/ml (1 fig/50ul). This
material was only used in study 1.
         [001131         Randomization and Blindina: Five animals were operated on per day. The
investigator doing the surgery and behavioral assessments was blinded to treatment assignment
of each animal (except the bFGF treated group) until all of the data were collected.
         [001141          Behavioral Tests:
         Sensorimotor functional activities were evaluated using forelimb and hindlimb placing,
and body swing behavioral tests. These tests were performed one (1) day before surgery, one (1)
day after surgery and at three (3), seven (7), fourteen (14) and twenty-one (21) days after
MCAO.
                  [001151        1. Limb Placing
                  Limb placing tests were divided into both forelimb and hindlimb tests. For the
         forelimb placing test, the examiner held the rat close to a tabletop and scored the rat's
         ability to place the forelimb on the tabletop in response to whisker, visual, tactile, or
         proprioceptive stimulation. Similarly, for the hindlimb placing test, the examiner
                                                   30

        assessed the rat's ability to place the hindlimb on the tabletop in response to tactile and
        proprioceptive stimulation. Separate sub-scores were obtained for each mode of sensory
        input (halfpoint designations possible), and added to give total scores (for the forelimb
        placing test: 0 = normal, 12   = maximally impaired; for the hindlimb placing test: 0 =
        normal; 6 = maximally impaired).
                 [00116]         2. Body Swing Test
               The rat was held approximately one inch from the base of its tail. It was then
        elevated to an inch above a surface of a table. The rat was held in the vertical axis,
        defined as no more than 100 to either the left or the right side. A swing was recorded
        whenever the rat moved its head out of the vertical axis to either side. The rat must return
        to the verticalposition for the next swing to be counted. Thirty (30) total swings were
        counted. A normal rat typically has an equal number of swings to either side. Following
        focal ischemia, the rat tends to swing to the contralateral (left) side.
         [00117]         On all the days of the behavioral tests, animals were tested before drug
administration. Time points are designated with the day of surgery (Day 0) as a reference.
         [001181         Sacrifice and Infarct Volume:
        Following behavioral evaluations at twenty one (21) days after MCAO, rats were deeply
anesthetized with Ketamine (50-100 mg/kg) and Xylazine (5-10 mg/kg) mixture,
intraperitoneally. Animals were perfused transcardially with normal saline (with heparin, 2
unit/ml) followed by 10% formalin. Brains were then removed and stored in 10% formalin.
Fixed brains were then embedded with paraffin, and 5 micron coronal sections were cut using a
microtome. Sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Seven sections
(+4.7, +2.7, +0.7, -1.3, -3.3, -5.3 and -7.3, compared to bregma respectively) from each brain
were photographed by a digital camera, and the infarct area on each slice was determined by
NIH Image (Image J) using the "indirect method" (area of the intact contralateral [left]
hemisphere - area of intact regions of the ipsilateral [right] hemisphere) to correct for brain
edema. Infarct areas were then summed among slices and multiplied by slice thickness to give
total infarct volume, which was expressed as a percentage of intact contralateral hemispheric
volume.

         Results:
          Forelimb Placing Test:
         [001211        Recovery in the GGF2, 100 pg/kg group was superior to the vehicle group
(p<0.001). Recovery in the bFGF group was superior to the vehicle group (p<0.05). There was
no significant difference in recovery of the GGF2, 6.5 pg/kg or NRG, 1.0 jg/kg groups
compared to the vehicle group. See Figure 2.

 6.5 pg/kg group and NRG, 1.0 pg/kg group was significantly improved compared to vehicle on
 behavioral testing Days 7 and 14 but this effect was not maintained to the 21 day end point. See

significantly improved compared to vehicle (p<0.05) at the behavioral testing Day 21 end point.
There was no significant difference in recovery of the NRG, 1.0 pg/kg group, or the GGF2, 6.5
pig/kg group compared to the vehicle group. See Figure 4.
        Weight Changes:

        Infarct Volume: There were no significant differences among the groups. See Table 1
above.
        Summary:
These results demonstrate that GGF2 is acting in a dose responsive manner and promotes
functional recovery in this model of permanent stroke. The hindlimb data using the lower dose
of neuregulin shows that continued treatment can lead to continued improvements.

By the Day 21 study endpoint it was found that treatment initiated on Day 1, Day 3 or Day 7 post
MCAO resulted in significant improvements in forelimb function compared to vehicle treated
animals. Treatment initiated on Day 1, Day 3 or Day 7 post MCAO resulted in significant
improvements in hindlimb function compared to vehicle treatment during specific behavioral
testing points that correlated with treatment time, indicating that continued treatment may prove
beneficial   Functional recovery with interventions given at this later time points post injury
eliminates the possibility that the effect is due to acute neuroprotection. Indeed, this data
coupled with the lack of a significant change in infarct volume demonstrates that the
improvements are due to the promotion of neurorecovery with GGF2 treatment. This shows that
a long temporal window exists (post-acute and post-semi acute)during which time GGF2 may be
administered as an effective therapeutic for the chronic phase of stroke
         1001321         It is, noteworthy that the significant (under ANOVA statistics)
improvements observed following GGF2 administration at 3 and 7 days post-MCAO represent a
dramatic expansion in the therapeutic window offered by previously available strategies for
treatment of acute phase stroke. For the first time in the art, the data presented herein
demonstrated that GGF2 administration is efficacious even during the chronic phase of stroke.
The data presented herein further suggest that GGF2 contributes to neurorecovery following
 neuroinjury.
         Example 4:      Treatment of Ischemic Stroke
         1001331         A patient presents to a medical facility with signs and symptoms of an
 ischemic stroke. The patient is revascularized with tPA or other therapy to restore blood flow.
 Although blood flow has been restored, some level of brain injury has occurred. Three days after
 the injury the patient is assessed neurologically and shown to have measurable sensory and/or
 motor deficits. Beginning on day four, after day two and after day 3, this patient would is treated
 with neuregulin at a dose between 0.01 and 1.0 mg/kg per dose, intravenously for 10 days to 3
 months. The patient successfully regains sensory and motor function without the concomitant
 use of Occupational or Physical Therapy. This recovery is better than would have been clinically
 predicted without neuregulin therapy. This recovery is better than would have been clinically
 predicted without use of Occupational or Physical Therapy.

        Example 5: Treatment Of Stroke And Resulting Paralysis of the Right Hand
         [001341        A patient presents to the Emergency Department with paralysis of the
right hand. Following evaluation and imaging it is determined that the patient has suffered an
ischemic stroke. The patient receives tPA according to approved methods , and blood flow is
restored through the thrombosis. However, a week after tPA treatment, the patient has residual
paralysis of the right hand as measured by standard neurological measures of hand motor
activity. This patient is treated with neuregulin (0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg, IV) once per week for 4
weeks. Improvement in hand function is measured periodically by a neurologist or other
physician with standard neurological testing including dynamometer and other strength testing.
The patient successfully regains sensory and motor function in their right hand without the
concomitant use of Occupational or Physical Therapy. This recovery is better than would have
been clinically predicted without neuregulin therapy. This recovery is better than would have
been clinically predicted without use of Occupational or Physical Therapy
         Example 6: Treatment of Ischemic Stroke
         [001351         A patient presents to a medical facility with signs and symptoms of an
ischemic stroke. They are found to have paralysis of their left side. The patient does not arrive
in time for revascularization therapy with. Upon clinical evaluation it is found that some brain
injury has occurred. Three days after the injury the patient is assessed neurologically and shown
to have measurable sensory and motor deficits. This patient is treated with neuregulin at a dose
between 0.01 and 1.0 mg/kg per dose, intravenously each day for four weeks; thereafter they
 receive weekly doses for six months. They also receive physical therapy. Improvement is
 noticed as early as the second week of treatment; recovery continues throughout the period of
 neuregulin therapy. The patient successfully regains sensory and motor function of their left
 side. This recovery is seen as excellent; and is much better than would have been clinically
 predicted without with the use of Physical Therapy alone.

patient does not receive tPA. Upon neurological exam it is found that The patient has residual
paralysis of the left hand as measured by standard neurological measures of hand motor activity;
the patient has a sensory deficit as well. The patient refuses to participate in physical or
occupational therapy. This patient treated with neuregulin (0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg, IV) once per week
for 12 weeks. Improvement in hand function is measured periodically by a neurologist or other
physician with the standard neurological testing including dynamometer and other strength
testing. Improvement is noticed as early as the second week of treatment; recovery continues
throughout the period of neuregulin therapy. The patient successfully regains sensory and motor
function in their left hand without the concomitant use of Occupational or Physical Therapy.
This recovery is better than would have been clinically predicted without neuregulin therapy.

          Example 8: Traumatic brain injury
          [001371         A patient presents to a medical facility following a traumatic event with
 signs and symptoms of a head injury and resultant brain injury. Some level of brain injury has
 occurred as assessed by imaging and neurological testing including Glasgow Coma Scale and
 more detailed neurocognitive testing. Five days after the injury, the patient is assessed
 neurologically and shown to have measurable sensory and motor deficits. This patient is treated
 with neuregulin at a dose between 0.01 and 1.0 mg/kg per dose, intravenously for 3 months.
 Initially the patient is not willing to participate in physical therapy. Improvement in brain
 function is noticed as early as the first week of treatment; recovery continues throughout the
 period of neuregulin therapy. This recovery is better than would have been clinically predicted
 without neuregulin therapy. Beginning at three months the patient begins to receive neuregulin
 once per week, and they also begin to receive physical therapy. The concomitant therapies
 continue for up until one year from the day of original injury. On the anniversary of the patient's
 injury their recover is extraordinary. Clinically is it far better than would have been anticipated
 in the absence of any therapy and is also better than would have been expected from the use of
 physical therapy.

         [001381         A patient presents to a medical facility with signs and symptoms
consistent with an ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. The patient is stabilized. Upon
neurological assessment it is found that some level of brain injury has occurred. One week after
the injury the patient is again assessed neurologically and shown to have measurable sensory
and/or motor deficits. This patient is treated with neuregulin at a dose between 0.01 and 1.0
mg/kg daily, intravenously for 10 days, followed by administration of this dose weekly for 2
months, at which point all treatment is discontinued. Improvement in brain function is noticed as
early as the first week of treatment; recovery continues throughout the period of neuregulin
therapy. Upon cessation of neuregulin therapy the patients recover is deemed clinically
excellent. The patient returns for evaluation six months and then 12 months from the date of the
initial injury; at each assessment the patient's recovery is deemed clinically excellent.

       What is claimed is:
        1. A method for administering a polypeptide comprising an epidermal growth factor-like
(EGF-like) domain to a mammal, said method comprising:
       administering a polypeptide comprising an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like)
domain following neuroinjury in said mammal; and,
       initiating the administering at least two days after the neuroinjury.
       2.       A method of claim 1, wherein said initiating step begins at least three days after
the neuroinjury.
        3. The method of claim 1, wherein said initiating step begins at least seven days after the
neuroinj ury.
        4.      A method of claim 1 wherein the EGF-like domain is encoded by the neuregulin
(NRG)-1 gene, (NRG)-2 gene, (NRG)-3 gene, (NRG)-4 gene.
        5. The method of claim 1, wherein said polypeptide is GGF2.
        6. The method of claim 1, wherein said mammal is a human.
