DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
In order to avoid duplication of description, identical reference numerals will be
shown, where applicable, throughout the illustrated embodiments to indicate
similar integers.
In the drawings a first embodiment is shown in Figs. 1 to 5, which shows a cable
drive device 10 having a linear drive member 12 and cable drum 14. Linear drive
member 12 has a longitudinal base member 16 with a pair of arms 18, 20. A pair

                                          -9
of pivot pins 22, 24 are provided at each end for attachment to a respective
member as described in subsequent embodiments. Cable drum 14 has a central
axle 26 rotatably held by a journal or bearings 28 in a support member 29. Arms
18, 20 may, if required, be substituted by a longitudinal bar or plate.
A pair of faceplates 30, 32 support journal or bearings 28 at the opposite end
thereof by pins 34, 36. Pins 34, 36 will, in use, slide along base member 16 with
the cable drum 14 being on one side of the linear drive member 12 and pins 34, 36
on the other side. Pins 34, 36 will prevent cable drum 14 from leaving the face of
linear drive member 12. Rollers can replace pins 34, 36, for reducing frictional
resistance. The pair of pins 34, 36 can be substituted by a single pin or roller,
which would be preferably centrally located between the positions of pins 34, 36.
Cable drum 14 has spiralled grooves 38 in its outer circumferential face 40 to
allow a cable 42 to be wound out or wound out from cable drum 14. Cable 42 is
held taut and is coupled to pivot pins 22, 24 at opposite ends of linear drive
member 12. Cable 42 is threaded through a hole 44 in cable drum 14 passing
diagonally there through from opposing outer edges of outer circumferential face
40. Cable 42 is pre-tensioned above the maximum design load of cable drive
device 10. As only a single cable 42 is provided with multiple wraps around cable
drum 14, cable 42 is not subject to slip.
 Cable drive device 10 can provide movement of a member by attaching either
                                                                                    a
 pivot pins 22, 24 to a member to be moved and anchoring support member 29 to
 stationary support. Rotation of central axle 26 will result to longitudinal
 movement of linear drive member 12 through support member 29 by the roll on or
 roll off movement of cable 42 around cable drum 14. Cable drive device 10 can
 generally replace devices used for a rack and pinion type of movement.
                                                                             5 where
 Figs. 43 and 44 illustrate a similar cable drive device shown in Figs. 1 to
                                                                              Cable
 an arcuate or circular drive member 206 replaces linear drive member 12.
 42 is similarly attached to pivot pins 22, 24 and is held taut in groove 208 of
 arcuate or circular drive member 206. Cable drum 14 sits inside of groove 208

                                          - 10
and can be supported by a bracket (not shown) and/or by axle 26. The arcuate or
                                                               0
circular drive member 206 is shown as extending for angle X where X can be
any angle up to about 3600. The arcuate or circular drive member 206 will rotate
about a central axis 210. Cable drum 14 will be configured in a similar manner to
that described with reference to Figs. 1 to 5. This embodiment will simulate a
pinion gear (cable drum 14) driving a larger circular gear (arcuate or circular drive
member 206). In use, the radial base 216 can be attached to a movable member,
for example, the top of a flap valve and the flap valve can pivot about central axis
210. Axle 26 can be supported by a frame member and axle 26 can be rotated to
allow radial base 216 to be move about central axis 210 as shown in Fig. 44. This
movement will lift the flap valve to open the valve.
Fig. 6 illustrates an enhancement of the cable drive device 10 shown in Figs. 1 to
5. In this embodiment a pair of linear drive members 12, 12A on opposite sides of
cable drum 14 are provided. Separate spiralled grooves (not shown) are formed in
the circumferential face of cable drum 14 to allow cables 42, 42 A to co-operate
with cable drum 14. The operation of linear drive member 12A is identical to that
of linear drive member 12 discussed with reference to Figs. I to 5. Because the
linear drive members 12, 12A are on opposite sides of cable drum 14 and have
opposing displacements, the movement of linear drive member 12 in one direction
will cause movement of linear drive member 12A in the opposite direction on
rotation of axle 26. This movement will allow greater linear movement between
pivot pins 22, 24A.
Fig. 7 shows the use of the cable drive device 10 shown in Figs. I to 5 in an
irrigation system. A barrier member 46 is hinged at the bed or base 48 of a
channel 50 through which water passes. Barrier member 46 includes a base
member 52 and side members 54, 56. Barrier member 46 may be of a rigid
 construction, of the type shown in International Patent Application No.
PCT/AUO1/01036, or may be flexible, of the type known as Padman Bay outlets,
 or a combination thereof. The free end 58 of barrier member 46 is pivotally
 attached to pivot pin 24 of linear drive member 12 of cable drive device 10 of

                                            - 11
Figs. I to 5. Support member 29 is secured to a frame member 60 across channel
50. An electric motor 62 is coupled to axle 26 to allow rotation of cable drum 14.
Fig. 8 shows a variation of Fig. 7 where a pair of cable drive devices 10 are used.
In this embodiment, electric motor 62 has an extended shaft 64 to allow rotation
of the axles of both cable drive devices 10. If required, separate electric motors
could be used. The embodiment is not limited to two cable drive devices 10 as any
numbers may be used to suit the width of the channel 50. Figs. 7 and 8 show use
of a rigid construction of barrier member 46.
Figs. 9 to 11 show the operation of barrier member 46 using the cable drive device
or devices 10. Figs. 9 to 11 show barrier member 46 having a rigid base member
52 and flexible side members 54, 56. Fig. 9 has barrier member 46 in the closed
position with linear drive member 12 fully extended in the upward direction. As
barrier member 46 is lowered, water flows over the free end 58 of base member
52 in a controlled manner (Fig. 10). Full flow of water is obtained when linear
drive member 12 is fully extended in the downward direction (Fig. 11). Linear
drive member 12 will be partially immersed in the water, which can be a harsh
environment for such devices. In prior art devices it is commonplace to use gear
mechanisms, which do not suit being immersed or being exposed to water. Gears
can jam and the gear teeth can wear resulting in drive backlash. The cable drive
devices 10 do not suffer these disadvantages and allow a more accurate
positioning of barrier member 46 to assist in superior measurement.
Figs. 12 to 16 are very similar in construction and operation to the embodiment
shown in Figs. 7 to 1 1. In this embodiment a dam wall 66 extends across the
channel and barrier member 46 is pivotally attached to the bottom of dam opening
68 rather than at the bed or base 48 of channel 50.
Although the cable drive device 10 of Figs. 1 to 5 has been shown with reference
to its use in the irrigation field in Figs. 7 to 16 its use is not limited to that
environment. Cable drive device 10 can be used where any mechanical movement
is required.

                                           -  12
  Figs. 17 to 22 illustrate an embodiment of a fluid control barrier 70, which is
 attached to the end 72 of a pipe 74. Pipe 74 is shown vertically disposed but could
 be readily disposed horizontally, or at any other desired angle. The fluid control
 barrier 70 can also be adapted to be located within pipe 74 and the embodiment
 described is not limited to the position or orientation shown in Figs. 17 to 22. A
 flange 76 at the end of pipe 74 provides attachment to a flange 78 of fluid control
 barrier 70. A sealing lip 80 on flange 78 allows the sealing thereto of a pair of
 semi-circular plates 82, 84 forming a barrier member. The plates 82, 84 are joined
 along their diametric sides by hinge 86 to open and close fluid control barrier 70
 and form a bi-foldable barrier member, Hinge 86 is fixed and constrained by
 frame elements 88, 90 of frame 92. A pair of cross-members 94, 96 complete
 frame 92. Plates 82, 84 fold in the direction of flow towards the centreline when
 opening and into the flow away from the centreline when closing.
In order to open and close plates 82, 84 a pair of struts 98, 100 downstream of
pipe 74 are pivotally attached to plates 82, 84 at one end and are pivotally
 attached at the other end to a threaded journal 102 at the other end to form a thrust
point. Journal 102 is coupled to a threaded member 104 supported by bearings
 106, 108 in respective cross-members 94, 96. Rotation of the end 1 10 of threaded
member 104 will result in opening and closing of fluid control barrier 70 as
indicated by arrows 112.
Figs. 17 to 19 show plates 82, 84 pressed onto sealing lip 80 to prevent escape of
water from pipe 74. Turning end 110 of threaded member 104 will cause threaded
journal 102 to move up threaded member 104, as threaded journal 102 is
constrained from rotating. The upward movement of threaded journal 102 will lift
 struts 98, 100, and plates 82, 84 will thus lift away from pipe 74 to open fluid control
barrier 70, as shown in Figs. 20 to 22. In this configuration the fluid control barrier
70 can be used for flood irrigation where water flows out pipe 74 and onto the
ground. End 1 10 can be turned by hand or coupled to a rotation means e.g. motor
or axle (not shown) controlled by irrigation automation (not shown). By turning end

                                          -13
  110 in the opposite direction the plates 82, 84 will pivot towards sealing lip 80 to
  stop water flow.
 It is evident that other forms of movement of the plates 82, 84 can be utilised and
 the invention is not limited to the embodiment shown in Figs. 17 to 22. Figs. 23 to
 28, Figs. 31 to 36 and Figs. 37 to 42 disclose various embodiments to move plates
 82, 84. Figs. 23 to 28 have struts 98, 100 replaced by cable drive devices 114, 1 16,
 described with reference to Figs. 1 to 5. Threaded member 104 has been replaced
 by a rotatable shaft 1 18 coupled to the axles of cable drive devices 114, 116 and
 supported by frame elements 88, 90. The operation is very similar to that shown in
 the embodiment of Figs. 17 to 22 where rotation of shaft 118 will result in the
 opening or closing of plates 82, 84. The fluid control barrier 70 can also be adapted
to be located within pipe 74 and the embodiment described is not limited to the
position or orientation shown in Figs. 23 to 28.
The embodiment shown in Figs. 31 to 36 is very similar to the embodiment shown
in Figs. 17 to 22. In this embodiment a cable drive device 120, described with
reference to Figs. I to 5, replaces threaded member 104. Threaded journal 102 is
not required as struts 98, 100 can be directly mounted to pivot pin 24 of cable
 drive device 120. The support member 29 of cable drive device 120 is mounted to
 cross-member 94. A drive shaft (not shown) is coupled to central axle 26 for
rotation of cable drum 14 resulting in opening and closing of plates 82, 84. The
fluid control barrier 70 can also be adapted to be located within pipe 74 and the
embodiment described is not limited to the position or orientation shown in Figs.
 31 to 36.
The embodiment shown in Figs. 37 to 42 has a completely different actuation
mechanism when compared with the embodiments of Figs. 17 to 28 and Figs. 31
to 36. In this embodiment a threaded screw member 122 is supported in journals
 124, 126 in frame elements 88, 90. Threaded screw member 122 has opposing
threads 128, 130 separated by an unthreaded section 132. A pair of rotatable
journals 134, 136 are mounted on respective plates 82, 84 and equispaced from

                                         -14
 hinge 86. A pair of threaded journals 138, 140 are threadably attached to
 respective threads 128, 130 on threaded screw member 122 and equispaced from
 unthreaded section 132. A first pair of equal length struts 142, 144 are pivotally
mounted to rotatable journal 134 at one end and to threaded journal 136 at the
other end. A second pair-of equal length struts 146, 148 are pivotally mounted to
rotatable journal 134 at one end and to threaded journal 136 at the other end. The
points of attachment to each plate 82, 84 are along the radial axis that bisects the
semicircle. The location-of the position of rotatable journals 134, 136 can vary
and may be determined on the basis of the specific force loading of the actuation
mechanism and what is optimal for the actuation mechanism. From the closed
position of plates 82, 84 shown in Figs. 37 to 39, the shaft end 150 of threaded
screw member 122 can be rotated. As the threaded journals 138, 140 are
constrained from rotating, the threaded screw journals 138, 140 will move
outwardly along respective threads 128, 130, as evident from Figs. 40 to 42. Struts
142 to 148 will pivot and cause plates 82, 84 to be lifted and open the fluid control
barrier. Turning the shaft end 150 in the opposite direction will reverse the
movement and plates 82, 84 will be moved towards the closed position. The fluid
control barrier 70 can also be adapted to be located within pipe 74 and the
embodiment described is not limited to the position or orientation shown in Figs.
37 to 42. The cable drive device depicted in Fig. 6. could replace the outward and
inward movement of threaded journals 138, 140 along threaded screw member
122.
The embodiment shown in Figs. 29 to 30 is very similar to the embodiment shown
in Figs. 31 to 36. The major difference is that instead of having plates 82, 84
mounted at the end of pipe 74, plates 82, 84 are mounted inside pipe 74. The other
difference is that the cable drive 120 of the type described in Figs. I to 5 is located
inside pipe 74 rather than being externally mounted. An annular ring 152 on the
inner circumference of pipe 74 replaces sealing lip 80. Annular ring 152 has a pair
of protuberances 154 to receive the central pin of hinge 86 to fix the position of
plates 82, 84. Plates 82, 84 are moved by the longitudinal movement of linear
drive member 12 which is pivotally attached to struts 98, 100. Cable drum 14 has

                                           - 15
 an axle 156 extending through pipe 74 and supported in bearings or journals 158,
 160 in, or on, pipe 74. Rotation of the end 162 in the direction of arrow 164 will
 open the valve by lifting plates 82, 84 from its sealed position on annular ring 152
 and allow flow of water through pipe 74 in the direction of arrow 166. It is
 evident that other actuation mechanisms can be utilised in relation to the mounting
 of plates 82, 84 inside pipe 74. For example, the embodiment shown in Figs. 23 to
 28 may be used.
 The embodiment shown in Figs. 45 to 48 differs from the embodiments shown in
Figs. 17 to 28 and Figs. 29 to 42, in that fixed hinge 86 is replaced by a floating
hinge 168. In this embodiment the hinge 168 is free to move in the direction of the
pipe 74 centreline axis and remain perpendicular to the axis. The valve device can
be used at pipe inlets and pipe outlets as well as internal to the pipe 74 as shown
in this embodiment. A threaded screw member 170 is supported in journals 172,
 174 in pipe 74. Threaded screw member 170 has opposing threads 176, 178
separated by an unthreaded section 180. A first pair of equal length struts 190, 192
are pivotally mounted to an unthreaded section 194 of threaded screw member
 170 at one end and to respective plates 82, 84 at the other end. A second pair of
equal length struts 196, 198 are pivotally mounted to an unthreaded section 200 of
threaded screw member 170 at one end and to respective plates 82, 84 at the other
end. The pivotal attachment of struts 190, 192, 196 and 198 to respective plates
82, 84 is along, or near to, the centroidal axis of the semi-circular plates 82, 84. It
is also possible to have only one set of struts, which could be pivotally attached to
the central unthreaded section 180.
In this embodiment the fluid pressure load associated with the semi-circular plates
82,84 is transferred to the threaded screw member 170 through the struts 190, 192,
 196 and 198. A key aspect of this embodiment is the location of pivotal load
supporting struts 190, 192, 196 and 198 at or near the centroidal axis. Supporting
the plates 82, 84 at the centroidal axis means the net fluid pressure forces are
equal either side of the centroidal axis of each semi-circular plate 82, 84. The
resultant effect is that the net force in opening or closing the plates 82, 84 is

                                          - 16
 minimal and largely those associated with the frictional force in moving the hinge
 168. This will substantially reduce the power requirements of a motor (not shown)
to open and close the fluid control barrier. A small solar powered motor could be
used.
The movement of hinge 168 in this embodiment uses a pair of threaded journals
182, 184 that are threadably attached to respective threads 176, 178 on threaded
screw member 170 and equispaced from unthreaded section 180. A first strut 186
is pivotally mounted to hinge 168 at one end and to threaded journal 182 at the
other end. A second strut 188 is pivotally mounted to hinge 168 at one end and to
threaded journal 184 at the other end.
Figs. 45 and 47 show the closed position whilst Figs. 46 and 48 show the open
position of the fluid control barrier. From the position shown in Figs. 45 and 47
the threaded screw member 170 is rotated which results in threaded journals 182,
184 moving towards the centre of pipe 74 and pulling struts 186, 188 towards
each other. This movement pushes hinge 168 away from threaded screw member
170 to release plates 82, 84 in a folding action from seal 202 to open the fluid
control barrier. As previously discussed the net force in opening or closing the
plates 82, 84 is minimal and largely those associated with the frictional force in
moving the hinge 168 by struts 186, 188. Struts 190 and 192 and struts 196 and
198 will be drawn towards one another as shown in Figs. 46 and 48.
In addition, the positioning of the struts 190, 192, 196 and 198 on plates 82, 84
with a slight location bias either side of the centroidal axis can result in a resultant
force with a bias towards either self-closing or self-opening depending on what
side of the axis is the location of the pivotal connection of the struts 190, 192, 196
and 198. A similar result can be obtained by offsetting the mounting point of the
struts 190, 192, 196 and 198 above the surface of said plates 82, 84 and slightly
away from the centroidal axis.
In a further embodiment threaded screw member 170 could be replaced by an
unthreaded member and threaded journals 182, 184 replaced by annular drive

                                           -17
 rings which could be controlled by individual actuator members or by a cable
 drive device as shown in Fig. 6.
 The definition of Centroid and Centroidal Axis: The Centroid is defined as the
 geometric centre or centre of mass of an object. For the purposes of this
 application the surface area either side of the centroidal line are equal and
 therefore the net pressure forces either side of the centroidal line of a semicircular
 plate are equal.
 The Centroidal axis is parallel to the straight edge of a semi-circular shaped plate
 and at a distance of y from the straight edge and where;
         y=4R/3wr
         Where R is the radius of the semicircle.
The embodiments shown in Figs. 49 to 64 show different actuator devices to
move floating hinge 168 as described in Figs. 45 to 48.
Figs. 49 to 52 show a similar fluid control barrier to that shown in Figs. 45 to 48.
In this embodiment movement of hinge 168 is by a pair of cable drive devices 10
as described with reference with Figs. I to 5. A non-threaded shaft 204 passes
through pipe 74 to replace the threaded screw member 170. Struts 186, 188 are
not required to move against hinge 168. Cable drive devices 10, from the closed
position, pull hinge 168. The embodiment shows a pair of cable drive devices 10
at opposing ends of hinge 168 but a single centrally located cable drive device 10
could also be used. The pivotal attachment of struts 190, 192, 196 and 198 to
respective plates 82, 84 is along, or near to, the centroidal axis of the semi-circular
plates 82, 84 as described with reference to Figs. 45 to 48. Figs. 49 and 51 show
the closed position of the fluid barrier whilst Figs. 50 and 48 show the open
position of the fluid control barrier. From the position shown in Figs. 49 and 51
the axles 156 are rotated causing the linear drive members 12 to pull hinge 168
axially away and pull struts 186, 188 towards each other. This movement pulls

                                           - 18
  hinge 168 to release plates 82, 84 in a folding action from seal 202 to open the
  fluid control barrier. Struts 190 and 192 and struts 196 and 198 will be pulled
  towards one another as shown in Figs. 50 and 52. Again the net force in opening
 or closing the plates 82, 84 by cable drive devices 10 is minimal.
 Figs. 53 to 64 show an embodiment that is very similar to the embodiment shown
 in Figs. 49 to 52 except that the fluid control barrier is located at the end of pipe 74
 rather than being located inside pipe 74. The pair of cable drive devices 10 shown
 in Figs. 49 to 52 has been reduced to a single device 10, which is external to pipe
 74. The non-threaded shaft 204 is constrained by journals in frame elements 88, 90
 of frame 92 and is drivingly coupled to cable drum 14. A pair of hinge struts 212
 are pivotally coupled at one end to linear drive member 12 and to the other end to
 hinge 168. The pivotal attachment of struts 190, 192, 196 and 198 to respective
 plates 82, 84 is along, or near to, the centroidal axis of the semi-circular plates 82,
 84 as described with reference to Figs. 45 to 48. In the closed position shown in
 Figs. 53 to 56 the plates 82, 84 will be pressed against seal 202 to prevent escape
 of water. The rotation of shaft 204 will result in rotation of cable drum 14 which
 will move linear drive member 12 downwardly. This downward force will push
 hinge 168 downwardly to the position shown in Figs. 57 to 60 to open the fluid
 control barrier. Plates 82, 84 will pivot away from seal 202 in view of their pivotal
 connection to hinge 168. Struts 190 and 192 and struts 196 and 198 will be pulled
towards one another to push plates 82, 84 into pipe 74. Figs. 61 to 64 show the fluid
 control barrier completely open with plates 82, 84 having an acute angle between
them and collapsing around struts 190, 192, 196 and 198. As discussed previously
the supporting of plates 82, 84 at the centroidal axis means the net fluid pressure
forces are equal either side of the centroidal axis of each semi-circular plate 82, 84.
The resultant effect is that the net force in opening or closing the plates 82, 84 is
minimal and largely those associated with the frictional force in moving the hinge
 168.
Additional and/or alternate mechanisms to those described could be used to actuate
the plates 82, 84 by providing force on hinge 168. The man skilled in the art could

                                           -  19
  readily select such mechanisms and the invention is not limited to the mechanisms
  shown for the fluid control barrier.
  The fluid control barriers described hereinbefore using a pair of semi-circular plates
  barriers 82, 84 pivoting at hinge 86 or 168 and positioned across the diameter of
  pipe 74 will bisect the flow moving through pipe 74. The advantage of this type of
  fluid control barrier is that there is a symmetrical flow profile generated
 perpendicular to the hinge 86 or 168. A symmetrical flow profile will suit the
 location of a flow meter using ultrasonic transit time flow measurement techniques
 discussed     in   Wikipedia    and    in   International Patent    Application    No.
 PCT/AU2010/001052, the contents of which are incorporated herein. The invention
 allows a flow meter to be located immediately upstream of fluid control barrier and
 is unique as it is often necessary to locate flow meters some distance upstream of a
 fluid control barrier or valve (typically up to five pipe diameters in order that a
 symmetrical velocity profile is developed. Traditional valve mechanisms such as a
 butterfly valve or a gate valve do not generate a symmetrical velocity profile
 immediately upstream of the valve.
 A further embodiment to the bi-folding plates 82, 84 is to streamline the shape of
 the barrier surface (upstream) to lessen the drag and therefore the energy loss of
the fluid as it traverses the valve. When the valve is fully open and the two
barriers are adjacent and near in line with the pipe centreline, the cross-sectional
profile would approximate a streamlined 'tear drop' shape. The embodiment
shown in Figs. 65 to 79 illustrates the tear drop shape formed by the bi-folding
plates 82, 84. Plates 82, 84 provide a clam shell type configuration each having a
bulge 220 at the hinged end and tapering towards the shaft end 222. When plates
82, 84 are in the fully open position as shown in Figs. 75 to 79 a basic tear drop
profile will be formed by the exterior surfaces of plates 82, 84. Plates 82, 84 will
fonn a clam shell which will substantially enclose struts 190, 192, 196 and 198 to
reduce frictional drag of the water.

                                           - 20
 In the embodiments shown with pipe 74 and semi-circular plates 82, 84 the
 invention is not limited to a complementary circular construction. Pipe 74 could
 be square or any other closed profile with plates 82, 84 being configured to match
 the pipe profile. In non-circular profiles the hinges 86, 168 can be located
 midpoint to provide symmetrical or non-symmetrical plates 82, 84.
 The centroidal axes can be readily determined to maintain the reduced force to
move hinge 168.
The invention will be understood to embrace many further modifications as will
be readily apparent to persons skilled in the art and which will be deemed to
reside within the broad scope and ambit of the invention, there having been set
forth herein only the broad nature of the invention and certain specific
embodiments by way of example.
