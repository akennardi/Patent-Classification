               CD33 Antibodies and Use of Same to Treat Cancer
                 CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application is a continuation of 13/804,227 filed March 14, 2013 and claims
the benefit of US Provisional Application No. 61/649,110, filed May 18, 2012.
                                     BA CKGROUND
[0002]     CD33 is a 67 kDa plasma membrane protein that binds to sialic acid and is a
member of the sialic acid-binding Ig-related lectin (SIGLEC) family of proteins. CD33 is
known to be expressed on myeloid cells. CD33 expression has also been reported on a
number of malignant cells. Although CD33 has been targeted for treatment of cancer,
e.g., acute myeloid leukemia, no effective CD33-targeted treatments are currently on the
market. The present invention solves these and other problems.
                     SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMED INVENTION
[0003] Provided herein are monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the human
CD33 protein and methods of using those antibodies to treat cancers that express the
CD33 protein. The monoclonal antibodies contain complementarity determining regions
(CDRs) of SEQ ID NOs: 19, 20 and 21 in the heavy chain variable region and CDRs of
SEQ ID NOs:22, 23, and 24 in the light chain variable region. In some embodiments, at
least one CDR has a conserved amino acid substitution. In some embodiments, any
differences in CDRs of the mature heavy chain variable region and mature light variable
region from SEQ ID NOS:18 and 8 respectively reside in positions H60-H65.
The monoclonal antibodies can be murine antibodies, chimeric antibodies or humanized
antibodies. A preferred humanized antibody is the h2Hl12 antibody, as disclosed herein.

   N                                                                  OMe

antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic or cytostatic agent. In a further embodiment, the
administered humanized antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent. A cytotoxic agent
can be, e.g., a DNA minor groove binder. A pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) is an
example of a cytotoxic agent that is a DNA minor groove binder that can be conjugated
to the administered humanized CD33 antibodies disclosed herein. In one embodiment,
the PBD is conjugated to the administered CD33 antibody via an enzyme cleavable
linker. In another embodiment, the cytotoxic agent has the formula

                      BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
[0016] Figure 1A and 1B shows an alignment of the amino acid sequences of the
parental murine mAb (referred to as m2H12) with the humanized 2H12 heavy (Figure
1A) and light chain variable (Figure IB) regions.
[0017]    Figure 2 shows the results of an in vitro cytotoxicity assay testing the activity
of 2H12-derived antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) against the CD33-positive AML cell
lines HL-60 and HEL 92.1.7. h2H12d was conjugated to SGD-1910; m2H12 and h2H12
were conjugated to SGD-1269. Non-binding control ADC (hOOd-SGD-1910 and hOO
SGD-1269) were tested as a control of antigen specificity. MYLOTARG @
(gemtuzumab ozogamicin) is a well described CD33-directed antibody drug conjugate
comprised of an anti-CD33 antibody hP67.6 linked to the cytotoxic drug calicheamicin
and was also tested.
                                       DEFINITIONS
[0018]    The invention provides, inter alia,monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind
to the human CD33 protein and conjugates thereof. The antibodies are useful for
treatment and diagnoses of CD33-expressing cancers as well as detecting the CD33
protein.
[0019]    An "isolated" antibody refers to an antibody that has been identified and
separated and/or recovered from components of its natural environment and/or an
antibody that is recombinantly produced. A "purified antibody" is an antibody that is
typically at least 50% w/w pure of interfering proteins and other contaminants arising
from its production or purification but does not exclude the possibility that the
monoclonal antibody is combined with an excess of pharmaceutical acceptable carrier(s)
or other vehicle intended to facilitate its use. Interfering proteins and other contaminants
can include, for example, cellular components of the cells from which an antibody is
isolated or recombinantly produced. Sometimes monoclonal antibodies are at least 60%,
70%, 80%, 90%, 95 or 99% w/w pure of interfering proteins and contaminants from
production or purification. The antibodies described herein, including murine, chimeric,
and humanized antibodies can be provided in isolated and/or purified form.
                                                6

[0020]     The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained
from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies
comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations
that may be present in minor amounts. The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character
of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of
antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any
particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance
with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by
Kohler et al. (1975) Nature 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods
(see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4816567). The "monoclonal antibodies" may also be
isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al.
(1991) Nature, 352:624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597, for
example or may be made by other methods. The antibodies described herein are
monoclonal antibodies.
[0021]     Specific binding of a monoclonal antibody to its target antigen means an affinity
of at least 106, 107, 10', 109, or 10'0 M- . Specific binding is detectably higher in
magnitude and distinguishable from non-specific binding occurring to at least one
unrelated target. Specific binding can be the result of formation of bonds between
particular functional groups or particular spatial fit (e.g., lock and key type) whereas
nonspecific binding is usually the result of van der Waals forces.
[0022]     The basic antibody structural unit is a tetramer of subunits. Each tetramer
includes two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light" (about 25
kDa) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each
chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily
responsible for antigen recognition. This variable region is initially expressed linked to a
cleavable signal peptide. The variable region without the signal peptide is sometimes
referred to as a mature variable region. Thus, for example, a light chain mature variable
region, means a light chain variable region without the light chain signal peptide. The
carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible
for effector function.
                                               7

[0023]    Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are
classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as
IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable
and constant regions are joined by a "J" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the
heavy chain also including a "D" region of about 10 or more amino acids. (See generally,
FundamentalImmunology (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y., 1989, Ch. 7,
incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes).
[0024]    The mature variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody
binding site. Thus, an intact antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or
bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are the same. The chains all exhibit the same
general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three
hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The
CDRs from the two chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling
binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains
comprise the domains FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment
of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat, Sequences
of Proteinsof Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 1987
and 1991), or Chothia & Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al., Nature
342:878-883 (1989). Kabat also provides a widely used numbering convention (Kabat
numbering) in which corresponding residues between different heavy chains or between
different light chains are assigned the same number.
[0025]    The term "antibody" includes intact antibodies and binding fragments thereof.
Typically, antibody fragments compete with the intact antibody from which they were
derived for specific binding to the target including separate heavy chains, light chains
Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 , F(ab)c, diabodies, Dabs, nanobodies, and Fv. Fragments can be
produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical separation of
intact immunoglobulins. The term "antibody" also includes a diabody (homodimeric Fv
fragment) or a minibody (VL* V1CH3). a bispecific antibody or the like. A bispecific or
bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light
chain pairs and two different binding sites (see, e.g., Songsivilai and Lachmann, Clin.
Exp. Immunol., 79:315-321 (1990); Kostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148:1547-53 (1992)).
                                                8

[0026]     The term "antibody" includes an antibody by itself (naked antibody) or an
antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic or cytostatic drug.
[0027]     The term "epitope" refers to a site on an antigen to which an antibody binds.
An epitope can be formed from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids
juxtaposed by tertiary folding of one or more proteins. Epitopes formed from contiguous
amino acids are typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents whereas epitopes
formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An
epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a
unique spatial conformation. Methods of determining spatial conformation of epitopes
include, for example, x-ray crystallography and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic
resonance. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols, in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol.
66, Glenn E. Morris, Ed. (1996).
[0028]     Antibodies that recognize the same or overlapping epitopes can be identified in
a simple immunoassay showing the ability of one antibody to compete with the binding
of another antibody to a target antigen. The epitope of an antibody can also be defined by
X-ray crystallography of the antibody bound to its antigen to identify contact residues.
Alternatively, two antibodies have the same epitope if all amino acid mutations in the
antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of
the other. Two antibodies have overlapping epitopes if some amino acid mutations that
reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other.
Competition between antibodies is determined by an assay in which an antibody under
test inhibits specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen (see, e.g.,
Junghans et al., Cancer Res. 50:1495, 1990). A test antibody competes with a reference
antibody if an excess of a test antibody (e.g., at least 2x, 5x, lOx, 20x or 100x) inhibits
binding of the reference antibody by at least 50% but preferably 75%, 90% or 99% as
measured in a competitive binding assay. Antibodies identified by competition assay
(competing antibodies) include antibodies binding to the same epitope as the reference
antibody and antibodies binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the
epitope bound by the reference antibody for steric hindrance to occur. Antibodies that
compete with the h2H12 antibody for binding to the human CD33 protein are included in
this disclosure.
                                               9

[0029] A 2H12 antibody is an antibody that specifically binds to the human CD33
protein, and that comprises three heavy chain complementarity determining regions
(hCDRs): heavy chain CDR1, e.g., SEQ ID NO:19 or a sequence that is substantially
identical to SEQ ID NO:19, heavy chain CDR2, e.g., SEQ ID NO:20 or a sequence that is
substantially identical to SEQ ID NO:20, and heavy chain CDR3, e.g., SEQ ID NO:21 or
a sequence that is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO:21; and three light chain CDRs:
light chain CDR1, e.g., SEQ ID NO:22 or a sequence that is substantially identical to
SEQ ID NO:22, light chain CDR2 , e.g., SEQ ID NO:23 or a sequence that is
substantially identical to SEQ ID NO:23, and light chain CDR3, e.g., SEQ ID NO:24 or a
sequence that is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO:24. 2H12 antibodies include the
murine 2H12 (m2H12) antibody and chimeric or humanized antibodies derived from the
murine 2H12 antibody.
[0030]    The term "patient" includes human and other mammalian subjects that receive
either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment.
[0031]    For purposes of classifying amino acids substitutions as conservative or
nonconservative, amino acids are grouped as follows: Group I (hydrophobic side
chains): met, ala, val, leu, ile; Group II (neutral hydrophilic side chains): cys, ser, thr;
Group III (acidic side chains): asp, glu; Group IV (basic side chains): asn, gln, his, lys,
arg; Group V (residues influencing chain orientation): gly, pro; and Group VI (aromatic
side chains): trp, tyr, phe. Conservative substitutions involve substitutions between
amino acids in the same class. Non-conservative substitutions constitute exchanging a
member of one of these classes for a member of another.
[0032]    Percentage sequence identities are determined with antibody sequences
maximally aligned by the Kabat numbering convention. After alignment, if a subject
antibody region (e.g., the entire mature variable region of a heavy or light chain) is being
compared with the same region of a reference antibody, the percentage sequence identity
between the subject and reference antibody regions is the number of positions occupied
by the same amino acid in both the subject and reference antibody region divided by the
total number of aligned positions of the two regions, with gaps not counted, multiplied by
100 to convert to percentage.
                                               10

[0033]     Compositions or methods "comprising" one or more recited elements may
include other elements not specifically recited. For example, a composition that
comprises antibody may contain the antibody alone or in combination with other
ingredients.
[0034]     Designation of a range of values includes all integers within or defining the
range.
[0035]     An antibody effector function refers to a function contributed by an Fc
domain(s) of an Ig. Such functions can be, for example, antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis or complement-dependent
cytotoxicity. Such function can be effected by, for example, binding of an Fc effector
domain(s) to an Fc receptor on an immune cell with phagocytic or lytic activity or by
binding of an Fc effector domain(s) to components of the complement system. Typically,
the effect(s) mediated by the Fc-binding cells or complement components result in
inhibition and/or depletion of the CD33 targeted cell. Fc regions of antibodies can recruit
Fc receptor (FcR)-expressing cells and juxtapose them with antibody-coated target cells.
Cells expressing surface FcR for IgGs including FcyRIII (CD16), FcyRII (CD32) and
FcyRIII (CD64) can act as effector cells for the destruction of IgG-coated cells. Such
effector cells include monocytes, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and
eosinophils. Engagement of FcyR by IgG activates antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). ADCC is
mediated by CD 16' effector cells through the secretion of membrane pore-forming
proteins and proteases, while phagocytosis is mediated by CD32* and CD64* effector
cells (see FundamentalImmunology, 4h ed., Paul ed., Lippincott-Raven, N.Y., 1997,
Chapters 3, 17 and 30; Uchida et al., 2004, J. Exp. Med. 199:1659-69; Akewanlop et al.,
2001, Cancer Res. 61:4061-65; Watanabe et al., 1999, Breast CancerRes. Treat. 53:199
207). In addition to ADCC and ADCP, Fc regions of cell-bound antibodies can also
activate the complement classical pathway to elicit complement-dependent cytotoxicity
(CDC). Clq of the complement system binds to the Fc regions of antibodies when they
are complexed with antigens. Binding of Clq to cell-bound antibodies can initiate a
cascade of events involving the proteolytic activation of C4 and C2 to generate the C3
convertase. Cleavage of C3 to C3b by C3 convertase enables the activation of terminal
                                              11

complement components including C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9. Collectively, these proteins
form membrane-attack complex pores on the antibody-coated cells. These pores disrupt
the cell membrane integrity, killing the target cell (see Immunobiology, 6       ed., Janeway
et al., Garland Science, N. Y., 2005, Chapter 2).
[0036]     The term "antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity", or ADCC, is a mechanism
for inducing cell death that depends upon the interaction of antibody-coated target cells
with immune cells possessing lytic activity (also referred to as effector cells). Such
effector cells include natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils. The
effector cells attach to an Fc effector domain(s) of Ig bound to target cells via their
antigen-combining sites. Death of the antibody-coated target cell occurs as a result of
effector cell activity.
[0037]     The term "antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis", or ADCP, refers to the
process by which antibody-coated cells are internalized, either in whole or in part, by
phagocytic immune cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells) that bind to
an Fc effector domain(s) of Ig.
[0038]     The term "complement-dependent cytotoxicity", or CDC, refers to a mechanism
for inducing cell death in which an Fc effector domain(s) of a target-bound antibody
activates a series of enzymatic reactions culminating in the formation of holes in the
target cell membrane. Typically, antigen-antibody complexes such as those on antibody
coated target cells bind and activate complement component CIq which in turn activates
the complement cascade leading to target cell death. Activation of complement may also
result in deposition of complement components on the target cell surface that facilitate
ADCC by binding complement receptors (e.g., CR3) on leukocytes.
[0039]     A "cytotoxic effect" refers to the depletion, elimination and/or the killing of a
target cell. A "cytotoxic agent" refers to an agent that has a cytotoxic effect on a cell.
[0040]     Cytotoxic agents can be conjugated to an antibody or administered in
combination with an antibody.
[0041]     A "cytostatic effect" refers to the inhibition of cell proliferation. A "cytostatic
agent" refers to an agent that has a cytostatic effect on a cell, thereby inhibiting the
growth and/or expansion of a specific subset of cells. Cytostatic agents can be
conjugated to an antibody or administered in combination with an antibody.

[0042]      The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved or approvable by a
regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S.
Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more
particularly in humans. The term "pharmaceutically compatible ingredient" refers to a
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which an anti
CD33 antibody is administered to a subject.
[0043]      The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt," refers to pharmaceutically
acceptable organic or inorganic salts of an anti-CD33-1 antibody or conjugate thereof or
agent administered with an anti-CD33-1 antibody. Exemplary salts include sulfate,
citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid
phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate,
pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate,
glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate,
ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1' methylene
bis -(2 hydroxy 3 naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the
inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counterion.
The counterion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the
parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than
one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the
pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and/or one or more
counterion.

                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         I.       General
[0045]      The invention provides monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to CD33.
The antibodies are useful for treatment and diagnoses of various cancers as well as
detecting CD33.
                                               13

        II.     Target molecules
[0046]     Unless otherwise indicated, CD33 means a human CD33. An exemplary human
sequence is assigned Swiss Prot accession number P20138. P20138 is included herein as
SEQ ID NO:55. P20138 includes a signal peptide, amino acids 1-17; an extra-cellular
domain with IgG-like domains, amino acids 18-259; a transmembrane domain, amino
acids 260-282; and a cytoplasmic domain, amino acids 283-364.
Unless otherwise apparent from the context reference CD33 means at least an
extracellular domain of the protein and usually the complete protein other than a
cleavable signal peptide (amino acids 1-17 of P20138).
        III.    Antibodies of the invention
A.              Binding specificity and functional properties
[0047] The invention provides a murine antibody, m2H12, and chimeric or humanized
antibodies derived from m2H12. Murine antibodies were selected for ability to bind to
both human CD33 protein and cynomolgus CD33 protein. Cynomolgus CD33 amino
acid sequences are provided as SEQ ID NOs:56 and 57.
[0048] The affinity of humanized or chimeric forms of the murine m2H12 antibody (i.e.,
Ka) can bey greater than that of the m2H12 antibody, or within a factor of five or a factor
of two (i.e., more than or less than) that of that of the murine antibody m2H12 for human
CD33. One method of measuring affinity of an antibody for its target antigen is by
determining an antibody's apparent dissociation constant. The present invention
encompasses antibodies (e.g., chimeric and humanized forms of the mouse 2H12
antibody) having an apparent dissociation constant that is essentially the same as that of
murine 2H12 (i.e., within experimental error) as well as antibodies having a dissociation
constant lower or higher than that of murine antibody 2H12 for human CD33.          In some
embodiments, antibodies of the present invention (e.g., chimeric, humanized and human
forms of the mouse 2H12 antibody) have an apparent dissociation constant within a range
of 0.1 to 10 times, or preferably within a range of 0.1 to 5 times, 0.1 to 2 times, or even
0.5 to 2 times that of the apparent dissociation constant of the murine 2H12 antibody for
human CD33. In some aspects, the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of the antibodies
for human CD33is preferably within a range of 0.1 nM to 50 nM, even more preferably
within a range of 0.1 nM to 25 nM, even preferably within a range of 0.1 nM to 10 nM,
                                               14

0.5 nM to 5 nM, or 0.5 nM to 2.5 nM. Humanized or chimeric m2H12 antibodies
specifically bind to human CD33 in native form and/or recombinantly expressed from
CHO cells as does the murine m2H12 antibody from which they were derived.
Humanized or chimeric m2H12 antibodies bind to the same epitope and/or compete with
m2H12 for binding to human CD33. In some embodiments, humanized or chimeric
m2H12 antibodies also bind to the cyno-homolog of CD33, thus permitting preclinical
testing in nonhuman primates.
[0049]    Preferred antibodies (e.g., humanized or chimeric m2H12 antibodies) inhibit
cancer (e.g., growth of cells, metastasis and/or lethality to the organisms) as shown on
cancerous cells propagating in culture, in an animal model or clinical trial. Animal
models can be formed by implanting CD33-expressing human tumor cell lines or primary
patient tumor cells into appropriate immunodeficient rodent strains, e.g., athymic nude
mice, NSG, or SCID mice. These tumor cell lines can be established in immunodeficient
rodent hosts either as solid tumor by subcutaneous injections or as disseminated tumors
by intravenous injections. Once established within a host, these tumor models can be
applied to evaluate the therapeutic efficacies of the anti-CD33 antibodies or conjugated
forms thereof as described in the Examples.
        B.      Antibodies
[0050] A humanized antibody is a genetically engineered antibody in which the CDRs
from a non-human "donor" antibody are grafted into human "acceptor" antibody
sequences (see, e.g., Queen, US 5,530,101 and 5,585,089; Winter, US 5,225,539; Carter,
US 6,407,213; Adair, US 5,859,205; and Foote, US 6,881,557). The acceptor antibody
sequences can be, for example, a mature human antibody sequence, a composite of such
sequences, a consensus sequence of human antibody sequences, or a germline region
sequence. A preferred acceptor sequence for the heavy chain is the germline      VH exon
VH1-1 8 and for the J exon (JH), exon JH-6. For the light chain, a preferred acceptor
sequence is exon VL1-1   6 J exon JK-4. Thus, a humanized antibody is an antibody having
some or all CDRs entirely or substantially from a non-human donor antibody and
variable region framework sequences and constant regions, if present, entirely or
substantially from human antibody sequences. Similarly a humanized heavy chain has at
                                              15

least one, two and usually all three CDRs entirely or substantially from a donor antibody
heavy chain, and a heavy chain variable region framework sequence and heavy chain
constant region, if present, substantially from human heavy chain variable region
framework and constant region sequences. Similarly a humanized light chain has at least
one, two and usually all three CDRs entirely or substantially from a donor antibody light
chain, and a light chain variable region framework sequence and light chain constant
region, if present, substantially from human light chain variable region framework and
constant region sequences. Other than nanobodies and dAbs, a humanized antibody
comprises a humanized heavy chain and a humanized light chain. A CDR in a
humanized or human antibody is substantially from or substantially identical to a
corresponding CDR in a non-human antibody when at least 60%, 85%, 90%, 95% or
100% of corresponding residues (as defined by Kabat) are identical between the
respective CDRs.     In some embodiments, a CDR in a humanized antibody or human
antibody is substantially from or substantially identical to a corresponding CDR in a non
human antibody when there are no more than 3 conservative amino acid substitutions in
each CDR. The variable region framework sequences of an antibody chain or the constant
region of an antibody chain are substantially from a human variable region framework
sequence or human constant region respectively when at least 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%,
95% or 100% of corresponding residues defined by Kabat are identical. In some
humanized antibodies of the present invention, there is at least one murine 2H12
backmutation in the heavy chain variable framework region of the antibody.
Although humanized antibodies often incorporate all six CDRs (preferably as defined by
Kabat) from a mouse antibody, they can also be made with less than all CDRs (e.g., at
least 3, 4, or 5) CDRs from a mouse antibody (e.g., Pascalis et al., J Immunol. 169:3076,
2002; Vajdos et al., Journal of MolecularBiology, 320: 415-428, 2002; Iwahashi et al.,
Mol. Immunol. 36:1079-1091, 1999; Tamura et al, Journalof Immunology, 164:1432
1441, 2000).
[0051]     Certain amino acids from the human variable region framework residues can be
selected for substitution based on their possible influence on CDR conformation and/or
binding to antigen. Investigation of such possible influences is by modeling, examination
                                              16

of the characteristics of the amino acids at particular locations, or empirical observation
of the effects of substitution or mutagenesis of particular amino acids.
[0052]     For example, when an amino acid differs between a murine variable region
framework residue and a selected human variable region framework residue, the human
framework amino acid can be substituted by the equivalent framework amino acid from
the mouse antibody when it is reasonably expected that the amino acid:
        (1)      noncovalently binds antigen directly,
        (2)      is adjacent to a CDR region,
        (3)      otherwise interacts with a CDR region (e.g. is within about 6 A of a CDR
                 region); or
        (4)      mediates interaction between the heavy and light chains.
[0053]     The invention provides humanized forms of the mouse m2H12 antibody
including nine exemplified humanized heavy chain mature variable regions (HA-HI) and
seven exemplified humanized light chain mature variable regions (LA-LG). The
permutations of these chains having the strongest binding (lowest EC50) are HCLA,
HCLE, HCLG, HILA, HILE and HILG. Of these permutations, HILG (also known as
h2H12) is preferred because it has the strongest binding.
[0054]     The invention provides 2H12 antibodies in which the heavy chain variable
region shows at least 90% identity to HA (SEQ ID NO: 10) and a light chain variable
region at least 90% identical to LA (SEQ ID NO:2). In some aspects, the antibody is a
humanized antibody and there is at least one murine 2H12 backmutation in the heavy
chain variable framework region. In other aspects, the antibody is a humanized antibody
and there is at least one murine 2H12 backmutation in the light chain variable framework
region. Additionally, the invention provides 2H12 antibodies in which the humanized
heavy chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence
identity to SEQ ID NOS: 10-18 and the humanized light chain variable region shows at
least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOS: 2-8 (and
any combinations thereof (i.e., the antibody can comprise any one of the heavy chain
variable regions paired with any one of the light chain variable regions). For example,
the invention provides antibodies in which the heavy chain variable region shows at least
90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOS:10, 11,12,

13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18, and the humanized light chain variable region shows at least
90%, 95%,96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOS:2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, or 8. In another embodiment, the invention provides antibodies in which the heavy
chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100%
sequence identity to SEQ ID NOS:10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18, and the light
chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% , 99% or 100%
sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:2. In another embodiment, the invention provides
antibodies in which the heavy chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%,
98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOS:10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or
18, and the light chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%
or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:3. In another embodiment, the invention
provides antibodies in which the heavy chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%,
96%, 97%, 98%. 99% or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOS:10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, or 18, and the light chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%,
98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:4. In another embodiment, the
invention provides antibodies in which the heavy chain variable region shows at least
90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOS:10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18, and the light chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%,
96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:5. In another
embodiment, the invention provides antibodies in which the heavy chain variable region
shows at least 90%, 95%,96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID
NOS:10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18, and the light chain variable region shows at
least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%. 99% or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:6. In
another embodiment, the invention provides antibodies in which the heavy chain
variable region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence
identity to SEQ ID NOS:10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18, and the light chain variable
region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to
SEQ ID NO:7.     In another embodiment, the invention provides antibodies in which the
heavy chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100%
sequence identity to SEQ ID NOS:10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18, and the light
                                              18

chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence
identity to SEQ ID NO:8.
[0055]     In some aspects, these antibodies are humanized antibodies and some or all of
the backmutations in the respective antibodies are retained. In some antibodies position
H94 is occupied by S. In some antibodies, , preferably, at least one of positions H48,
H66, H67, H69, H71, and H94 is occupied by the amino acid from the corresponding
position of the murine 2H12 antibody. Optionally, in any such antibody, position H48 is
occupied by I; position H66 is occupied by K; position H67 is occupied by A; position
H69 is occupied by L; position H71 is occupied by A; position H94 is occupied by S. In
other embodiments in such antibodies, preferably, at least one of positions L22, L46,
L69, and L71 is occupied by the amino acid from the corresponding position of the
murine 2H12 antibody. Optionally, in any such antibody, position L22 is occupied by N;
position L46 is occupied by T; position L69 is occupied by    Q; and position L71 is
occupied by Y.
[0056]     Preferably, in any of the antibodies described above, e.g., 2H12 humanized
antibodies in which the heavy chain variable region shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%,
98% or 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOS:10-18 and the light chain variable region
shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOS:2
8, the CDR regions are identical or substantially identical to the CDR regions of the
mouse donor antibody, i.e., murine 2H12 antibody (SEQ ID NOS:19-24). The CDR
regions are as defined by Kabat. Antibodies of the present invention include antibodies
HCLA, HCLE, HCLG, HILA, HILE, and HILG.
[0057]     The invention provides variants of the HILG humanized antibody in which the
humanized heavy chain mature variable region shows at least 90%, 95%,96%, 97%, 98%
or 99% identity to SEQ ID NO: 18 and the humanized light chain mature variable region
shows at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:8.
In some such antibodies, position H94 is occupied by S. Preferably, in such antibodies
some or all of the backmutations in HILG are retained. In other words, at least 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, or preferably all 6 of heavy chain positions H48, H66, H67, H69, H71, and H94 are
occupied by I and K and A and L and A and S, respectively. Also, at least 1, 2, 3, or
preferably all 4 of light chain positions L22, L46, L69, and L71 are occupied by N and T
                                               19

and  Q and Y respectively.   The CDR regions of such humanized antibodies are preferably
substantially identical to the CDR regions of HILG, which are the same as those of the
mouse donor antibody. The CDR regions can be defined by any conventional definition
(e.g., Chothia) but are preferably as defined by Kabat. In one embodiment, the humanized
antibody comprises a heavy chain comprising the three CDRs of SEQ ID NO: 18 and
variable region frameworks with at least 95% identity to the variable region frameworks
of SEQ ID NO: 18. In another embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises a light
chain comprising the three CDRs of SEQ ID NO:8 and variable region frameworks with
at least 95% identity to variable region frameworks of SEQ ID NO:8. In a further
embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises a heavy chain comprising the three
CDRs of SEQ ID NO: 18 and variable region frameworks with at least 95% identity to
the variable region frameworks of SEQ ID NO: 18, and a light chain comprising the three
CDRs of SEQ ID NO:8, and variable region frameworks with at least 95% identity to the
variable region frameworks of SEQ ID NO:8.
[0058]     Insofar as humanized antibodies show any variation from the exemplified HILG
humanized antibody, one possibility for such additional variation is additional
backmutations in the variable region frameworks. Any or all of the positions
backmutated in other exemplified humanized heavy or light chain mature variable
regions can also be made (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, or all 5 of H38 occupied by N, H40 occupied by
R, H73 occupied by K, H82A occupied by S, and H83 occupied by T in the heavy chain
and 1 or both of L3 occupied by K, and L20 occupied by I in the light chain. However,
such additional backmutations are not preferred because they in general do not improve
affinity and introducing more mouse residues may give increased risk of
immunogenicity.
[0059]     Another possible variation is to substitute certain residues in the CDRs of the
mouse antibody with corresponding residues from human CDRs sequences, typically
from the CDRs of the human acceptor sequences used in designing the exemplified
humanized antibodies. In some antibodies only part of the CDRs, namely the subset of
CDR residues required for binding, termed the SDRs, are needed to retain binding in a
humanized antibody. CDR residues not contacting antigen and not in the SDRs can be
identified based on previous studies (for example residues H60-H65 in CDR H2 are often
                                               20

not required), from regions of Kabat CDRs lying outside Chothia hypervariable loops
(Chothia, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901, 1987), by molecular modeling and/or empirically, or as
described in Gonzales et al., Mol. Immunol. 41: 863 (2004). In such humanized
antibodies at positions in which one or more donor CDR residues is absent or in which an
entire donor CDR is omitted, the amino acid occupying the position can be an amino acid
occupying the corresponding position (by Kabat numbering) in the acceptor antibody
sequence. The number of such substitutions of acceptor for donor amino acids in the
CDRs to include reflects a balance of competing considerations. Such substitutions are
potentially advantageous in decreasing the number of mouse amino acids in a humanized
antibody and consequently decreasing potential immunogenicity. However, substitutions
can also cause changes of affinity, and significant reductions in affinity are preferably
avoided. Positions for substitution within CDRs and amino acids to substitute can also be
selected empirically.
[0060]    Although not preferred other amino acid substitutions can be made, for
example, in framework residues not in contact with the CDRs, or even some potential
CDR-contact residues amino acids within the CDRs. Often the replacements made in the
variant humanized sequences are conservative with respect to the replaced HILG amino
acids in the case of humanized 2H12 antibodies. Preferably, replacements relative to
HILG (whether or not conservative) have no substantial effect on the binding affinity or
potency of the humanized mAb, that is, its ability to bind human CD33 and inhibit
growth of cancer cells.
[0061]    Variants typically differ from the heavy and light chain mature variable region
sequences of HILG (h2H 12) by a small number (e.g., typically no more than 1, 2, 3, 5 or
10 in either the light chain or heavy chain mature variable region, or both) of
replacements, deletions or insertions.
[0062]    In some embodiments, humanized or chimeric antibodies have a CDR H2 with
up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 substitutions, deletions or insertions relative to CDR H2 of heavy
chain HI, and CDRs HI, H3, Li, L2 and L3, each have up to 1, 2, 3 or 4 substitutions,
deletions or insertions relative to the corresponding CDR of heavy chain HI or light
chain LG. In some embodiments, the humanized or chimeric antibodies of the invention
have one or at most two conserved amino acid substitutions in amino acid(s) that are
                                                21

identified as part of a CDR. Examples of preferred amino acid substitutions include the
following. In CDR1 of the light chain, an R residue can be substituted for a K at position
24; G, S, or T can be substituted for A at position 25; M can be substituted for L at
position 33; and T can be substituted for S at position 34. In CDR2 of the light chain, a K
residue can be substituted for an R residue at position 53; an M residue can be substituted
for an L residue at position 54; an I residue can be substituted for a V residue at position
55; and an E residue can be substituted for a D residue at position 56. In CDR2 of the
heavy chain, a D residue can be substituted for an E residue at position 61; an R residue
can be substituted for a K residue at position 62; a Y residue can be substituted for an F
residue at position 63; an R residue can be substituted for a K residue at position 64; and
a G residue can be substituted for an A residue at position 65.
[0063]     In some embodiments, the humanized antibodies of the invention comprise a
mature heavy chain variable region of SEQ ID NO: 18, with one two or three conservative
substitutions in a CDR sequence as listed above. In some embodiments, the humanized
antibodies of the invention comprise a mature light chain variable region of SEQ ID
NO:8, with one two or three conservative substitutions in a CDR sequence as listed
above.
         C.      Selection of Constant Region
[0064]     Heavy and light chain variable regions of humanized antibodies can be linked to
at least a portion of a human constant region. The choice of constant region depends, in
part, whether antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, antibody dependent cellular
phagocytosis and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity are desired. For example, human
isotopes IgGI and IgG3 have strong complement-dependent cytotoxicity, human isotype
IgG2 weak complement-dependent cytotoxicity and human IgG4 lacks complement
dependent cytotoxicity. Human IgGI and IgG3 also induce stronger cell mediated
effector functions than human IgG2 and IgG4. Light chain constant regions can be
lambda or kappa. Antibodies can be expressed as tetramers containing two light and two
heavy chains, as separate heavy chains, light chains, as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv, or as
single chain antibodies in which heavy and light chain variable domains are linked
through a spacer.
                                              22

[0065]     Human constant regions show allotypic variation and isoallotypic variation
between different individuals, that is, the constant regions can differ in different
individuals at one or more polymorphic positions. Isoallotypes differ from allotypes in
that sera recognizing an isoallotype binds to a non-polymorphic region of a one or more
other isotypes.
[0066]     One or several amino acids at the amino or carboxy terminus of the light and/or
heavy chain, such as the C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain, may be missing or
derivatized in a proportion or all of the molecules. Substitutions can be made in the
constant regions to reduce or increase effector function such as complement-mediated
cytotoxicity or ADCC (see, e.g., Winter et al., US Patent No. 5,624,821; Tso et al., US
Patent No. 5,834,597; and Lazar et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103:4005, 2006), or to
prolong half-life in humans (see, e.g., Hinton et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279:6213, 2004).
[0067] Exemplary substitution include the amino acid substitution of the native amino
acid to a cysteine residue is introduced at amino acid position 234, 235, 237, 239, 267,
298, 299, 326, 330, or 332, preferably an S239C mutation in a human IgGI isotype
(numbering is according to the EU index (Kabat, Sequences of Proteinsof Immunological
Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 1987 and 1991); see US
20100158909, which is herein incorporated reference). The presence of an additional
cysteine residue allows interchain disulfide bond formation. Such interchain disulfide
bond formation can cause steric hindrance, thereby reducing the affinity of the Fc region
FcyR binding interaction. The cysteine residue(s) introduced in or in proximity to the Fc
region of an IgG constant region can also serve as sites for conjugation to therapeutic
agents (i.e., coupling cytotoxic drugs using thiol specific reagents such as maleimide
derivatives of drugs. The presence of a therapeutic agent causes steric hindrance, thereby
further reducing the affinity of the Fc region-FcyR binding interaction. Other
substitutions at any of positions 234, 235, 236 and/or 237 reduce affinity for Fcy
receptors, particularly FcyRI receptor (see, e.g., US 6,624,821, US 5,624,821.)
[0068] The in vivo half-life of an antibody can also impact its effector functions. The
half-life of an antibody can be increased or decreased to modify its therapeutic activities.
FcRn is a receptor that is structurally similar to MHC Class I antigen that non-covalently
associates with  p2-microglobulin.   FcRn regulates the catabolism of IgGs and their
                                              23

transcytosis across tissues (Ghetie and Ward, 2000, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 18:739-766;
Ghetie and Ward, 2002, Immunol. Res. 25:97-113). The IgG-FcRn interaction takes
place at pH 6.0 (pH of intracellular vesicles) but not at pH 7.4 (pH of blood); this
interaction enables IgGs to be recycled back to the circulation (Ghetie and Ward, 2000,
Ann. Rev. Immunol. 18:739-766; Ghetie and Ward, 2002, Immunol. Res. 25:97-113). The
region on human IgGI involved in FcRn binding has been mapped (Shields et al., 2001,
J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-604). Alanine substitutions at positions Pro238, Thr256,
Thr307, Gln3 11, Asp312, Glu380, Glu382, or Asn434 of human IgGI enhance FcRn
binding (Shields et al., 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-604). IgGI molecules harboring
these substitutions have longer serum half-lives. Consequently, these modified IgGI
molecules may be able to carry out their effector functions, and hence exert their
therapeutic efficacies, over a longer period of time compared to unmodified IgG1. Other
exemplary substitutions for increasing binding to FcRn include a Gln at position 250
and/or a Leu at position 428. EU numbering is used for all position in the constant
region.
[0069]     Oligosaccharides covalently attached to the conserved Asn297 are involved in
the ability of the Fc region of an IgG to bind FcyR (Lund et al., 1996, J. Immunol.
157:4963-69; Wright and Morrison, 1997, Trends Biotechnol. 15:26-3 1). Engineering of
this glycoform on IgG can significantly improve IgG-mediated ADCC. Addition of
bisecting N-acetylglucosamine modifications (Umana et al., 1999, Nat. Biotechnol.
17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001, Biotech. Bioeng. 74:288-94) to this glycoform or
removal of fucose (Shields et al., 2002, J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-40; Shinkawa et al.,
2003, J. Biol. Chem. 278:6591-604; Niwa et al., 2004, Cancer Res. 64:2127-33) from this
glycoform are two examples of IgG Fc engineering that improves the binding between
IgG Fc and FcyR, thereby enhancing Ig-mediated ADCC activity.
[0070]     A systemic substitution of solvent-exposed amino acids of human IgG1 Fc
region has generated IgG variants with altered FcyR binding affinities (Shields et al.,
2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-604). When compared to parental IgG1, a subset of these
variants involving substitutions at Thr256/Ser298, Ser298/Glu333, Ser298/Lys334, or
Ser298/Glu333/Lys334 to Ala demonstrate increased in both binding affinity toward
                                              24

FcyR and ADCC activity (Shields et al., 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-604; Okazaki et
al., 2004, J. Mol. Biol. 336:1239-49).
[0071]     Complement fixation activity of antibodies (both Clq binding and CDC
activity) can be improved by substitutions at Lys326 and Glu333 (Idusogie et al., 2001, J.
Immunol. 166:2571-2575). The same substitutions on a human IgG2 backbone can
convert an antibody isotype that binds poorly to CIq and is severely deficient in
complement activation activity to one that can both bind Clq and mediate CDC (Idusogie
et al., 2001, J. Immunol. 166:2571-75). Several other methods have also been applied to
improve complement fixation activity of antibodies. For example, the grafting of an 18
amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail piece of IgM to the carboxyl-termini of IgG greatly
enhances their CDC activity. This is observed even with IgG4, which normally has no
detectable CDC activity (Smith et al., 1995, J. Immunol. 154:2226-36). Also,
substituting Ser444 located close to the carboxy-terminal of IgGI heavy chain with Cys
induced tail-to-tail dimerization of IgGI with a 200-fold increase of CDC activity over
monomeric IgGI (Shopes et al., 1992, J. Immunol. 148:2918-22). In addition, a
bispecific diabody construct with specificity for Clq also confers CDC activity
(Kontermann et al., 1997, Nat. Biotech. 15:629-3 1).
[0072]     Complement activity can be reduced by mutating at least one of the amino acid
residues 318, 320, and 322 of the heavy chain to a residue having a different side chain,
such as Ala. Other alkyl-substituted non-ionic residues, such as Gly, Ile, Leu, or Val, or
such aromatic non-polar residues as Phe, Tyr, Trp and Pro in place of any one of the three
residues also reduce or abolish Clq binding. Ser, Thr, Cys, and Met can be used at
residues 320 and 322, but not 318, to reduce or abolish Clq binding activity.
Replacement of the 318 (Glu) residue by a polar residue may modify but not abolish Clq
binding activity. Replacing residue 297 (Asn) with Ala results in removal of lytic activity
but only slightly reduces (about three fold weaker) affinity for C lq. This alteration
destroys the glycosylation site and the presence of carbohydrate that is required for
complement activation. Any other substitution at this site also destroys the glycosylation
site. The following mutations and any combination thereof also reduce Clq binding:
D270A, K322A, P329A, and P31 S (see WO 06/03629 1).
                                             25

Reference to a human constant region includes a constant region with any natural
allotype or any permutation of residues occupying polymorphic positions in natural
allotypes. Also, up to 1, 2, 5, or 10 mutations may be present relative to a natural human
constant region, such as those indicated above to reduce Fc gamma receptor binding or
increase binding to FcRN.
        D.      Expression of Recombinant Antibodies
[0073]    Humanized or chimeric antibodies are typically produced by recombinant
expression. Recombinant polynucleotide constructs typically include an expression
control sequence operably linked to the coding sequences of antibody chains, including
naturally-associated or heterologous promoter regions. Preferably, the expression control
sequences are eukaryotic promoter systems in vectors capable of transforming or
transfecting eukaryotic host cells. Once the vector has been incorporated into the
appropriate host, the host is maintained under conditions suitable for high level
expression of the nucleotide sequences, and the collection and purification of the
crossreacting antibodies.
[0074]    Mammalian cells are a preferred host for expressing nucleotide segments
encoding immunoglobulins or fragments thereof. See Winnacker, From Genes to Clones,
(VCH Publishers, NY, 1987). A number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting
intact heterologous proteins have been developed in the art, and include CHO cell lines
(e.g., DG44), various COS cell lines, HeLa cells, HEK293 cells, L cells, and non
antibody-producing myelomas including Sp2/0 and NSO. Preferably, the cells are
nonhuman. Expression vectors for these cells can include expression control sequences,
such as an origin of replication, a promoter, an enhancer (Queen et al., Immunol. Rev.
89:49 (1986)), and necessary processing information sites, such as ribosome binding
sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences.
Preferred expression control sequences are promoters derived from endogenous genes,
cytomegalovirus, SV40, adenovirus, bovine papillomavirus, and the like. See Co et al., J.
Immunol. 148:1149 (1992).
[0075]    Human antibodies against CD33 protein can be provided by a variety of
techniques described below. Methods for producing human antibodies include the
                                              26

trioma method of Oestberg et al., Hybridoma 2:361-367 (1983); Oestberg, U.S. Patent
No. 4,634,664; and Engleman et al., US Patent 4,634,666; use of transgenic mice
including human immunoglobulin genes (see, e.g., Lonberg et al., W093/12227 (1993);
US 5,877,397, US 5,874,299, US 5,814,318, US 5,789,650, US 5,770,429, US 5,661,016,

(1994), Nature Biotechnology 14, 826 (1996), Kucherlapati, WO 91/10741 (1991) and
phage display methods (see, .e.g. Dower et al., WO 91/17271 and McCafferty et al., WO
92/01047, US 5,877,218, US 5,871,907, US 5,858,657, US 5,837,242, US 5,733,743 and
US 5,565,332
[0076]     Once expressed, antibodies can be purified according to standard procedures of
the art, including HPLC purification, column chromatography, gel electrophoresis and
the like (see generally, Scopes, Protein Purification(Springer-Verlag, NY, 1982)).
         IV.     Nucleic Acids
[0077]     The invention further provides nucleic acids encoding any of the humanized
heavy and light chains described above. Typically, the nucleic acids also encode a signal
peptide fused to the mature heavy and light chains. Coding sequences on nucleic acids
can be in operable linkage with regulatory sequences to ensure expression of the coding
sequences, such as a promoter, enhancer, ribosome binding site, transcription termination
signal and the like. The nucleic acids encoding heavy and light chains can occur in
isolated form or can be cloned into one or more vectors. The nucleic acids can be
synthesized by for example, solid state synthesis or PCR of overlapping oligonucleotides.
Nucleic acids encoding heavy and light chains can be joined as one contiguous nucleic
acid, e.g., within an expression vector, or can be separate, e.g., each cloned into its own
expression vector.
[0078]     In one embodiment, this disclosure provides an isolated polynucleotide
encoding an antibody heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of
SEQ ID NO: 18. This isolated polynucleotide can further encode a human IgG heavy
chain constant region. The isotype of the IgG constant region is, e.g., IgGI, IgG2, IgG3,
or IgG4. In one embodiment, the isotype of the IgG constant region is IgGI. In another
embodiment, the encoded IgGI constant region has an amino acid sequence comprising a
                                              27

substitution at residue 239, according to the Kabat numbering system, i.e., S239C. The
disclosure also provides an expression vector comprising the isolated polynucleotide
encoding the antibody heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence
of SEQ ID NO: 18, and further, a host cell comprising that expression vector. In some
embodiments, the host cell is a mammalian host cell, e.g., a CHO cell.
[0079]    In another embodiment, this disclosure provides an isolated polynucleotide
encoding an antibody light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of
SEQ ID NO:8. This isolated polynucleotide can further encode a human IgG light chain
constant region. The isotype of the IgG light chain constant region is, e.g., a kappa
constant region. The disclosure also provides an expression vector comprising the
isolated polynucleotide encoding the antibody light chain variable region comprising the
amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8, and further, a host cell comprising that expression
vector. In some embodiments, the host cell is a mammalian host cell, e.g., a CHO cell.
In another embodiment, this disclosure provides an isolated polynucleotide or
polynucleotides encoding an antibody heavy chain variable region comprising the amino
acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18 and an antibody light chain variable region comprising
the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8, the heavy chain variable domain and the light
chain variable domain forming an antibody or antigen binding fragment that specifically
binds to human CD33. This disclosure also provides an expression vector comprising the
isolated polynucleotide or polynucleotides the encode the antibody heavy chain variable
region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18 and the antibody light
chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8. A host cell
comprising the expression vector or vectors is also provided. The host cell is preferably a
mammalian cell, e.g., a CHO cell.
[0080]    In another embodiment, this disclosure provides first and second vectors
comprising a polynucleotide encoding an antibody heavy chain variable region
comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18 and a polynucleotide encoding an
antibody light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID
NO:8, the heavy chain variable domain and the light chain variable domain forming an
antibody or antigen binding fragment that specifically binds to human CD33. Host cell
                                             28

comprising the vectors are provided, preferably mammalian host cells, such as a CHO
cell.
         V.      Antibody Drug Conjugates
[0081] Anti-CD33 antibodies can be conjugated to cytotoxic moieties to form
antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Particularly suitable moieties for conjugation to
antibodies are cytotoxic agents (e.g., chemotherapeutic agents), prodrug converting
enzymes, radioactive isotopes or compounds, or toxins (these moieties being collectively
referred to as therapeutic agents or drugs). For example, an anti-CD33 antibody can be
conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, or a toxin (e.g., a
cytostatic or cytocidal agent such as, e.g., abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or
diphtheria toxin). Examples of useful classes of cytotoxic agents include, for example,
DNA minor groove binders, DNA alkylating agents, and tubulin inhibitors. Exemplary
cytotoxic agents include, for example, auristatins, camptothecins, duocarmycins,
etoposides, maytansines and maytansinoids (e.g., DM1 and DM4), taxanes,
benzodiazepines (e.g., pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs), indolinobenzodiazepines,
and oxazolidinobenzodiazepines) and vinca alkaloids. Techniques for conjugating
therapeutic agents to proteins, and in particular to antibodies, are well-known. (See, e.g.,
Alley et al., Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2010 14:1-9; Senter, CancerJ., 2008,
14(3):154-169.)
[0082]     The therapeutic agent (e.g., cytotoxic agent) can be conjugated to the antibody
in a manner that reduces its activity unless it is detached from the antibody (e.g., by
hydrolysis, by antibody degradation, or by a cleaving agent).       Such therapeutic agent
can be attached to the antibody via a linker. A therapeutic agent conjugated to a linker is
also referred to herein as a drug linker. The nature of the linker can vary widely. The
components that make up the linker are chosen on the basis of their characteristics, which
may be dictated in part, by the conditions at the site to which the conjugate is delivered.
[0083]     The therapeutic agent can be attached to the antibody with a cleavable linker
that is sensitive to cleavage in the intracellular environment of the anti-CD33-expressing
cancer cell but is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment, such that the
conjugate is cleaved from the antibody when it is internalized by the anti-CD33
                                                29

expressing cancer cell (e.g., in the endosomal or, for example by virtue of pH sensitivity
or protease sensitivity, in the lysosomal environment or in the caveolear environment).
The therapeutic agent can also be attached to the antibody with a non-cleavable linker.
As indicated, the linker may comprise a cleavable unit. In some such embodiments, the
structure and/or sequence of the cleavable unit is selected such that it is cleaved by the
action of enzymes present at the target site (e.g., the target cell). In other embodiments,
cleavable units that are cleavable by changes in pH (e.g. acid or base labile), temperature
or upon irradiation (e.g. photolabile) may also be used.
[0084]      In some embodiments, the cleavable unit may comprise one amino acid or a
contiguous sequence of amino acids. The amino acid sequence may be the target
substrate for an enzyme.
 [0085]     In some aspects, the cleavable unit is a peptidyl unit and is at least two amino
acids long. Cleaving agents can include cathepsins B and D and plasmin (see, e.g.,
Dubowchik and Walker, 1999, Pharm. Therapeutics 83:67-123). Most typical are
cleavable unit that are cleavable by enzymes that are present in anti-CD33 expressing
cells, i.e., an enzyme cleavable linker. Accordingly, the linker can be cleaved by an
intracellular peptidase or protease enzyme, including a lysosomal or endosomal protease.
For example, a linker that is cleavable by the thiol-dependent protease cathepsin-B,
which is highly expressed in cancerous tissue, can be used (e.g., a linker comprising a
Phe-Leu or a Val-Cit peptide or a Val-Ala peptide).
In some embodiments, the linker will comprise a cleavable unit (e.g., a peptidyl unit) and
the cleavable unit will be directly conjugated to the therapeutic agent. In other
embodiments, the cleavable unit will be conjugated to the therapeutic agent via an
additional functional unit, e.g., a self-immolative spacer unit or a non-self-immolative
spacer unit. A non self-immolative spacer unit is one in which part or all of the spacer
unit remains bound to the drug unit after cleavage of a cleavable unit (e.g., amino acid)
from the antibody drug conjugate. To liberate the drug, an independent hydrolysis
reaction takes place within the target cell to cleave the spacer unit from the drug.
With a self-immolative spacer unit, the drug is released without the need for drug for a
separate hydrolysis step. In one embodiment, wherein the linker comprises a cleavable
unit and a self immolative group, the cleavable unit is cleavable by the action of an
                                               30

enzyme and after cleavage of the cleavable unit, the self-immolative group(s) release the
therapeutic agent. In some embodiments, the cleavable unit of the linker will be directly
or indirectly conjugated to the therapeutic agent on one end and on the other end will be
directly or indirectly conjugated to the antibody. In some such embodiments, the
cleavable unit will be directly or indirectly (e.g., via a self-immolative or non-self
immolative spacer unit) conjugated to the therapeutic agent on one end and on the other
end will be conjugated to the antibody via a stretcher unit. A stretcher unit links the
antibody to the rest of the drug and/or drug linker. In one embodiment, the connection
between the antibody and the rest of the drug or drug linker is via a maleimide group,
e.g., via a maleimidocaproyl linker. In some embodiments, the antibody will be linked
to the drug via a disulfide, for example the disulfide linked maytansinoid conjugates
SPDB-DM4 and SPP-DM 1.
[0086]     The connection between the antibody and the linker can be via a number of
different routes, e.g., through a thioether bond, through a disulfide bond, through an
amide bond, or through an ester bond. In one embodiment, the connection between the
anti-CD33 antibody and the linker is formed between a thiol group of a cysteine residue
of the antibody and a maleimide group of the linker. In some embodiments, the
interchain bonds of the antibody are converted to free thiol groups prior to reaction with
the functional group of the linker. In some embodiments, a cysteine residue is an
introduced into the heavy or light chain of an antibody and reacted with the linker.
Positions for cysteine insertion by substitution in antibody heavy or light chains include
those described in Published U.S. Application No. 2007-0092940 and International
Patent Publication W02008070593, each of which are incorporated by reference herein
in its entirety and for all purposes.
[0087]     In some embodiments, the antibody- drug conjugates have the following
formula I:
                                   L - (LU-D)p              (I)
wherein L is an anti-CD33 antibody, LU is a Linker unit and D is a Drug unit (i.e., the
therapeutic agent). The subscript p ranges from 1 to 20. Such conjugates comprise an
anti-CD33 antibody covalently linked to at least one drug via a linker. The Linker Unit is
connected at one end to the antibody and at the other end to the drug.
                                               31

[0088]     The drug loading is represented by p, the number of drug molecules per
antibody. Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 Drug units (D) per antibody. The skilled
artisan will appreciate that in some aspects, the subscript p will range from 1 to 20 (i.e.,
both integer and non-integer values from 1 to 20). The skilled artisan will appreciate that
in some aspects, the subscript p will be an integer from 1 to 20, and will represent the
number of drug-linkers on a singular antibody. In other aspects, p represents the average
number of drug-linker molecules per antibody, e.g., the average number of drug-linkers
per antibody in a reaction mixture or composition (e.g., pharmaceutical composition), and
can be an integer or non-integer value. Accordingly, in some aspects, for compositions
(e.g., pharmaceutical compositions), p represents the average drug loading of the
antibody-drug conjugates in the composition, and p ranges from 1 to 20.
[0089]     In some embodiments, p is from about 1 to about 8 drugs per antibody. In some
embodiments, p is 1. In some embodiments, p is 2. In some embodiments, p is from
about 2 to about 8 drugs per antibody. In some embodiments, p is from about 2 to about
6, 2 to about 5, or 2 to about 4 drugs per antibody. In some embodiments, p is about 2,
about 4, about 6 or about 8 drugs per antibody.
[0090]     The average number of drugs per antibody unit in a preparation from a
conjugation reaction may be characterized by conventional means such as mass
spectroscopy, ELISA assay, HIC, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of conjugates
in terms of p may also be determined.
[0091]     Exemplary antibody-drug conjugates include auristatin based antibody-drug
conjugates, i.e., conjugates wherein the drug component is an auristatin drug.
Auristatins bind tubulin, have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics and
nuclear and cellular division, and have anticancer activity. Typically the auristatin based
antibody-drug conjugate comprises a linker between the auristatin drug and the anti
CD33 antibody. The auristatins can be linked to the anti-CD33 antibody at any position
suitable for conjugation to a linker. The linker can be, for example, a cleavable linker
(e.g., a peptidyl linker) or a non-cleavable linker (e.g., linker released by degradation of
the antibody). The auristatin can be auristatin E or a derivative thereof. The auristatin
can be, for example, an ester formed between auristatin E and a keto acid. For example,
auristatin E can be reacted with paraacetyl benzoic acid or benzoylvaleric acid to produce
                                               32

AEB and AEVB, respectively. Other typical auristatins include MMAF (monomethyl
auristatin F), and MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E). The synthesis and structure of
exemplary auristatins are described in U.S. Publication Nos. 7,659,241, 7,498,298, 2009
0111756, 2009-0018086, and 7,968, 687 each of which is incorporated herein by

number of drug-linker molecules per antibody. Depending on the context, p can represent
the average number of drug-linker molecules per antibody, also referred to the average
                                                    33

drug loading. The variable p ranges from 1 to 20 and is preferably from 1 to 8. In some
preferred embodiments, when p represents the average drug loading, p ranges from about
2 to about 5. In some embodiments, p is about 2, about 3, about 4, or about 5.      In some
aspects, the antibody is conjugated to the linker via a sulfur atom of a cysteine residue.
In some aspects, the cysteine residue is one that is engineered into the antibody. In other
aspects, the cysteine residue is an interchain disulfide cysteine residue.
[0093] Exemplary antibody-drug conjugates include PBD based antibody-drug
conjugates; i.e., antibody-drug conjugates wherein the drug component is a PBD drug.
[0094] PBDs are of the general structure:

[0095] They differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic
A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B-ring
there is either an imine (N=C), a carbinolamine(NH-CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl
ether (NH-CH(OMe)) at the N10-C 11 position, which is the electrophilic center
responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)
configuration at the chiral C1 la position which provides them with a right-handed twist
when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three
dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a
snug fit at the binding site. The ability of PBDs to form an adduct in the minor groove
enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumor agents.
[0096] The biological activity of these molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD
units together through their C8/C'-hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker.
The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence-selective DNA lesions such as the
palindromic 5'-Pu-GATC-Py-3' interstrand cross-link which is thought to be mainly
responsible for their biological activity.
                                              34

[0097] In some embodiments, PBD based antibody-drug conjugates comprise a PBD
dimer linked to an anti-CD33 antibody. The monomers that form the PBD dimer can be
the same or different, i.e., symmetrical or unsymmetrical. The PBD dimer can be linked
to the anti-CD33 antibody at any position suitable for conjugation to a linker. For
example, in some embodiments, the PBD dimer will have a substituent at the C2 position
that provides an anchor for linking the compound to the anti-CD33 antibody. In
alternative embodiments, the N10 position of the PBD dimer will provide the anchor for
linking the compound to the anti-CD33 antibody.
[0098] Typically the PBD based antibody-drug conjugate comprises a linker between
the PBD drug and the anti-CD33 antibody. The linker may comprise a cleavable unit
(e.g., an amino acid or a contiguous sequence of amino acids that is a target substrate for
an enzyme) or a non-cleavable linker (e.g., linker released by degradation of the
antibody).    The linker may further comprise a maleimide group for linkage to the
antibody, e.g., maleimidocaproyl. The linker may, in some embodiments, further
comprise a self-immolative group, such as, for example, a p-aminobenzyl alcohol (PAB)
unit.
[0099]     An exemplary PBD for use as a conjugate is described in International
Application No. WO 2011/130613 and is as follows wherein the wavy line indicates the
site of attachment to the linker:

or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The drug loading is represented by p, the
number of drug-linker molecules per antibody. Depending on the context, p can represent
the average number of drug-linker molecules per antibody, also referred to the average
drug loading. The variable p ranges from 1 to 20 and is preferably from 1 to 8. In some
preferred embodiments, when p represents the average drug loading, p ranges from about
2 to about 5. In some embodiments, p is about 2, about 3, about 4, or about 5.      In some
aspects, the antibody is conjugated to the drug linker via a sulfur atom of a cysteine
residue that is engineered into the antibody. In some aspects, the cysteine residue is
engineered into the antibody at position 239 (IgGI) as determined by the EU index
(Kabat, Sequences of Proteinsof Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, 1987 and 1991).
        VI.      Other Antibodies to CD33
[0101]    As well as humanized forms of the m2H12 antibodies discussed above, other
antibodies binding to an extracellular domain of CD33 can be used in some of the
methods of the invention, particularly the treatment of cancer. Chimeric or veneered
forms of these antibodies can be made by conventional methods summarized below.
                                             36

[0102]     A chimeric antibody is an antibody in which the mature variable regions of light
and heavy chains of a non-human antibody (e.g., a mouse) are combined with human
light and heavy chain constant regions. Such antibodies substantially or entirely retain
the binding specificity of the mouse antibody, and are about two-thirds human sequence.
[0103]     A veneered antibody is a type of humanized antibody that retains some and
usually all of the CDRs and some of the non-human variable region framework residues
of a non-human antibody but replaces other variable region framework residues that may
contribute to B- or T-cell epitopes, for example exposed residues (Padlan, Mol. Immunol.
28:489, 1991) with residues from the corresponding positions of a human antibody
sequence. The result is an antibody in which the CDRs are entirely or substantially from
a non-human antibody and the variable region frameworks of the non-human antibody
are made more human-like by the substitutions.
[0104]     Any of the antibodies can be selected to have the same or overlapping epitope
specificity as an exemplar antibody, such as the m2H12 antibody, by a competitive
binding assay, such as described in the Examples, or otherwise. Preferred antibodies
have the same epitope specificity as the m2H12 antibody. Those of skill are able to
identify an epitope bound by an antibody using a variety of methods. For example, array
based oligopeptide scanning or pepscan analysis uses a library of oligo-peptide sequences
from overlapping and non-overlapping segments of a target antigen and tests for their
ability to bind the antibody of interest. See, e.g., Geysen et al., PNAS 81:3998-4002
(1984). Non-linear epitopes can be identified using, e.g., CLIPS T M technology, a
variation of array-based oligopeptide scanning. See, e.g., Timmerman et al., Open
Vaccine J. 2:56-67 (2009). The antigen protein can also be mutagenized and then use to
assess binding by the antibody of interest. The protein systematic site-directed
mutagenesis can be used or a library of mutations can be made and used to screen for
antibody binding. Mutation libraries can be purchased from, e.g., Integral Molecular.
Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS can be used to identify epitopes. Antigens of
interest are placed in deuterated water and labeled with deuterons. The protein is then
digested with a protease and the resulting peptide fragments are subjected to mass spec
analysis. The antigen is also assessed in the presence of an antibody and differences in
labeling of peptide fragments indicate areas of antibody binding.
                                              37

        VII.    Therapeutic Applications
[0105]    Antibodies derived from the murine 2H12 antibody, e.g., chimeric or
humanized antibodies, alone or as CD33 antibody drug conjugates thereof, can be used to
treat cancer. Some such cancers show detectable levels of CD33 measured at either the
protein (e.g., by immunoassay using one of the exemplified antibodies) or mRNA level.
Some such cancers show elevated levels of CD33 relative to noncancerous tissue of the
same type, preferably from the same patient. An exemplary level of CD33 on cancer
cells amenable to treatment is 5000-150000 CD33 molecules per cell, although higher or
lower levels can be treated. Optionally, a level of CD33 in a cancer is measured before
performing treatment.
[0106]    Examples of cancers associated with CD33 expression and amenable to
treatment include myeloid diseases such as, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML), other myeloproliferative disorders, including chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia and chronic myeloproliferative disorders, acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL), thrombocytic leukemia, a myelodysplastic syndrome, precursor B-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (preB-ALL), precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (preT-ALL), multiple myeloma (MM), mast cell disease including mast cell
leukemia and mast cell sarcoma, myeloid sarcomas, refractory anemia, a preleukemia
syndrome, a lymphoid leukemia, or an undifferentiated leukemia. The treatment can also
be applied to patients who are treatment naive, who are refractory to conventional
treatments (e.g., chemotherapy or MYLOTARG@ (gemtuzumab ozogamicin), or who
have relapsed following a response to such treatments.
[0107]    CD33 antibodies derived from the murine 2H12 antibody, including chimeric
antibodies or humanized antibodies such as h2H12 antibodies, can be used to treat

to treat a subject with CD33-positive undifferentiated leukemia. In a further
embodiment, the h2H12 antibody is used to treat a subject with CD33-positive
undifferentiated leukemia.     In one embodiment, a humanized antibody derived from
murine 2H12 antibody is used to treat a subject with CD33-positive precursor B-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (preB-ALL). In a further embodiment, the h2H12
antibody is used to treat a subject with CD33-positive pre-B-ALL. In one embodiment, a
humanized antibody derived from murine 2H12 antibody is used to treat a subject with
                                             39

CD33-positive precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (preT-ALL). In a further
embodiment, the h2H12 antibody is used to treat a subject with CD33-positive preT
ALL. In one embodiment, a humanized antibody derived from murine 2H12 antibody is
used to treat a subject with CD33-positive multiple myeloma (MM). In a further
embodiment, the h2H12 antibody is used to treat a subject with CD33-positive MM. In
one embodiment, a humanized antibody derived from murine 2H12 antibody is used to
treat a subject with CD33-positive mast cell disease including mast cell leukemia and
mast cell sarcoma. In a further embodiment, the h2H12 antibody is used to treat a subject
with CD33-positive mast cell disease including mast cell leukemia and mast cell
sarcoma.
[0108]    The CD33 antibody can be, for example, an unconjugated or conjugated
antibody, e.g., a CD33 antibody drug conjugate. In some embodiments, the anti-CD33
antibody can be a humanized or chimeric 2H12 antibody. In some embodiments, the anti
CD33 antibody can be an antibody that competes with a murine, humanized, or chimeric
2H12 antibody for specific binding to CD33.
[0109]    CD33 antibodies derived from murine 2H12 antibody, including chimeric
antibodies or humanized antibodies such as h2H12, can be conjugated to a therapeutic
agent and used to treat subjects with CD33-positive cancers. Examples of therapeutic
agents are provided herein, including active therapeutic agents, e.g., auristatins, and
highly active therapeutic agents, e.g., PBDs. An h2H12 antibody conjugated to an active
therapeutic agent, i.e., an h2H12 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), can be used to treat a
subject with CD33-positive cancer. An h2H12 antibody conjugated to an auristatin can
be used to treat a subject with CD33-positive cancer. An h2H12 antibody conjugated to a
highly active therapeutic agent can be used to treat a subject with CD33-positive cancer.
An h2H12 antibody conjugated to a PBD can be used to treat a subject with CD33
positive cancer.
[0110]    Some cancer cells develop resistance to a therapeutic agent after increasing
expression of a protein increases efflux of the therapeutic agent out of the cancer cell.
Such proteins include P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein, lung
resistance-related protein, and breast cancer resistance protein. Detection of drug
resistance in cancer cells can be performed by those of skill. Antibodies or assays that

detect efflux proteins are commercially available from, e.g., Promega, Millipore, Abcam,
and Sigma-Aldrich. In one embodiment, an antibody derived from a murine 2H12
antibody is used to treat a subject with a multi-drug resistant cancer, e.g., a CD33
positive multi-drug resistant cancer. In another embodiment a humanized antibody
derived from the murine 2H12 antibody is used to treat a subject with a multidrug
resistant cancer, e.g., a CD33-positive multi-drug resistant cancer. In one embodiment,
an h2H12 antibody is used to treat a subject with a multi-drug resistant cancer, e.g., a
CD33-positive multi-drug resistant cancer. In a further embodiment, an h2H12 ADC is
used to treat a subject with a multi-drug resistant cancer, e.g., a CD33-positive multi-drug
resistant cancer.   In another embodiment, an h2H12 antibody conjugated to a highly
active therapeutic agent is used to treat a subject with a multi-drug resistant cancer, e.g., a
CD33-positive multi-drug resistant cancer. In another embodiment, an h2H12 antibody
conjugated to a PBD is used to treat a subject with a multi-drug resistant cancer, e.g., a
CD33-positive multi-drug resistant cancer. In a further embodiment, an h2H12 antibody
conjugated to a PBD is used to treat a subject with a multi-drug resistant, CD33-positive
acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
[0111]    Humanized or chimeric antibodies derived from the murine 2H12 antibody,
alone or as drug-conjugates thereof, are administered in an effective regime meaning a
dosage, route of administration and frequency of administration that delays the onset,
reduces the severity, inhibits further deterioration, and/or ameliorates at least one sign or
symptom of cancer. If a patient is already suffering from cancer, the regime can be
referred to as a therapeutically effective regime. If the patient is at elevated risk of the
cancer relative to the general population but is not yet experiencing symptoms, the
regime can be referred to as a prophylactically effective regime. In some instances,
therapeutic or prophylactic efficacy can be observed in an individual patient relative to
historical controls or past experience in the same patient. In other instances, therapeutic
or prophylactic efficacy can be demonstrated in a preclinical or clinical trial in a
population of treated patients relative to a control population of untreated patients.
[0112]    Exemplary dosages for a monoclonal antibody are 0.1 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg of the
patient's body weight, more typically 1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 1
mg/kg to 15 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg, or 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kgl, or 2 mg/kg to 30
                                               41

mg/kg, 2 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg, or 2 mg/kg to
10 mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg
to 12 mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. Exemplary dosages for active monoclonal
antibody drug conjugates thereof, e.g., auristatins, are 1 mg/kg to 7.5 mg/kg, or 2 mg/kg
to 7.5 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg to 7.5 mg/kg of the subject's body weight, or 0.1-20, or 0.5-5
mg/kg body weight (e.g., 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 mg/kg) or 10-1500 or 200-1500
mg as a fixed dosage. Exemplary dosages for highly active monoclonal antibody drug
conjugates thereof, e.g., PBDs, are 1.0 pg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg, or 1.0 pg/kg to 500.0 pg/kg of
the subject's body weight. In some methods, the patient is administered then antibody or
ADC every two, three or four weeks. The dosage depends on the frequency of
administration, condition of the patient and response to prior treatment, if any, whether
the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic and whether the disorder is acute or chronic,
among other factors.
[0113]    Administration can be parenteral, intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, intra-arterial,
intracranial, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, topical, intranasal or intramuscular.
Administration can also be localized directly into a tumor. Administration into the
systemic circulation by intravenous or subcutaneous administration is preferred.
Intravenous administration can be, for example, by infusion over a period such as 30-90
min or by a single bolus injection.
[0114]    The frequency of administration depends on the half-life of the antibody or
antibody-drug conjugate in the circulation, the condition of the patient and the route of
administration among other factors. The frequency can be daily, weekly, monthly,
quarterly, or at irregular intervals in response to changes in the patient's condition or
progression of the cancer being treated. An exemplary frequency for intravenous
administration is between twice a week and quarterly over a continuous course of
treatment, although more or less frequent dosing is also possible. Other exemplary
frequencies for intravenous administration are between once weekly or once monthly
over a continuous course of treatment, although more or less frequent dosing is also
possible. For subcutaneous administration, an exemplary dosing frequency is daily to
monthly, although more or less frequent dosing is also possible.
                                                42

[0115]     The number of dosages administered depends on the nature of the cancer (e.g.,
whether presenting acute or chronic symptoms) and the response of the disorder to the
treatment. For acute disorders or acute exacerbations of a chronic disorder between 1 and
10 doses are often sufficient. Sometimes a single bolus dose, optionally in divided form,
is sufficient for an acute disorder or acute exacerbation of a chronic disorder. Treatment
can be repeated for recurrence of an acute disorder or acute exacerbation. For chronic
disorders, an antibody can be administered at regular intervals, e.g., weekly, fortnightly,
monthly, quarterly, every six months for at least 1, 5 or 10 years, or the life of the patient.
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration are preferably sterile and
substantially isotonic and manufactured under GMP conditions. Pharmaceutical
compositions can be provided in unit dosage form (i.e., the dosage for a single
administration). Pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated using one or more
physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or auxiliaries. The formulation
depends on the route of administration chosen. For injection, antibodies can be
formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as
Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline or acetate buffer (to reduce
discomfort at the site of injection). The solution can contain formulatory agents such as
suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively antibodies can be in
lyophilized form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water,
before use. The concentration of antibody in a liquid formulation can be e.g., .01-10
mg/ml, such as 1.0 mg/ml.
[0116]     Treatment with antibodies of the invention can be combined with
chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell treatment, surgery other treatments effective against
the disorder being treated. Useful classes of other agents that can be administered with
humanized antibodies to CD33 include, for example, antibodies to other receptors
expressed on cancerous cells, antitubulin agents (e.g., auristatins), DNA minor groove
binders (e.g., PBDs), DNA replication inhibitors, alkylating agents (e.g., platinum
complexes such as cis-platin, mono(platinum), bis(platinum) and tri-nuclear platinum
complexes and carboplatin), anthracyclines, antibiotics, antifolates, antimetabolites,
chemotherapy sensitizers, duocarmycins, etoposides, fluorinated pyrimidines,
ionophores, lexitropsins, nitrosoureas, platinols, pre-forming compounds, purine
                                              43

antimetabolites, puromycins, radiation sensitizers, steroids, taxanes, topoisomerase
inhibitors, vinca alkaloids, and the like.
[0117]    Treatment with an antibody derived from murine 2H12 antibody, e.g., a
chimeric antibody, a humanized antibody, or the h2H12 antibody, optionally in
combination with any of the other agents or regimes described above alone or as an
antibody drug conjugate, can increase the median progression-free survival or overall
survival time of patients with cancer (e.g., ALL, CML, CMML), especially when
relapsed or refractory, by at least 30% or 40% but preferably 50%, 60% to 70% or even
100% or longer, compared to the same treatment (e.g., chemotherapy) but without the
antibody derived from murine 2H12 antibody, alone or as an antibody-drug conjugate. In
addition or alternatively, treatment (e.g., standard chemotherapy) including the antibody
derived from murine 2H12 antibody, alone or as an antibody-drug conjugate, can increase
the complete response rate, partial response rate, or objective response rate (complete +
partial) of patients with tumors by at least 30% or 40% but preferably 50%, 60% to 70%
or even 100% compared to the same treatment (e.g., chemotherapy) but without the
antibody derived from murine 2H12 antibody.
[0118]    Typically, in a clinical trial (e.g., a phase II, phase 11/111 or phase III trial), the
aforementioned increases in median progression-free survival and/or response rate of the
patients treated with standard therapy plus the antibody derived from murine 2H12
antibody, relative to the control group of patients receiving standard therapy alone (or
plus placebo), are statistically significant, for example at the p = 0.05 or 0.01 or even
0.001 level. The complete and partial response rates are determined by objective criteria
commonly used in clinical trials for cancer, e.g., as listed or accepted by the National
Cancer Institute and/or Food and Drug Administration.
         VIII. Other Applications
[0119]    The anti-CD33 antibodies disclosed herein can be used for detecting CD33 in
the context of clinical diagnosis or treatment or in research. Expression of CD33 on a
cancer provides an indication that the cancer is amenable to treatment with the antibodies
of the present invention. The antibodies can also be sold as research reagents for
laboratory research in detecting cells bearing CD33 and their response to various stimuli.
                                                 44

In such uses, monoclonal antibodies can be labeled with fluorescent molecules, spin
labeled molecules, enzymes or radioisotypes, and can be provided in the form of kit with
all the necessary reagents to perform the assay for CD33. The antibodies described
herein, m2h12 and chimeric or humanized versions thereof, e.g., h2H12, can be used to
detect CD33 protein expression and determine whether a cancer is amenable to treatment
with CD33 ADCs. As an example, murine 2H12 and chimeric or humanized versions
thereof, e.g., h2H12, can be used to detect CD33 expression on lymphocytes,
lymphoblasts, monocytes, myelomonocytes or other CD33-expressing cells. The
antibodies can also be used to purify CD33 protein, e.g., by affinity chromatography.
[0120]    Any feature, step, element, embodiment, or aspect of the invention can be used
in combination with any other unless specifically indicated otherwise. Although the
present invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example
for purposes of clarity and understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and
modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
                                       EXAMPLES
I. Generation of anti-CD33 antibodies
Materials
[0121] Cell lines described in the following examples were maintained in culture
according to the conditions specified by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
(Manassas, VA) or the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen
GmbH (DSMZ), (Braunschweig, Germany). Primary AML cells were maintained in
Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) containing 20% heat-inactivated FBS,
supplemented with 25 ng/ml each of granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) and
stem cell factor (SCF). Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen Corp
(Carlsbad, CA) and cytokines were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ).
Methodologies:
Saturation binding assays
[0122] One hundred thousand CD33-positive cells (HL-60, HEL 92.1.7, and HEK-293F
cells transfected to express human or cynomologus CD33) were transferred to 96-well
                                             45

plates. AlexaFluor-647 labeled CD33 mAb was added in concentrations ranging from 50
nM to 0.85 pM and the cells incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were pelleted by
centrifugation, washed 3 times with a PBS + 1% BSA solution, and resuspended in 125
[tL of PBS + 1% BSA. Fluorescence was analyzed using a flow cytometer, and the
percent of saturated fluorescent signal was used to determine percent bound and to
subsequently calculate apparent Kd.
Competition binding assays
[0123] One hundred thousand CD33-positive cells were transferred to 96-well plates and
incubated for 1 hour on ice with 1 nM AlexaFluor-647 labeled m2H12 and increasing
concentrations (from 0.03 nM to 600 nM) of unlabeled hybrid, humanized or chimeric
2H12 mAb. Cells were centrifuged, washed 3 times with PBS, and resuspended in 125
[tL of a PBS+ 1% BSA solution. Fluorescence was analyzed using a flow cytometer, and
the percent of saturated fluorescent signal was used to determine percent labeled 2H12
mAb bound. The EC50 was extrapolated by fitting the data to a sigmoidal dose-response
curve with variable slope.
Cytotoxicity assay
[0124] AML cell lines or primary AML cells were treated with CD33-specific mAb and
antibody drug conjugates (ADC) for 96 hours at 37 0 C. In some experiments, non-antigen
binding ADC were included as negative controls. Cell viability for the cell lines was
measured using CelltiterGlo (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 25 minutes at room temperature
with the CelltiterGlo reagents and luminescence was measured on a Fusion HT
fluorescent plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). For the primary AML cells,
viability was measured by flow cytometry using Annexin V and propidium iodide
staining. Results are reported as IC50, the concentration of compound needed to yield a
50% reduction in viability compared to vehicle-treated cells (control = 100%).
Production of antibody drug conjugates
[0125] Antibody drug conjugates of the CD33 antibodies were prepared as described in
US20050238649 and W02011/130613using the anti-CD33 antibodies described herein.
The drug linker SGD-1269 (mcMMAF) is described in US20050238649 and the drug
linker SGD-1910 is described W02011/130613. Preparation of cysteine mutants of IgGI
mAb is generally described in US20100158909. The drug-linker SGD-1269 was
                                             46

conjugated to the anti-CD33 antibody h2H12 via a thiol group of a cysteine residue of an
interchain disulfide bond and the average drug load was about 4 drugs per antibody. The
drug-linker SGD-1910 was conjugated to the anti-CD33 antibody via a thiol group of a
cysteine residue introduced at position 239 of the IgGI chain of the antibody and the
average drug load was about 2 drugs per antibody. Antibodies with cysteine at the 239
position carry the designation EC, e.g., h2H12EC or h00EC
In Vivo Activity Study
Disseminated AML model
[0126] CB-17/IcrHsd-PrkdcSCID (SCID) mice were inoculated intravenously with 5x106
HL-60 tumor cells in the tail vein. One day post tumor inoculation, mice (n= 8/group)
were untreated or dosed intraperitoneally every four days for a total of two doses with
CD33 mAb and ADC or non-binding control mAb and ADC. Mylotarg dosed
intraperitoneally every seven days for a total of two doses was included as a positive
control in this Mylotarg-sensitive AML model. Animals were euthanized when body
weight loss was >20%, or when mice showed signs of disseminated disease manifested as
central nervous system symptoms that included cranial swelling and/or hind limb
paralysis, or development of a palpable disseminated tumor mass.
Subcutaneous AML models
[0127] SCID mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 5x106 HL-60 or TF1-a AML
tumor cells. Tumor growth was monitored with calipers and the mean tumor volume was
calculated using the formula (0.5 x [length x width2]). When the mean tumor volume
reached approximately 100 mm3 , mice (n=6-7/group) were untreated or dosed
intraperitoneally with a single dose of CD33 ADC or non-binding control ADC. For the
HL-60 model, mice were treated with human IVIg (single intraperitoneal injection of 10
mg/kg) approximately four hours prior to administration of the therapeutic antibody to
minimize interaction of the test ADC with Fc receptors on AML cells. Mice were
euthanized when tumor volumes reached approximately 1000 mm3 . All animal
procedures were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.

Results
1. Generation of murine CD33 mAb
[0128] Antibodies directed against the human CD33 antigen were generated in Balb/c
mice by immunization with recombinant human CD33-Fc fusion protein. The murine
mAb 2H12 (m2H12) was selected based upon binding affinity for human CD33 and
cynomologus CD33 to permit preclinical testing in nonhuman primates.
2. Design and testing of humanized antibodies
[0129] Humanized antibodies were derived from the murine 2H12 antibody. Nine
humanized heavy chains (HA-HI) and seven humanized light chains (LA-LG) were made
incorporating back mutations at different positions. See, Figures 1A, B a sequence
alignment and Tables 1-4.

[0130] Humanized heavy and light chains were paired with chimeric light and heavy
chains (chimeric chains composed of murine variable regions and human constant

tested for binding to human CD33 expressed on the surface of HEL 92.1.7 AML cells
(Table 5). Heavy chains HC and HI were selected for further study. Humanized
antibodies were expressed representing permutations of humanized heavy chains HC and
HI and humanized light chains LA, LE and LG and binding to cells expressing human or
cynomolgus (cyno) CD33 was determined (Table 6). The HILG antibody (2H12 HILG)
was selected as the humanized antibody that most closely resembled the binding
characteristics of the murine CD33 mAb m2H12. The HILG antibody is referred to as the
h2H12 antibody (human 2H12 antibody). The     KD for m2H12, h2H12, and h2H12 with
                                           49

an S239C mutation (EU numbering) in the IgGI heavy chain (referred to as h2H12EC,
for engineered cysteine), was determined for human CD33 expressed as an endogenous
protein in two AML cell lines or as a recombinant protein in a HEK293F cell line. The
KD  for these antibodies was also determined for cyno CD33 expressed as a recombinant
protein in a HEK293F cell line (Table 7).

In Vitro Anti-tumor Activity of h2H12 ADC
[0131] The cytotoxic activity of h2H12 antibody-drug conjugates was tested using two
drug linker systems, SGD-1269 (auristatin drug-linker) and SGD-1910
(pyrrolobenzodiazapine dimer drug-linker). A cytotoxicity assay was performed against
two CD33-positive AML cell lines, HL-60 and HEL 92.1.7, using unconjugated
antibody, h2H12- ADCs and control ADCs that do not bind to CD33. As shown in
Figure 2, h2H12 and h2H12EC (also referred to as h2H12d) unconjugated antibodies had
no activity against either cell line. Likewise, the non-binding control ADCs (hOOEC
SGD-1910 and hOO-SGD-1269) were not cytotoxic. In contrast, h2H12EC-SGD-1910
was cytotoxic towards HL-60 (IC50 ~ 1.6 ng/mL) and HEL 92.1.7 (IC50 -12.9 ng/mL).
The activity of the h2H12EC-SGD-1910 was similar to that of Mylotarg, a well described
anti-CD33 directed antibody drug conjugate, on HL-60 cells and more potent when tested
against HEL 92.1.7 (a multi-drug resistant (MDR) cell line), where Mylotarg is
ineffective. m2H12-SGD-1269 and h2H12-SGD-1269 were active against HL-60 cells
(IC50 of 1.3 ng/mL and 5.3 ng/mL respectively) and to a lesser extent HEL 92.1.7
(Figure 2). In separate experiments, h2H12-SGD-1269 and h2H12EC-SGD-1910 were
further tested against an expanded panel of CD33-positive AML cell lines. As shown in
Table 8, h2H12-SGD-1269 was active against 4 of 7 AML cell lines (mean IC50 for
responsive cell lines, 72.8 mg/mL), and h2H12EC-SGD-1910 had potent activity against
7 of 7 AML cell lines tested (mean IC50, 20.4 ng/mL). h2H12EC-SGD-1910 was more
potent than Mylotarg, which was active in 3 of 8 CD33-positive AML cell lines. No
activity was observed when the ADCs were tested against three cell lines that were not of
AML origin and did not express CD33 (Table 8). Altogether, these data demonstrate that
h2H12 and h2H12EC antibody drug conjugates selectively target CD33-positive cells and
display cytotoxic activity towards those cells.

In Vivo Anti-Tumor Activity of h2H12 ADC
[0132] The activity of h2H12-SGD-1269 was tested in a model in which the HL-60 AML
cell line was introduced into SCID mice to initiate disseminated disease. Mice were
treated the next day with h2H12 antibody, non-specific IVIg negative control antibody,
h2H12-SGD-1269, a non-binding control ADC (hBU12-SGD-1269) or Mylotarg
according to the dose levels and schedule described in Table 9. The median survival of
HL-60-innoculated mice increased from 22 days in the untreated or human IVIg-treated
groups to 29 days (p=0.007), 41 days (p=0.001) and 52 days (p< 0.001) in groups
receiving h2H12 (3 mg/kg) and 1 or 3 mg/kg h2H12-SGD-1269 respectively (Table 9).
h2H12EC-SGD-1269 prolonged survival similar to that of mice dosed with h2H12-SGD
1269 (median survival of 50 and 52 days respectively). Mylotarg was also active in this
MDR-negative model; greater than 50% of the Mylotarg-treated mice survived to the end
of the study on day 99. Survival of mice treated with the unconjugated antibody h2H12
or the non-binding control ADC (hBU12-SGD-1269) was prolonged 6-7 days compared
                                                    52

to untreated control mice, but to a much lesser extent than mice treated with the CD33
targeted ADC.

[0133] The activity of h2H12EC-SGD- 1910 was tested in two subcutaneous AML
xenograft models, HL-60 and TF1-a. SCID mice bearing established (- 100mm 3) tumors
were dosed with h2H12EC-SGD-1910 or non-binding control ADC (h00EC-SGD-19 10)
as described in Table 10 for the HL-60 model and in Table 11 for the TF1-catumor model.
Treatment with h2H12EC-SGD-1910 significantly decreased tumor growth compared to
untreated and non-binding control ADC-treated mice as measured by the median time for
tumors to quadruple in volume (Tables 10 and 11). The anti-tumor activity observed
with CD33-targeted ADC was dose dependent. For HL-60 tumors, a single dose of 0.1
mg/kg resulted in complete and durable tumor regression in 6 of 6 treated mice. A lower
dose of 0.03 mg/kg resulted in complete regression in 1 of 6 treated mice and extended
the time to tumor quadrupling to 20 days compared to 15 days for untreated mice and
those similarly dosed with the non-binding control ADC (hOOd-SGD-1910). In the
MDR-positive TF1-catumor model (Table 11), a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg h2H12EC
SGD-1910 resulted in complete and durable tumor regression in 5 of 7 treated mice. The
median day to tumor quadrupling had not been reached by the end of the study on day
117. In contrast, the tumors in mice similarly dosed with the non-binding control ADC
                                                       53

(hOOEC-SGD-1910) had quadrupled in volume by 27 days. Likewise, the median time
for tumors to quadruple in mice dosed with 0.1 mg/kg or 0.03 mg/kg h2H12EC-SGD
1910 was significantly longer (p=0.0001) than that of untreated or hOOEC-SGD-1910
treated mice. Mylotarg was not active in the TF1-a tumor model; tumor growth of
Mylotarg-treated mice was not different than untreated mice. Taken together, the data
demonstrate that h2H12-ADC show anti-tumor activity in AML xenograft models that is
dose-dependent and significantly greater than non-targeted ADC.
