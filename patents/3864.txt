20  [00031    The present invention provides methods for determining the selectivity of an
    anesthetic for an anesthetic-sensitive receptor by determining the molar water solubility of
    the anesthetic. The invention further provides methods for modulating the selectivity of an
    anesthetic for an anesthetic-sensitive receptor by altering or modifying the anesthetic to have
    higher or lower water solubility. The invention further provides methods of inducing
25  anesthesia in a subject by administering via the respiratory pathways (e.g., via inhalational or
    pulmonary delivery) an effective amount of an anesthetic compound identified according to
    the present methods.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
30   [00041   Molecular mechanisms of anesthetic action
     [00051   All general anesthetics in common clinical use modulate either three
    transmembrane (TM3) ion channels (e.g., NMDA receptors), four-transmembrane (TM4) ion
                                                     1

    channels (e.g., GABAA receptors), or members of both ion channel superfamilies. Sonner, et
    al., Anesth Analg (2003) 97:718-40. For example, many structurally unrelated inhaled
    anesthetics potentiate GABAA currents and inhibit NMDA currents. But why should a
    diverse group of compounds all modulate unrelated ion channels? A highly specific "induced
 5  fit" model between protein and ligand, as proposed for enzyme-substrate binding, (Koshland,
    ProcNatlAcadSci USA 1958; 44: 98-104) is problematic since it implies the conservation
    of specific binding sites across non-homologous proteins to compounds (i.e., anesthetics) not
    found in nature. Sonner, Anesth Analg (2008) 107: 849-54. Moreover, promiscuous
    anesthetic actions on disparate receptors typically occurs at drug concentrations 50-200 times
10  the median effective concentration (EC50) at which modulation of a single receptor class
    typically occurs, such as with etomidate agonism of GABAA receptors (Tomlin et al.,
    Anesthesiology (1998) 88: 708-17; Hill-Venning, et al., Br JPharmacol(1997) 120: 749-56;
    Belelli, et al., Br JPharmacol(1996) 118: 563-76; Quast, et al., JNeurochem (1983) 41:418

    40. It is unknown what molecular properties confer specificity for a single receptor (or
    members of a single receptor superfamily) and what properties allow other anesthetics to
    modulate multiple unrelated receptors. However, since ion channel modulation is important
20  to conferring desirable anesthetic efficacy-as well as undesirable drug side effects-it is
     desirable to know what factors influence anesthetic receptor specificity in order to develop
     new and safer agents.
     [00061    Anesthetics and specific ion channel targets
     [0007]    General anesthetics mediate central nervous system depression through actions on
25   cell membrane receptors and channels which have a net hyperpolarizing effect on neurons.

     Trends PharmacolSci (2005) 26: 503-10; and Forman, et al., Int Anesthesiol Clin (2008) 46:
     43-53. Although anesthetics partition into cell membranes as a function of lipid solubility, it
30   is through competitive protein binding that these agents most likely produce anesthetic
     effects. In fact, general anesthetics have been shown to competitively inhibit functions of
     membrane-free enzymes (Franks, et al., Nature (1984) 310: 599-601), indicating that the lipid
     phase is not essential for anesthetic modulation of protein function. Specific high-affinity

    binding sites have been identified for some of these anesthetics. For example, propofol
    (Jewett, et al., Anesthesiology (1992) 77: 1148-54; Bieda, et al., JNeurophysiol (2004) 92:

    O'Meara, et al., Neuroreport(2004) 15: 1653-6), and thiopental (Jewett, et al.,
    Anesthesiology (1992) 77: 1148-54; Bieda, et al, JNeurophysiol(2004) 92: 1658-67; Yang,
    et al., Anesth Analg (2006) 102: 1114-20) all potently potentiate GABAA receptor currents,
    and their anesthetic effects are potently antagonized or prevented by GABAA receptor
10  antagonists, such as pictotoxin or bicuculline. Ketamine produces anesthesia largely (but not
    entirely) through its antagonism of NMDA receptors. Harrison et al., Br JPharmacol(1985)
    84: 381-91; Yamamura, et al., Anesthesiology (1990) 72: 704-10; and Kelland, et al., Physiol
    Behav (1993) 54: 547-54. Dexmedetomidine is a specific a2 adrenoreceptor agonist that is
    antagonized by specific a2 adrenoreceptor antagonists, such as atipamezole. Doze, et al.,
15  Anesthesiology (1989) 71: 75-9; Karhuvaara, et al., BrJClinPharmacol(1991) 31: 160-5;
    and Correa-Sales, et al., Anesthesiology (1992) 76: 948-52. It is probably not by coincidence
    that anesthetics for which a single receptor contributes to most or all of the anesthetic effect
    also have low aqueous ED50 values (see, Table 1).

    [0008]      Ion channel mutations, either in vitro or in vivo, dramatically alter anesthetic
    sensitivity, not only for the very potent and specific agents, but also for the inhaled
    anesthetics. Several mutations in the GABAA (Hara, et al., Anesthesiology 2002; 97: 1512

10  2006; 105: 297-304) or NMDA (Ogata, et al., JPharmacolExp Ther (2006) 318: 434-43;
    Dickinson, et al., Anesthesiology 2007; 107: 756-67) receptor can decrease responses to
    isoflurane, halothane, and other volatile anesthetics. Although mutations that render
    receptors insensitive to anesthetics could suggest a single site that is responsible for binding a
    specific drug, it need not be the case. Most of these mutations are believed to reside near
15  lipid-water interfaces, either in amphiphilic protein pockets (Bertaccini et al., Anesth Analg
    (2007) 104: 318-24; Franks, et al., Nat Rev Neurosci (2008) 9: 370-86) or near the outer lipid
    membrane. It is possible that an anesthetic could be excluded from its protein interaction site
    because of size. However, it is also possible that the mutation substantially increases (but
    does not entirely exclude) the number of "non-specific" low-affinity anesthetic-protein
20  interactions necessary to modulate the receptor. In this case, modulation of the mutant
    receptor will either only occur at anesthetic concentrations in excess of the wild-type
    minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) (Eger, et al., Anesthesiology (1965) 26: 756-63) or,
     if the drug is insufficiently soluble at the active site to allow a sufficient number of "non
                                                                                                    even at
     specific" interactions with the mutant protein, no receptor modulation will be possible
25   saturating aqueous drug concentrations.
     [00091      Another argument for specific "induced fit" binding sites on ion channels is the
     "cut-off' effect. For example, increasing the carbon chain length of an alkanol increases lipid
     solubility and anesthetic potency, as predicted by the Meyer-Overton hypothesis (Overton
     CE: Studies of Narcosis. London, Chapman and Hall, 1991), until a 12-carbon chain length
                                                        4

   WO 2014/011235                                                                  PCT/US2013/031668
                                                                                                     a
    (dodecanol) is reached (Alifimoff, et al., Br JPharmacol(1989) 96: 9-16). Alkanols with
    longer chain length were not anesthetics (hence, a "cut-off" effect at C=13 carbons).
    However, the hydrocarbon chain length needed to reach the cut-off effect is C=9 for alkanes
    (Liu, et al., Anesth Analg (1993) 77: 12-8), C=2 for perfluorinated alkanes (Liu, et al., Anesth
 5  Analg (1994) 79: 23 8-44), and C=3 for perfluorinated methyl ethyl ethers (Koblin, et al.,
    Anesth Analg (1999) 88: 1161-7). If size is essential to access a specific anesthetic binding
    site, then why is the "cut-off" chain length not constant? At the cellular level, straight-chain
    alcohols can maximally inhibit NMDA receptor function up to octanol with complete cut-off
    at C= 10. But straight-chain 1, Cl-diols maximally inhibit NMDA receptors up to decanol,
10  with complete cut-off not observed until C=16 (Peoples, et al., Mol Pharmacol(2002) 61:
     169-76). Increasing hydrocarbon chain length does not only increase molecular volume, but
    also decreases water solubility. The cut-off effect therefore refers to a minimum water
    solubility necessary to produce an effect, rather than a maximum molecular size.
     [0010]     Anesthetics and low-affinity "non-specific" ion channel effects
15   [00111     At the tens of micromolar concentrations or less, anesthetics most likely exert their
    effects on ion channels by specific binding to relatively high-affinity sites on proteins to
     induce a conformational change that alters ion conductance, either alone or in the presence of
     another endogenous ligand. However, these agents can still interact with other receptors (or
    the same receptor at different sites) if present in higher concentrations. For example, assume
20   that two dissimilar receptors (RI and R2) each can exert an anesthetic effect. Assuming that
     efficacy of a drug at R1 =1, that RI is able to produce a full anesthetic effect in isolation, and
     that the EC99 of RI is less than the EC 1 of R2, then this drug will produce anesthesia by
     selectively modulating RI. However, if any of these assumptions is not true, then some
     contribution of R2 will be required to produce an anesthetic effect (Figure 1).
25   [0012]     Many injectable anesthetics seem to follow the example described above. Propofol
     is a positive modulator of GABAA receptor currents with an EC50 around 60pM (Hill
     Venning, et al., Br JPharmacol(1997) 120: 749-56; Prince, et al., Biochem Pharmacol
     (1992) 44: 1297-302; Orser, et al., JNeurosci(1994) 14: 7747-60; Reynolds, et al., Eur J
     Pharmacol(1996) 314: 151-6), and propofol is believed to mediate the majority of its
30   anesthetic effects through potentiation of GABAA currents (Sonner, et al,Anesth Analg
     (2003) 96: 706-12). However, propofol also inhibits currents from the unrelated NMDA
     receptor with an IC50 of 160 gM (Orser, et al., Br JPharmacol(1995) 116: 1761-8).
                                                       5

   WO 2014/011235                                                                   PCT/US2013/031668
    Ketamine produces anesthesia largely through antagonism of NMDA receptors, which it
    inhibits with an IC50 of 14 pM (Liu, et al., Anesth Analg (2001) 92: 1173-81), although
    365 pM ketamine also increases unrelated 4 transmembrane GABAA receptor currents by
                                                                                       it seems
    56% (Lin, et al., JPharmacolExp Ther (1992) 263: 569-78). In these cases,
                                                                                 responses) could
 5  plausible that 2 different types of interactions (for high- vs. low-affinity
    occur on a single receptor to produce the same qualitative effect. In contrast, volatile inhaled
    anesthetics generally have little or no effect on GABAA and NMDA receptors at aqueous
    phase concentrations <50 pM (Lin, et al., JPharmacolExp Ther (1992) 263: 569-78; Moody,
    et al., Brain Res (1993) 615: 101-6; Harris, et al., JPharmacolExp Ther (1993) 265: 1392-8;
10  Jones, et al., JPhysiol(1992) 449: 279-93; Hall, et al., Br JPharmacol(1994) 112: 906-10).
     It is possible that these agents are not specific ligands for any anesthetic-sensitive receptor
     that is relevant to immobility; thus they may rely only on nonspecific protein-ligand
     interactions that, in turn, may be reflected in the higher aqueous phase concentrations of these
     agents required for anesthesia (Table 1).

                                                                                         that are
    agent. Anesthetic-sensitive receptors are usually ion channels or cell membrane
    indirectly linked to ion channels via second messenger systems (such as G-proteins and
                                                                                             can be

    comprised of 2 or more subunits and function as part of a protein complex. Activation
    inhibition of these receptors results in either a direct change in ion permeability across the
    cell membrane that alters the cell resting membrane potential, or alters the response of the
    cell receptor to its endogenous ligand in such a way that the change in ion permeability and
10  cell membrane potential normally elicited by the endogenous ligand is changed. Exemplary
     anesthetic-sensitive receptors include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors,
    N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, voltage-gated sodium ion channels, voltage-gated
     potassium ion channels, two-pore domain potassium channels, adrenergic receptors,

    [0035]     The phrase "cause to be administered" refers to the actions taken by a medical
    professional (e.g., a physician), or a person controlling medical care of a subject, that control
    and/or permit the administration of the agent(s)/compound(s) at issue to the subject. Causing
    to be administered can involve diagnosis and/or determination of an appropriate therapeutic
 5  or prophylactic regimen, and/or prescribing particular agent(s)/compounds for a subject.
    Such prescribing can include, for example, drafting a prescription form, annotating a medical
    record, and the like.
     [0036]    The terms "patient," "individual," "subject" interchangeably refer to any mammal,
    e.g., a human or non-human mammal, e.g., a non-human primate, a domesticated mammal
10  (e.g., canine, feline), an agricultural mammal (e.g., equine, bovine, ovine, porcine), or a
     laboratory mammal (e.g., rattus, murine, lagomorpha, hamster).
     [0037]    The term "molar water solubility" refers to the calculated or measured number of
    moles per liter of a compound present at a saturated concentration in pure water at 25*C and
     at pH=7.0.
15   [00381    The term "solubility cut-off value" refers to the threshold water solubility
     concentration of an anesthetic compound that can activate a particular anesthetic-sensitive
     receptor. If the water solubility of the anesthetic agent is below the solubility cut-off value
     for a particular anesthetic-sensitive receptor, then the agent will not activate that receptor. If
     the water solubility of the anesthetic agent is above the solubility cut-off value for a particular
20   anesthetic-sensitive receptor, then the agent can, but need not, activate that receptor.
     [0039]    The term "alkyl", by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise
     stated, a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical, having the number of carbon atoms
     designated (i.e. C1 8 means one to eight carbons). Examples of alkyl groups include methyl,
     ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl,
25   n-octyl, and the like. For each of the definitions herein (e.g., alkyl, alkoxy, alkylamino,
     alkylthio, alkylene, haloalkyl), when a prefix is not included to indicate the number of main
     chain carbon atoms in an alkyl portion, the radical or portion thereof will have 24 or fewer,
     for example, 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6 or fewer, main chain carbon atoms.
     [00401     The term "alkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means an unsaturated
30   hydrocarbon chain containing 1 or more carbon-carbon double bonds. Typically, an alkyl (or

    example, bicyclo[2.2. 1]heptane, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, etc. When a prefix is not included
    indicate the number of ring carbon atoms in a cycloalkyl, the radical or portion thereof will
    have 8 or fewer ring carbon atoms.
10  [0042]    The terms "alkoxy," "alkylamino" and "alkylthio" (or thioalkoxy) are used in their
    conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule
    via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively. Additionally, for
    dialkylamino groups, the alkyl portions can be the same or different and can also be
    combined to form a 3 to 8 membered ring with the nitrogen atom to which each is attached.
15  Accordingly, a group represented as --NRRb is meant to include piperidinyl, pyrrolidinyl,

    wherein one to five heteroatoms or heteroatom functional groups have replaced a ring carbon,
    while retaining aromatic properties, e.g., pyridyl, quinolinyl, quinazolinyl, thienyl, and the
 5  like. The heteroatoms are selected from N, 0, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms
    are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl
    group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom. Non-limiting
    examples of aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl and biphenyl, while non-limiting examples
    of heteroaryl groups include pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimindinyl, triazinyl,

     aryl, when used in combination with other radicals (e.g., aryloxy, arylalkyl) is meant to
     include both aryl groups and heteroaryl groups as described above.

10  [0048]    Figure 1 illustrates a diagram showing the effect of drug dose on the percent
    contribution to MAC of 2 anesthetic-sensitive receptors (RI and R2). The drug shows high
    affinity for R 1, but is unable to produce an anesthetic effect by itself. A small contribution
    from low-affinity interactions with R2 is necessary to produce a 100% anesthetic effect
    (MAC).

    conventional and experimental agents modulate members of 4-transmembrane ion channels
    (e.g., y-aminobutyric acid Type A or GABAA receptors, glycine receptors, and nicotinic
    acetylcholine receptors) and 3-transmembrane ion channels (e.g., N-methyl-d-aspartate or
    NMDA receptors). However, agents with low molar water solubility fail to modulate 3
20  tranamembrane receptors.
    [00501     Figure 3 illustrates sample two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from oocytes
    expressing either GABAA receptors (left) or NMDA receptors (right). Black bars (-)
    represent periods of agonist exposure, and arrows (*+) represent periods of saturated alkane
    exposure. Both butane and pentane positively modulate GABAA receptors. Butane
25  negatively modulates NMDA receptors, but pentane produces no effect. Hence, NMDA
    receptors exhibit an alkane cut-off between butane and pentane.
     [0051]    Figure 4 illustrates a summary of receptor cut-off effects as a function of molar
    water solubility. For each hydrocarbon functional group, white bars represent compounds
    that modulate both GABAA and NMDA receptors, and black bars represent compounds that
30  modulate GABAA receptors but have no effect on NMDA receptors at a saturating
     concentration. Intervening grey bars represent solubility values for which no data exist.

       I.    Introduction
     [0055]     The present invention is based, in part, on the surprising discovery that the
     specificity of an anesthetic for an anesthetic-sensitive receptor can be modulated (e.g.,
     increased or decreased) by altering the water solubility of the anesthetic. Based on the
20  threshold solubility cut-off values for different families of anesthetic-sensitive receptors,
     anesthetics can be designed to activate subsets of receptors with a water solubility cut-off
     value that is less than the water solubility of the anesthetic, while not activating receptors
     with a water solubility cut-off value that is greater than the water solubility of the anesthetic.
     Generally, anesthetics with a relatively higher water solubility activate a larger number of
25   anesthetic-sensitive receptors; anesthetics with a relatively lower water solubility activate
     fewer anesthetic-sensitive receptors. The present discovery finds use in determining the
     specificity of a particular anesthetic for different anesthetic-sensitive receptors, e.g., by
     comparing the water solubility of the anesthetic with the threshold solubility cut-off values of
     different anesthetic-sensitive receptors. The present discovery also finds use in guiding the
30   rational chemical modification or derivitization of an anesthetic to adjust its water solubility
     and specificity for different anesthetic-sensitive receptors.

   WO 2014/011235                                                                 PCT/US2013/031668
    [00561    Some anesthetics bind with high affinity (low EC50) to either 4-transmembrane
    receptors (i.e., GABAA) or 3-transmembrane receptors (i.e., NMDA), but not to members of
    both receptor superfamilies. However, drugs with sufficient amphipathic properties can
    modulate members of both receptor superfamilies; this is true not only for ketamine and
 5  propofol, but for many conventional and experimental anesthetics (Figure 2). Based the
    information in Figure 2, sufficient water solubility appears sufficient to allow modulation of
    phylogenetically unrelated receptor superfamilies. Further, Figure 2 would suggest that
    compounds with a molar solubility less than approximately 1mM exhibit receptor
    superfamily specificity, but compounds with greater molar aqueous solubility can modulate
10  3- and 4-transmembrane receptors, if applied in sufficient concentrations. The importance of
    aqueous anesthetic concentration to mediate low-affinity ion channel effects explains why
    receptor point mutations near water cavities in proteins or near the plasma membrane
    extracellular interface can dramatically affect sensitivity to volatile anesthetics (Lobo, et al.,
    Neuropharmacology(2006) 50: 174-81). In addition, the anesthetic cut-off effect with
15  increasing hydrocarbon chain length may be due to an insufficient molar water solubility of
    large hydrophobic molecules (Katz, et al., J Theor Biol (2003) 225: 341-9). In effect, this
    may not be a size cut-off, but a solubility cut-off.
    [0057]    Anesthetics do not distribute equally throughout the lipid bilayer. Halothane shows
    a preference for the phospholipid headgroup interface (Vemparala, et al., Biophys J (2006)
20  91: 2815-25). Xenon atoms prefer regions at the lipid-water interface and the central region
    of the bilayer (Stimson, et al., Cell Mol Biol Lett (2005) 10: 563-9). The anesthetics
    cyclopropane, nitrous oxide, desflurane, isoflurane, and 1,1,2-trifluoroethane (TFE) all
    preferentially concentrate at the interface between water and hexane (Pohorille et al., Toxicol
    Lett (1998) 100-101: 421-30). However, perfluoroethane, a compound structurally similar to
25  TFE, does not exhibit an hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfacial maxima, and it is both poorly
    soluble in water and a nonimmobilizer (Pohorille, supra). It has been hypothesized that
    accumulation of amphipathic anesthetics at the lipid-water interface may decrease surface
    tension (Wustneck, et al., Langmuir (2007) 23: 1815-23) and reduce the lateral pressure
    profile of the membrane phospholipids (Terama, et al., JPhys Chem B (2008) 112: 4131-9).
30  This could alter the hydration status of membrane proteins (Ho, et al., Biophys J (1992) 63:
    897-902), and thus alter conduction through ion channels. It is possible that the "anesthetic
    sensitivity" of certain channels may simply be a marker of receptors that are subject to
    modulation by interfacial hydrophilic interactions.
                                                    25

   WO 2014/011235                                                                  PCT/US2013/031668
    [00581    However, there is no reason to presume that the same number of hydrophilic or
    hydrophobic anesthetic interactions should be identical for dissimilar ion channels. The
    2-transmembrane (e.g., P2X, P2Z receptors), 3-transmembrane (e.g., AMPA, kainite, and
    NMDA receptors), 4-transmembrane (nACh, 5-HT 3, GABAA, GABAc, and glycine
 5  receptors), and 7-transmembrane (G-protein coupled receptors) superfamilies are
    phylogenetically unrelated (Foreman JC, Johansen T: Textbook of Receptor Pharmacology,
    2nd Edition. Boca Raton, CRC Press, 2003). Hence, it seems likely that the number of
    anesthetic molecules at the lipid water interface necessary to modulate a receptor should be
    different for members of different superfamilies, but more similar for channels within the
10  same superfamily since these share greater sequence homology.
    [0059]    If non-specific interactions of anesthetics at the lipid-water interface are important
    for low-affinity and promiscuous ion channel modulations, then at least two predictions can
    be made.
    [0060]    First, sufficient water solubility should be important for interfacial interactions, and
15  thus any amphipathic molecule with sufficient water solubility should be able to modulate
    anesthetic-sensitive channels. This statement is supported by numerous studies that show
    GABAA, glycine, NMDA, two-pore domain potassium channels, and other anesthetic
    sensitive channels can be modulated by conventional and nonconventional anesthetics,
    including carbon dioxide, ammonia, ketone bodies, and detergents (Yang, et al, Anesth Analg
20  (2008) 107: 868-74; Yang, et al., Anesth Analg (2008) 106: 83 8-45; Eger, et al., Anesth
    Analg (2006) 102: 1397-406; Solt, et al., Anesth Analg (2006) 102: 1407-11; Krasowski, et
    al., JPharmacolExp Ther (2001) 297: 338-5 1; Brosnan, et al., Anesth Analg (2007) 104:
     1430-3; Brosnan, et al., Br JAnaesth (2008) 101: 673-9; Mohammadi, et al., Eur J
    Pharmacol(2001) 421: 85-91; Anderson, et al., JMed Chem (1997) 40: 1668-81; Brosnan, et
25  al., Anesth Analg (2006) 103: 86-91).87-96). Moreover, receptor mutations that decrease ion
    channel sensitivity to conventional anesthetics can also decrease sensitivity to
    nonconventional ones as well (Yang, et al., Anesth Analg (2008) 106: 838-45), suggesting
    these disparate compounds all share a common nonspecific mechanism for interacting with
    unrelated ion channels.
30   [00611    Second, the number of non-specific interfacial interactions should be different
     between non-homologous channels. Hence, a prime determinant of the cut-off effect for ion
     channel modulation should be the water solubility of a drug, and this threshold solubility cut
                                                     26

   WO 2014/011235                                                                PCT/US2013/031668
    off concentration should differ between ion channels from unrelated superfamilies (e.g., 3
    vs. 4-transmembrane receptors). Preliminary data supports this contention (Figure 9). In
    these studies, whole cell currents of oocytes expressing either GABAA (human ai P2Y2s)
    receptors or NMDA (human NR1/ rat NR2A) receptors were measured in the presence and
 5  absence of saturated hydrocarbons with differing functional groups. For a given homologous
    hydrocarbon series (with an identical functional group), the agent solubility was varied by
    increasing the hydrocarbon chain length at the 92-position. For example, the alkane series
    consisted of n-butane, n-pentane, and n-hexane; the alcohol series consisted of 1-decanol and
    1-dodecanol; the amines consisted of 1-octadecamine and 1-eicosanamine; the ethers
10  consisted of dipentylether and dihexylether; etc. All compounds studied were positive
    modulators (>10% increase over baseline) of GABAA receptors, but only compounds with a
    molar water solubility greater than approximately 1mM were also able to modulate NMDA
    receptors (>10% decrease from baseline), as shown in Figure 9. Hence, water solubility
    correlated with specificity for GABAA versus NMDA receptors. This correlation is
15  remarkably good since solubility values are calculated-not measured-for compounds in
    unbuffered pure water instead of the polyionic buffered solutions in which whole cell
    currents were actually measured. Although increasing chain length increases molecular
    volume, the specificity cut-off was not associated with any particular hydrocarbon chain
    length. In addition, increasing chain length also changes the activity of a hydrocarbon in
20  solution; but there was no correlation between saturated vapor pressure and the receptor
    specificity cut-off.
    [00621    Inhaled anesthetics enjoy widespread clinical use in general anesthesia in animals
    and humans, even though these drugs pose patient risks in terms of cardiovascular and
    respiratory depression. Continued drug development is important to improving anesthetic
25  safety. However, all volatile anesthetics in clinical use were developed in the 1970s or before
    (Terrell,Anesthesiology (2008) 108: 531-3).
     [00631   Creating newer and safer anesthetics requires knowledge of properties that predict
    which receptors or receptor superfamilies are likely to be modulated (Solt, et al., Curr Opin
    Anaesthesiol 2007; 20: 300-6). Data are provided herein that demonstrate a threshold
30  solubility related to NMDA versus GABAA receptor specificity; analogous threshold
    solubility-specificity "cut-off' values exist for other receptors as well. This is important,
    because actions at various receptors and ion channels determine the pharmacologic profile of
    a drug. An inhaled agent that selectively acts on NMDA receptors can offer increased
                                                     27

   WO 2014/011235                                                                  PCT/US2013/031668
    analgesia and autonomic quiescence, as do other injectable NMDA antagonists (Cahusac, et
    al., Neuropharmacology(1984) 23: 719-24; Bovill, et al., Br JAnaesth (1971) 43: 496-9;
    Sanders, Br Med Bull (2004) 71: 115-35; France, et al., JPharmacolExp Ther (1989) 250:
    197-201; Janig, et al., JAuton Nerv Syst (1980) 2: 1-14; and Ness, et al., Brain Res 1988;
 5  450: 153-69). Drugs that act predominantly through certain GABA receptors can offer
    excellent amnesia (Clark, et al., Arch Neurol (1979) 36: 296-300; Bonin, et al., Pharmacol
    Biochem Behav (2008) 90: 105-12; Cheng, et al., JNeurosci2006; 26: 3713-20; Sonner, et
    al., Mol Pharmacol(2005) 68: 61-8; Vanini, et al., Anesthesiology (2008) 109: 978-88), but
    may also contribute to significant respiratory depression (Harrison, et al., Br JPharmacol
10  1985; 84: 381-91; Hedner, et al., JNeural Transm (1980) 49: 179-86;Yamada, et al., Brain
    Res 1982; 248: 71-8; Taveira da Silva, et al., JAppl Physiol(1987) 62: 2264-72; Delpierre, et
    al., Neurosci Lett (1997) 226: 83-6; Li, et al., JPhysiol(2006) 577: 307-18; Yang, JAppl
    Physiol (2007) 102: 350-7). Other cut-off values may exist for receptors that cause negative
    inotropy and vasodilation, leading to cardiovascular instability in anesthetized patients.
15  [0064]     Knowledge of threshold cut-off values, and the means to easily predict them
    through calculated estimates of a physical property facilitates the rational design of new
    agents with an improved safety profile. For example, a good analgesic with poor
    immobilizing effects can be turned into a good general anesthetic by increasing the water
    solubility of the agent, such as by addition of an alcohol group or halogen, or by removal of
20  long aliphatic chains that are not involved with high-affinity binding interactions.
    Conversely, a good immobilizer could be altered to reduce water solubility in order eliminate
    certain side effects caused by receptor modulation above that cut-off value. It is also possible
    to alter activity at high affinity sites to make drugs less potent, thereby increasing the drug
    ED50 and adding potentially desirable pharmacodynamic effects from low-affinity sites at
25  these higher concentrations.
    [00651     The discovery of threshold solubility-specificity cut-off values allows one to make
    predictions regarding anesthetic mechanisms. For example, since receptors with the same
    superfamily share sequence homology, their solubility cut-off values should be more similar
    to each other than receptors from different superfamilies.

   WO 2014/011235                                                                  PCT/US2013/031668
    [00661     Using the water solubility threshold values to predict the efficacy and
    pharmacological activity of candidate compounds on anesthetic-sensitive receptors,
    compounds for effecting anesthesia via delivery through the respiratory passages have been
    identified. Some of the compounds potentiate GABAA receptors without inhibiting NMDA
 5  receptors. Candidate compounds are selected based on their molar water solubility, vapor
    pressure, saline-gas partition coefficient, carbon-to-halogen ratio, odor (or lack thereof),
    stability, e.g., in formulations for inhalational or pulmonary delivery, pharmacological
    activity on different anesthetic-sensitive receptors, and toxicity.
                            i. Molar water solubility and channel cut-off values
10  [0067]     Inhaled agents produce anesthesia via a summation of ion channel and cell
    membrane receptor effects that serve to decrease neuronal excitability within the central
    nervous system. Anesthetic efficacy at specific ion channels and cell membrane receptors is
    predicted by molar water solubility. Hydrocarbons that have a molar water solubility greater
    than approximately 1.1 mM will modulate NMDA receptors whereas less soluble anesthetics
15  will generally not, although there is small variability about this cut-off number with alcohols
    continuing to modulate NMDA receptors at slightly lower solubility values and ethers
    exhibiting a cut-off effect at slightly higher solubility values. Conversely, inhaled
    hydrocarbons that cannot potentiate GABAA receptors are not anesthetics. The water
    solubility cut-off for GABAA receptor modulation is around 0.068 mM, but current data from
20  our laboratory shows a 95% confidence interval that extends from 0.3 mM to 0.016. These
    GABAA solubility cut-off values provide an absolute molar water solubility lower-limit for
    rapid database screening of potential anesthetic candidates. Inhaled agents less soluble than
    0.068 mM are unlikely to exhibit an anesthetic effect. Non-gaseous volatile compounds more
    soluble than 100mM are unlikely to have desirable pharmacokinetic properties, and this value
25  serves as an upper solubility limit for database screening.
                           ii. Vapor pressure
     [0068]    Inhaled anesthetics are administered via the respiratory system and thus need a
     sufficiently high vapor pressure to facilitate rapid agent delivery to a patient. The vapor
    pressure also must exceed anesthetic potency (a function of water and lipid solubility) for the
30   agent to be delivered via inhalation at 1 atmosphere pressure. For database screening, we
     selected a minimum vapor pressure of 0.1 atmospheres (76 mmHg) at 25*C.
                          iii. Saline-gas partition coefficient
                                                      29

   WO 2014/011235                                                                 PCT/US2013/031668
    [00691     Inhaled anesthetics with low Ostwald saline-gas partition coefficients exhibit
    desirable and rapid washin and washout kinetics. These values can be estimated using
    previously published QSPR correlations, or by identifying within a chemical family those
    compounds that exhibit high vapor pressure and low aqueous solubility which together
 5  suggest a low Ostwald saline-gas partition coefficient. Compounds should have a saline-gas
    partition coefficient <_0.8 at 370 C.
                        iv. Carbon-to-halogen ratio
    10070]     Modem anesthetics must be non-flammable in order to be clinically useful.
                                                                                            atoms
    Halogenation reduces flammability. Compounds for which the number of hydrogen
10  did not exceed the number of carbon atoms are preferred.
                         v. Parent compound properties
                                 1. Odor
    [0071]     Malodorous compounds will not be tolerated by patients or perioperative personnel.
    Compounds containing thiols or sulfide linkages and primary and secondary amine
15  compounds have unpleasant odors, and so volatile compounds containing these groups were
    excluded from screening.
                                 2. Stability
     [0072]     Divalent bases (and sometimes monovalent bases) are used for CO 2 absorption in
    anesthetic circuits; clinically-useful agents must therefore be stable in the presence of strong
20  bases. Compounds containing aldehyde, ketone, or carboxillic acid groups were unstable in
    soda lime are not preferred. Anesthetics should also be resistant to hydrolysis and redox
    reactions in vivo. Compounds with ester linkages can be thermally unstable or hydrolysed by
    plasma and tissue cholinesterases; and those compounds resistant to hydrolysis may likely
    cause undesirable inhibition of these enzymes (which are essential for metabolism of other
25  drugs). Therefore, compounds with ester linkages are not preferred. Anesthetics with non
     aromatic unsaturated carbon linkages have been used historically (fluroxene, isopropenyl
    vinyl ether, trichloroethylene, vinethylene, ethylene) and shown to undergo extensive
     metabolism that for some agents was associated with toxicity. Agents containing double or
     triple carbon bonds are not preferred.

    [00731     Clinically-relevant anesthetics should inhibit excitatory ion channels and cell
    receptors and potentiate inhibitory ion channels and cell receptors. However, tests with
    unhalogenated compounds containing tertiary amines (4-methylmorpholine,
    N-methylpiperadine) caused direct activation of NMDA receptors which would be expected
 5  to antagonize anesthetic effects and potentially cause neuronal injury at high concentrations.
    Accordingly, compounds containing tertiary amines are not preferred.
                                 4. In vitro and in vivo toxicity
    [0074]     Some parent structures (such as pyrrolidine) caused cytotoxicity during oocyte
    electrophysiology studies. These compounds are not preferred. Other structures previously
10  known to be highly toxic to animals or humans (such as silanes and boranes) are not
    preferred.

    limitation halogenated alcohol derivatives, halogenated diether (polyether) derivatives,
15  halogenated dioxane derivatives, halogenated dioxolane derivatives, halogenated
    cyclopentane derivatives, halogenated cyclohexane derivatives, halogenated tetrahydrofuran
    derivatives, and halogenated tetrahydropyran derivatives. The compounds can be formulated
    for delivery to a subject via the respiratory pathways, e.g., for inhalational or pulmonary
    delivery.

    included in the present invention. In one embodiment, the salts are pharmaceutically
    acceptable salts. The term "salts" embraces addition salts of free acids that are useful within

     III.    Subjects Who May Benefit
     [01011     The anesthetic compounds and methods described herein find use for inducing
     anesthesia in any subject in need thereof. For example, the subject may be undergoing a
     surgical procedure that requires the induction of temporary unconsciousness and/or
25   immobility.
                                                                                                    of
     101021      The patient receiving the anesthetic may have been selected for having or at risk
     having a sensitivity or adverse reaction to an anesthetic that activates a particular anesthetic
     sensitive receptor or subset of anesthetic-receptors. For example, the patient may have or be
     at risk of having a sensitivity or adverse reaction to an anesthetic that activates one or more of
30   NMDA receptors, two-pore potassium channels, voltage-gated ion channels, GABA
     receptors, glycine receptors, or another anesthetic-sensitive receptor. In such cases, the
                                                      44

   WO 2014/011235                                                                 PCT/US2013/031668
    anesthetic administered to the patient has a water solubility that is less than the solubility
    threshold concentration for the receptor for which it is sought to avoid modulating.
    [01031    In various embodiments, it may be desirable to induce in the subject amnesia and/or
    immobility by potentiating GABAA receptors, but minimize or avoid inducing possible
 5  respiratory or neurologic side-effects that may be associated with inhibition of NMDA
    receptors.
     IV.     Formulation and Administration
                a. Formulation
    [01041     The invention also encompasses the use of pharmaceutical compositions comprising
10  a compound or a mixture of compounds (e.g., of Formula I, Formula II, Formula III, Formula
    IV, Formula V, Formula VI, Formula VII and/or Formula VIII, as described herein), or salts
    thereof, to induce anesthesia in a subject.
    [01051     Such a pharmaceutical composition may consist of at least one compound of the
    invention or a salt thereof, in a form suitable for administration to a subject, or the
15  pharmaceutical composition may comprise at least one compound of the invention or a salt
    thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, one or more additional
    ingredients, or some combination of these. The at least one compound of the invention may
    be present in the pharmaceutical composition in the form of a physiologically acceptable salt,
    such as in combination with a physiologically acceptable cation or anion, as is well known in
20  the art.
     [01061    The relative amounts of the active ingredient, the pharmaceutically acceptable
    carrier, and any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention will
    vary, depending upon the identity, size, and condition of the subject treated and further
    depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered. By way of
25  example, the composition may comprise between 0.1% and 100% (w/w) active ingredient.
     [0107]    As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" means a
    pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or carrier, such as a liquid or solid filler,
    stabilizer, dispersing agent, suspending agent, diluent, excipient, thickening agent, solvent or
    encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting a compound useful within the
30   invention within or to the subject such that it may perform its intended function. Typically,
     such constructs are carried or transported from one organ, or portion of the body, to another
                                                     45

   WO 2014/011235                                                                  PCT/US2013/031668
    organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense of being
    compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation, including the compound useful
    within the invention, and not injurious to the subject. Some examples of materials that may
    serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include: sugars, such as lactose, glucose and
 5  sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose, and its derivatives, such as
    sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth;
    malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as
    peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil;
    glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and
10  polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such
    as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; surface active agents; alginic acid;
    pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer
    solutions; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical
    formulations. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" also includes any and all
15  coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, and absorption delaying agents, and the like that
    are compatible with the activity of the compound useful within the invention, and are
    physiologically acceptable to the subject. Supplementary active compounds may also be
    incorporated into the compositions. The "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" may further
     include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound useful within the invention.
20  Other additional ingredients that may be included in the pharmaceutical compositions used in
    the practice of the invention are known in the art and described, for example in Remington:
    The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (Remington: The Science & Practice of Pharmacy),
    2 1St Edition, 2011, Pharmaceutical Press, and Ansel's Pharmaceutical
                                                                               Dosage Forms and
    Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, et al., eds., 9t Edition, 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,
25  which are incorporated herein by reference.
     [01081    In various embodiments, the compounds are formulated for delivery via a
     respiratory pathway, e.g., suitably developed for inhalational, pulmonary, intranasal, delivery.
     In various embodiments, the compound or mixture of compounds is vaporized into or directly
     mixed or diluted with a carrier gas, e.g., oxygen, air, or helium, or a mixture thereof. A
30   preservative may be further included in the vaporized formulations, as appropriate. Other
     contemplated formulations include projected nanoparticles, and liposomal preparations. The
     route(s) of administration will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan and will depend upon
                                                     46

   WO 2014/011235                                                                PCT/US2013/031668
    any number of factors including the type and severity of the disease being treated, the type
    and age of the veterinary or human patient being treated, and the like.
    [01091     The formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be
    prepared by any method known or hereafter developed in the art of pharmacology. In general,
 5  such preparatory methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association
    with a carrier or one or more other accessory ingredients, and then, if necessary or desirable,
    shaping or packaging the product into a desired single- or multi-dose unit.
    [01101     As used herein, a "unit dose" is a discrete amount of the pharmaceutical
                                                                                      amount of the
    composition comprising a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. The
10  active ingredient is generally equal to the dosage of the active ingredient that would be
    administered to a subject or a convenient fraction of such a dosage such as, for example, one
    half or one-third of such a dosage. The unit dosage form may be for a single daily dose or one
    of multiple daily doses (e.g., about 1 to 4 or more times per day). When multiple daily doses
    are used, the unit dosage form may be the same or different for each dose.
15   [01111    Although the descriptions of pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are
    principally directed to pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for ethical
     administration to humans, it will be understood by the skilled artisan that such compositions
     are generally suitable for administration to animals of all sorts. Modification of
                                                                                             the
     pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to humans in order to render
20   compositions suitable for administration to various animals is well understood, and the
     ordinarily skilled veterinary pharmacologist can design and perform such modification with
     merely ordinary, if any, experimentation. Subjects to which administration of the
     pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is contemplated include, but are not limited to,
     humans and other primates, mammals including commercially relevant mammals including
25   agricultural mammals (e.g., cattle, pigs, horses, sheep), domesticated mammals (e.g., cats,
     and dogs), and laboratory mammals (e.g., rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters).
                  b. Administration
      [01121   In some embodiments, the methods further comprise administering the selected
     anesthetic (e.g., a compound or mixture of compounds of Formula I, Formula II, Formula III,
30   Formula IV, Formula V, Formula VI, Formula VII and/or Formula VIII, as described herein)
     to a patient. The anesthetic can be administered by any route sufficient to achieve a desired
      anesthetic, amnestic, analgesic, or sedative effect. For example, the anesthetic can be
                                                      47

   WO 2014/011235                                                                 PCT/US2013/031668
    administered intravenously, inhalationally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, transdermally,
    topically, or by any other route to achieve an efficacious effect.
    [0113]     The anesthetic is administered at a dose sufficient to achieve a desired anesthetic
                                                                                    autonomic
    endpoint, for example, immobility, amnesia, analgesia, unconsciousness or
 5  quiescence.

    [0114]     Administered dosages for anesthetic agents are in accordance with dosages
    scheduling regimens practiced by those of skill in the art. General guidance for appropriate
                                                                                                 and
    dosages of pharmacological agents used in the present methods is provided in Goodman
    Gilman's The PharmacologicalBasis of Therapeutics, 12th Edition, 2010, supra, and in a
10  Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR), for example, in the 65* (2011) or 6 6 th (2012) Eds., PDR
    Network, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
     [0115]     The appropriate dosage of anesthetic agents will vary according to several factors,
     including the chosen route of administration, the formulation of the composition, patient
     response, the severity of the condition, the subject's weight, and the judgment of the
15   prescribing physician. The dosage can be increased or decreased over time, as required by an
     individual patient. Usually, a patient initially is given a low dose, which is then increased to
     an efficacious dosage tolerable to the patient.
     [0116]     Determination of an effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in
     the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. Generally, an
20   efficacious or effective amount of a combination of one or more anesthetic agents is
     determined by first administering a low dose or small amount of the anesthetic, and then
     incrementally increasing the administered dose or dosages, adding a second or third
     medication as needed, until a desired effect is observed in the treated subject with minimal or
     no toxic side effects. Applicable methods for determining an appropriate dose and dosing
25   schedule for administration of anesthetics are described, for example, in Goodman and
     Gilman's The PharmacologicalBasis of Therapeutics, 12th Edition, 2010, supra; in a

    [01171     Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of
    the active compounds which are sufficient to maintain a desired therapeutic effect.
 5  Preferably, therapeutically effective serum levels will be achieved by administering a single
    dose, but efficacious multiple dose schedules are included in the invention. In cases of local
    administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be
    related to plasma concentration. One having skill in the art will be able to optimize
    therapeutically effective local dosages without undue experimentation.
10  [0118]     The dosing of analog compounds can be based on the parent compound, at least as a
    starting point.
    [01191     In various embodiments, the compositions are delivered to the subject via a
    respiratory pathway, e.g., via inhalational, pulmonary and/or intranasal delivery.
    Technologies and devices for inhalational anesthetic drug dosing are known in the art and
15  described, e.g., in MILLER'S ANESTHESIA, Edited by Ronald D. Miller, et al., 2 vols, 7th
    ed, Philadelphia, PA, Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier, 2010; and Meyer, et al., Handb Exp
    Pharmacol.(2008) (182):451-70. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions
    useful for inducing anesthesia can be administered to deliver a dose of between about
    0.1-10.0 percent of 1 atmosphere (1 atm), e.g., 0.5-5.0 percent of 1 atm, e.g., about 1.0-3.5 of
20   1 atm, e.g., about 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4. 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5,
    7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5 or 10.0 percent of 1 atm, e.g., delivered over the period of time of
    desired anesthesia. The dose used will be dependent upon the drug potency, and the
    compound or mixture of compounds administered.
     [01201    Detailed information about the delivery of therapeutically active agents in the form
25  of vapors or gases is available in the art. The compound will typically be vaporized using a
    vaporizer using a carrier gas such as oxygen, air, or helium, or a mixture thereof, to achieve a
    desired drug concentration suitable for inhalation by use of a semi-open or semi-closed
    anesthetic circuit, as is known to individuals familiar with the art of anesthesia.. The
    compound in a gaseous form may also be directly mixed with a carrier gas such as oxygen,
30  air, or helium, or a mixture thereof, to achieve a desired drug concentration suitable for
     inhalation by use of a semi-open or semi-closed anesthetic circuit, as is known to individuals
     familiar with the art of anesthesia. The drug may also be administered by direct application

    of onto or through a breathing mask, also termed an open circuit, as is known to individuals
    familiar with the art of anesthesia. In animals, the drug may also be administered into a
    closed chamber or container containing the animal subject whereby the drug is delivered by
    the respiratory tract as the animal breathes, as is known to individuals familiar with animal
 5  anesthesia.
    [01211    In some aspects of the invention, the anesthetic compound or mixture of
    compounds, is dissolved or suspended in a suitable solvent, such as water, ethanol, or saline,
    and administered by nebulization. A nebulizer produces an aerosol of fine particles by
    breaking a fluid into fine droplets and dispersing them into a flowing stream of gas. Medical
10  nebulizers are designed to convert water or aqueous solutions or colloidal suspensions to
    aerosols of fine, inhalable droplets that can enter the lungs of a patient during inhalation and
    deposit on the surface of the respiratory airways. Typical pneumatic (compressed gas)
    medical nebulizers develop approximately 15 to 30 microliters of aerosol per liter of gas in
    finely divided droplets with volume or mass median diameters in the respirable range of 2 to
15  4 micrometers. Predominantly, water or saline solutions are used with low solute
    concentrations, typically ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 mg/mL.
    [0122]    Nebulizers for delivering an aerosolized solution to the lungs are commercially
    available from a number of sources, including the AERxTM (Aradigm Corp., Hayward, Calif.)
    and the Acorn II* (Vital Signs Inc., Totowa, N.J.).
20   [0123]    Metered dose inhalers are also known and available. Breath actuated inhalers
    typically contain a pressurized propellant and provide a metered dose automatically when the
    patient's inspiratory effort either moves a mechanical lever or the detected flow rises above a
    preset threshold, as detected by a hot wire anemometer. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos.

    solubility of the anesthetic and comparing the water solubility of the anesthetic with a water
    solubility cut-off or threshold value for the anesthetic-sensitive receptor. An anesthetic with
    a water solubility that is below the water solubility cut-off or threshold value for the
    anesthetic-sensitive receptor will not activate that receptor. An anesthetic with a water
 5  solubility that is above the water solubility cut-off or threshold value for the anesthetic
    sensitive receptor can activate that receptor.
                a. Anesthetics
    [0129]    The anesthetic can be any compound with anesthetic properties when administered
    to a patient. Generally, increasing doses of an anesthetic causes immobility, amnesia,
10  analgesia, unconsciousness and autonomic quiescence in a patient. The anesthetics are
    general anesthetics (e.g., systemic) and can be inhalational or injectable.
    [01301    In some embodiments, the anesthetic is an inhalational anesthetic. For example, in
    some embodiments, the anesthetic is selected from the group consisting of ethers and
    halogenated ethers (including, e.g., desflurane, enflurane, halothane, isoflurane,
15  methoxyflurane, sevoflurane, diethyl ether, methyl propyl ether, and analogues thereof);
    alkanes and halogenated alkanes (including, e.g., halothane, chloroform, ethyl chloride, and
    analogues thereof), cycloalkanes and cyclohaloalkanes (including, e.g., cyclopropane and
    analogues thereof), alkenes and haloalkenes (including, e.g., trichloroethylene, ethylene, and
    analogues thereof), alkynes and haloalkynes and their analogues, vinyl ethers (including, e.g.,
20  ethyl vinyl ether, divinyl ether, fluoroxine, and analogues thereof). In some embodiments,
    the anesthetic is selected from the group consisting of desflurane, enflurane, halothane,
    isoflurane, methoxyflurane, nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, xenon, and analogs thereof. In some
    embodiments, the anesthetic is selected from the group consisting of halogenated alcohols,
    halogenated diethers, halogenated dioxanes, halogenated dioxolanes, halogenated
25  cyclopentanes, halogenated cyclohexanes, halogenated tetrahydrofurans and halogenated
    tetrahydropyrans, as described herein. In various embodiments, the inhalational anesthetic is
    a compound or mixture of compounds of Formula I, Formula II, Formula III, Formula IV,
    Formula V, Formula VI, Formula VII and/or Formula VIII, as described herein.
    [0131]    In some embodiments, the anesthetic is an injectable anesthetic or sedative drug.
30  For example, in some embodiments, the anesthetic is selected from the group consisting of
    alkyl phenols (including, e.g., propofol and analogues thereof), imidazole derivatives
    (including, e.g., etomidate, metomidate, clonidine, detomidine, medetomidine,

                 b. Anesthetic-Sensitive Receptors
     [0133]    Anesthetic-sensitive receptors are receptors and ion channels that bind to and are
20   activated by anesthetics. Anesthetic-sensitive receptors include 2-, 3-, 4-, and 7
     transmembrane receptor proteins. Exemplary anesthetic-sensitive receptors include glycine
     receptors, GABA receptors, two-pore domain potassium channels (K2p), voltage-gated
     sodium channels (Nay), NMDA receptors, opioid receptors and subtypes of such receptors.
     Anesthetic-sensitive receptors are well-known in the art. Their sequences are well
25   characterized.
     [0134]    N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels are heteromers composed of three
     different subunits: NR1 (GRINI), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or GRIN2D) and NR3
     (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The NR2 subunit acts as the agonist binding site for glutamate. This
     receptor is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter receptor in the mammalian brain.

20               c. Determining Water Solubility of the Anesthetic
     [0139]    The water solubility of the anesthetic can be determined using any method known in
     the art. For example, the water solubility can be determined using a computer implemented
     algorithm. One such algorithm is available through SciFinder Scholar provided by the
     American Chemical Society and available on the worldwide web at scifinder.cas.org. Water
25   solubility values using SciFinder Scholar are calculated using Advanced Chemistry
     Development (ACD/Labs) Software V9.04 for Solaris (1994-2009 ACD/Labs). Solubility
     values are calculated at pH=7 in pure water at 25 'C. Other computer-implemented
                                                                                              in the
     algorithms for determining the water solubility of an anesthetic find use and are known
     art. For example, software for calculating water solubility is also commercially available
30   from Advanced Chemistry Development of Toronto, Ontario, Canada (on the worldwide web
     at acdlabs.com). Chemix software is available without charge and can be downloaded from
     the internet at home.c2i.net/astandne.

    [0140]    Alternatively, the water solubility of a compound can be empirically determined.
    For example, the conditions in which anesthetic effects are measured in a biological system
    are usually at pH (7.4), in a buffered electrolyte solution at 22-23 'C. These differences
    likely account for the small variation in the NMDA solubility cutoff for different
 5  hydrocarbon groups shown in Figure 4.
                 d. Determining the Specificity of the Anesthetic for the Anesthetic-Sensitive
                    Receptor
    [01411     The water solubility of the anesthetic is compared with the solubility cut-off or
    threshold concentration of an anesthetic-sensitive receptor. If the molar water solubility of
10  the anesthetic is less than the solubility cut-off or threshold concentration of an anesthetic
    sensitive receptor, then the anesthetic will not activate that anesthetic-sensitive receptor. If
    the water solubility of the anesthetic is greater than the solubility cut-off or threshold
    concentration of an anesthetic-sensitive receptor, then the anesthetic can activate that
    anesthetic-sensitive receptor.
15  [01421     For example, in some embodiments, an anesthetic with a molar water solubility
    below a predetermined solubility threshold concentration for Nav channels does not inhibit
    Nav channels, but can inhibit NMDA receptors, potentiate two-pore domain potassium
    channels (K2p), potentiate glycine receptors and potentiate GABAA receptors.
    [0143]     In some embodiments, an anesthetic with a molar water solubility below a
20  predetermined solubility threshold concentration for NMDA receptors does not inhibit Na,
    channels or inhibit NMDA receptors, but can potentiate two-pore domain potassium channels
    (K2p), potentiate glycine receptors and potentiate GABAA receptors.
     [01441    In some embodiments, an anesthetic with a molar water solubility below a
    predetermined solubility threshold concentration for two-pore domain potassium channels
25  (K2p) does not inhibit Nav channels, inhibit NMDA receptors or potentiate two-pore domain
    potassium channel (K2p) currents, but can potentiate glycine receptors and potentiate GABAA
     receptors.
     [01451    In some embodiments, an anesthetic with a molar water solubility below a
     predetermined solubility threshold concentration for GABAA receptors does not inhibit Nay
30   channels, inhibit NMDA receptors, potentiate two-pore domain potassium channel (K2P)
     currents, or potentiate GABAA receptors but can potentiate glycine receptors.

    predetermined solubility threshold concentration for NMDA receptors (e.g., below about

 5  threshold concentration for NMDA receptors (e.g., greater than about 1.1 mM) and both
    potentiates GABAA receptors and inhibits NMDA receptors.
    101471 In various embodiments, the solubility threshold concentration for NMDA receptors
    is in the range of between about 0.45 mM and about 2.8 mM, for example between about

    mM, 1.7 mM, 1.8 mM, 1.9 mM or 2.0 mM. In some embodiments, the predetermined
    solubility threshold concentration for NMDA receptors is about 1.1 mM. In some
    embodiments, the predetermined solubility threshold concentration for NMDA receptors is
    about 2 mM. In some embodiments, the anesthetic has a molar water solubility that is below
15  the threshold water solubility cut-off concentration of an NMDA receptor, and therefore does
    not inhibit the NMDA receptor. In some embodiments, the anesthetic has a water solubility
    that is below about 2 mM, for example, below about 2.0 mM, 1.9 mM, 1.8 mM, 1.7 mM, 1.6
     mM, 1.5 mM, 1.4 mM, 1.3 mM, 1.2 mM, 1.1 mM or 1.0 mM. In some embodiments, the
     anesthetic has a water solubility that is above the threshold water solubility cut-off
20   concentration of an NMDA receptor, and therefore can inhibit the NMDA receptor. In some
     embodiments, the anesthetic has a molar water solubility that is above about 1.0 mM, for
     example, above about 1.1 mM, 1.2 mM, 1.3 mM, 1.4 mM, 1.5 mM, 1.6 mM, 1.7 mM,
     1.8 mM, 1.9 mM or 2.0 mM.
     [01481     In various embodiments, the solubility threshold concentration for two-pore domain
25   potassium channels (K2p) receptors is in the range of about 0.10-1.0 mM, for example, about

     In some embodiments, the predetermined solubility threshold concentration for two-pore
     domain potassium channels (K2p) receptors is about 0.26 mM. In some embodiments, two
30   pore domain potassium channels (K2p) receptor is a TREK or a TRESK receptor. In some
     embodiments, the anesthetic has a molar water solubility that is below the threshold water
     solubility cut-off concentration of a two-pore domain potassium channels (K2p) receptor (e.g.,
     below about 0.26 mM), and therefore does not potentiate the two-pore domain potassium

 5  [0149]     In various embodiments, the solubility threshold concentration for voltage-gated
    sodium channels (Nay) is in the range of about 1.2 to about 1.9 mM, for example, about 1.2
    mM, 1.3 mM, 1.4 mM, 1.5 mM, 1.6 mM, 1.7 mM, 1.8 mM or 1.9 mM. In some
    embodiments, the predetermined solubility threshold concentration for voltage-gated sodium
    channels (Nay) is about 1.2 mM. In some embodiments, the predetermined solubility
10  threshold concentration for voltage-gated sodium channels (Nay) is about 1.9 mM. In some
    embodiments, the anesthetic has a molar water solubility that is below the threshold water
    solubility cut-off concentration of a voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) (e.g., below about
    1.2 mM), and therefore does not inhibit the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav). In some
    embodiments, the anesthetic has a water solubility that is above the threshold water solubility
15  cut-off concentration of a voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) (e.g., above about 1.9 mM)

    [0150]     In various embodiments, the solubility threshold concentration for GABAA

    68 ptM, 70 pM, 75 pM, 80 pM, 85 pM, 90 piM, 95 pM or 100 pM. In some embodiments,
20  the predetermined solubility threshold concentration for GABAA receptors is about 68 pM.
    In some embodiments, the anesthetic has a molar water solubility that is below the threshold
    water solubility cut-off concentration of a GABAA receptor (e.g., below about 68 pM), and
    therefore does not potentiate the GABAA receptor. In some embodiments, the anesthetic has
    a water solubility that is above the threshold water solubility cut-off concentration of a
25  GABAA receptor (e.g, above about 68 pM), and therefore can potentiate the GABAA

                 e. Selecting the Desired Anesthetic
    [0152]    In some embodiments, the methods further comprise the step of selecting an
 5  appropriate or desired anesthetic, e.g., based on the subset of anesthetic-sensitive receptors
    that can be activated by the anesthetic.
    [01531    For example, the selected anesthetic can have a water solubility below a
    predetermined solubility threshold concentration for Nav channels (e.g., below about
    1.2 mM), such that the anesthetic does not inhibit Nav channels, but can inhibit NMDA
10  receptors, potentiate two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P), potentiate glycine receptors
    and potentiate GABAA receptors.
    [0154]    In some embodiments, the selected anesthetic can have a water solubility below a
    predetermined solubility threshold concentration for NMDA receptors (e.g., below about 1.1
    mM) such that the anesthetic does not inhibit Nav channels or inhibit NMDA receptors, but
15  can potentiate two-pore domain potassium channels (K2p), potentiate glycine receptors and
    potentiate GABAA receptors.
    [0155]    In some embodiments, the selected anesthetic can have a water solubility below a
    predetermined solubility threshold concentration for two-pore domain potassium channels
    (K2p) (e.g., below about 0.26 mM) such that the anesthetic does not inhibit Nay channels,
20  inhibit NMDA receptors or potentiate two-pore domain potassium channel (K2P) currents, but
    can potentiate glycine receptors and potentiate GABAA receptors.
    [01561    In some embodiments, the selected anesthetic can have a water solubility below a
    predetermined solubility threshold concentration for GABAA receptors (e.g., below about 68
    piM) such that the anesthetic does not inhibit Nav channels, inhibit NMDA receptors,
25  potentiate two-pore domain potassium channel (K2P) currents, or potentiate GABAA receptors
    but can potentiate glycine receptors.
     [0157]   In some embodiments, the selected anesthetic can have a water solubility below a
    predetermined solubility threshold concentration for NMDA receptors (e.g., below about 1.1
    mM) such that the anesthetic potentiates GABAA receptors but does not inhibit NMDA

     VI.     Methods of Modulating the Specificity of an Anesthetic for an Anesthetic
             Sensitive Receptor by Altering the Water Solubility of the Anesthetic
10   [01601    The invention also provides methods for modulating (i.e., increasing or decreasing)
    the specificity of an anesthetic for an anesthetic-sensitive receptor or a subset of anesthetic
    sensitive receptors by adjusting the water solubility of the anesthetic. The anesthetic can be
    chemically modified or altered to increase or decrease the water solubility and hence the
    specificity of the anesthetic for the anesthetic-sensitive receptor or the subset of anesthetic
15  sensitive receptors.
     [0161]    In various embodiments, this method can be performed by determining the water
    solubility of the parent anesthetic and then comparing the water solubility of the parent
    anesthetic threshold cut-off value of an anesthetic-sensitive receptor, as described above. If
    the water solubility of the anesthetic is below the water solubility threshold cut-off
20  concentration of the anesthetic-sensitive receptor, then the anesthetic will not modulate the
    receptor. If the capacity to modulate the anesthetic-sensitive receptor is desired, the water
    solubility of the anesthetic can be sufficiently increased, e.g., by chemically modifying the
    parent anesthetic, such that the analog of the parent anesthetic has a water solubility above
    the water solubility threshold cut-off concentration of the receptor or the subset of receptors
25  of interest. In this case, the analog of the parent anesthetic can modulate the anesthetic
    sensitive receptor or a subset of anesthetic-sensitive receptors of interest.
    [0162]    Conversely, if the water solubility of the anesthetic is above the water solubility
    threshold cut-off concentration of the anesthetic-sensitive receptor, then the anesthetic can
    modulate the receptor. If the capacity to modulate the anesthetic-sensitive receptor is not
30  desired, then the water solubility of the anesthetic can be sufficiently decreased, e.g., by
    chemically modifying the parent anesthetic, such that the analog of the parent anesthetic has a
                                                     63

   WO 2014/011235                                                                  PCT/US2013/031668
    water solubility below the water solubility threshold cut-off concentration of the anesthetic
    sensitive receptor or the subset of receptors of interest. In this case, the analog of the parent
    anesthetic does not modulate the receptors or subset of receptors of interest.
    [0163]     The water solubility of the parent anesthetic can be adjusted using methods well
 5  known in the art. For example, the parent anesthetic can be chemically modified.
    Substituents on the parent anesthetic can be added, removed or changed, to increase or
    decrease the water solubility of the compound, as desired. The resulting analogs of the parent
    anesthetic either gain or lose the functional ability to activate the anesthetic-sensitive
    receptor, as desired, and have an increased or decreased water solubility, respectively, in
10  comparison to the parent anesthetic. The anesthetic analogs of use retain the functional
    ability to effect anesthesia. The potency and/or efficacy of the anesthetic analogs, however,
    may be increased or decreased in comparison to the parent anesthetic.
    [0164]     For example, to decrease the water solubility of the anesthetic, polar or heteroatom
    substituents, e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups, can be removed or substituted with more
15  hydrophobic substituents, e.g., a halogen or an alkyl group. Water solubility can also be
    decreased, e.g., by increasing the number of carbons on alkyl substituents, e.g., alkane,
    alkene, alkyne, alkoxy, etc. One, two, three, four, or more carbons can be added to the alkyl
    substituent, as needed, to decrease the water solubility of the anesthetic, as desired.
     [0165]     Conversely, to increase the water solubility of the anesthetic, hydrophobic
20  substituents, e.g., a halogen or an alkyl group, can be removed or substituted with polar or
    heteroatom substituents, e.g., hydroxyl or amino groups. Water solubility can also be
    increased, e.g., by decreasing the number of carbons on alkyl substituents, e.g., alkane,
    alkene, alkyne, alkoxy, etc. One, two, three, four, or more carbons can be removed from the
    alkyl substituent, as needed, to increase the water solubility of the anesthetic, as desired.
25   [0166]     For example, in some embodiments, the anesthetic is adjusted to have a water
     solubility below a predetermined solubility threshold concentration for NMDA receptors
     (e.g., below about 1.1 mM) such that the anesthetic does not inhibit Na, channels or inhibit
    NMDA receptors, but can potentiate two-pore domain potassium channels (K2p), potentiate
     glycine receptors and potentiate GABAA receptors. The water solubility threshold
30   concentrations for the different anesthetic-sensitive receptors are as described above and
     herein.

    [01761    The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed

    [01771    Example 1
    [01781    Hydrocarbon Molar Water Solubility Predicts NMDA vs. GABAA Receptor
20  Modulation
    [01791    Background: Many anesthetics modulate 3-transmembrane (such as NMDA) and
    4-transmembrane (such as GABAA) receptors. Clinical and experimental anesthetics
    exhibiting receptor family specificity often have low water solubility. We determined that
    the molar water solubility of a hydrocarbon could be used to predict receptor modulation
25  in vitro.
     [01801   Methods: GABAA        (alp272s) or NMDA (NR1/NR2A) receptors were expressed in
    oocytes and studied using standard two-electrode voltage clamp techniques. Hydrocarbons
    from 14 different organic functional groups were studied at saturated concentrations, and
    compounds within each group differed only by the carbon number at the o-position or within
30  a saturated ring. An effect on GABAA or NMDA receptors was defined as a 10% or greater
    reversible current change from baseline that was statistically different from zero.

    [01811     Results: Hydrocarbon moieties potentiated GABAA and inhibited NMDA receptor
    currents with at least some members from each functional group modulating both receptor
    types. A water solubility cut-off for NMDA receptors occurred at 1.1 mM with a 95% CI=
    0.45 to 2.8 mM. NMDA receptor cut-off effects were not well correlated with hydrocarbon
 5  chain length or molecular volume. No cut-off was observed for GABAA receptors within the
    solubility range of hydrocarbons studied.
    [0182]      Conclusions: Hydrocarbon modulation of NMDA receptor function exhibits a
    molar water solubility cut-off. Differences between unrelated receptor cut-off values suggest
    that the number, affinity, or efficacy of protein-hydrocarbon interactions at these sites likely
10  differ.
    METHODS
     101831     Oocyte Collection and Receptor Expression. An ovary from tricaine-anesthetized
    Xenopus laevis frogs was surgically removed using a protocol approved by the Institutional
    Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Davis. Following manual
15  disruption of the ovarian lobule septae, the ovary was incubated in 0.2% Type I collagenase
    (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) to defolliculate oocytes which were washed and
     stored in fresh and filtered modified Barth's solution composed of 88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl,
     2.4 mM NaHCO 3, 20 mM HEPES, 0.82 mM MgSO4, 0.33 mM Ca(N0 3 ) 2 , 0.41 mM CaCl2, 5
     mM sodium pyruvate, gentamycin, penicillin, streptomycin, and corrected to pH=7.4. All
20   salts and antibiotics were A.C.S. grade (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).
     [0184]     Clones used were provided as a gift from Dr. R.A. Harris (University of Texas,
     Austin) and were sequenced and compared to references in the National Center for
     Biotechnology Information database to confirm the identity of each gene. GABAA receptors
     were expressed using clones for the human GABAA al and the rat GABAA 02 and y2s
25   subunits in pCIS-II vectors. Approximately 0.25-1 ng total plasmid mixture containing either
     al,  p2, or y 2 genes in a respective ratio of 1:1:10 was injected intranuclearly through the
     oocyte animal pole and studied 2-4 days later. These plasmid ratios ensured incorporation of
     the y-subunit into expressed receptors, as confirmed via receptor potentiation to 10 pM
     chlordiazepoxide or insensitivity to 10 IiM zinc chloride during co-application with GABA.
30   In separate oocytes, glutamate receptors were expressed using rat NMDA NR1 clones in a
     pCDNA3 vector and rat NMDA NR2A clones in a Bluescript vector. RNA encoding each
     subunit was prepared using a commercial transcription kit (T7 mMessage mMachine,

     controls.

 5   linear-flow perfusion chamber with solutions administered by syringe pump at 1.5 ml/min
     with gastight glass syringes and Teflon tubing. Oocyte GABAA currents were studied using
     standard two-electrode voltage clamping techniques at a holding potential of 8OmV using a
     250 pLL channel linear-flow perfusion chamber with solutions administered by syringe pump
     at 1.5 mL/min.
10   [0186]      Frog Ringer's (FR) solution composed of 115 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM
     CaCl 2, and 10 mM HEPES prepared in 18.2 M92 H20 and filtered and adjusted to pH=7.4
     was used to perfuse oocytes. Agonist solutions also contained an EC 10-20 of
     4-aminobutanoic acid (FR-GABA) (Brosnan, et al., Anesth Analg (2006) 103:86-91; Yang, et
     al., Anesth AnaIg (2007) 105:673-679; Yang, et al., Anesth Analg (2007) 105:393-396).
15   After FR perfusion far 5 min, oocytes were exposed to 30 sec FR-GABA followed by another
     5 min FR washout; this was repeated until stable GABAA-elicited peaks were obtained.
     Next, FR containing a saturated solution of the study drug (Table 2)-or for gaseous study
     compounds a vapor pressure equal to 90% of barometric pressure with balance oxygen-was
     used to perfuse the oocyte chamber for 2 min followed by perfusion with a FR-GABA
20   solution containing the identical drug concentration for 30 sec. FR was next perfused for 5
     min to allow drug washout, and oocytes were finally perfused with FR-GABA for 30 sec to
     confirm return of currents to within 10% of the initial baseline response.

    solutions were the same as for GABAA with the substitution of equimolar BaCl 2 for calcium
    salts and the addition of 0.1 mM EGTA; this constituted barium frog Ringer's solution
    (BaFR). Agonist solutions for NMDA studies also contained 0.1 mM glutamate (E) and 0.01
    mM glycine (G) to constitute a BaFREG solution.
 5  [01891    The syringe pump and perfusion chamber apparatus as well as the clamp holding
    potential and baseline-agonist exposure protocols were identical to that described for the
    GABAA studies. The same test compounds, concentrations, and preparative methods were
    used in NMDA voltage clamp studies as in the GABAA voltage clamp studies (Table 2).
    [0190]    Response Calculationsand Data Analysis. Modulating drug responses were
10  calculated as the percent of the control (baseline) peak as follows: 100 -, IB where ID and IB
    were the peak currents measured during agonist+drug and agonist baseline perfusions,
    respectively. When present, direct receptor activation by a drug was similarly calculated as a
    percent of the agonist response. Average current responses for each drug and channel were
    described by mean+SD. A lack of receptor response (cut-off) was defined as a <10% change
15  from baseline current that was statistically indistinguishable from zero using a two-tailed
    Student t-test. Hence, drug responses >110% of the baseline peak showed potentiation of
    receptor function, and drug responses 590% of the baseline peak showed inhibition of
    receptor function.
     [0191]    The logio of the calculated solubility (logioS) for compounds immediately below
20  and above the cut-off for each hydrocarbon functional group were used to determine the
    receptor cut-off. For each hydrocarbon, there was a "grey area" of indeterminate solubility
    effect (Figure 3) between sequentially increasing hydrocarbon chain length. Mean solubility
    cut-offs were calculated as the average logioS for the least soluble compound that modulated
    receptor function and the most soluble neighboring compound for which no effect was
25  observed. From this result, a 95% confidence interval for logioS was calculated for receptor
    solubility cut-offs.
    RESULTS
     [01921    Hydrocarbon effects on NMDA and GABAA receptors are summarized in Table 3,
     and sample recordings are presented in Figure 3. All of the compounds tested positively
30   modulated GABAA receptor function, and a few of the 5-to-6 carbon compounds caused
     mild direct GABAA receptor activation, particularly the 1-fluoroalkanes and thiols. Mild

    direct receptor activation also occurred with dibutylether. With the exception of the
    aldehydes, alkynes, and cycloalkanes, GABAA receptor inhibition tended to decrease with
    increasing hydrocarbon chain length. No water solubility cut-off effect was observed for
    GABAA receptors for the compounds tested.

    [01941        In contrast, NMDA receptors currents were decreased by the shorter hydrocarbons
    within each functional group (Table 2), but lengthening the hydrocarbon chain eventually
    produced a null response-a cut-offeffect. No direct hydrocarbon effects on NMDA
 5  receptor function were detected in the absence of glutamate and glycine agonist.
    101951        The cut-off effect for NMDA receptor current modulation was associated with a
    hydrocarbon water solubility of 1.1 mM with a 95% confidence interval between 0.45 mM
    and 2.8 mM (Figure 4). More soluble hydrocarbons consistently inhibited NMDA receptor
    currents when applied at saturated aqueous concentrations, and hydrocarbons below this
10  range had no appreciable effect on NMDA receptor function. Moveover, during the course of
    the study, water solubility was sufficiently predictive of an NMDA receptor cut-off so as to
    require identify and testing of only single pair of compounds bracketing this critical solubility
    value, as occurred with the alkenes, amines, cyclic hydrocarbons, and sulfur-containing
    compounds.

    [0196]     Increasing hydrocarbon chain length decreases water solubility, but also increases
    molecular size. However, when graphed as a function of either carbon number (Figure 5) or
    molecular volume (Figure 6), the observed NMDA receptor cut-off effects show no
    consistent pattern. For example, the n-alkanes, 1-alkenes, and 1-alkynes show progressive
 5  lengthening of the hydrocarbon chain cut-off, presumably as a result of the increasing
    aqueous solubility conferred by the double and triple carbon bonds, respectively. There was
    also tremendous variation in molecular size of compounds exhibiting NMDA receptor cut
    off. Alkanes exhibited NMDA receptor cut-off between butane and pentane, respectively 4
    and 5 carbons in length, whereas the primary amines exhibited cut-off between 1
10  octadecanamine and 1-eicosanamine, respectively 18 and 20 carbons in length. As expected,
    the molecular volume of these compounds associated with NMDA receptor cut-off is also
    quite different, with the primary amine being over 3 times larger than the alkane.
    DISCUSSION
    [01971     NMDA receptor modulation is associated with an approximate 1.1 mM water
15  solubility cut-off (Figure 4). In contrast, GABAA receptors potentiated all studied
    compounds, suggesting that either a GABAA cut-off occurs at a lower water solubility value
    or possibly that GABAA receptors lack such a cut-off. Increasing a single hydrocarbon length
    to find a receptor cut-off effect introduces confounding factors of carbon number and
    molecular volume that could in turn be responsible for the cut-off effect (Eger, et al., Anesth
20  Analg (1999) 88:1395-1400; Jenkins, JNeurosci(2001) 21:RC136; Wick, Proc NatlAcad
    Sci USA (1998) 95:6504-6509; Eger,Anesth Analg (2001) 92:1477-1482). An aggregate
    comparison of cut-off values for all functional groups as a function of carbon number (Figure
    5) or molecular volume (Figure 6) shows no discernible pattern, suggesting that these
    physical properties are unlikely the primary limiting factors for drug-receptor modulation.
25  [0198]     Nonetheless, although the correlation between cut-off and molar water solubility is
    very good, it is not perfect. Some variability is due simply to the lack of compounds of
    intermediate solubility within a functional group series. For example, pentanethiol inhibited
    NMDA receptors, whereas the 1-carbon longer hexanethiol did not (Table 3). This pre-cut
    off thiol is nearly 3-times more soluble in water than its post-cut-off cognate; yet it is not
30  possible to obtain a more narrowly defined cut-off delineation for 1-thiols. Even larger
    variability was observed with the dialkylbenzene series, to which 1 additional carbon was

   WO 2014/011235                                                                PCT/US2013/031668
    added to each 1- and 3-alkyl group. The solubility ratio between the NMDA antagonist 1,3
    dimethylbenzene and its cut-off cognate 1,3-diethylbenzene is more than 18 (Table 3).
    [01991    Variability about the molar water solubility NMDA receptor cut-off may also have
    arisen from the use of calculated, rather than measured, values for hydrocarbon molar water
 5  solubility. Aqueous solubility is difficult to measure accurately, particularly for poorly
    soluble substances. Calculated solubilities are more accurate for small uncharged
    compounds, but still can have an absolute error within 1 log unit (Delaney, et al., Drug
    Discov Today (2005) 10:289-295). However, even predicted values for nonpolar n-alkanes
    may show large deviations from experimental data as the hydrocarbon chain length increases
10  (Ferguson, JPhys Chem B (2009) 113:6405-6414).
    [02001    Furthermore, the molar solubility values used in the present study were calculated
    for pure water at 25*C and at pH=7.0. These were not the conditions under which drug
    receptor effects were studied. Ringer's oocyte perfusates contained buffers and physiologic
    concentrations of sodium, potassium, and chloride resulting in a 250 mOsm solution. The
15  solubility of haloether and haloalkane anesthetic vapors vary inversely with osmolarity
    (Lerman, et al., Anesthesiology (1983) 59:554-558), as do the water-to-saline solubility ratio
    of benzenes, amines, and ketones (Long, et al., Chem Rev (1952) 51:119-169). The presence
    of salts could have caused overestimation of aqueous solubility for some compounds when
    using values calculated for pure water. Likewise, solubility is also temperature-dependent.
20  Studies were conducted at 22*C; solubility of gases in water should be greater than values
    calculated at 25*C. In contrast, most solutes used in the present study have negative enthalpy
    for dissolution (Abraham, et al., JAm Chem Soc (1982) 104:2085-2094), so solubility should
    be decreased at the lower ambient temperature. The reverse should occur for exothermic
    solutions, as predicted by the Le Chatelier principle. As for hydronium ion concentration, the
25  solubility of most study compounds is trivially affected at pH values between 7-to-8.
    However, hydrocarbons containing an amine group have pKa values that are closer to
    physiologic pH, and the calculated aqueous solubility of 1-eicosanamine and 1
    octadecanamine (Table 2) decreases by about 66% as pH increases from 7 to 8. Calculated
    molar water solubilities for the amines in this study were probably modestly overestimated at
30  a physiologic pH equal to 7.4.
    [0201]     Despite these inaccuracies inherent in calculated rather than experimentally
    measured values, an association between molar water solubility and NMDA receptor

    modulation cut-off remains evident. Anesthetics exhibit low-affinity binding on receptors;
    these weak interactions are inconsistent with an induced fit binding. Rather, anesthetics
    likely bind to pre-existing pockets and surfaces on or within the protein (Trudell, et al., Br J
    Anaesth (2002) 89:32-40). A critical water solubility for modulation implies that critical
 5  modulation sites are either hydrophilic or amphiphilic. Hydrocarbons act as hydrogen bond
    donors--or in the case of electrophiles, as hydrogen bond acceptors-with amino acid
    residues on anesthetic-sensitive receptors, resulting in displacement of water molecules from
    these binding pockets and alteration of protein function (Bertaccini, et al., Anesth AnaIg
    (2007) 104:318-324; Abraham, et al., JPharmSci (1991) 80:719-724; Streiff, et al., JChem
10  Inf Model (2008) 48:2066-2073). These low energy anesthetic-protein interactions are
    postulated to be enthalpically favorable since the displaced water molecules should be better
     able to hydrogen bond with like molecules in the bulk solvent rather than with amino acids
     (Bertaccini, et al., Anesth AnaIg (2007) 104:318-324; Streiff, et al., JChem Inf Model (2008)
     48:2066-2073). Halothane and isoflurane both have been shown to bind in water accessible
15   pockets formed between a-helices in S-subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
     (Chiara, et al., Biochemistry (2003) 42:13457-13467), a member of the 4-transmembrane
     receptor superfamily that includes the GABAA receptor. Models of nicotinic acetylcholine
     receptors and GABAA receptors further suggest that endogenous agonist or anesthetic binding
     might increase water accumulation in hydrophilic pockets and increase the number and
20   accessibility of hydrophilic sites that are important for channel gating (Willenbring, et al.,
     Phys Chem Chem Phys (2010) 12:10263-10269; Williams, et al., Biophys J(1999) 77:2563
     2574). However, molecules that are insufficiently water soluble may not be able to displace
     enough water molecules at enough critical sites in order to modulate channel function.
      [0202]    NMDA receptor modulation by inhaled anesthetics such as isoflurane, xenon, and
25   carbon dioxide occurs-at least in part-at hydrophilic agonist binding sites (Brosnan, et al.,
     Anesth Anaig (2011) 112:568-573; Dickinson, et al., Anesthesiology (2007) 107:756-767).
     Yet despite evidence that hydrophilic interactions are important to hydrocarbon modulation
     of anesthetic-sensitive receptors, the minimum hydrocarbon hydrophilicity required to exert
     anesthetic-like effects is different between NMDA and GABAA receptors. As these receptors
30   belong to different and phylogenetically distinct superfamilies, it seems likely that either the
      number of displaced water molecules required to effect modulation and/or the relative
      affinities of the hydrocarbon versus water molecule for a critical hydrophilic protein pocket
      and/or the number of hydrophilic sites necessary for allosteric modulation should also be

    different between proteins. Put another way, there is a minimum number of hydrocarbon
    molecules-no matter the type-that is required to interact with NMDA receptors to alter ion
    channel conductance, and this number is significantly greater than that necessary to alter
                                                                                            exhibit
    GABAA receptor ion channel conductance. Implied is that other ion channels should
 5  hydrocarbon cut-off effects that correlate with molar water solubility, and these solubility
    cut-off values will likely be more similar between channels having a common phylogeny than
    cut-off values between distantly or unrelated proteins.
    [02031     Hydrocarbons below the water solubility cut-off presumably have insufficient
    molecules in the aqueous phase to successfully compete with water at hydrophilic modulation
10  or transduction sites on a receptor alter its function. Likewise, transitional compounds and
    nonimmobilizers predicted by the Meyer-Overton correlation to produce anesthesia either
    have lower than expected potency or lack anesthetic efficacy altogether. And like NMDA
    cut-off hydrocarbons in the present study, transitional compounds and nonimmobilizers all
    share a common property of low aqueous solubility (Eger EI, 2nd. Mechanisms of Inhaled
15  Anesthetic Action In: Eger EI, 2nd, ed. The Pharmacology of Inhaled Anesthetics. IL, USA:
    Baxter Healthcare Corporation, 2002;33-42). Nonimmobilizers such as 1,2
    dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane fail to depress GABAA-dependent pyramidal cells
    (Perouansky, et al., Anesth Analg (2005) 100:1667-1673) or NMDA-dependent CAl neurons
    (Taylor, et al., Anesth Analg (1999) 89:1040-1045) in the hippocampus, and likely lack these
20  effects elsewhere in the central nervous system. With decreasing water solubility, there is
    differential loss of receptor effects-such as occurred with NMDA receptors versus GABAA
    receptors in the present study. The anesthetic cut-off effect in whole animal models
    correlates with agent water solubility, and might be explained by the loss of one or more
    anesthetic-receptor contributions to central nervous system depression. Conversely, receptor
25  molar water solubility cut-off values may be used to define those ion channels that are sine
    qua non for volatile anesthetic potency. Inhaled agents likely act via low affinity interactions
    with multiple cell receptors and ion channels to decrease neuronal excitability in the brain
     and spinal cord, but a loss or inadequate contribution from certain targets-perhaps GABAA
     or glycine receptors-as water solubility decreases may render a drug a nonimmobilizer.
30   Additionally, agents having a water solubility below the cut-off value for some anesthetic
     sensitive receptors may also produce undesirable pharmacologic properties, such as seizures
     following the loss of GABAA receptor modulation (Raines, Anesthesiology (1996) 84:663
     671). In contrast, NMDA receptors can contribute to immobilizing actions of conventional

    volatile anesthetics,43 but they are not as a general principle essential for inhaled anesthetic
    action since an agent like pentane does not modulate NMDA receptors-even at a saturated
    aqueous concentration (Table 3)-yet has a measurable minimum alveolar concentration
    (Liu, et al., Anesth Analg (1993) 77:12-18; Taheri, et al., Anesth Analg (1993) 77:7-11).
 5  [0204]     Although only water solubility was predictive of NMDA receptor cut-off, size and
                                                                                                   in
    shape nonetheless must be able influence this effect. Most of the hydrocarbons examined
    the present study had functional groups located on the 1- or 2-carbon position. However, the
    ethers were all 1,1 '-oxybisalkanes; each member of the ether consisted of symmetrical 1
    carbon additions to alkyl groups on either side of the oxygen atom (Table 2). Hence this
10  electron-rich oxygen atom allowing hydrogen bonding with water molecules or amino acid
    residues with strong partial positive charges lies buried in the middle of the ether.
    Consequently, for hydrocarbons with equivalent molar water solubilities, it may be more
    difficult for dialkyl ether to form hydrogen bonds in hydrophilic receptor pockets compared
    to a long primary amine (Table 2) that might more easily insert its nucleophilic terminus into
15  the anesthetic-binding pocket while the long hydrophobic carbon chain remains in the lipid
    membrane. This may explain why ethers in this study appear to exhibit an NMDA cut-off
    that is slightly greater than hydrocarbons with other functional groups. Perhaps if a methyl
    alkyl ether series were used instead of a dialkyl ether series, the apparent molar water
     solubility cut-off for this group would have been lower.
20   [02051     As the hydrocarbon chain lengthened within any functional group, the efficacy of
     GABAA receptor modulation also tended to increase. This is consistent with the Meyer
     Overton prediction of increased anesthetic potency as a function of increasing hydrophobicity
     (Mihic, et al., Mol Pharmacol(1994) 46:851-857; Horishita, et al., Anesth Analg (2008)
     107:1579-1586). However, the efficacy by which NMDA receptors were inhibited by
25   hydrocarbons prior to the cut-off varied greatly between functional groups. Most compounds
     caused about 25-to-40% inhibition of NMDA receptor currents. However, the alkane n
     butane almost completely inhibited NMDA receptor currents prior to cut-off, whereas the
     thiol 1-pentanethiol caused only 15% NMDA receptor current inhibition. Since solubility
     values are discontinuous within a hydrocarbon series, it is not possible to evaluate changes in
30   modulation efficacy as solubility asymptotically approaches a cut-off within a hydrocarbon
     functional group series. Perhaps agents that are closer to the critical molar water solubility
     required for receptor modulation begin to lose potency despite increasing drug lipophilicity.
     If so, differences in NMDA receptor efficacy may reflect the relative difference between this

    theoretical critical molar water solubility and the aqueous solubility of the pre-cut-off test
    agent.
    [02061     Finally, discrete and distinct water solubility cut-off values for anesthetic-sensitive
    receptors offer the possibility of a structure-activity relationship that may aid new
 5  pharmaceutical design. Anesthetics produce a number of desirable effects, such as analgesia
    and amnesia, and a number of side effects, such as hypotension and hypoventilation.
    Different pharmacodynamic properties are likely mediated by different cell receptors or
    channels or combinations thereof. Thus, by modifying a compound to decrease its water
     solubility below the NMDA receptor cut-off, absolute specificity for GABAA versus NMDA
10  receptors may be obtained and those side-effects mediated by NMDA receptor inhibition
     should be reduced or eliminated. Conversely, highly insoluble agents could be modified to
     increase the molar water solubility above the NMDA cut-off in order to add desirable
    pharmacologic effects from this receptor, provided that the immobilizing versus NMDA
     receptor median effective concentrations are not sufficiently different as to maintain relative
15   receptor specificity. At the same time, differential cut-off values suggest an important limit
     to drug design. It will probably not be possible to design an anesthetic with low-affinity
     receptor binding that exhibits absolute specificity for NMDA receptors while having no effect
     on GABAA receptors up to a saturating aqueous concentration. Only if the minimum alveolar
     concentration and the anesthetic potency at NMDA receptors are much greater than the
20   anesthetic potency at GABAA receptors might relative anesthetic specificity for NMDA
     receptors be achieved.

    specificity cut-off value equal to about 1.1 mM with a 95% confidence interval between
    about 0.4 and about 2.9 mM (calculated molar solubility in water at pH=7). Compounds
    more soluble than this threshold value can negatively modulate NMDA receptors and

    only positively modulate GABAA receptors. We have also identified approximate water

    evidence of inflammation or toxicity. As predicted by its water solubility, 1,1,2,2,3,3,4

     concentration. Despite a lack of NMDA receptor effects, 1,1,2,2,3,3,4
30   heptafluorocyclopentane is able to produce the desired pharmacologic endpoints of
     unconsciousness and immobility that appears similar to desirable effects produced by
     conventional agents.

    [0210]     To our knowledge, no new inhaled anesthetics are currently under development
    because of an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of action and activity-structure
    relationships of these agents. Inhalation anesthetics have among the lowest therapeutic
    indices (low safety margin) of drugs in routine clinical use; there is a need to develop newer
 5  and safer agents. We have identified a physical property (molar water solubility) that is
    important to determining whether an anesthetic can modulate channels or receptors that
    contribute to immobility and amnesia. We have applied this knowledge in order to identify a
    novel volatile anesthetic of clinical use (HFCP) which also lacks NMDA receptor
    modulation.

            1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5-octafluorocyclopentane (CAS# 828-35-3) Induces Anesthesia
    [0211]     1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5-octafluorocyclopentane (CAS# 828-35-3) caused a loss of righting
    reflex in 4 healthy Sprague-Dawley rats at a concentration of 3.3 0.4 (mean SD) percent of
     1 atmosphere. This agent has a faint but pleasant odor and induced anesthesia very rapidly
15  without excitement or coughing. After discontinuing the agent, rats were awake and
    ambulatory in less than 1 minute. As predicted by its water solubility, 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5
    octafluorocyclopentane potentiates GABAA, glycine, and some inhibitory potassium channels
    in vitro, but has no effect on NMDA receptors up to a saturating aqueous concentration.
    Despite a lack of NMDA receptor effects, 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5-octafluorocyclopentane is able to
20  produce the desired pharmacologic endpoints of unconsciousness and immobility that appears
    similar to desirable effects produced by conventional agents.

    techniques of direct hypofluorite addition and reverse hypofluorite addition, described, e.g.,
25   in Navarrini, et al., JournalofFluorine Chemistry (2008), 129(8), 680-685.
     [0217]    In a typical direct hypofluorite addition, a stream of hypofluorite is bubbled into a
     solution of an olefin maintained at the desired temperature in a semi-batch method in order to
     operate in excess of olefin. The addition reactor can be standard dimensions designed 250 ml
     American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) 316 stainless steel cooled by an external vessel. The

    reactor can be realized with a discharge bottom valve and two feeding tubes. The reactor's
    head can be equipped with: an outgoing tube for collecting the off-gas stream and a
    mechanical/magnetic transmission stirring system. The feed of the addition reactor and the
    off-gases can be analysed on-line, e.g., via infrared (IR), gas chromatography-thermal
 5  conductivity detector (GC-TCD) and gas chromatography-infrared (GC-IR). At the end of
    the addition, the reactor can be stripped with 4 nL/h of helium for about 30 min, the vessel is
    unloaded and the resulting mixture analysed, e.g., via gas chromatography (GC), GC- mass
                                                                  9
    spectrometry (MS) e nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1 F. The raw reaction mixture can
    be distilled in vacuum or at atmospheric pressure.
10  [0218]     In a typical reverse hypofluorite addition, a stream of olefin is bubbled into a
    solution of hypofluorite in order to operate in excess of hypofluorite at the desired
    temperature. The reaction can be carried out in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR)
    with a continuous feed of both the reagents. The reactor is charged with the solvent, cooled
    at the desired temperature and a gaseous stream comprising CF 30F (2.35 nL/h), He
15  (2.5 nL/h), COF2 (0.3 nL/h) is fed in the reactor (e.g., for about 12 min) before starting to add
    the olefin. After adding the olefin, for safety reasons it is compulsory to eliminate the
    residual hypofluorite before opening the reactor. In order to remove the majority of the
    overloaded hypofluorite from the bulk, the liquid phase can be stripped with a stream of 4
    nL/h of helium for about 30 min at the temperature between -80 and -90*C, after that
20  maintaining the temperature in the range -80 to -90*C about 2 ml of CFCl=CFCl can be
    added in the reactor to eliminate the remaining traces of hypofluorite. The traces of CF 30F
    react completely with CFCl=CFCl producing CF 30-CFCl-CF 2CL.

     [02201    A halogenated cyclopentane or halogenated cyclohexane can be synthesized by
    reduction of a halogenated cycloalkene with lithium aluminum hydride, as described, for
20   example, by Evans, et al., Journalof the Chemical Society (1963), (Oct.), 4828-34. In this
     approach, a (poly)fluorocycloalkene is mixed with lithium aluminum hydride in ether,
     producing several species of (poly)fluorocycloalkenes in an addition-elimination process.
     These (poly)fluorocycloalkenes can be characterized and several (poly)fluorocycloalkanes
     and related compounds can be made from them. Elimination is the most important reaction
25   of such systems, and a possible pathway for a cis-E2-process. For reaction of the
     polyfluorocycloalkene with lithium aluminum anhydride, the (poly)fluorocycloalkene is
     added dropwise to a stirred suspension of lithium aluminum hydride in diethyl ether at -20*C.
     When the initial reaction subsides, the solution is refluxed, then cooled to -20*C and 50% v/v
     sulphuric acid is added dropwise, followed by water until no precipitate remained. The dried
30   (MgSO 4) ethereal solution is evaporated through a vacuum-jacketed column (1' x 1%")
     packed with glass helices to leave a mixture of (poly)fluorocycloalkenes (180 g.) which is
     separated by preparative gas chromatography (column type B, 100*C, N 2 flow-rate 60 I./hr.).
      1H-Nonafluorocyclohexene prepared in this way contained a trace of ether which can be
                                                    92

    removed by a second gas-chromatographic separation in a column of type A packed with
    tritolyl phosphate-kieselguhr (1:3). The double bond of the (poly)fluorocycloalkenes can be
    readily saturated, e.g., by fluorination with cobaltic fluoride, or by catalytic hydrogenation at
    atmospheric pressure to produce the corresponding desired (poly)fluorocycloalkane.
 5  Characterization of the (poly)fluorocycloalkenes (poly)fluorocycloalkanes can be performed
    using standard methodologies, including, e.g., oxidation, NMR spectroscopy, mass
    spectroscopy, resistance to alkali, and gas chromatography.
    [02211     The vapour-phase fluorination of a cycloalkadiene with cobaltic fluoride to produce
    the corresponding (poly)fluorocycloalkane and the alternative synthesis of the
10  (poly)fluorocycloalkane starting from a (poly)fluorocycloalkene, fluorinating with cobaltic
    fluoride and then reducing with lithium aluminum hydride are described, for example, by
    Heitzman, et al., Journalof the Chemical Society (1963), 281-9. For vapour-phase
    fluorination of a cycloalkadiene, the cycloalkadiene is fed into a reactor containing cobalt
    trifluoride maintained at 190*C-250 0C. The products are collected in a copper trap cooled by
15  solid carbon dioxide and any remaining in the reactor is swept into the trap by a gentle stream
    of nitrogen. The total product is poured into ice-water and washed with sodium hydrogen
    carbonate solution. The clear organic layer is separated, and a resin discarded. The
    combined products are distilled through a vacuum-jacketed column (4' x 1") packed with
    Dixon gauze rings (1/16" x 1/16"). The distillation is controlled by analytical gas
20  chromatography. For synthesis of the (poly)fluorocycloalkanes the corresponding
    (poly)fluorocycloalkenes, the (poly)fluorocycloalkene is first chlorinated and then reduced.
    For chlorination, the olefin and liquid chlorine are irradiated with ultraviolet light for 4 hr. in
    a quartz flask fitted with a condenser at -78*C. The excess of chlorine is removed by washing
    the products with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (10% w/v). The
25  (poly)chlorofluorocycloalkane product is dried (P20 5) and distilled, and can be analyzed by

    (poly)chlorofluorocycloalkane product in dry ether is added to a stirred suspension of lithium
    aluminum hydride in dry ether at 0*C. The apparatus is fitted with a condenser cooled to

30  00C by the careful addition of water followed by hydrochloric acid (10% v/v) to dissolve the
    solid. The ethereal layer is distilled through a column (2' x %") and the residue can be
    analyzed by gas chromatography and infrared spectroscopy.

    halogenated alkenes, e.g., as described by Navarrini, et al., J FluorineChem 71:111-117
15  (1995) or by reaction of chloroalkoxyfluorocarbonyl halides or ketones with fluoride ions,

    bis(fluoroxy)difluoromethane (usually about 1 liter per hour flow rate) diluted with He in a
25   1:5 ratio is then fed into the reactor until 90% of the olefin is converted. At the end of the
    addition, helium is bubbled through the reaction mixture to remove traces of unreacted
    CF 2(OF) 2 . The dioxolanes are isolated via fractional distillation using an HMS 500 C
     Spaltrohr Fischer apparatus. In a general procedure for a continuous system,
     bis(fluoroxy)difluoromethane at a flow rate of about 0.4 liters per hour diluted with He (about
30   2 liters per hour) and the olefin (36 mmol per hour) are simultaneously but separately fed, at

30  perfluorinated dibasic ester, cyclizing the diol to an ether, chlorinating the cyclic ether to
    produce a perhalogenated cyclic ether, and then fluorinating the perhalogenated cyclic ether

    in dry ether to give the diol. The diol can be recrystallized, e.g., from benzene. For
    cyclization, a mixture of the glycol and concentrated sulfuric acid (10 g. or 0.1 mole) is kept
    in an oil bath at a temperature in the range of about 185'C to about 250'C. The cyclic ether
    which distilled over can be dried, e.g., with Drierite, and redistilled. For chlorination of the
 5  cyclic ether, the cyclic ether is placed in a quartz flask illuminated with a sun lamp or UV
    lamp. Chlorine is bubbled through for two days. An ice-cooled trap attached to the reflux
    condenser caught entrained material, which is returned from time to time. For fluorination of
    the cyclic ether to produce the perfluorinated cyclic ether, the cyclic ether and SbF 3Cl 2 are
    heated at 155*C for 24 hours in a steel bomb. The pressure rises to about 230 p.s.i. and drops
10  to about 50 p.s.i. on cooling to room temperature. This pressure is released into a Dry Ice
    trap which collects raw perfluorinated cyclic ether. For larger rings, a two-step procedure
    may be applied. The cyclic ether and SbF 3CI2 are heated to 125*C for seven hours in a 450
    ml. steel bomb, with shaking. The pressure rises to about 75 p.s.i. The temperature is raised
    to 160*C for 16 hours, which raises pressure to 280 p.s.i. After cooling, a light fraction is
15  collected by distillation. The light fraction and SbF 3Cl 2 are shaken at 160'C for five hours in
    a bomb. The pressure rises to about 320 p.s.i. After cooling, repeated distillation of the
    crude product gives the desired perfluorinated cyclic ether. This perfluorinated cyclic ether
    can be purified by passage through two 10% HC1 bubblers to remove traces of antimony
    salts, concentrated H2 S0 4 to remove unsaturated impurities and finally distilled from P20 5 .
20  The purified material can be analyzed, e.g., by GLC, IR, MS and/or NMR.

    voltage of 5.0~6.2 V, and a cell temperature of about 5-6"C over a period of 437 min (234
10  Ahr) until the cell voltage rose rapidly up to 9.0 V. Initially, the products collected in cold

30  tube, 9.1m x 7mm i.d.) to give a pure sample of each product. As appropriate or desired, the
     fluorinated products can be isomerized. The apparatus used for isomerization can be an
     electrically-heated hard glass tube (320mm x 25mm i.d.), packed with a 1:1 mixture of
     aluminium fluoride and small glass spheres. Before use, this is heated to 280*C for 24 h,
