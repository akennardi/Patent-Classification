    INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
 5           This application is a divisional application based on Australian Application No.
    2015276941, which claims priority to provisional application USSN 62/014,245, filed on 19

    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 0           The present invention provides parasiticidal indole derivatives and oral, topical or
    injectable veterinary compositions comprising an indole derivative active agent for controlling
    liver flukes in mammals. The use of these compounds and compositions against liver flukes and
    methods for treating parasitic infections and infestations in mammals is presented herein.
 5  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
             Animals such as mammals (including humans) are often susceptible to parasite infections
    and infestations. These parasites may be ectoparasites, such as insects, and endoparasites such as
    filariae and other worms. Production animals, such as cows, pigs, sheep and goats, can be
    infected with one or more trematodes. Of particular concern here is Fasciolahepatica (i.e., liver
 '0 fluke or F. hepatica).
             Liver flukes are a particular problem because they adversely affect the health of the
    animal or human and can inflict significant economic loss in a domestic livestock population. It
    is estimated that F. hepaticaposes a risk to at least 250 million sheep and 350 million cattle
    worldwide. Moreover, domestic animals other than sheep and cows may serve as intermediate
25  hosts. Liver flukes can cause liver condemnation, secondary infections, reduced milk and meat
    production, abortion and fertility problems.
             Several types of control measures for liver flukes have been introduced over the past
    century. First, halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., CCl 4 ; carbon tetrachloride) were introduced for
    ruminants in the 1920s. Halogenated hydrocarbons had limited success and are no longer used
30  primarily because of their adverse effects and variable efficacy. Second, halogenated phenols
    were administered in the late 1950s (e.g., hexachlorophene and bithionol sulfoxide) followed by
                                                       1

      WO 2015/196014                                                            PCT/US2015/036580
the similar halogenated salicylanilides (e.g., oxyclozanide, bromoxanide). Fourth, benzimidazole
carbamates (e.g., albendazole, luxabendazole) were found to have a broad anthelmintic spectrum
against nematodes and mature F. hepatica. Another benzimidazole - the chlorinated
methylthiobenzimidazole derivative triclabendazole - has a high success rate against F. hepatica.
Fifth, bisanilino compounds introduced in the 1960s were intolerable due to toxic side effects.
Finally, benzene sulfonamides (e.g., clorsulon) were studied in the 1970s. Extensively modified
examples of this class demonstrate high efficacy on both mature and immature F. hepatica.Of
these six classes of anthelmintics the benzimidazole class is perhaps the most widely used for its
high efficacy.
        Indeed, triclabendazole is the current drug of choice against mature and immature liver
flukes. Not surprisingly, however, reports of parasite resistance are increasing. For example,
Mottier et al., report that a population of resistant F. hepatica (Sligo) may use an altered
influx/efflux mechanism to selectively decrease the amount of triclabendazole and
triclabendazole sulfoxide but not albendazole. See Mottier et al., J. Parasitol., 92(6), 2006, pp.
1355-1360. McConville et al., report that juvenile triclabendazole-resistant F. hepatica are
somewhat susceptible to compound alpha (i.e., 5-chloro-2-methylthio-6-(1-naphthyloxy)-1H
benzimidazole) via a tubulin-independent mechanism. See McConville et al., Parasitol. Res.,
(2007) 100:365-377. Further, Keiser et al., report the testing of artemether and OZ78 in
triclabendazole-resistant F. hepatica, although at high concentrations. For a short review of
triclabendazole resistance see Brennan et al., Experimental and Molecular Pathology, 82, (2007)
pp. 104-109.
        There is, however, little in the literature disclosing indoles as a treatment for trematodes.
Derquantel is in a class known as spiroindoles and is paired with a macrocyclic lactone for
greater efficacy against sheep nematodes (e.g., gastrointestinal and respiratory parasites) but no
data is currently available as to the effectiveness of derquantel against trematodes.
        Other indole compounds have demonstrated an effect on F. hepatica. Indolamines such
as serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) have a stimulant effect on the rhythmical activity of the
trematode that is antagonized by other compounds also having an indole structure (e.g.,
bromolysergic acid diethylamide and yohimbine; Mansour, Brit. J. Pharmacol.(1957), 12, 406.)
        WO 2007/051619 discloses aryl indole derivatives as pesticides. The '619 application
speculates that the aryl indole derivatives that it discloses would be effective against trematodes
                                                    2

      WO 2015/196014                                                           PCT/US2015/036580
such as F. hepatica but offers evidence only against the dog tick, the cat flea, and certain
gastrointestinal nematodes.
         WO 2012/125662 discloses indole derivatives useful as ccr2 (i.e., chemokine receptor
type 2) antagonists. The '662 application further speculates that the compounds of its disclosure
may be effective against trematodes but offers no evidence of such.
         Similarly, WO 2012/059232 discloses carbazole and carboline derivatives, and
preparation and therapeutic applications thereof. The compounds reportedly are useful against
proliferative diseases and parasitic diseases. The authors present evidence that some compounds
disclosed inhibit tubulin polymerization for possible application against proliferative diseases but
no evidence is presented for activity against trematodes.
         The resistance to triclabendazole and lack of effective substitutes creates a pressing need
in the field for alternatives that exhibit low side effects and that do not contaminate the animals
as a food source. Optimal compositions should further be efficacious, have a quick onset of
activity, have a long duration of activity, and be safe to the animal recipients and their human
owners.

Experimental Procedure and Results
         Representative compounds of formula (I) were tested in vitro against F. hepatica as
follows. Adult F. hepatica (fluke) were collected from infected bovine livers obtained from a
local abattoir (Basel, Switzerland). The worms were quickly washed with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and
placed in 6 or 12-well plates (Costar). Culture medium in each well contained RPMI 1640
(Gibco) at 37 C, which was supplemented with antibiotics (50 gg/ml streptomycin and 50 IU/ml
penicillin; Gibco) and 80 gg/ml of a haemin solution. The haemin solution was prepared as
follows: 5mg haemin was dissolved in 1ml of 0.1M aqueous solution of NaOH, and 3.95 ml of
                                                  14

PBS (pH   =  7.4) and 0.05 ml of IM HCl were added to adjust the pH to 7.1-7.4 (Keiser and
Morson, 2008). Cultures were kept at 37    oC  in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . To monitor the
temporal effects of test compounds in vitro, 3 flukes were incubated for 72 h in the presence of
50 or 100 gg/ml of each test compound. At 24, 48, and 72 h, worms were examined using a
dissecting microscope. For the adult worms, a viability scale ranging from 3 (normal
movements) to 0 (death; no movement observed for two min using a microscope) was used. Test
compounds that showed activity at a concentration of 50 gg/ml were further evaluated at lower
concentrations (20 gg/ml, 10 gg/ml, 5 gg/ml, 2.5 gg/ml, 1.25 gg/ml and 0.625 gg/ml).
        Table 1 lists representative compounds of formula (I) of the present invention and their
effective in vitro concentrations against F. hepatica. All compounds were tested in vitro on the
adult stage of F. hepaticaas described above. Each data point refers to at least two independent
experiments having at least three worms per concentration.

        Further testing employed a fluke motility assay. Compounds 332, 336 and 351 were
screened for activity against liver fluke newly-excysted juveniles (NEJs) in a digital image-based
motility assay, based on measurement of the rate of change in worm length (gm/min) during
peristaltic motility. Newly excised worms were immediately placed into a solution of drug in
RPMI (final concentrations 10 M - lnM), alongside untreated and vehicle controls, and
triclabendazole/triclabendazole sulfoxide (i.e., TCBZ/TCBZ-SO) at matching concentrations, for
a period of 18h. Each treatment group consisted of 15-20 NEJs. Compounds 332 (Figure ID),
336 (Figure 1E) and 351 (Figure IF) showed more potent inhibition of motility than either TCBZ
(Figure 1A) or TCBZ-SO (Figure IB; both effective only at 10 gM). Compounds 332 and 351
completely abolished motility at 1 gM, while compound 336 significantly impacted motility at
100 nM. See Figure 1. Each data point represents mean length change (um/min) in an individual
worm during a five minute recording period. Horizontal lines represent data set means. *         p<

and EP 0 677 054.
        Macrocyclic lactones are either natural products or are semi-synthetic derivatives thereof.
The structure of the avermectins and milbemycins are closely related, e.g., by sharing a complex
16-membered macrocyclic lactone ring. The natural product avermectins are disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,310,519 and the 22,23-dihydro avermectin compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,199,569. Mention is also made of U.S. Patent Nos. 4,468,390, 5,824,653, EP 0 007 812
Al, U.K. Patent Specification 1 390 336, EP 0 002 916, and New Zealand Patent No. 237 086,
inter alia. Naturally occurring milbemycins are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,950,360 as well
as in the various references cited in "The Merck Index"    12 th ed., S. Budavari, Ed., Merck & Co.,
Inc. Whitehouse Station, New Jersey (1996). Latidectin is described in the "International
Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN)", WHO DrugInformation, vol. 17,
no. 4, pp. 263- 286, (2003). Semisynthetic derivatives of these classes of compounds are well
known in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,077,308, 4,859,657,

        In another embodiment, the invention comprises a composition comprising an indole
compound in combination with verapamil. Verapamil is believed to be an inhibitor of P
glycoprotein, which is a membrane protein that has been shown to efflux triclabendazole from
triclabendazole-resistant F. hepatica. Inhibiting the efflux mechanism could allow the
benzimidazole derivative to accumulate to toxic levels in the parasite.
        In another embodiment, the invention comprises a composition comprising an indole
compound in combination with a class of acaricides or insecticides known as insect growth
regulators (IGRs). Compounds belonging to this group are well known to the practitioner and
represent a wide range of different chemical classes. These compounds all act by interfering
with the development or growth of the insect pests. Insect growth regulators are described, for
example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,748,356, 3,818,047, 4,225,598, 4,798,837, 4,751,225, EP 0 179

least one indole active agent to the animal. The compositions and methods of the invention are
effective against endoparasites, trematodes in particular, of animals and humans.
        In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for the treatment and prevention of
parasitic infections and infestations of animals (either wild or domesticated), including livestock
and companion animals such as cats, dogs, horses, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle, with the aim of
ridding these hosts of liver flukes commonly encountered by such animals.
        By "treating" or "treat" or "treatment" is intended the application or administration of a
composition of the invention to an animal that has a parasitic infestation for the eradication of the
parasite or the reduction of the number of the parasites infesting the animal undergoing
treatment. It is noted that the compositions of the invention may be used to prevent such a
parasitic infestation.
 Additional Active Agents
        Additional veterinary/pharmaceutical active ingredients may be used in accordance with
all embodiments and aspects detailed above.
        In general, the additional active agent is included in the composition in an amount of
between about 0.1 tg and about 1000 mg. More typically, the additional active agent may be
included in an amount of about 10 tg to about 500 mg, about 1 mg to about 300 mg, about 10
mg to about 200 mg or about 10 mg to about 100 mg.
        In other embodiments of the invention, the additional active agent may be included in the
composition to deliver a dose of about 5 ptg/kg to about 50 mg/kg per weight of the animal. In
other embodiments, the additional active agent may be present in an amount sufficient to deliver
a dose of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, about 0.1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, or about 0.1
mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of weight of animal. In other embodiments, the additional active agent
may be present in a dose of about 5 ptg/kg to about 200 ptg/kg or about 0.1 mg/kg to about 1
mg/kg of weight of animal. In still another embodiment of the invention, the additional active
agent is included in a dose between about 0.5 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg.
        Optionally, a fragrance may be added to any of the compositions of the invention.
Fragrances which are useful for the invention include but are not limited to:
        (i)     carboxylic acid esters such as octyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, isopropyl acetate and
isobutyl acetate;
        (ii)    fragrant oils such as lavender oil.

        The compositions of the invention are made by mixing the appropriate amount of the
active agents, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and optionally a crystallization
inhibitor, antioxidant, preservative, film former, etc., to form a composition of the invention. In
some embodiments the composition can be obtained by following the method of making these
forms described above by the description of making these forms found in general formulation
text known to those in the art, e.g., Remington - The Science and PracticeofPharmacy (2 1 s
Edition) (2005), Goodman & Gilman's The PharmacologicalBasis of Therapeutics (1th
Edition) (2005) and Ansel's PharmaceuticalDosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (8 th
Edition), edited by Allen et al., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, (2005).
        The inventive formulations may contain other inert ingredients such as antioxidants,
preservatives, or pH stabilizers. These compounds are well known in the formulation art.
Antioxidants such as an alpha tocopherol, ascorbic acid, ascrobyl palmitate, fumaric acid, malic
acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium metabisulfate, n-propyl gallate, BHA (butylated hydroxy
anisole), BHT (butylated hydroxy toluene) monothioglycerol and the like, may be added to the
present formulation. The antioxidants are generally added to the formulation in amounts of from
about 0.01 to about 2.0%, based upon total weight of the formulation, such as about 0.05% to
about 1.0%.
        Preservatives, such as the parabens (methylparaben and/or propylparaben), are suitably
used in the formulation in amounts ranging from about 0.01% to about 2.0%, or about 0.05% to
about 1.0%. Other preservatives include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzoic
acid, benzyl alcohol, bronopol, butylparaben, cetrimide, chlorhexidine, chlorobutanol,
chlorocresol, cresol, ethylparaben, imidurea, methylparaben, phenol, phenoxyethanol,
phenylethyl alcohol, phenylmercuric acetate, phenylmercuric borate, phenylmercuric nitrate,
potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like.
Ranges for these compounds include from about 0.010%to about 50%.
        Compounds which stabilize the pH of the formulation are also contemplated. Again, such
compounds are well known to a practitioner in the art as well as how to use these compounds.
Buffering systems include, for example, systems selected from the group consisting of acetic
acid/acetate, malic acid/malate, citric acid/citrate, tataric acid/tartrate, lactic acid/lactate,
phosphoric acid/phosphate, glycine/glycimate, tris, glutamic acid/glutamates or sodium
carbonate.

         The compositions of the invention are administered in parasiticidally effective amounts
which are which are suitable to control the parasite in question to the desired extent, as described
below. In each aspect of the invention, the compounds and compositions of the invention can be
applied against a single pest or combinations thereof.
         The compositions of the invention may be administered continuously, for treatment or
prevention of parasitic infections or infestations. In this manner, the compositions of the
invention deliver an effective amount of the active compounds to the animal in need thereof to
control the target parasites. By "effective amount" is intended a sufficient amount of a
composition of the invention to eradicate or reduce the number of parasites infesting the animal.
         In some embodiments, an effective amount of the active agent achieves at least 70%
efficacy against the target parasite. In other embodiments, an effective amount of the active agent
achieves at least 80%, or at least 90% efficacy against the target pests. In other embodiments, an
effective amount of the active agent will achieve at least 95%, at least 98% or 100% efficacy
against the target parasites.
         Generally, a dose of from about 0.00 1 to about 100 mg per kg of body weight given as a
single dose or in divided doses for a period of from 1 to 5 days will be satisfactory, but there can
be instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are indicated, and such are within the scope of
this invention. It is well within the routine skill of the practitioner to determine a particular
dosing regimen for a specific host and parasite.
         Higher amounts may be provided for very prolonged release in or on the body of the
animal. In another treatment embodiment, the amount of active agents for animals which are
small in size is greater than about 0.01 mg/kg, and in another embodiment for the treatment of
small-sized animals the amount of active agents is between about 0.01 and about 20 mg/kg of
weight of animal.
         The solutions according to the invention may be applied using any means known per se,
e.g., using an applicator gun or a metering flask, pipette, syringes, roll on, droppers, capsules,
foil packages, vials, twist tip containers and other single dose and multi-dose containers.
         In another aspect of the invention, a kit for the treatment or prevention of a parasitic
infestation in an animal is provided, which comprises at least one isoxazoline active agent
together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a dispensing device for topical
application of the composition. The dispensing device may be a pipette, syringes, roll on,
                                                    32

      WO 2015/196014                                                          PCT/US2015/036580
droppers, capsules, foil packages, vials, twist tip containers and other single dose and multi-dose
containers, which includes an effective dose of each active agent in the pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier or diluent.
         An important aspect of the invention is to provide a multiple-use container comprising a
topical composition of the invention, from which accurate single dose aliquots of the long lasting
topical formulations may be administered. The formulation must remain stable with repetitive
exposure to the outside environment, particularly oxygen and water. This embodiment may be
particularly useful with the very long lasting formulations of the invention that require
administration to an animal infrequently, such as once every 3-6 months, or similar. Some
solvents such as ethers (including DMI (dimethyl isosorbide) and the like) give rise to peroxides,
which then yield ketones and aldehydes that may be further degraded to acids. The presence of
acids may contribute to the degradation of acid hydrolysis-susceptible molecules. Thus,
formulation stability is particularly important for the multi-dose container application, where the
formulations can be exposed to oxygen and water during multiple rounds of opening and closing.
Importantly, it was found that the use of certain antioxidants such as BHT and BHA efficiently
inhibit the degradation of the active agent in ether solvents. For example, a 12% (w/v) solution of
an indole compound of the invention in DMI exhibited no significant change in assay over the
course of an eleven week accelerated stability study at 50 'C in clear glass containers.
