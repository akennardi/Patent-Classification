 1.75D, etc.); and cylinder axis parameters may only be available in 100 steps (e.g., 10',
20', 30', etc.). Other Standard Product parameters and features offered in discrete steps
include but are not limited to base curve radii, diameter, stabilization profiles and thickness

volume element, representing a value on a regular or irregular grid in 3-dimensional space.
A Voxel may be viewed as a three dimensional pixel, however, wherein a pixel represents
2D image data a Voxel includes a third dimension. In addition, wherein Voxels are
frequently used in the visualization and analysis of medical and scientific data, in the
present invention, a Voxel is used to define the boundaries of an amount of actinic
radiation reaching a particular volume of Reactive Mixture, thereby controlling the rate of
crosslinking or polymerization of that specific volume of Reactive Mixture. By way of
example, Voxels are considered as existing in a single layer conformal to a 2-D mold
surface wherein the Actinic Radiation may be directed normal to the 2-D surface and in a
common axial dimension of each Voxel. As an example, specific volume of Reactive
Mixture may be crosslinked or polymerized according to 768x768 Voxels.
[0086]         A Lens may be fabricated based upon a desired Lens Design, via the use of
DMD Shows. Furthermore, a fabricated Lens may not conform to an Acceptance Criteria
of a Lens Design wherein an Iteration of a previous DMD Show may have to occur. For
example, an Iteration of a previous DMD Show may enable closer Convergence of a
desired Lens Design.
[0087]         Referring now to Fig. 1, a flowchart illustrates method steps that may be
followed to implement the present invention. At 101, in some embodiments, a Lens
surface may be examined for surface anomalies (e.g., blobs, dirt, etc), that may be present
on a Lens surface. At 102, upon determination that surface anomalies are present on a
Lens surface, a Lens may be discarded and a new Lens remade for example, by utilizing
the same settings of a previous DMD Show. At 103, upon determination that surface
anomalies are not present on a Lens surface, a PV value may be determined. If a PV is not
acceptable, at 104, parameters for a subsequent Iteration of a DMD Show may be created
and a new Lens made. If a PV is acceptable, at 105, a determination may be made of
whether a RMS is in a desired optic zone. If a RMS is not acceptable, at 104, parameters
for a subsequent DMD Show may be created and a new Lens made. If a RMS is

                                              15
acceptable, at 106, a determination may be made of whether a measured Lens meets other
thickness specifications (e.g., peripheral geometries). If other thickness specifications are
not acceptable, at 104, parameters for a subsequent Iteration of a DMD Show may be
created and an Iteration of a Lens made. If other thickness specifications are acceptable, at
 107, a Lens may be released for post processing.
[0088]          As discussed in the aforementioned method steps, there may be cases when
a previous DMD Show creates a Lens that does not conform to an Acceptance Criteria of a
Lens Design and a subsequent Iteration may be needed.
       [ 9      There may be a variety of one or more: techniques, modalities, and methods
utilized during a Convergence Process. When performing a Convergence Process, a
subsequent DMID Show instruction for a subsequent Iteration may be one or both of an
altered previous DMID Show instruction, a combination of a previous show instruction and
one or more of another DMD Show instruction, and a combination of two or more DMID
Shows. For example, two or more portions from one or multiple DMID Shows may be
combined together for a subsequent Iteration. Accordingly, an Iterative Loop of a
Convergence Process may be continuously repeated until a Lens meets an Acceptance
Criteria of a Lens Design.
[0090]          In some aspects of the present invention, a masking technique may be
implemented during a Convergence Process. In some embodiments, a masking technique
may include one or more of a radial masking technique, a sector masking technique, a
segment masking technique, and an area masking technique. In some related
embodiments, one or more of a masking technique may be applied to either: one DMD
Show, and two or more DMD Shows that may be used in a subsequent Iteration.
Additionally, one or more of a masking technique may be applied to a Training Region of
a Lens that may include one or both of a whole Lens, and one or more of a portion of a
Lens.
[0091]          Furthermore, performing a masking technique may be used to further
Converge a Lens Design even if a measured Lens already meets a desired Acceptance
Criteria. For example, a PV of a measured Lens may be acceptable, but performing a

                                               16
masking technique in a subsequent Iteration may cause Convergence of a Lens Design
even more closely and therefore, enable better performance of a Lens such as improving
vision with even more precision than it may have been without using a masking technique.
[0092]          Referring now to Figs. 2a-2d, illustrate various examples of different
masking techniques, in flat space. When implementing a masking technique a user may
specify one or more of a boundary inside of which a DMD Show may be used, and outside
of which a different DMD Show may be used.
[0093]          Referring now to Fig. 2a, illustrates an example of a radial masking
technique applied to a DMD Show. When using a radial masking technique for a
subsequent Iteration, one or more portions of one or more DMD Shows, may be specified
to occur within a certain radius 201. Additionally, one or more portions of one or more
different DMD Shows may be specified to occur within one or both of one or more radii of
a Lens Design, and an entire remaining portion of a Lens Design.
[0094]          Referring now to Fig. 2b, illustrates an example of a sector masking
technique applied to a DMD Show. When using a sector masking technique for a
subsequent Iteration, one or more portions of one or more DMD Shows, may be specified
to occur within a certain sector 202. Additionally, one or more portions, of one or more
different DMD Shows may be specified to occur within one or both of one or more sectors
of a Lens Design, and an entire remaining portion of a Lens Design.
[0095]          Referring now to Fig. 2c, illustrates an example a segment masking
technique applied to a DMD Show. When using a segment masking technique for a
subsequent Iteration, one or more portions of one or more DMD Shows, may be specified
to occur within a certain segment 203, 204. Additionally, one or more portions, of one or
more different DMD Shows may be specified to occur within one or both of one or more
segments of a Lens Design, and an entire remaining portion of a Lens Design.
[0096]          Referring now to Fig. 2d, illustrates an example an area masking technique
applied to a DMD Show. When using an area masking technique for a subsequent
Iteration, one or more portions of one or more DMID Shows, may be specified to occur

                                               17
within a certain area 205. Additionally, one or more portions, of one or more different
DMD Shows may be specified to occur within one or both of one or more areas of a Lens
Design, and an entire remaining portion of a Lens Design.
[0097]          One or more of a Blend Zone 206 may be specified when using a masking
technique. For example, one or more of a Blend Zone 206 may be applied when
implementing a masking technique and two or more portions 207, 208 taken from either
one DMD Show or two or more DMD Shows, do not connect to one another when they are
combined together in a subsequent DMD Show, as illustrated in Fig. 2e. A blend zone 206
exists between a portion 207 of the lens and an adjoining portion 208 of the lens. In each
blend zone, a property of the portion 207 of the lens and a property of the adjoining portion
208 of the lens are blended.
[0098]          In some additional aspects of the present invention, there may be different
Convergence modalities implemented during a Convergence Process either, by one or both
of a one-sided Convergence modality, and a two-sided Convergence modality. In some
embodiments, a two-sided Convergence modality may be used when performing an
Iteration of a previous DMD Show to Converge a Lens Design in a subsequent DMD
Show. For example, a previous show may create parts of a Lens that may be either one or
both of thicker than a Lens Design, and thinner than a Lens Design. When performing a
two-sided Convergence modality, an Iteration for a subsequent DMD Show may occur by
adjusting one or more of a parameter of both of an instruction that resulted in a Lens with
both one or more thicker areas and one or more thinner areas, than called for in a Lens
Design. Adjustments may occur at each pixel of a previous show for a subsequent show.
[0099]          A one-sided Convergence modality may also be implemented to Converge a
Lens Design in a subsequent DMID Show. When performing an Iteration of a previous
DMD Show, a one-sided Convergence modality may be performed by utilizing either one
or both of a thickening ratchet instruction, and a thinning ratchet instruction. For example,
a previous DMD Show may create areas of a Lens that may be either one or both of thicker
than a Lens Design, and thinner than a Lens Design. Iterations for a subsequent show
instruction may occur by one of either adjusting one or more parameters of an instruction
that needs to be decreased in value, and of an instruction that needs to be increased in

                                                 18
value. Accordingly, adjustments may occur at each pixel of selected areas for a subsequent
show instruction.
[0100]           Referring now to Fig. 3, illustrates a graphical representation in flat space,
of implementing a two-sided Convergence modality. In this example, the previous DMD
instruction 301 created the measured Lens 303 with areas 306 of the Lens that were
thinner than the target thickness 302, and areas 305 of the lens that were thicker than the
target thickness 302 of the desired Lens Design.
[0101]           At 300, illustrates applying a two-sided Convergence modality to the
subsequent DMID instruction 304. The subsequent DMD Show instruction 304 results in
decreasing instruction in areas 307 of the previous DMD Show instruction 301 that created
regions that were too thick on the measured Lens 303, in comparison to the target thickness
value 302. In areas 307 the subsequent instruction is reduced compared to the previous
instruction. Additionally, the subsequent DMID Show instruction results increasing
instruction in areas 308 of the previous DMD Show instruction 301 that created regions
that were too thin on the measured Lens 303, in comparison to the target thickness value
302.
[0102]           Referring now to Fig. 4, illustrates a graphical representation in flat space,
of implementing a one-sided Convergence modality by utilizing a thickening ratchet
instruction. In this example, the previous DMD instruction 401 created the measured Lens
403 with areas 406 of the Lens that were thicker than the target thickness and areas 407 of
the Lens that were thinner than the target thickness 402 of the Lens Design.
[0103]           At 400, illustrates applying a one-sided Convergence modality by utilizing a
thickening ratchet instruction 405 in the subsequent DMD Show instruction 404. The
subsequent DMD instruction 404 results in an increasing instruction only in areas 408 of
the previous DMD Show instruction 401 that created regions 407 that were too thin on the
measured Lens 403, in comparison to the target thickness value 402. Additionally, the
subsequent DMD instruction 404 remains unchanged from the previous show instruction
401 that created regions 406 of the measured Lens 403 that were too thick, in comparison
to the target thickness value 402. Therefore, for the subsequent Iteration, adjustments

                                               19
occur only to portions of the previous show that resulted in regions 407 that were too thin
on the measured Lens 403 while other areas 409 remain unchanged in the subsequent
DMD instruction 404. The previous instruction is to be used in regions 409 of the previous
instruction that created regions 406 of the measured lens 403 that were too thick, in
comparison to the target thickness value 402.
[0104]          Referring now to Fig. 5, illustrates a graphical representation in flat space,
of a one-sided Convergence technique by utilizing a thinning ratchet instruction. In this
example, the previous DMD instruction 501 created the measured Lens 503 with areas that
were both thicker 506 and thinner 507 than the target thickness 502 of the Lens Design.
[0105]          At 500, illustrates applying a one-sided Convergence modality by utilizing a
thinning ratchet instruction 505 in the subsequent DMID Show instruction 504. The
subsequent DMID instruction 504 results in only decreasing instruction of the previous
DMD Show instruction 501 that created regions 506 that were too thick on the measured
Lens 503, in comparison to the target thickness 502. Additionally, the subsequent DMD
instruction 504 remains unchanged from the previous show instruction 504 that created
areas 507 of the measured Lens 503 that were too thin, as compared to the target thickness
value 502. Therefore, for the subsequent Iteration, adjustments occur only to portions of
the previous show that resulted in regions 506 that were too thick on the measured Lens
503 while other areas remain unchanged in the subsequent DMID instruction 504. At 509,
the subsequent instruction is reduced compared to the previous instruction. At 508, the
previous instruction is used.
[0106]          In some further aspects of the present invention, various techniques
including one or both of an Apex locking technique and a piston-shifting technique may be
applied when implementing one or more the aforementioned Convergence modalities.
When performing an apex-locking technique an instruction at an apex from a previous
DMD Show may be adjusted up to a target thickness value. Furthermore, other selected
areas of a previous instruction may be adjusted up uniformly by a same amount as an apex
value and an apex may be locked so that it may be kept constant for other subsequent
DMD Shows.

                                                 20
[0107]          For example, when locking an apex control, instruction at an apex       (ICT) may
be adjusted up to a target thickness apex value and kept the same; this measured distance
between an ICT and a target thickness apex is a lock CT value. A lock CT value (A         h), may
be calculated by taking the difference between an ICT of a previous show and a target
thickness apex value of that same show. Subsequently, Ath may be added to every point of
an entire measured Lens surface, and may become a "modified" Lens thickness file for a
subsequent DMD Show. Consequently, a subsequent DMD Show instruction may create a
"modified" measured Lens and subsequently, be compared to a Lens Design.
[0108]          Additionally, performing an apex locking technique may be used to further
Converge a Lens Design even if a measured Lens already meets a desired Acceptance
Criteria. For example, a PV of a measured Lens may be acceptable, but performing an
apex locking technique in a subsequent Iteration may cause Convergence of a Lens Design
even more closely and therefore, enable better performance of a Lens such as improving
vision with even more precision than it may have been without using an apex locking
technique.
[0109]          Referring now to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, Fig. 6, illustrates a graphical
representation in flat space, of utilizing an apex locking technique when a Lens center
thickness is too thin, and Fig. 7, illustrates a graphical representation in flat space, of
utilizing an apex locking technique when a Lens center thickness is too thick.
Additionally, both Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, are examples in flat space, of a comparison between a
subsequent locked apex DMD instruction wherein the ICT remains the same as in the
previous show instruction 601 and 701, and a subsequent non-locked apex DMD
instruction 606 and 706, wherein the ICT may not remain the same as in the previous show
instruction 601 and 701. The target thickness 602, 702, is shown in Figures 6 and 7
respectively. Referring now again to Fig. 6, in this example, the previous DMD instruction
601 created the measured Lens 603, where the ICT is thinner than the target thickness 602
apex value of the desired Lens Design. Referring now again to Fig. 7, in this example, the
previous DMD instruction 701 created the measured Lens 703, where the ICT is thicker
than the target thickness 702 apex value of the desired Lens Design.

                                               21
[0110]          Referring now again to both Fig. 6, at 605, and Fig. 7, at 705, the temporary
adjusted measured Lens profile is created by comparing the difference between the ICT
value of the measured Lens 603 and 703, and the target thickness apex value 602 and 702,
and adjusting the subsequent instruction by Ah. At 606 and at 706, the subsequent non
locked apex instruction is calculated by adding Ah to every point on the entire measured
Lens 603 and 703, surface of a temporary adjusted measured Lens profile 605 and 705,
plus any selected additional amount and thereby, adjusting a subsequent instruction by that
total amount. At 604 and 704, the apex lock instruction is calculated by taking the
difference of the non-locked apex instruction 606 and 706, and the Ath, and subsequently,
adding the difference to every point on the measured Lens 603 and 703, surface except to
the ICT. Accordingly, the ICT remains the same as in the previous DMD instruction 601 and
701, and is kept constant during subsequent Iterations when going through an Iterative
Loop of a Convergence Process.
[0111]          In some other additional aspects of the present invention, when performing
a piston-shifting technique a uniform shift of a previous DMD Show instruction may be
done to one or more selected portions of a previous instruction by a selected amount.
Additionally, in some other embodiments, performing a piston shifting technique may be
used to further Converge a Lens Design even if a measured Lens already meets a desired
Acceptance Criteria. For example, a PV of a measured Lens may be acceptable, but
performing a piston shifting technique in a subsequent Iteration may cause Convergence of
a Lens Design even more closely and therefore, enable better performance of a Lens such
as improving vision with even more precision than it may have been without using a piston
shifting technique.
[0112]          Referring now to Fig. 8, illustrates a graphical representation in flat space,
of utilizing a piston-shifting technique. Additionally, at 800, is an example in flat space of
a comparison between a subsequent piston shifted DMD instruction 805, wherein a
uniform shift of one or more selected portions of the instruction of the previous show are
adjusted by a same amount, and a subsequent non-piston shifted DMD instruction 804. In
this example, the previous DMD instruction 801 created the measured Lens 803, with areas
of the Lens that were both thicker and thinner than the target thickness 802 of the desired
Lens Design. At 804, the subsequent non-piston-shifting instruction results by non-

                                              22
uniformly adjusting one or more of a selected portion of the previous DMD instruction 801
by one or more of various selected amounts. At 805, the subsequent piston-shift
instruction results by uniformly shifting one or more of a selected portion of the previous
DMD Show instruction 801 by a same selected amount.
[0113]           Various thickness correction methods may be utilized in a Convergence
Process to calculate a subsequent DMD Show instruction including one or more of an
arithmetic thickness correction method, a percentage thickness correction method, and a
secant thickness correction method. In cases where a Lens may not meet an Acceptance
Criteria, a thickness correction method may be selected based upon observation made by
someone skilled in the art.
[0114]           Adjustments may be made at each pixel of a previous DMD Show using a
selected thickness correction method to calculate a DMD Show instruction for a
subsequent Iteration. Selected data points of a previous show may go through one or both
of a Filtering process and a Surface Fitting process for a subsequent DMD Show prior to
applying a thickness correction method. A DMD Show may be Iterated to affect certain or
specific areas of a Lens. Accordingly, for example, subsequent Iterations of a previous
DMD Show may result in one or more of changing a whole Lens, one or both of reducing
certain apertures of a Lens and increasing certain apertures of a Lens (e.g., optic zone,
peripheral zone), and changing select regions of a Lens.
[0115]           Additionally, various gain magnitude factors may be applied to a
calculation of a subsequent DMD Show instruction. Furthermore, a gain magnitude factor
may be changed mid-stream during subsequent Iterations. For example, a gain factor of
200% applied to Iteration 3 may be dropped down to 150% at Iteration 5.
[0116]           If a DMD Show creates a Lens that does not meet an Acceptance Criteria,
an arithmetic thickness correction method may be used to calculate instructions for an
Iterative DMD Show. Tables 1 to 4 illustrate a display of data generated by utilizing an
arithmetic thickness correction method to calculate subsequent DMD Show instructions at
different iterations and applying various gain magnitude factors. The illustrated data is

                                                  23
generated by utilizing an arithmetic thickness correction method with application of
various gain magnitude factors that may be used to implement the present invention.

[0118]          To calculate an Iteration value for a subsequent DMD Show instruction set
using an arithmetic thickness correction method, a Delta thickness value may have to be
calculated. For example, a Delta thickness value may be equal to a target thickness value
of a target design minus a measured Lens thickness value created from a previous DMD
Show. Subsequent to a calculation of a Delta thickness value, a Delta thickness value may
be multiplied with an applicable gain magnitude factor amount selected and divided by

                                               25
 100, to determine a scaled Delta thickness value. A scaled Delta thickness value may be
added to a value of a previous show instruction. Use of the aforementioned formula may
occur at each pixel of a previous show to calculate a new value for each pixel for a
subsequent DMD Show.
[0119]          The formula for the arithmetic method are:
         A value= (Target Thickness - Measured Lens Thickness)
         Scaled Athvalue= (Ath value xGain Factor)
                                      100
         Subsequent DMD Show Instruction= Previous Instruction + Scaled Ath value
[0120]          Table 2 is an example of utilizing an arithmetic thickness correction method
and applying a 200% gain magnitude factor to subsequent Iterations of the previous show,
wherein the target thickness value of the Lens Design is .0900 mm and the measured Lens
thickness is .0750 mm. In this example, the Delta thickness value is 0.0150 mm, which is
calculated by subtracting the measured Lens thickness of 0.0750 mm from the target
thickness value of 0.0900 mm. Furthermore, the scaled Delta thickness value is 0.0300
mm, which is calculated by multiplying the Delta thickness value of 0.0150 mm by the
gain magnitude factor of 200%, and dividing that value by 100. Subsequently, the scaled
Delta thickness value of 0.0300 mm is added to the previous show value of 0.1250 mm,
giving the subsequent show instruction value of 0.1550 mm.
[0121]          If a DMD Show creates a Lens that does not meet desired Acceptance
Criteria a percentage thickness correction method may be used to calculate instructions for
an Iterative DMD Show. Referring now to Tables 5 to 7 which illustrate a display of data
generated by utilizing a percentage thickness correction method to calculate subsequent
DMD Show instructions at different iterations and applying various gain magnitude
factors. The illustrated data is generated by utilizing a percentage thickness correction
method with application of various gain magnitude factors that may be used to implement
the present invention.

[0122]          To calculate an Iteration value for a subsequent DMD Show instruction set
utilizing a percentage thickness correction method, a Delta instruction value may have to
be calculated. For example, a Delta instruction value may be equal to taking a previous
show value and multiplying it by an applicable gain magnitude factor followed by,
multiplying the resulting value by a target thickness value minus a measured Lens value.
Furthermore, the preceding value is divided by a measured Lens value, followed by
multiplying the resulting value by 100 and subsequently, adding the value to a previous
show value. Use of the aforementioned formula may occur at each pixel of a previous
show to calculate a new value for each pixel for a subsequent DMD Show. The formula
for the percentage method is as follows:
         Subsequent DMD Show Instruction=
  ((Previous Instruction x Gain Factor) x (Target Thickness - Measured Lens Thickness)
                                   (Measured Lens Thickness x 100)
[0123]          Table 6 is an example of utilizing a percentage thickness correction method
calculation and applying a 200% gain magnitude factor to subsequent Iterations of an
initial show, wherein the initial show is 0.125 mm, the target thickness is 0.090 mm, and
the measured Lens thickness is .0750 mm. In this example, the subsequent DMD Show
instruction is calculated by multiplying the initial show value of 0.125 mm by 200%,
followed by multiplying this value by 0.015 mm, which is value of the difference of the
target thickness value of 0.090 mm, and the measured Lens value of 0.075 mm, equaling
the value of 0.00375 mm. Subsequently, the Delta instruction a value of 0.05 mm is
calculated by dividing the value of 0.00375 mm by the measured Lens value of 0.075 mm.
Furthermore, the previous show value of 0.125 mm is subsequently added to the Delta
instruction value of 0.05 mm, resulting in the subsequent DMID Show instruction value of
0.175 mm.
[0124]          An Iteration value for a subsequent DMID Show instruction set may be
determined by utilizing a secant thickness correction method, which may be calculated by
using a secant method algorithm. A secant method is a root-finding algorithm that uses a
succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a functionf, and is
known to those skilled in the art.

[0125]          Various spatial gain methods may be applied when using one or more of the
aforementioned thickness correction methods. Spatial gain methods may include one or
both of a uniform (linear) spatial gain method, and a non-uniform spatial gain method.
Furthermore, a non-uniform spatial gain method may consist of two types including one or
both of a function based non-uniform spatial gain method, and a direct mapping spatial
gain method.
[0126]          When applying a uniform (linear) spatial gain method, a same thickness
correction method be applied across a designated Training Region wherein a gain
magnitude factor is equal at each pixel location. For example, all pixels within an optic
zone may be modified by the arithmetic method using a 100% gain magnitude factor.
When applying a non-uniform spatial gain method, a same thickness correction method
may be applied across a designated Training Region wherein a gain magnitude factor may
be different at each pixel location. For example, pixels lying on a diameter of 4mm may
have a gain magnitude factor of 200% whereas pixels lying a diameter of 2mm may have a
gain magnitude factor of 150%.
[0127]          When applying a function based non-uniform spatial gain method, a gain
magnitude factor may be related to a radial location of a pixel. In some other related
embodiments, when applying a direct mapping non-uniform spatial gain method,
corresponding data may be leveraged from a Training Region of one or more previous
DMD Shows, a measured Lens, and a Lens Design, to calculate a desired gain magnitude
at each pixel location.

implement some aspects of the present invention. A processor unit 1101, which may
include one or more processors, coupled to a communication device 1102 configured to
communicate via a communication network. The communication device 1102 may be
used to communicate, for example, with one or more controller apparatus or manufacturing
equipment components.
[0129]          A processor 1101 may also be used in communication with a storage device
1103. A storage device 1103 may comprise any appropriate information storage device,

                                               29
including combinations of magnetic storage devices (e.g., magnetic tape and hard disk
drives), optical storage devices, and/or semiconductor memory devices such as Random
Access Memory (RAM) devices and Read Only Memory (ROM) devices.
[0130]          A storage device 1103 may store an executable software program 1104 for
controlling a processor 1101. A processor 1101 performs instructions of a software
program 1104, and thereby operates in accordance with the present invention such as, for
example, the aforementioned method steps. For example, a processor 1101 may receive
information descriptive of a desired Lens Design. A storage device 1103 may also store
ophthalmic related data in one or more databases 1105 and 1106. A database may include
one or more of files containing DMD Show instruction data, customized Lens Design data,
metrology data, defined Lens parameter data for specific Lens Designs.
