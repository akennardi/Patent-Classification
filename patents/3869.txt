The invention is, broadly, a doped lattice, relying on the different
electropotential of three different dopant atoms to provide a total
of eight possible levels of charge for the device.
In particular,      a lattice     formed as a carbon nanotube ("Buckytube"),
containing the      three     dopant atoms internally,     allows eight   distinct
levels of charge to the device.
The charge will        probably be input from the        ends of the    Buckytube.
Further,       it may be possible       to use the     same device as an opto
electrical unit if suitable dopant atoms are used.
There the output would be in eight different colours of light.

A device allowing input      and reading   of  eight   characters     form a
molecular scale  store  will    be must faster     both in     access and in
processing than the current binary system.
