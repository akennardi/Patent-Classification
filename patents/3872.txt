30 gaming comprising:
               conducting play of a game;
               awarding eligibility to a feature game in response to a first trigger condition
   being met in relation to the game;
               conducting play of the feature game;
35             awarding eligibility to access a number of bonus feature game levels in
   response to a second trigger condition being met in relation to the feature game; and
               determining an outcome of the play of the feature game.
   10088921_1(GHMaters) P100166.AU.2

                                               -2
   The method may include setting an initial number of feature game reels based on the
   first trigger condition.
   In one embodiment, the first trigger condition comprises a game round outcome that
 5 includes a plurality of aligned scatter symbols. The method may include setting an
   initial number of the feature game reels according to a number of the aligned scatter
   symbols (or, in other embodiments, some other characteristic of the first trigger
   condition), such as by setting the number of the feature game reels to be the number
   of the aligned scatter symbols.
10
   In another embodiment, the method includes setting an initial number of the feature
   game game rounds according to whether or not an ante bet is made.
   Thus, typically the number of feature game game rounds would be to be greater if with
15 an ante bet than without an ante bet. For example, the number of feature game game
   rounds may be set to 15 with an ante bet but to only 7 without an ante bet.
   In one embodiment, the method includes determining the number of the bonus feature
   game levels based on an outcome of one or more feature game game rounds
20 (colloquially referred to as a 'free game'). The method may include successively
   modifying the number of the bonus feature game levels based on successive
   outcomes of one or more of the feature game game rounds.
   At least one of the bonus feature game levels may comprise multiplication of a win by
25 an integer (e.g. 2, 3 or 4) or other value (e.g. 1.5 or 2.5) greater than one.
   At least one of the bonus feature game levels may comprise comprises an award of a
   number (e.g. 5) of extra game rounds or an award of a number of extra game rounds
   determined according to the second trigger condition.
30
   At least one of the bonus feature game levels may comprise an additional winning
   combination of reel symbols.
   At least one of the bonus feature game levels may comprise an additional scatter
35 symbol or wildcard.
   In one embodiment, the second trigger condition comprises a feature game game
   round outcome wherein a number of the feature game reels displays at least a

                                                  -3
   predefined minimum number of identical symbols. The method may include setting the
   number of bonus feature game levels according to the number of the feature game
   reels that display at least the predefined minimum number of identical symbols.
 5 In a particular embodiment, the second trigger condition comprises a feature game
   game round outcome wherein a number of the feature game reels displays only
   identical symbols. The method may include setting the number of bonus feature game
   levels according to the number of the feature game reels that display only identical
   symbols.
10
   In one embodiment, the bonus feature game levels depend on whether or not an ante
   bet was made (and some of the bonus levels would typically be more generous if an
   ante bet was made).
15 In another embodiment, an initial number of bonus feature game levels depend on
   whether or not an ante bet was made.

   Detailed Description of Embodiments of the Invention
10
   According to embodiments of the invention there is provided a gaming system in which
   a player plays a spinning reel type game or games. An award is determined for the
   game or games. The reels spin about an axis in a conventional manner to display a
   sequence of symbols and in due course may form a winning pattern (such as a win
15 line). According to embodiments of the present invention, the reels are each of
   apparent three-dimensional, torus form. In one example, the torus has a circular cross
   section, and in another example a square cross section. It will be appreciated,
   however, that essentially any cross section can be used provided it is suitable for
   displaying the symbols.
20
   The gaming system may be provided in a number of different forms.
   In a first form, a stand-alone gaming machine is provided in which all or most
   components required for implementing the game are present in a player operable
25 gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided wherein some of the
   components required for implementing the game are present in a player operable
   gaming machine and some of the components required for implementing the game are
30 located remotely relative to the gaming machine. For example, a "thick client"
   architecture may be used wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely, such as by a gaming
   server; or a "thin client" architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player operable gaming machine
35 is used only to display audible and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are envisaged. For example,
   10088921_1(GHMaters) P100166.AU.2

                                              -6
   an architecture may be provided wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming
   server and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the gaming server are
   selectively modifiable. For example, the gaming system may operate in stand-alone
   gaming machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending on the
 5 game being played, operating conditions, and so on. Other variations will be apparent
   to persons skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises several core components.
   Referring to figure 1, at the broadest level the core components are a player interface
10 12 and a game controller 14, as illustrated schematically at 10 in figure 1.
   Player interface 12 is arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and the
   gaming system and for this purpose includes the input/output components required for
   the player to enter instructions and play the game. Components of the player interface
15 may vary from embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a credit
   mechanism 16 to enable a player to input credits and receive payouts, one or more
   displays 18 and a game play mechanism 20 that enables a player to input game play
   instructions.
20 Game controller 14 is in data communication with the player interface and typically
   includes a processor 22 that processes the game play instructions in accordance with
   game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the display. Typically, the game
   play instructions are stored as program code in a memory 24 but can also be
   hardwired. Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically to any device that
25 can process game play instructions in accordance with game play rules and may
   include: a microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device or other
   computational device, a general purpose computer (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand-alone gaming machine 30 according to another
30 embodiment of the invention is shown schematically at 30 in figure 2. Gaming
   machine 30 includes a console 32 having a display 34 on which is displayed
   representations of a game 36 that can be played by a player. A mid-trim 40 of the
   gaming machine 30 houses a bank of buttons 42 for enabling a player to interact with
   the gaming machine, in particular during game play. The mid-trim 40 also houses a
35 credit input mechanism 44 that, in this example, includes a coin input chute 44A and a
   bill collector 44B. Other credit input mechanisms may also be employed, such as a
   card reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit card. A player marketing
   module having a reading device may also be provided for the purpose of reading a
   10088921_1(GHMaters) P100166.AU.2

   10088921_1(GHMaters) P100166.AU.2

                                                -8
   a network card 74. Network card 74 may, for example, send status information,
   accounting information or other information to a central controller, server or database
   and receive data or commands from the central controller, server or database.
 5 In the example shown in figure 3, gaming machine 60 includes a player interface 80
   that includes peripheral devices that communicate with game controller 62. These
   peripheral devices comprise one or more displays 82, a touch screen and buttons
   (including a PLAY button) 84, a card and/or ticket reader 86, a printer 88, a bill
   acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 90 and a coin output mechanism 92. Additional
10 hardware may be included as part of the gaming machine 60, or hardware may be
   omitted as required for the specific implementation.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of an exemplary memory 66.
   Memory 66 includes RAM 66A, EPROM 66B and a mass storage device 66C. RAM
15 66A typically temporarily holds program files for execution by the processor 64 and
   related data. EPROM 66B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain some
   system or game related code. Mass storage device 66C is typically used to store
   game programs, the integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   processor 64 using protected code from EPROM 66B or elsewhere.
20
   It is also possible for the operative components of the gaming machine 60 to be
   distributed; for example, input/output devices 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92 may be provided
   remotely from game controller 62.
25 Figure 5 shows a gaming system 100 in accordance with an alternative embodiment.
   Gaming system 100 includes a network 102 that may be, for example, an Ethernet
   network. Gaming machines 104, shown arranged in three banks 106 of two gaming
   machines 104 in figure 5, are connected to the network 102. Gaming machines 104
   provide a player operable interface and may be the same as gaming machines 30, 60
30 shown in figures 2 and 3, or may have simplified functionality depending on the
   requirements for implementing game play. While banks 106 of two gaming machines
   are illustrated in figure 5, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are also
   envisaged.
35 One or more displays 108 may also be connected to the network 102. Displays 108
   may, for example, be associated with one or more banks 106 of gaming machines.
   Displays 108 may be used to display representations associated with game play on
   gaming machines 104, to display other representations, such as promotional or
   10088921_1(GHMaters) P100166.AU.2

                                               -9
   informational material, or both.
    In a thick client embodiment, game server 110 of gaming system 100 implements part
   of the game played by a player using a gaming machine 104 and gaming machine 104
 5 implements part of the game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and the
   gaming machine implement part of the game, they collectively provide a game
   controller. A database management server 112 may manage storage of game
   programs and associated data for downloading or access by the gaming devices 104
   in a database 112A. Typically, if the gaming system enables players to participate in a
10 Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 114 will be provided to carry out the accounting in
   respect of the Jackpot game. A loyalty program server 116 may also be provided.
    In a thin client embodiment, game server 110 implements most or all of the game
   played by a player using a gaming machine 104 and gaming machine 104 essentially
15 provides only the player interface. With this embodiment, game server 110 provides
   the game controller. Gaming machine 104 receives player instructions, passes these
   to game server 110, which then processes them and returns game play outcomes to
   gaming machine 104 for display. In a thin client embodiment, gaming machines 104
   may be computer terminals, such as PCs running software that provides a player
20 interface operable using standard computer input and output components.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the administration of gaming system 100
   including, for example, a gaming floor management server 118, and a licensing server
    120 to monitor the use of licences relating to particular games. An administrator
25 terminal 122 is provided to allow an administrator to run network 102 and the devices
   connected to the network.
   Gaming system 100 may communicate with other gaming systems, with other local
   networks such as a corporate network, with a wide area network such as the Internet,
30 for example through a firewall 124, or a combination of these.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that, in accordance with known techniques,
   functionality at the server side of gaming system 100 may be distributed over a plurality
   of different computers. For example, elements may be run as a single "engine" on one
35 server or a separate server may be provided. For example, game server 110 could run
   a random generator engine. Alternatively, a separate random number generator
   server could be provided. Further, persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a
   plurality of games servers could be provided to run different games or a single game
   10088921_1(GHMaters) P100166.AU.2

                                                - 10
   server may run a plurality of different games as required by the terminals.
    Figure 6 is a schematic view of the player interface 12 and a game controller 14 of
   figure 1, with greater detail shown in the game controller 14. Specifically, processor 12
 5 of game controller 14 includes a display controller 140, a spinning module 142 and an
   outcome determiner 144. The display controller 140 controls the view that is displayed
   on display 34, 82; spinning module 142 controls the manner in which reels are
   displayed when displayed to spin. Outcome determiner 144, which typically receives
   input from random number generator 72, determines game outcomes. Display
10 controller 140, spinning module 142 and outcome determiner 144 cooperate to display
   and determine the outcome of a game.
   Memory 24 includes game play instructions 146, which control the reels to be
   displayed to spin such that game symbols arranged along the reels are displayed as
15 moving downwards in display 34, 82, and reel data 148 comprising vertical symbol
   sequence data. The vertical symbol sequence data is indicative of the sequence in
   which game symbols are to be displayed along each of the reels. This can be encoded
   in any convenient way.
20 Processor 22 further includes a feature game controller 150, which determines when a
   player becomes eligible to be awarded a feature game, according to a trigger condition
    152 stored in memory 24. Trigger condition 152 specifies that eligibility for a feature
   game is awarded if an outcome of a base game game round includes three or more left
   to right scatter symbols, that is, triggers the feature game. In this example, the scatter
25 symbols consist of diverse gemstone symbols, specifically a ruby symbol, an emerald
   symbol, a pink sapphire symbol, a topaz symbol and a sapphire symbol. Outcome
   determiner 144 confers a prize if a game round outcome a pay line with a predefined
   number of any of these scatter symbols, but in addition a game round outcome with
   three or more left to right scatter symbols triggers the feature game, irrespective of the
30 identity of the individual scatter symbols. Thus, the combination from left to right of an
   emerald symbol, a topaz symbol, an emerald symbol and a pink sapphire symbol
   would not result in the awarding of a prize but would trigger the feature game.
   Thus, if feature game controller 150 determines that feature game trigger condition 152
35 has been met, feature game controller 150 initiates a feature game, which comprises
   of seven game rounds each with a number of feature game reels. Each reel consists
   of diamond symbols and credit prizes. The initial number of reels depends on the
   trigger condition: feature game controller 150 sets the number of feature game reels to
   10088921_1(GHMaters) P100166.AU.2

                                                     - 11
   be the same as the number of scatter symbols aligned left to right that triggered the
   feature game. As three or more such aligned scatter symbols are required to trigger
   the feature game, in this embodiment there will be at least three reels in the feature
   game and at most five.
 5
   Figure 7 is a view of an exemplary feature game game round outcome 160. In this
   example, the trigger condition that gave the player eligibility to the feature game
   included four scatter symbols, so four of the base game reels have been replaced by
   feature game reels 162; the fifth base game reel 164 in inactive during the feature
10 game, so is darkened.
   Each of the feature game reels, as explained above, comprises stacked diamond
   symbols and credit prizes. Numerous outcomes are possible, as will be appreciated by
   those in the art, but two outcomes (as determined by outcome determiner 144, when
15 the player touches or presses PLAY button 84) confer an award to the player:
               i) each stack of three diamond symbols satisfies bonus level trigger condition
   154, so prompts feature game controller 150 to unlock a feature game Bonus Level;
   and
               ii) each credit prize is awarded.
20
   In the example shown in figure 7, outcome determiner 144 determines that there are
   three stacks of three diamond symbols and a credit prize of 250 credits, so feature
   game controller 150 unlocks (that is, gives the player eligibility to) three feature game
   Bonus Levels and controls a prize awarder 158 of processor 22 to award 250 credits.
25
   According to this embodiment, feature game controller 150 may apply either of these
   awards according to the outcome of any of the feature game game rounds, and also
   subsequently applies any awarded feature game Bonus Levels to the remaining game
   round of the feature game. Hence, in the example of figure 7, feature game controller
30 150 will apply three Bonus Levels to all subsequent game rounds of the feature game
   (unless further Bonus Levels are awarded in later game rounds, in which case the
   number of Bonus Levels will be incremented as appropriate).
   The Bonus Levels, which are defined in a bonus levels register 156, of this
35 embodiment when an ante bet was not made when the feature game was awarded are
   shown in Table 1:
                                     Table 1: Bonus Levels without Ante Bet
   10088921_1(GHMaters) P100166.AU.2

                                Level                    Award
                                     1           5 extra game rounds
                                    2     Pic4 and Pic5 pay the same as Pic1
                                    3     Pic2 and Pic3 pay the same as Pic1
                                    4  WILD and WILD substituting wins x 2 or x 3
                                    5                 AllWins x 2
   Pic1, Pic2, Pic3, Pic4 and Pic5 indicate different symbols, while WILD indicates a
   wildcard.
 5
   The Bonus Levels are awarded in succession (from Level 5 to Level 1), so the five
   extra game rounds will only be awarded if the player is awarded five Bonus Levels. If
   further Bonus Levels are awarded (e.g. a sixth, seventh, etc), an additional five extra
   game rounds are awarded each time.
10
   In addition, if-when the feature game is awarded-the player makes an ante bet,
   feature game controller 150 initiates the feature game with initially 15 game rounds and
   employs a different set of Bonus Levels (also defined in bonus levels register 156) as
   shown in Table 2:

   The method of this embodiment is summarized as a flow diagram 170 in figure 8. At
 5 step 172, games play is conducted. At step 174, feature game controller 150
   determines whether the player has become eligible to be awarded a feature game
   (according to whether the relevant feature game trigger condition is met). If not,
   processing returns to step 172, but if the player has become eligible to be awarded a
   feature game, processing continues at step 176 where feature game controller 150
10 sets an initial number of feature game reels according to feature game trigger
   condition, that is, one reel for every scatter symbol constituting the trigger condition. At
   step 178, game controller 14 determines whether an ante bet has been made. If not,
   processing continues at step 180 where feature game controller 150 sets the initial
   number of game rounds for the feature game to seven and display controller 140
15 displays the Bonus Levels of Table 1 for player information. If an ante bet has been
   made, however, processing continues at step 182 where feature game controller 150
   sets the initial number of game rounds for the feature game to 15 and display controller
   140 displays the Bonus Levels of Table 2 for player information .
20 In both cases (i.e. whether or not an ante bet was made), processing continues at step
   184 where a game round of the feature game is conducted by feature game controller
   150. Next, at step 188 outcome determiner 144 determines the outcome of that game
   round and, if an award is due to the player (in the form either of a Bonus Level of a
   credit prize (or both), processing continues at step 188 where that award is made, after
25 which-at step 190-feature game controller 150 determines whether the last game
   round of the feature game has been completed. If, at step 186, no award is due,
   processing continues at step 190.
   At step 190, if feature game controller 150 determines that the last game round of the
30 feature game has not been completed (either because the initial number of game
   rounds has not yet been completed, or because that initial number augmented by an
   10088921_1(GHMaters) P100166.AU.2

                                               - 14
   award made at step 188 has not yet been completed), processing returns to step 184.
   Otherwise, processing continues at step 192 where outcome determiner 144
   determines the outcome of the feature game, followed by step 194 where Prize
   awarder 158 awards any prize due to the player according to the feature game
 5 outcome. Processing then ends.
   It will be appreciated that other features known in electronic gaming machines and the
   games provided thereby can be advantageously and synergistically combined with the
   features described above.
