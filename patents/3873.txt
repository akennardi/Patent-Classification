                                         RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian application No. 2014414810, the
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                            BACKGROUND
[0002] A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth
surfaces.           Conventional toothbrushes having a flat bristle trim are limited in their ability to
conform to the curvature of the teeth, to penetrate into the interproximal areas between the teeth,
to sweep away the plaque and debris, and to clean along the gum line.               Additionally, such
toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice for cleaning the teeth. During the brushing
process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of bristles and away from the contact
between the bristles and the teeth. As a result, the dentifrice is often spread around the mouth,
rather than being concentrated on the contact of the bristles with the teeth.            Therefore, the
efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced.
[0003] While substantial efforts have been made to modify the cleaning elements of
toothbrushes to improve the efficiency of the oral cleaning process, the industry continues to
pursue arrangements of cleaning elements that will improve upon the existing technology. In
typical oral care implements, bristles having circular transverse cross-sectional profiles are
bundled together in a bristle tuft and mounted within tuft holes having circular transverse cross
sectional profiles. However, such a configuration results in gaps being present between adjacent
bristles in the tuft and between the bristles of the tuft and the walls of the tuft holes, thereby
resulting in a looser packing of the tuft hole and a less than optimal packing factor. These gaps
can also reduce the effectiveness of the oral care implement and can cause the oral care
implement to effectuate an uncomfortable feeling during brushing. Therefore, a need exists for
an oral care implement having an improved arrangement of bristles.
                                             BRIEF SUMMARY

present disclosure controls.
[0022] Referring first to FIGS. 1-3 concurrently, an oral care implement 100 is illustrated in
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In the exemplified embodiment, the
oral care implement 100 is in the form of a manual toothbrush. However, in certain other
embodiments the oral care implement 100 can take on other forms such as being a powered
toothbrush, a tongue scraper, a gum and soft tissue cleanser, a water pick, an interdental device, a
tooth polisher, a specially designed ansate implement having tooth engaging elements or any
other type of implement that is commonly used for oral care. Thus, it is to be understood that the
inventive concepts discussed herein can be applied to any type of oral care implement unless a
specific type of oral care implement is specified in the claims.
[0023] The oral care implement 100 extends from a proximal end 101 to a distal end 102 along a
longitudinal axis A-A.              The oral care implement 100 generally comprises a head 110 and a
handle 120.                The head 110 extends from a proximal end 118 to a distal end 119 along a
longitudinal axis B-B that is coextensive with the longitudinal axis A-A of the oral care
implement 100. Furthermore, in the exemplified embodiment the distal end 102 of the oral care
implement 100 is the same as the distal end 119 of the head 110.
[0024] The handle 120 is an elongated structure that provides the mechanism by which the user
can hold and manipulate the oral care implement 100 during use.                    In the exemplified
embodiment, the handle 120 is generically depicted having various contours for user comfort.
Of course, the invention is not to be limited by the specific shape illustrated for the handle 120 in
all embodiments and in certain other embodiments the handle 120 can take on a wide variety of
shapes, contours, and configurations, none of which are limiting of the present invention unless
so specified in the claims.
[0025] In the exemplified embodiment, the handle 120 is formed of a rigid plastic material, such
as for example without limitation polymers and copolymers of ethylene, propylene, butadiene,
vinyl compounds, and polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate. Of course, the invention is
not to be so limited in all embodiments and the handle 120 may include a resilient material, such
as a thermoplastic elastomer, as a grip cover that is molded over portions of or the entirety of the
handle 120 to enhance the gripability of the handle 120 during use. For example, portions of the
handle 120 that are typically gripped by a user's palm during use may be overmolded with a
                                                        5
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

thermoplastic elastomer or other resilient material to further increase comfort to a user.
Furthermore, materials other than those noted above can be used including metal, wood, or any
other desired material that has sufficient structural rigidity to permit a user to grip the handle 120
and manipulate the oral care implement 100 during toothbrushing.
[0026] The head 110 of the oral care implement 100 is coupled to the handle 120 and comprises
a front surface 111 and an opposing rear surface 112. In the exemplified embodiment, the head
110 is formed integrally with the handle 120 as a single unitary structure using a molding,
milling, machining, or other suitable process. However, in other embodiments the handle 120
and the head 110 may be formed as separate components which are operably connected at a later
stage of the manufacturing process by any suitable technique known in the art, including without
limitation thermal or ultrasonic welding, a tight-fit assembly, a coupling sleeve, threaded
engagement, adhesion, or fasteners. Thus the head 110 may, in certain embodiments, be formed
of any of the rigid plastic materials described above as being used for forming the handle 120,
although the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments and other materials that are
commonly used during toothbrush head manufacture may also be used.
[0027] The oral care implement 100 also comprises a plurality of tooth cleaning elements 115
extending from the front surface 111 of the head 110. The details of certain ones of the plurality
of tooth cleaning elements 115 will be discussed below, including specific details with regard to
structure, pattern, orientation, and material of such tooth cleaning elements 115.           However,
where it does not conflict with the other disclosure provided herein, it should be appreciated that
the term "tooth cleaning elements" may be used in a generic sense to refer to any structure that
can be used to clean, polish, or wipe the teeth and/or soft oral tissue (e.g. tongue, cheek, gums,
etc.) through relative surface contact. Common examples of "tooth cleaning elements" include,
without limitation, bristle tufts, filament bristles, fiber bristles, nylon bristles, spiral bristles,
rubber bristles, elastomeric protrusions, flexible polymer protrusions, combinations thereof
and/or structures containing such materials or combinations.         Thus, any combination of these
tooth cleaning elements may be used within the tooth cleaning elements 115 in some
embodiments. However, as described herein below, in certain embodiments one or more of the
tooth cleaning elements 115 may be formed as tufts of bristles.
[0028] In embodiments that use elastomeric elements as one or more of the tooth cleaning
elements 115, suitable elastomeric materials may include any biocompatible resilient material
                                                   6
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

suitable for uses in an oral hygiene apparatus. To provide optimum comfort as well as cleaning
benefits, the elastomeric material of any such tooth or soft tissue engaging elements may have a
hardness property in the range of A8 to A25 Shore hardness. One suitable elastomeric material
is     styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene block    copolymer    (SEBS)    manufactured     by  GLS
Corporation. Nevertheless, SEBS material from other manufacturers or other materials within
and outside the noted hardness range could be used.
[0029] Referring now to FIGS. 1-8 concurrently, one manner in which the tooth cleaning
elements 115 are secured to the head 110 will be described.        Specifically, in the exemplified
embodiment the tooth cleaning elements 115 are formed as a cleaning element assembly on a
head plate 121 such that one or more of the tooth cleaning elements 115 are mounted onto the
head plate 121 and then the head plate 121 is coupled to the head 110. In such an embodiment,
the head plate 121 is a separate and distinct component from the head 110 of the oral care
implement 100. However, the head plate 121 is connected to the head 110 at a later stage of the
manufacturing process by any suitable technique known in the art, including without limitation
thermal or ultrasonic welding, any fusion techniques such as thermal fusion, melting, a tight-fit
assembly, a coupling sleeve, threaded engagement, adhesion, or fasteners. Thus, the head plate
121 and the head 110 are separately formed components that are secured together during
manufacture of the oral care implement 100.
[0030] In certain embodiments, the head plate 121 may comprise a plurality of holes 122 formed
therethrough, and the tooth cleaning elements 115 may be mounted to the head plate 121 within
the holes 122. This type of technique for mounting the tooth cleaning elements 115 to the head
110 via the head plate 121 is generally known as anchor free tufting (AFT). Specifically, in AFT
a plate or membrane (i.e., the head plate 121) is created separately from the head 110. The tooth
cleaning elements 115 (such as bristles, elastomeric elements, and combinations thereof) are
positioned into the head plate 121 so as to extend through the holes 122 of the head plate 121.
The free ends of the tooth cleaning elements 115 on one side of the head plate 121 perform the
cleaning function. The ends of the tooth cleaning elements 115 on the other side of the head
plate 121 are melted together by heat to be anchored in place. As the tooth cleaning elements
105 are melted together, a melt matte 106 is formed. After the tooth cleaning elements 115 are
secured to the head plate 121, the head plate 121 is secured to the head 110 such as by ultrasonic
welding. When the head plate 121 is coupled to the head 110, the melt matte 106 is located
                                                 7

between a lower surface 123 of the head plate 121 and a floor 107 of a basin 108 of the head 110
in which the head plate 121 is disposed. The melt matte 106, which is coupled directly to and in
fact forms a part of the tooth cleaning elements 115, prevents the tooth cleaning elements 115
from being pulled through the holes 122 in the head plate 121 to ensure that the tooth cleaning
elements 105 remain attached to the head plate 121 during use of the oral care implement 100.
[0031] Of course, techniques other than AFT can be used for mounting the tooth cleaning
elements 115 to the head 110, such as widely known and used stapling techniques or the like. In
such embodiments the head plate 121 may be omitted and the tooth cleaning elements 115 may
be coupled directly to the head 110. Furthermore, in a modified version of the AFT process
discussed above, the head plate 121 may be formed by positioning the tooth cleaning elements
115 within a mold, and then molding the head plate 121 around the tooth cleaning elements 115
via an injection molding process.
[0032] Although described herein above with regard to using AFT, in certain embodiments any
suitable form of cleaning elements and attachment may be used in the broad practice of this
invention.              Specifically, the tooth cleaning elements 115 of the present invention can be
connected to the head 110 in any manner known in the art. For example, staples/anchors or in
mold tufting (IMT) could be used to mount the cleaning elements/tooth engaging elements. In
certain embodiments, the invention can be practiced with various combinations of stapled, IMT
or AFT bristles. Alternatively, the tooth cleaning elements 115 could be mounted to tuft blocks
or sections by extending through suitable openings in the tuft blocks so that the base of the tooth
cleaning elements 115 is mounted within or below the tuft block.
[0033] Although not illustrated herein, in certain embodiments the head 110 may also include a
soft tissue cleanser coupled to or positioned on its rear surface 112. An example of a suitable
soft tissue cleanser that may be used with the present invention and positioned on the rear surface
of the head 110 is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,143,462, issued December 5, 2006 to the
assignee of the present application, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In
certain other embodiments, the soft tissue cleanser may include protuberances, which can take
the form of elongated ridges, nubs, or combinations thereof. Of course, the invention is not to be
so limited and in certain embodiments the oral care implement 100 may not include any soft
tissue cleanser.

[0034] With reference to FIGS. 1-8, the oral care implement 100, and specifically the tooth
cleaning elements 115 of the oral care implement 100, will be further described.                In the
exemplified embodiment, the plurality of tooth cleaning elements 115 comprises a first conical
tuft 130 and a second conical tuft 140. Each of the first and second conical tufts 130, 140 is a
tuft or grouping of bristles that are arranged together into a tuft and then secured into a single tuft
hole within the head 110 (or within the head plate 121). The first and second conical tufts 130,
140 are described herein as being conical due to the first and second conical tufts 130, 140
having a conical shape. More specifically, as can best be seen in FIGS. 5, 6, and 8, the first and
second conical tufts 130, 140 are in the shape of a truncated cone wherein the portion of the first
and second conical tufts 130, 140 that are positioned within the head 110 is the truncated (i.e.,
cut off) portion of the cone such that the first and second conical tufts 130, 140 are in the shape
of an inverted truncated cone.
[0035] The first conical tuft 130 comprises a first continuous bristle wall 135 having an inner
surface 131 and an outer surface 136. The inner surface 131 of the first continuous bristle wall
135 of the first conical tuft 130 defines a first cavity 132 that extends along a first cavity axis C
C.      The first conical tuft 130, and specifically the first continuous bristle wall 135 thereof,
extends in a 3600 manner about the first cavity axis C-C. The first cavity 132 of the first conical
tuft 130 has an open top end and is bounded by the inner surface 131 of the first continuous
bristle wall 135 and by the front surface 111 of the head 110. As noted above, the first conical
tuft 130 in the exemplified embodiment is formed by a plurality of bristles. Specifically, the
plurality of bristles are clumped together and positioned collectively into a single tuft hole so that
the plurality of bristles collectively form the first conical tuft 130 having no gaps in the first
continuous bristle wall 135 for its entire 360' extension about the first cavity axis C-C. Thus, the
first conical tuft 130 extends from a single tuft hole. The term continuous bristle wall is intended
to mean that the first conical tuft 130 is a single tuft of bristles that are clumped together into a
single tuft hole in a non-spaced apart manner.
[0036] Thus, in the exemplified embodiment the first conical tuft 130 is a single bristle tuft
formed from a plurality of individual bristles that are positioned together within a single tuft
hole. As a result, the first conical tuft 130 has the first continuous bristle wall 135 that extends
without discontinuity about the first cavity axis C-C. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment there
are no gaps formed into the outer surface 136 of the first conical tuft 130. Of course, in other
                                                   9
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

embodiments the first conical tuft 130 may have small gaps therein as desired while still being a
single tuft positioned within a single tuft hole.      Such gaps in the bristle wall may prevent
dentifrice from being trapped within the first cavity 132 of the first conical tuft 130 by providing
means of egress from the first cavity 132. In such an embodiment, the bristle wall 135 of the
first conical tuft 130 may not be continuous.
[0037] Due to the conical shape of the first conical tuft 130, and more specifically, the inverted
conical shape of the first conical tuft 130, the first cavity 132 of the first conical tuft 130 has a
first transverse cross-sectional area that increases with distance from the front surface 111 of the
head 110. Specifically, the first transverse cross-sectional area of the first cavity 132 of the first
conical tuft 130 only increases and never decreases with distance from the front surface 111 of
the head 110. Thus, the greater the distance between a particular axial location within the first
cavity 132 of the first conical tuft 130 and the front surface 111 of the head 110, the greater the
transverse cross-sectional area of the first cavity 132 at that particular axial location.
[0038] The second conical tuft 140 comprises a second continuous bristle wall 145 having an
inner surface 141 and an outer surface 146. The inner surface 141 of the second continuous
bristle wall 145 of the second conical tuft 140 defines a second cavity 142 that extends along a
second cavity axis D-D. The second conical tuft 144 extends in a 3600 manner about the second
cavity axis D-D. The second cavity 142 of the second conical tuft 140 has an open top end and
is bounded by the inner surface 141 of the second continuous bristle wall 145 and by the front
surface 111 of the head 110. As noted above, the second conical tuft 140 in the exemplified
embodiment is formed by a plurality of bristles.          Specifically, the plurality of bristles are
clumped together and positioned collectively into a single tuft hole so that the plurality of bristles
collectively form the second conical tuft 140 having no gaps in the second continuous bristle
wall 145 for its entire 360' extension about the second cavity axis D-D.               Thus, the term
continuous bristle wall is intended to mean that the second conical tuft 140 is a single tuft of
bristles that are clumped together into a single tuft hole in a non-spaced apart manner.
[0039] Thus, in the exemplified embodiment the second conical tuft 140 is a single tuft formed
from a plurality of individual bristles that are positioned together within a single tuft hole. As a
result, the second conical tuft 140 has the second continuous bristle wall 145 that extends
without discontinuity about the second cavity axis D-D. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment
there are no gaps formed into the outer surface 146 of the second conical tuft 140. Of course, in
                                                   10
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

other embodiments the second conical tuft 140 may have small gaps therein as desired while still
being a single tuft positioned within a single tuft hole. Such gaps in the bristle wall may prevent
dentifrice from being trapped within the second cavity 142 of the second conical tuft 140 by
providing means of egress from the second cavity 142. In such an embodiment, the bristle wall
145 of the second conical tuft 140 may not be continuous.
[0040] Due to the conical shape of the second conical tuft 140, and more specifically, the
inverted conical shape of the second conical tuft 140, the second cavity 142 of the second conical
tuft 140 has a second transverse cross-sectional area that increases with distance from the front
surface 111 of the head 110.        Specifically, the second transverse cross-sectional area of the
second cavity 142 of the second conical tuft 140 only increases and never decreases with
distance from the front surface 111 of the head 110. Thus, the greater the distance between a
particular axial location within the second cavity 142 of the second conical tuft 140 and the front
surface 111 of the head 110, the greater the transverse cross-sectional area of the second cavity
142 at that particular axial location.
[0041] In the exemplified embodiment, the first conical tuft 130 is located at a distal region of
the head 110 near the distal end 119 of the head 110 and the second conical tuft 140 is located at
a proximal region of the head 110 near the proximal end 118 of the head 110. However, in the
exemplified embodiment the first conical tuft 130 is not the distal-most tuft and the second
conical tuft 140 is not the proximal-most tuft. Rather, there are tufts positioned between the first
conical tuft 130 and the distal end 119 of the head 110 and there are tufts positioned between the
second conical tuft 140 and the proximal end 118 of the head 110, as discussed in more detail
below. Of course, in other embodiments the first and second conical tufts 130, 140 may be the
proximal-most and distal-most tufts on the head 110. Furthermore, there are several different
tooth cleaning elements positioned in between the first and second conical tufts 130, 140 in the
direction of the longitudinal axis B-B as will be discussed in more detail below.            In the
exemplified embodiment, each of the first and second conical tufts 130, 140 is aligned on the
longitudinal axis B-B such that the longitudinal axis B-B crosses through a center point of each
of the first and second conical tufts 130, 140. The first and second conical tufts 130, 140 are on
opposite sides of a transverse axis that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis B-B and that
divides the head 110 into two equal halves.
                                                   11
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

[0042] Referring briefly to FIGS. 3 and 5 concurrently, the first conical tuft 130 terminates in a
first annular top surface 137 that extends a first height HI above the front surface 111 of the head
110. The first conical tuft 130 also has a first outer diameter D1 taken at the first annular top
surface 137 and at the outer surface 136. The second conical tuft 140 terminates in a second
annular top surface 147 that extends a second height H6 above the front surface 111 of the head
110.        The second conical tuft 140 also has a second outer diameter D2 taken at the second
annular top surface 147 and at the outer surface 136. In the exemplified embodiment, the first
height HI is greater than the second height H6. However, in other embodiments the first and
second heights HI, H6 may be the same, or the second height H6 may be greater than the first
height HI. Furthermore, in the exemplified embodiment the first and second diameters D1, D2
are different, and more specifically the first diameter D1, D2 is greater than the second diameter.
However, in certain other embodiments the first and second diameters D1, D2 may be the same,
or the second diameter D2 may be greater than the first diameter D1.
[0043] Furthermore, the outer surface 136 of the first continuous bristle wall 135 of the first
conical tuft 130 is oriented at a first acute angle 01 relative to the front surface 111 of the head
110. The outer surface 146 of the second continuous bristle wall 145 of the second conical tuft
140 is oriented at a second acute angle 02 relative to the front surface 111 of the head 110. In
the exemplified embodiment, the first and second acute angles 01, 02 are different from one
another. Specifically, in the exemplified embodiment the second acute angle 02 is greater than
the first acute angle 01. Of course, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments and
in certain other embodiments the first acute angle 01 may be greater than the second acute angle
02, or the first and second acute angles 01, 02 may be substantially the same.            In certain
embodiments, each of the first and second acute angles 01, 02 are between 800 and 890, more
specifically between 83.5' and 87.5'. In certain embodiments, one or both of the first and second
acute angles 01, 02 is between 82' and 85', and in other embodiments one or both of the first
and second acute angles 01, 02 is between 86' and 890. Furthermore, one of the first and second
acute angles 01, 02 may be between 820 and 850 while the other one of the first and second
acute angles 01, 02 is between 860 and 890.
[0044] Although not depicted herein, in certain embodiments a central cleaning element may be
positioned within each of the first and second cavities 132, 142 of the first and second conical
tufts 130, 140. The central cleaning elements may be bristle tufts containing tapered bristles,
                                                  12
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

spiral bristles, rounded bristles, or combinations thereof. Alternatively, the central cleaning
elements may be elastomeric protrusions/elements.
[0045] In addition to the first and second conical tufts 130, 140, the plurality of tooth cleaning
elements 115 also comprises a first arcuate cleaning element 150 and a second arcuate cleaning
element 160. The first arcuate cleaning element 150 is at least partially located between the first
conical tuft 130 and the distal end 119 of the head 110 and the second arcuate cleaning element
160 is at least partially located between the second conical tuft 140 and the proximal end 118 of
the head 110. Thus, the first arcuate cleaning element 150 is the distal-most cleaning element on
the head 110 and the second arcuate cleaning element 160 is the proximal-most cleaning element
on the head 110. Stated another way, there are no intervening cleaning elements between the
first arcuate cleaning element 150 and the distal end 119 of the head 110 and there are no
intervening cleaning elements between the second arcuate cleaning element 160 and the
proximal end 118 of the head 110.
[0046] In the exemplified embodiment, the first arcuate cleaning element 150 is formed of a
plurality of bristle wall segments including a first segment 151, a second segment 152, a third
segment 153, and a fourth segment 154. In this embodiment, each of the first, second, third, and
fourth segments 151-154 is positioned within its own tuft hole that is spaced apart from the other
tuft holes of the segments of the first arcuate cleaning element 150. Thus, in the exemplified
embodiment the first segment 151 is spaced from the second segment 152 by a gap, the second
segment 152 is spaced from the third segment 153 by a gap, and the third segment 153 is spaced
from the fourth segment 154 by a gap. However, in certain other embodiments the first arcuate
cleaning element 150 may be formed by a single continuous cleaning element that is positioned
within a single tuft hole. Furthermore, in embodiments that include the spaced apart segments
151-154 that form the first arcuate cleaning element 150, the gaps between adjacent ones of the
segments 151-154 may be considered as a part of the first arcuate cleaning element 150.
[0047] In the exemplified embodiment, the second arcuate cleaning element 160 is formed of a
plurality of bristle wall segments including a first segment 161, a second segment 162, a third
segment 163, and a fourth segment 164. In this embodiment, each of the first, second, third, and
fourth segments 161-164 is positioned within its own tuft hole that is spaced apart from the other
tuft holes of the segments of the second arcuate cleaning element 160. However, in certain other
embodiments the second cleaning element 160 may be formed by a single continuous cleaning
                                                 13
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

element that is positioned within a single tuft hole. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment, the
first segment 161 is spaced from the second segment 162 by a gap, the second segment 162 is
spaced from the third segment 163 by a gap, and the third segment 163 is spaced from the fourth
segment 164 by a gap.               However, in certain other embodiments the second arcuate cleaning
element 160 may be formed by a single continuous cleaning element that is positioned within a
single tuft hole. Furthermore, in embodiments that include the spaced apart segments 161-164
that form the first arcuate cleaning element 160, the gaps between adjacent ones of the segments
161-164 may be considered as a part of the second arcuate cleaning element 160.
[0048] Referring briefly to FIGS. 2-4 concurrently, the oral care implement 100 will be further
described. The first arcuate cleaning element 150 is arranged on the head 110 so as to at least
partially surround the first conical tuft 130. Specifically, in the exemplified embodiment the first
arcuate cleaning element 150 surrounds the first conical tuft 130 for at least 180' about the
circumference of the first conical tuft 130, or between 1800 and 270' about the circumference of
the first conical tuft 130.          In that regard, there are no other bristle tufts or cleaning elements
positioned between the first arcuate cleaning element 150 and the first conical tuft 130 where the
first arcuate cleaning element 150 surrounds the first conical tuft 130.                In the exemplified
embodiment, the second and third segments 152, 153 of the first arcuate cleaning element 150
are located between the first conical tuft 130 and the distal end 119 of the head 110 and the first
and fourth segments 151, 154 of the first arcuate cleaning element 150 are located between the
first conical tuft 130 and the lateral sides or peripheral edge of the head 110.
[0049] The first arcuate cleaning element 150 has a top surface 155 having a first high point
156a and a second high point 156b. The first high point 156a is located on the second segment
152 and the second high point 156b is located on the third segment 153.               The first and second
high points 156a, 156b are located on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis B-B. Furthermore,
each of the first and second high points 156a, 156b extends to a second height H2 from the front
surface 111 of the head 110. The top surface 155 of the first arcuate cleaning element 150 also
has a first low point 157a and a second low point 157b. The first low point 157a is located on
the first segment 151 and the second low point 157b is located on the fourth segment 154. The
first and second low points 157a, 157b are located on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis B-B
and on opposite sides of the first conical tuft 130. Furthermore, each of the first and second low
points 157a, 157b extends to a third height H3 from the front surface 111 of the head 110.
                                                         14
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

[0050] Although noted herein as having first and second high points 156a, 156b, in certain
embodiments the second and third segments 152, 153 may be formed as a single segment having
a single high point located on the longitudinal axis B-B.        Furthermore, in the exemplified
embodiment the first and second high points 156a, 156b are the same height, and thus the first
and second high points 156a, 156b may be considered a single high point in some embodiments.
[0051] The second arcuate cleaning element 160 is arranged on the head 110 so as to at least
partially surround the second conical tuft 140. Specifically, in the exemplified embodiment the
second arcuate cleaning element 160 surrounds the second conical tuft 140 for at least 1800 about
the circumference of the second conical tuft 140, or between 180' and 270' about the
circumference of the second conical tuft 140. In that regard, there are no other bristle tufts or
cleaning elements positioned between the second arcuate cleaning element 160 and the second
conical tuft 140 where the second arcuate cleaning element 160 surrounds the second conical tuft
140.        In the exemplified embodiment, the second and third segments 162, 163 of the second
arcuate cleaning element 160 are located between the second conical tuft 140 and the proximal
end 118 of the head 110 and the first and fourth segments 161, 164 of the second arcuate
cleaning element 160 are located between the second conical tuft 140 and the lateral sides or
peripheral edge of the head 110.
[0052] The second arcuate cleaning element 160 has a top surface 165 having a first high point
166a and a second high point 166b. The first high point 166a is located on the second segment
162 and the second high point 166b is located on the third segment 163.        The first and second
high points 166a, 166b are located on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis B-B. Furthermore,
each of the first and second high points 166a, 166b is located at a fourth height H4 from the front
surface 111 of the head 110. The top surface 155 of the second arcuate cleaning element 160
also has a first low point 167a and a second low point 167b. The first low point 167a is located
on the first segment 161 and the second low point 167b is located on the fourth segment 164.
The first and second low points 167a, 167b are located on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis
B-B and on opposite sides of the second conical tuft 140. Furthermore, each of the first and
second low points 167a, 167b is located at a fifth height H5 from the front surface 111 of the
head 110.
[0053] Although noted herein as having first and second high points 166a, 166b, in certain
embodiments the second and third segments 162, 163 may be formed as a single segment having
                                                  15
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

a single high point located on the longitudinal axis B-B.          Furthermore, in the exemplified
embodiment the first and second high points 166a, 166b may be the same height, and thus the
first and second high points 166a, 166b may be considered a single high point in some
embodiments.
[0054] In the exemplified embodiment, the first height HI (which is the height at which the
annular top surface 137 of the first conical tuft 130 extends from the front surface 111 of the
head 110) is greater than the third height H3 and less than the second height H2. Similarly, in
the exemplified embodiment the sixth height H6 (which is the height at which the annular top
surface 147 of the second conical tuft 140 extends from the front surface 111 of the head 110) is
greater than the fifth height H5 and less than the fourth height H4.            Furthermore, in the
exemplified embodiment the third height H3 is greater than the fifth height H5, and the second
height H2 is greater than the fourth height H4. Thus, each of the cleaning elements in the distal
region of the head 110 is taller than its counterpart in the proximal region of the head 110 (the
high point 156a, 156b of the first arcuate cleaning element 150 is taller than the high point 166a,
166b of the second arcuate cleaning element 160, the low point 157a, 157b of the first arcuate
cleaning element 150 is taller than the low point 167a, 167b of the second arcuate cleaning
element 160, and the first conical tuft 130 is taller than the second conical tuft 140).
[0055] In the exemplified embodiment the top surface 155 of the first arcuate cleaning element
150 comprises a first ramped portion 158a extending from the first low point 157a to the first
high point 156a (visible in FIG. 4) and a second ramped portion 158b extending from the second
low point 157b to the second high point 156b (not visible in FIG. 4, but denoted in FIG. 2). In
the exemplified embodiment, each of the first and second ramped portions 158a, 158b of the top
surface 155 of the first arcuate cleaning element 150 have a constant slope (i.e., the ramped
portions 158a, 158b are linear), although in other embodiments the slope may gradually increase
or decrease when extending from the low points 157a, 157b to the high points 156a, 156b as
desired. Similarly, the top surface 165 of the second arcuate cleaning element 160 comprises a
first ramped portion 168a extending from the first low point 167a to the first high point 166a
(visible in FIG. 4) and a second ramped portion 168b extending from the second low point 167b
to the second high point 166b (not visible in FIG. 4, but denoted in FIG. 2). In the exemplified
embodiment, each of the first and second ramped portions 168a, 168b of the top surface 165 of
the second arcuate cleaning element 160 have a constant slope (i.e., the ramped portions 168a,
                                                  16

168b are linear), although in other embodiments the slope may gradually increase or decrease
when extending from the low points 167a, 167b to the high points 166a, 166b as desired.
[0056] Furthermore, in embodiments wherein the first arcuate cleaning element 150 is a single
continuous cleaning element, the first and second high points 156a, 156b of the first arcuate
cleaning element 150 may be located along a reference plane that includes the longitudinal axis
B-B and is perpendicular to the front surface 111 of the head 110. Furthermore, even when the
first arcuate cleaning element 150 is formed by separate bristle segments 151-154 having gaps
therebetween, conceptually the high points 156a, 156b may still be located along the reference
plane that includes the longitudinal axis B-B and is perpendicular to the front surface 111 of the
head 110. Furthermore, as can be seen in FIG. 4, when viewed in side profile the first ramped
portion 158a (and also the second ramped portion 158b, although not visible in FIG. 4) of the top
surface 155 of the first arcuate cleaning element 150 intersects the annular top surface 137 of the
first conical tuft 130 at a first intersection point 159.
[0057] Similarly, in embodiments wherein the second arcuate cleaning element 160 is a single
continuous cleaning element, the first and second high points 166a, 166b of the second arcuate
cleaning element 160 may be located along a reference plane that includes the longitudinal axis
B-B and is perpendicular to the front surface 111 of the head 110. Furthermore, even when the
second arcuate cleaning element 160 is formed by separate bristle segments 161-164 having gaps
therebetween, conceptually the high points 166a, 166b may still be located along the reference
plane that includes the longitudinal axis B-B and is perpendicular to the front surface 111 of the
head 110. Furthermore, as can be seen in FIG. 4, when viewed in side profile the first ramped
portion 168a (and also the second ramped portion 168b, although not visible in FIG. 4) of the top
surface 165 of the second arcuate cleaning element 160 intersects the annular top surface 147 of
the second conical tuft 140 at a second intersection point 169.
[0058] Referring to FIGS. 1-3 and 5 concurrently, the oral care implement 100 will be further
described. As noted above, in the exemplified embodiment the first arcuate cleaning element
150 only partially surrounds the first conical tuft 130 and the second arcuate cleaning element
160 only partially surrounds the second conical tuft 140.        However, the plurality of tooth
cleaning elements 115 further comprise a first arcuate elastomeric wall 170 positioned adjacent
to the first conical tuft 130 and a second arcuate elastomeric wall 180 positioned adjacent to the
second conical tuft 140. In the exemplified embodiment, each of the first and second arcuate
                                                    17
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

elastomeric walls 170, 180 is formed of a resilient elastomeric material, such as a thermoplastic
elastomer. This is different than the first and second arcuate cleaning elements 150, 160 and the
first and second conical tufts 130, 140, which are formed as tufts of bristles.
[0059] The first arcuate elastomeric wall 170 has an arcuate section 171 and a support section
175. The arcuate section 171 has an inner concave surface 172 and an outer convex surface 173.
The inner concave surface 172 of the arcuate section 171 of the first elastomeric wall 170 is
adjacent to and faces the first conical tuft 130. The first arcuate elastomeric wall 170 is located
on the head 110 in between the first conical tuft 130 and the proximal end 118 of the head 110.
Thus, as can be seen, the first arcuate cleaning element 150 and the first arcuate elastomeric wall
170 collectively completely surround the first conical tuft 130. The support section 175 of the
first arcuate elastomeric wall 170 extends from the outer convex surface 173 of the arcuate
section 171 of the first arcuate elastomeric wall 170. More specifically, the support section 175
extends from the outer convex surface 173 of the arcuate section 171 along and in the direction
of the longitudinal axis B-B and in a direction away from the first conical tuft 130. The first
arcuate elastomeric wall 170 provides support for the first conical tuft 130 such that flexing of
the bristles of the first conical tuft 130 in the direction of the first arcuate elastomeric wall 170
will be kept to a minimum during brushing.
[0060] The arcuate section 171 of the first arcuate elastomeric wall 170 terminates in a top
surface 174.               Furthermore, the support section 175 of the first arcuate elastomeric wall 170
terminates in a top surface 176.              The top surface 174 of the arcuate section 171 of the first
arcuate elastomeric wall 170 extends a greater height from the front surface 111 of the head 110
than the top surface 176 of the support section 175 of the first arcuate elastomeric wall 170.
[0061] The second arcuate elastomeric wall 180 has an arcuate section 181 and a support section
185. The arcuate section 181 has an inner concave surface 182 and an outer convex surface 183.
The inner concave surface 182 of the arcuate section 181 of the second elastomeric wall 180 is
adjacent to and faces the second conical tuft 140. The second arcuate elastomeric wall 180 is
located on the head 110 in between the second conical tuft 140 and the distal end 119 of the head
110. Thus, as can be seen, the second arcuate elastomeric element 160 and the second arcuate
elastomeric wall 180 collectively completely surround the second conical tuft 140. The support
section 185 of the second arcuate elastomeric wall 180 extends from the outer convex surface
183 of the arcuate section 181 of the second arcuate elastomeric wall 180. More specifically, the
                                                          18
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

support section 185 extends from the outer convex surface 183 of the arcuate section 181 along
and in the direction of the longitudinal axis B-B and in a direction away from the second conical
tuft 140. The second arcuate elastomeric wall 180 provides support for the second conical tuft
140 such that flexing of the second conical tuft 140 in the direction of the second arcuate
elastomeric wall 180 will be kept to a minimum during brushing.
[0062] The arcuate section 181 of the second arcuate elastomeric wall 180 terminates in a top
surface 184. Furthermore, the support section 185 of the second arcuate elastomeric wall 180
terminates in a top surface 186. The top surface 184 of the arcuate section 181 of the second
arcuate elastomeric wall 180 extends a greater height from the front surface 111 of the head 110
than the top surface 186 of the support section 185 of the second arcuate elastomeric wall 180.
[0063] Referring now to FIGS. 2-4 and 7 concurrently, the oral care implement 100 will be
further described.                  In addition to the above, the tooth cleaning elements 115 also comprise at
least one multi-height bristle tuft 190 that extends from a single tuft hole along a tuft axis. In
certain embodiments, the invention may be directed to the inclusion of one or more of the multi
height bristle tufts 190 on the head 110 regardless of the structure, pattern, shape, and
configuration of the other tooth cleaning elements that are on the head.
[0064] In the exemplified embodiment, a plurality of the multi-height bristle tufts 190 are
positioned on opposing sides of the longitudinal axis B-B.                      Specifically, in the exemplified
embodiment there are four multi-height bristle tufts 190 positioned between the first segment
151 of the first arcuate cleaning element 150 and the first segment 161 of the second arcuate
cleaning element 160 along a first lateral edge of the head 110. Similarly, in the exemplified
embodiment there are four multi-height bristle tufts 190 positioned between the fourth segment
154 of the first arcuate cleaning element 150 and the fourth segment 164 of the second arcuate
cleaning element 160 along a second lateral edge of the head 110. Of course, more or less than
four of the multi-height bristle tufts 190 can be used on the opposing lateral sides of the head 110
in other embodiments as desired. The specific details of the multi-height bristle tufts 190 will
only be denoted in the drawings with regard to one or a couple of the multi-height bristle tufts
190 in order to avoid clutter, it being understood that each of the multi-height bristle tufts 190
has an identical structure.
[0065] Each of the multi-height bristle tufts 190 comprises a first bristle tuft section 191 and a
second bristle tuft section 192. The first bristle tuft section 191 has a rectangular transverse
                                                               19
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

cross-sectional shape and the second bristle tuft section 192 has a U-shaped transverse cross
sectional shape. Despite the multi-height bristle tufts 190 being formed of two different bristle
tuft sections having two different shapes, each multi-height bristle tuft 190 is positioned within a
single tuft hole 189. Thus, the tuft holes 189 within which the multi-height bristle tufts 190 are
positioned have a U-shaped portion and a rectangular-shaped portion that are in spatial
communication with each other.
[0066] As noted above, the second bristle tuft section 192 of the multi-height bristle tufts 190
has a U-shaped transverse cross-sectional shape. Thus, the second bristle tuft sections 192 have
edges at the top of each of the legs of the "U" and a cavity defined between the legs of the "U."
The first bristle tuft section 191 is positioned within the U-shaped cavity formed by the second
bristle tuft section 192 such that the second bristle tuft sections 192 at least partially surround the
first bristle tuft sections 191. Each of the first bristle tuft sections 191 has first and second major
surfaces and first and second minor surfaces. In the exemplified embodiment, one of the minor
surfaces and a portion of each of the major surfaces is surrounded by (and in the exemplified
embodiment in contact with) the second bristle tuft section 192. The other minor surface and the
remainder of the major surfaces of the first bristle tuft sections 191 is exposed and not
surrounded by the second bristle tuft section 192.
[0067] In the exemplified embodiment, approximately one-half of the transverse-cross section of
the first bristle tuft sections 191 is positioned within the U-shaped cavity of the second bristle
tuft sections 192, the other half of the transverse cross-section of the first bristle tuft sections 191
extending from the U-shaped cavity.         Thus, the first bristle tuft sections 191 extend further
laterally away from the longitudinal axis B-B than the second bristle tuft sections 192. The first
bristle tuft sections 191 comprise a first portion 193 that is nested within the U-shape of the
second bristle tuft section 192 and a second portion 194 that transversely protrudes from the U
shape of the second bristle tuft sections 192 in the direction of the lateral sides of the head 110.
The first portion 193 of the first bristle tuft sections 191 that are nested within the U-shape of the
second bristle tuft sections 192 are in surface contact with the second bristle tuft section 192.
The second bristle tuft sections 192 are positioned closer to the longitudinal axis B-B of the head
110 than the first bristle tuft sections 191 because the "U" of the second bristle tuft sections 192
wraps around the side of the first bristle tuft sections 191 that is closest to the longitudinal axis
B-B of the head 110.
                                                    20
10432657 1 (GHMatters) P103700.AU.1

[0068] The multi-height bristles 190 on the first lateral side of the head 110 are longitudinally
aligned with the multi-height bristles 190 on the second lateral side of the head 110.
Furthermore, the convex portions of the "U" of the second bristle tuft sections 192 of the multi
height bristles 190 on the first lateral side of the head 110 are in facing relation with the convex
portions of the U of the second bristle tuft sections 192 of the multi-height bristles 190 on the
second lateral side of the head 110. The first bristle tuft sections 191 of the multi-height bristles
190 extend a greater height from the front surface 111 of the head 110 than the second bristle tuft
sections 192. Thus, the second bristle tuft sections 192 partially surround the first bristle tuft
sections 191 and the first bristle tuft sections 191 axially protrude from an upper surface of the
second bristle tuft sections 192.
[0069] The tooth cleaning elements 115 also include first and second arcuate walls 210, 211 and
a central elastomeric wall 212.               The first and second arcuate walls 210, 211 and the central
elastomeric wall 212 are located centrally on the head in between the first and second arcuate
elastomeric walls 170, 180. The first and second arcuate walls 210, 211 each have a convex
surface and a concave surface. The convex surface of the first and second arcuate walls 210, 211
are facing each other. The concave surface of the first arcuate wall 210 is facing the first set of
the multi-height bristle tufts 190 on the first lateral side of the head. The concave surface of the
second arcuate wall 211 is facing the second set of multi-height bristle tufts 190 on the second
lateral side of the head. The central elastomeric wall 212 is positioned on and elongated along
the longitudinal axis B-B and is adjacent to the convex surfaces of each of the first and second
arcuate walls 210, 211.
[0070] In the exemplified embodiment, the collection of the tooth cleaning elements 115 are all
symmetric about the longitudinal axis B-B and about a transverse axis that is perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis B-B and that divides the head 110 into two equal halves. Thus, the pattern of
the tooth cleaning elements 115 is such that they have lateral and longitudinal symmetry.
[0071] While the invention has been described with respect to specific examples including
presently preferred modes of carrying out the invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate
that there are numerous variations and permutations of the above described systems and
techniques.              It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and
functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
