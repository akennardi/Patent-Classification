                          CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED INFORMATION
         [0001]         This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application
No. 62/425,406, filed November 22, 2016, titled "Dredge Boom", the contents of which are
hereby incorporated herein in its entirety.
                                         TECHNICAL FIELD
         [0002]         The present disclosure is directed to fishing equipment, and more
particularly to an easy mount boom to deploy and drag fishing dredges.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         [0003]         Dredge fishing is a method of recreational fishing that fisherman employ
to target game fish such as marlin, sailfish, wahoo, tuna and dolphin fish. Dredge fishing first
originated in Mexico in the late 1990's and has since spread worldwide throughout the sport
fishing community. What fisherman refer to as a "dredge" is the generic name for an umbrella
like spread of subsurface teasers pulled by a boat. The dredge may include things like clear
vinyl strips emblazoned with reflective fish decals, or a school of hookless artificial lures
creating a virtual ball of bait that can be trolled behind a boat. The main purpose of this is to
mimic a school of swimming baitfish. This presentation is intended to grab the attention of a
passing game fish and then attract the fish closer to the boat where the other baits or lures
containing hooks are being trolled.
         [0004]         Pulling dredges behind small or midsize boats with a one- or two-person
crew is challenging, but very effective. Large boats with towers have a great advantage, because
their dredges can be deployed farther back and deeper while still remaining in view from the
bridge or tower. Many small and midsize vessels lack that benefit. The technique for smaller
boats is to position the dredges as far back as you can and still see them; the objective is spotting
fish coming up on them, and being able to quickly adjust a flat-line bait or pitch out another bait
while the fish is on the dredge.
                                                    2

         [0005]           Since the inception of dredge fishing, fisherman have been constantly
evolving and trying to improve the way that dredges are trolled and retrieved. In the early days of
dredge fishing, fishermen would secure their dredges to a cleat on the transom of the boat and
troll the dredge straight off the stem of the boat. There were two issues with this method. The
first being that the dredges were in the "prop wash" created by the motors so it was hard for fish
to see them and also hard for the captain to see where the dredge was and if a fish was following
it. The other issue with this method was that it is very difficult to retrieve a dredge by hand in
this manner. There is a great deal of resistance created by a dredge being trolled in the water and
the captain would usually have to slow down or stop the boat to retrieve a dredge.
         [0006]           After years of growth and evolution of dredge fishing, most experienced
sport fishing crews have developed a preferred method for trolling and retrieving dredges. This
involves the use of heavy duty electric reels or large conventional reels. The reels are typically
mounted to some sort of conventional rod or a shortened custom rod. The line (usually 3001b
4001b test monofilament) comes off the rod, going up to a pulley on the outrigger, then down to a
second pulley in the water above the dredge, then terminally landed back on the outrigger. Using
this method, fishermen are able to get their dredge in "clean water" outside of the prop wash.
Additionally, they are able to take advantage of load distribution through multiple pulleys to aid
in the retrieval of the dredge.
         [0007]           There are still some issues that arise out of this method. The most pressing
one being that this requires an extremely heavy-duty outrigger that are typically found only on
large sport fishing yachts. Many recreational fishermen on smaller vessels do not have outriggers
that can support the heavy load created by the resistance of a dredge being trolled in the water.
         [0008]           Another issue that arises out of this method of trolling dredges from an
outrigger is that it is a permanent setup that cannot be easily removed and replaced each time one
wants to fish. This means that your heavy duty electric or conventional reels, which could also be
used for other types of fishing, are limited to strictly trolling and retrieving dredges.
         [0009]           Many people have been trying to find an effective way to troll and retrieve
dredges without the use of outriggers for these reasons. Other methods that have been tested are
the use of downriggers or conventional rods acting as a "dredge boom." This is not effective for
multiple reasons. A few examples are the dredges still are in the "prop wash", there is too much
resistance to retrieve the dredge, rods will bend and flex, once they are retrieved, the dredges are
                                                    3

in the way of the fisherman in the cockpit of the boat. There are many more issues that arise from
these methods.
                             BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         [00010]        In a preferred embodiment, a dredge boom assembly is described that
includes an elongated beam having a series of attachment points to connect a mainline using a
first pulley and a terminal end point and one or more support cables and a multi-position ferrule
connected to the elongated beam, the multi-position ferrule allowing the boom assembly to
mount to a universal rod holder. A reel is connected to the dredge boom assembly, the reel holds
the mainline and operable to deploy or retrieve the mainline, where a dredge can be attached to
the dredge boom assembly using the mainline and a second pulley assembly.
         [00011]        In another embodiment, a method for deploying, towing and retrieving a
dredge boom is described. The method includes mounting a dredge boom assembly to a
universal rod holder, where the dredge boom assembly comprises, an elongated beam having a
series of attachment points to connect to support cables and one or more pulleys, the series of
attachment points including at least a support line attachment point, a first pully attachment point
and a terminal end attachment point; and a multi-position ferrule connected to the elongated
beam, the multi-position ferrule able to mount to the universal rod holder. The method further
includes attaching a dredge to the dredge boom assembly using fishing line and at least one
pulley and using a reel to adjust the length of the fishing line to deploy and retrieve the dredge
boom.

                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
         [00024]        An example of a prior art fishing dredge is shown in Figure 1. The dredge
10 is comprised of a series of spreaders 12, to which a bait fish emulating mechanism 13 is
connected. The mechanism may be a series of hookless lures, ribbons with patterns printed on
the sides or other similar structure to appear as a school of bait fish when towed. Tow line 11
connects to the boat through a boom or other structure affixed to the boat.
         [00025]        Referring now to Figure 2, a boat 21 deploying an embodiment of a
dredge boom assembly 20 according to the concepts described herein are shown. Dredge boom
assembly 20 solves the issues that arise with the different methods of pulling and retrieving
dredges from a recreational sport fishing boat. Boat 21 typically includes various cleats 35 and
fishing rod holders 23 arranged along the side and back of the boat. The cleats 35 allow various
ropes and lines to be secured to the boat and the fishing rod holders 23 hold fishing rods that may
or may not be in use. Dredge boom assembly 20, according to the concepts described herein
uses the existing cleats and rod holders already on the typical fishing boat. No extra hardware is
required to be installed on the boat to make use of the dredge boom 20. Dredge boom assembly
20 preferably comprises a boom rod 22 with bend 27. A multi-position ferrule, which will be
described in greater detail with reference to Figures 3-7, allows the end of the dredge boom to
slide into a rod butt 24, which then can be placed in a standard rod holder mounted on the boat.
         [00026]        Boom rod 22 is further secured to the boat with line 28 attached to cleat
35. Line 28 helps support the weight of the dredge as it is pulled through the water. Reel 25
hold line 26 which is used to deploy, tow and retrieve dredge 33. Line 26 passes from reel 25
through guide ring 29 to first pulley 30 then to second pulley assembly 31 and then back to
terminal attachment point 32. Dredge tow line 34 attached dredge 33 to the second pulley
assembly 31. Reel 25 can be electric or manual and sized to hold enough line to tow dredge 33
to a desired position relative to the boat.
         [00027]        Referring now to Figures 3 and 4, boom rod 22 is capable of supporting
vertically the weight that the dredge configuration exerts and also the horizontal drag forces
created by the dredge's movement though the water at speed. Figure 3 shows the dredge boom
without the mainline 26 and support lines such as line 28, while Figure 4 shows a rigged
embodiment of the dredge boom assembly. A series of attachment points, such as attachment
                                                  6

points 41 and 43 and terminal end point 32 are distributed along the length of boom rod 22. The
attachment points can be metal rings or integral apertures or other attachment scheme, and can be
spaced along the structural pole to allow for the attachment (whether fixed or removable) of
various pullies and lines such as first pulley 30 and support line 28. Preferably, the attachment
points include at least the terminal point 32 of mainline which can be attached using a carabiner
42 or similar device, at least attachment point 43 for a pulley 30, and attachment point 41 for
potential support line(s) 28 that assists in counteracting forces exerted on the beam. Other
attachment points can be included for guide rings for the mainline or other similar devices.
Preferred embodiments of the deployed device incorporate an attachment for the dredge to the
main line via a pulley or similar non-fixed attachment, such as pulley assembly 31 and dredge
tow line 34 shown in Figure 4. Allowing the deployed device to attach securely to the main line
allows the device to move along the main line freely as line is deployed or retrieved.
         [00028]         Dredge boom rod 22 also includes a multi-position ferrule 33 that is
designed to slide into a rod butt, such as rod butt 24 from Figure 8. Multi-position ferrule may
be of different sizes to accommodate various rod butt, as described in Figure 6A and 6B, and is
preferably welded to the boom rod 22, though it may also be removably attached to allow
different ferrules to be used with the same boom. A double bend 27 is included at base of main
beam that creates an offset yet parallel trajectory of the main beam of the dredge boom rod 22
and the base that houses an attachment point. The double bend or offset is preferably comprised
of two angle changes that are of equal angle deflection and opposite in relative direction of angle
change. The desired offset of the main beam from the base can be achieved by increasing the
angle of deflection or by increasing the length of span between bends or both to provide
allowances for different size offsets for varying sizes of final product.
         [00029]         Referring now to Figure 5, preferred embodiments include a multi
positional ferrule 33. This adapter mates to the industry standard rod butt base but rather than a
single position, where the "top" of the mated rod and the "top" of the base are in alignment, the
adapter includes multi-positional mating ends that allows the dredge boom to be rotated to the
left or right of center and then locked into place within the rod butt base. The incorporation of
this "multi-positional" ferrule allows the user to deploy the dredge boom on either the port or
starboard side of the boat and eliminates the need for port and starboard side products. The
multi-position ferrule 33 may be secured permanently to the main beam. It may be secured to
                                                  7

the industry standard rod butt through industry standard attachment methods via the use of a
collet nut. A raised collar may be built into the multi-positional base to accommodate the
requirements of a collet nut for secure attachment to the rod butt base.
         [00030]        Referring now to Figure 6A and 6B, embodiments of multi-position
ferrules 60 are shown which accommodate different size rod butts. Each base includes boom
mating portion 61 and 65, raised collar 64 and 68, rod butt mating portion 62 and 66 and locking
pattern 63 and 67. Raised collars 64 and 68 allow for the use of a collet nut to make sure that the
rod butt is securely attached to the boom rod. Rod holder mating portions 62 and 66 insert into
the rod butt while locking patterns 63 and 67 engage with raised portions in the rod butt to
prevent the boom from twisting in the rod butt and to allow multiple orientations of the boom
assembly relative to the rod butt. There are at least two standard sizes of rod butts and rod butt
mating portions 62 and 66 are sized to fit those standard rod butts. Rod butt mating portions 62
and 66 are examples of two of several industry standard rod butt sizes.
         [00031]        Figure 7 shows a preferred embodiment of the locking pattern 70 and
collet nut 71 in greater detail.
         [00032]        Referring now to Figure 8, an embodiment of a rod butt assembly 80 for
use with the dredge boom is shown. Rod butt 24 can have a reel 25 mounted thereto. Receiving
end 82 has an opening allowing the multi-position ferrule of the rod boom assembly to slidably
engaged therein with the locking pattern holding the rod boom in a fixed position relative to the
rod butt 24. Mating end 81 engages with a locking pattern in a rod holder on a boat to hold the
rod butt securely to the rod holder. Figure 9 shows an embodiment of a complete assembly 90
with the rod butt 24 and reel 25 connected to the boom assembly 20 with boom rod 22. Figure
10 shows the dredge boom assembly 20 mounted to the rod butt 24 with reel 25, and the whole
assembly being mounted on boat 21. As described with respect to Figure 2, rod butt 24 is
inserted into rod holder 23. A support line is connected to cleat 35 to support rod boom 22 as it
tows dredge 33.
         [00033]        The dredge boom described herein extends the range perpendicular to the
direction of travel that the dredge can be deployed. It makes use of the mechanical advantage
offered by a pulley system rather than simply using a pulley as a friction free line guide. By
offsetting the main beam and incorporating an elevation change it prevents contact of the main
beam and the main line thus reducing potential friction, snags, and breakage. The use of the
                                                  8

multi-positional base makes use of industry standard fittings that make the dredge boom easily
attachable to an existing rod butt base and reel, and allows for multi-side deployment of the
dredge boom.
         [00034]        Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in
detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made
herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended
