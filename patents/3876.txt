                                            ABSTRACT
The present invention provides methods for inhibiting or attenuating tumor growth in a subject
by administering an IL-6 antagonist to the subject. In certain embodiments, the methods of the
invention are used to inhibit the growth of an anti-VEGF-resistant tumor in a subject. The IL-6
antagonist may be, e.g., an antibody that specifically binds IL-6R. The IL-6 antagonist may be
administered in combination with a VEGF antagonist, and/or an EGFR antagonist.

    METHODS OF INHIBITING TUMOR GROWTH BY ANTAGONIZING IL-6 RECEPTOR
                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The present invention relates to compositions and methods for inhibiting or attenuating
tumor growth or proliferation in a subject. More specifically, the invention relates to methods
comprising administering an interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonist to a tumor-bearing subject.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0002] Antagonists of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been shown to
effectively inhibit tumor growth in numerous experimental and clinical settings. VEGF
antagonists exert their therapeutic effects by targeting the tumor vasculature. It has been
observed, however, that tumors under certain circumstances can develop resistance to anti
VEGF agents. Thus, there is a need in the art for new therapeutic approaches for treating
tumors, including methods of inhibiting the growth of tumors that have developed resistance to
anti-VEGF therapies.
[0003] Interleukin-6 ("IL-6") is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is expressed in multiple
cancer types. Clinical studies have shown that increased serum IL-6 levels are associated
with worse patient outcomes. Elevated expression of IL-6 can result from the activation of
oncogenic signaling pathways and/or as a consequence of chronic inflammation, which has
been associated with the development of cancer. IL-6 signals through its heterodimeric
receptor IL-6R/gp130 to activate the JAK/STAT and Ras signaling pathways. In particular, IL
6 strongly activates STAT3, which has been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation,
invasion and survival. Inhibition of IL-6 signaling with monoclonal antibodies directed against
IL-6 or IL-6R has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in several preclinical models, suggesting
that the IL-6 pathway is an attractive therapeutic target for cancer. An association between IL
6 levels and anti-VEGF resistance, or the use of IL-6 antagonists to treat anti-VEGF resistant
tumors, however, has not been described.
                              BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0004] The present invention is based, at least in part, on the surprising discovery that anti
VEGF-resistant tumors express elevated levels of IL-6 and that antagonism of IL-6 (e.g., by
using an anti-IL-6R antibody), when combined with anti-VEGF therapy, is able to overcome
anti-VEGF resistance in tumors and thus provides robust anti-tumor activity against tumors
that heretofore were deemed unresponsive to VEGF antagonism.
[0005] Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention, methods and compositions are
provided for inhibiting or attenuating the growth of an anti-VEGF-resistant tumor in a subject.
According to certain embodiments of this aspect of the invention, methods of cancer therapy
are provided comprising: (i) measuring the level of IL-6/STAT3 signaling in a tumor biopsy
                                                  1

from a subject; and (ii) administering an IL-6 antagonist to the subject if the tumor biopsy
exhibits increased IL-6/STAT3 signaling. The methods according to this aspect of the
invention also comprise administering to the subject an IL-6 antagonist and a VEGF
antagonist. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, compositions are provided which
comprise at least one IL-6 antagonist and at least one VEGF antagonist.
[0006] According to another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for
enhancing the anti-tumor activity of an IL-6 antagonist. The methods according to this aspect
of the invention comprise administering at least one additional anti-tumor agent to a tumor
bearing subject in combination with an IL-6 antagonist. The additional anti-tumor agent can
be, e.g., a VEGF antagonist, an EGFR antagonist, or a combination thereof.
[0007] The antagonist molecules of the invention can be, e.g., antigen-specific binding
proteins, including antigen-specific binding proteins that specifically bind, e.g., IL-6, IL-6R,
VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, EGFR, EGFRvIII, ErbB2, ErbB3, and/or ErbB4. Antigen-specific
binding proteins of the present invention include antibodies and antigen-binding fragments
thereof. Antigen-specific binding proteins also include fusion polypeptides comprising ligand
binding portions of one or more receptor molecules. In certain exemplary embodiments, the
IL-6 antagonist is an antibody that specifically binds IL-6R, the VEGF antagonist is a VEGF
binding fusion molecule comprising VEGF binding domains of VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and a
multimerizing domain (a "VEGF-Trap"), and the EGFR antagonist is an antibody that
specifically binds EGFR (ErbB1/HER1), or an antibody that specifically binds ErbB3, or an
antibody that specifically binds ErbB4. However, other antagonists can be used in the context
of the present invention as described elsewhere herein.
[0008] Other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from a review of the
ensuing detailed description.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0012] Before the present invention is described, it is to be understood that this invention is
not limited to particular methods and experimental conditions described, as such methods and
conditions may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the
purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since
the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims.
[0013] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same
meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention
belongs. As used herein, the term "about," when used in reference to a particular recited
numerical value, means that the value may vary from the recited value by no more than 1%.
For example, as used herein, the expression "about 100" includes 99 and 101 and all values
in between (e.g., 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, etc.).
[0014] Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein
can be used in the practice of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are
now described.
Methods for Inhibiting or Attenuating Tumor Growth
[0015] The present invention provides methods for inhibiting or attenuating the growth of a
tumor in a subject. The invention includes administering an IL-6 antagonist to a tumor-bearing
subject. The IL-6 antagonist may be administered in combination with one or more additional
therapeutic agents. Exemplary therapeutic agents that can be administered in combination
with an IL-6 antagonist, in accordance with the methods of the present invention, include, e.g.,
antagonists of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) antagonists (as defined herein). Further examples of therapeutic agents that
can be administered in combination with an IL-6 antagonist in accordance with the methods of
the present invention are described elsewhere herein.
[0016]    The methods of the present invention are useful for the treatment of primary and/or
metastatic tumors arising in the brain and meninges, oropharynx, lung and bronchial tree,
gastrointestinal tract, male and female reproductive tract, muscle, bone, skin and
appendages, connective tissue, spleen, immune system, blood forming cells and bone
marrow, liver and urinary tract, and special sensory organs such as the eye. Specific cancers
that are treatable according to the methods of the present invention include, e.g., renal cell
carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma,
colorectal cancer, malignant mesothelioma, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, and
melanoma.
[0017] In certain embodiments, the methods of the present invention are useful for the
treatment of anti-VEGF-resistant tumors in a subject. An "anti-VEGF-resistant tumor," as
                                                 3

used herein, means a tumor that does not respond, or only partially responds, to treatment
with an anti-VEGF agent such as an anti-VEGF antibody, an anti-VEGF receptor antibody, or
any other VEGF-specific binding protein (including, e.g., a VEGF-trap, as defined herein). For
example, an anti-VEGF-resistant tumor can be, e.g., a tumor that, when contacted with an
amount of VEGF antagonist that is ordinarily capable of inhibiting or attenuating the growth of
at least one type of tumor, continues to grow and/or proliferate in vitro or in vivo (e.g., in cell
culture or when implanted into an animal). An anti-VEGF-resistant tumor may be a tumor
derived from tumor cells that originally responded to anti-VEGF therapy, but through selection,
mutation or adaptation, have acquired resistance to one or more anti-VEGF agents.
[0018] The subjects that are treatable using the methods of the present invention include any
subject diagnosed with cancer or identified as having a tumor. In certain embodiments, the
subject is a patient who has been diagnosed or identified as having a tumor that is at least
partially resistant to anti-VEGF treatment. Methods for diagnosing a patient as having an anti
VEGF resistant tumor will be known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and can be practiced
using routine diagnostic methods.
[0019] As shown in the Examples herein, tumor cells that are resistant to anti-VEGF therapy
are shown to express higher levels of IL-6 and phospho-STAT3 than the parental non
resistant tumor cells. Thus, the present invention also includes methods of cancer therapy
comprising: (i) measuring the level of IL-6/STAT3 signaling in a subject (e.g., in a serum
sample, tissue sample, tumor biopsy, etc., obtained from the subject); and (ii) administering an
IL-6 antagonist to the subject if the subject (or sample/biopsy obtained therefrom) exhibits
increased IL-6/STAT3 signaling.
[0020] According to certain embodiments of the present invention, the expression "increased
IL-6/STAT-3 signaling" means that the amount of IL-6 and/or amount of phospho-STAT3
measured in a tumor biopsy is at least 3x higher (e.g., 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x or more) than in a tumor
that is sensitive (i.e., not resistant) to anti-VEGF therapy. According to certain embodiments
of the present invention, "increased IL-6/STAT-3 signaling" means that the ratio of phospho
STAT3 to an invariant control protein (e.g., the P-STAT3/actin ratio) in a sample taken from a
subject is greater than about 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, or more.
According to certain embodiments of the present invention, "increased IL-6/STAT-3 signaling"
means that the concentration of IL-6 in a tumor sample taken from a subject is greater than
about 50 pg/ml, 55 pg/ml, 60 pg/ml, 65 pg/ml, 70 pg/ml, 75 pg/ml, 80 pg/ml, 85 pg/ml, 90
pg/ml, 95 pg/ml, 100 pg/ml, 110 pg/ml, 120 pg/ml, 130 pg/ml, 140 pg/ml, 150 pg/ml, 160
pg/ml, 170 pg/ml, 180 pg/ml, 190 pg/ml, 200 pg/ml, or higher. Levels of IL-6 and phospho
STAT3 can be measured, e.g., using Western blot, ELISA, or by any other
immunohistochemical methodology known in the art.
                                                   4

[0021] Similarly, the present invention also includes methods for determining whether a
tumor-bearing patient has an anti-VEGF-resistant tumor. Methods according to this aspect of
the invention comprise measuring the level of IL-6/STAT3 signaling in a sample (e.g., tumor
biopsy) from a patient, wherein "increased IL-6/STAT3 signaling" in the sample (as that
expression is defined herein above) identifies the subject as having an anti-VEGF-resistant
tumor. Since the present inventors have demonstrated that anti-VEGF-resistant tumors are
sensitive to IL-6 antagonism, the methods according to this aspect of the invention may, in
certain embodiments, further comprise administering to the patient an IL-6 antagonist and/or a
VEGF antagonist.
Antagonists
[0022] The present invention includes methods that comprise administering an IL-6
antagonist, a VEGF antagonist, an EGFR antagonist, and/or combinations thereof, to a
subject in need thereof. As used herein, an "IL-6 antagonist" is any agent which binds to or
interacts with IL-6 and inhibits the normal biological signaling function of IL-6 in vitro or in vivo.
The term "IL-6 antagonist" also includes antagonists of IL-6 receptor ("IL-6R", i.e., "IL-6R
antagonists). An IL-6R antagonist may be any agent which binds to or interacts with IL-6R
and inhibits the normal biological signaling function of IL-6R in vitro or in vivo.
[0023] A VEGF antagonist can be any agent which binds to or interacts with VEGF or a
VEGF receptor (VEGFR1, also referred to as Flt1; or VEGFR2, also referred to as FIk1 or
KDR).
[0024] An EGFR antagonist can be any agent which binds to or interacts with an epidermal
growth factor receptor and inhibits the normal biological signaling function of the receptor in
vitro or in vivo. The expression "EGFR antagonist," as used herein, includes antagonists of
any one or more members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. For example, an
EGFR antagonist may be an antagonist of EGFR (also referred to as ErbB1 or HER1), an
antagonist of a variant of EGFR such as, e.g., EGFRvIII, an antagonist of ErbB2 (also referred
to as HER2 or Neu), an antagonist of ErbB3 (also referred to as HER3), and/or an antagonist
of ErbB4 (also referred to as HER4).
[0025] Antagonists of IL-6, IL-6R, VEGF, VEGF receptors, and EGFRs include small
molecule antagonists, as well as antigen-specific binding proteins, as described elsewhere
herein.
Antigen-Specific Binding Proteins
[0026] The antagonists that are useful in the methods of the present invention include
antigen-specific binding proteins. For example, the present invention includes methods
comprising administering an antigen-specific binding protein that specifically binds interleukin
6 (IL-6) or IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) to a subject. The present invention also includes methods
                                                 5

comprising administering an antigen-specific binding protein that specifically binds vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or a VEGF receptor (VEGFR), or an antigen-specific
binding protein that specifically binds epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, EGFRvIII,
ErbB2, ErbB3, and/or ErbB4) to a subject.
[0027] As used herein, the expression "antigen-specific binding protein" means a protein
comprising at least one domain which specifically binds a particular antigen. Exemplary
categories of antigen-specific binding proteins include antibodies, antigen-binding portions of
antibodies, peptides that specifically interact with a particular antigen (e.g., peptibodies),
receptor molecules that specifically interact with a particular antigen, and proteins comprising
a ligand-binding portion of a receptor that specifically binds a particular antigen.
[0028] The term "specifically binds" or the like, as used herein, means that an antigen
specific binding protein, or an antigen-specific binding domain, forms a complex with a
particular antigen characterized by a dissociation constant (KD) of 500 pM or less, and/or does
not bind other unrelated antigens under ordinary test conditions. "Unrelated antigens" are
proteins, peptides or polypeptides that have less than 75% amino acid identity to one another.
Methods for determining whether two molecules specifically bind one another are well known
in the art and include, for example, equilibrium dialysis, surface plasmon resonance, and the
like. For example, an antigen-specific binding protein or an antigen-specific binding domain,
as used in the context of the present invention, includes molecules that bind a particular
antigen (e.g., IL-6, IL-6R, VEGF, VEGFR and/or EGFR) or a portion thereof with a        KD of less
than about 500 pM, less than about 400 pM, less than about 300 pM, less than about 200 pM,
less than about 100 pM, less than about 90 pM, less than about 80 pM, less than about 70
pM, less than about 60 pM, less than about 50 pM, less than about 40 pM, less than about 30
pM, less than about 20 pM, less than about 10 pM, less than about 5 pM, less than about 4
pM, less than about 2 pM, less than about 1 pM, less than about 0.5 pM, less than about 0.2
pM, less than about 0.1 pM, or less than about 0.05 pM, as measured in a surface plasmon
resonance assay.
[0029] As used herein, an antigen-specific binding protein or antigen-specific binding domain
"does not bind" to an unrelated antigen if the protein or binding domain, when tested for
binding to the unrelated antigen at 250C in a surface plasmon resonance assay, exhibits a KD
of greater than 1000 pM, or fails to exhibit any binding in such an assay or equivalent thereof.
[0030] The term "surface plasmon resonance", as used herein, refers to an optical
phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time interactions by detection of alterations in
protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BlAcoreTM system
(Biacore Life Sciences division of GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).
[0031] The term "KD ", as used herein, means the equilibrium dissociation constant of a
particular protein-protein interaction (e.g., antibody-antigen interaction). Unless indicated
                                                   6

otherwise, the   KD values disclosed herein refer to  KD  values determined by surface plasmon
resonance assay at 250C.
Antibodies and Antigen-Binding Fragments of Antibodies
[0032] As indicated above, an antigen-specific binding protein can comprise or consist of an
antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that specifically binds a particular antigen
(e.g., anti-IL-6 antibody, anti-IL-6R antibody, anti-VEGF antibody, anti-VEGFR antibody and/or
anti-EGFR antibody, or antigen-binding fragments thereof).
[0033] The term "antibody", as used herein, includes immunoglobulin molecules comprising
four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by
disulfide bonds, as well as multimers thereof (e.g., IgM). Each heavy chain comprises a
heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant
region. The heavy chain constant region comprises three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3 . Each
light chain comprises a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a
light chain constant region. The light chain constant region comprises one domain (CL1). The
VH  and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed
complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more
conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each         VH  and VL is composed of three CDRs and
four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1,
CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. In different embodiments of the invention, the FRs of
the antibodies (or antigen-binding portion thereof) may be identical to the human germline
sequences, or may be naturally or artificially modified. An amino acid consensus sequence
may be defined based on a side-by-side analysis of two or more CDRs.
[0034]     The term "antibody," as used herein, also includes antigen-binding fragments of full
antibody molecules. The terms "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody, "antigen-binding
fragment" of an antibody, and the like, as used herein, include any naturally occurring,
enzymatically obtainable, synthetic, or genetically engineered polypeptide or glycoprotein that
specifically binds an antigen to form a complex. Antigen-binding fragments of an antibody
may be derived, e.g., from full antibody molecules using any suitable standard techniques
such as proteolytic digestion or recombinant genetic engineering techniques involving the
manipulation and expression of DNA encoding antibody variable and optionally constant
domains. Such DNA is known and/or is readily available from, e.g., commercial sources, DNA
libraries (including, e.g., phage-antibody libraries), or can be synthesized. The DNA may be
sequenced and manipulated chemically or by using molecular biology techniques, for
example, to arrange one or more variable and/or constant domains into a suitable
configuration, or to introduce codons, create cysteine residues, modify, add or delete amino
acids, etc.
                                                  7

[0035] Non-limiting examples of antigen-binding fragments include: (i) Fab fragments; (ii)
 F(ab')2 fragments; (iii) Fd fragments; (iv) Fv fragments; (v) single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules;
(vi) dAb fragments; and (vii) minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues
that mimic the hypervariable region of an antibody (e.g., an isolated complementarity
 determining region (CDR) such as a CDR3 peptide), or a constrained FR3-CDR3-FR4
peptide. Other engineered molecules, such as domain-specific antibodies, single domain
antibodies, domain-deleted antibodies, chimeric antibodies, CODR-grafted antibodies,
 diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, minibodies, nanobodies (e.g. monovalent nanobodies,
 bivalent nanobodies, etc.), small modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs), and shark
variable IgNAR domains, are also encompassed within the expression "antigen-binding
fragment," as used herein.
[0036] An antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least one variable
domain. The variable domain may be of any size or amino acid composition and will generally
comprise at least one CDR which is adjacent to or in frame with one or more framework
sequences. In antigen-binding fragments having a VH domain associated with a VL domain,
the  VH   and VL domains may be situated relative to one another in any suitable arrangement.
For example, the variable region may be dimeric and contain          VH-VH, VH-VL    or VL-VL dimers.
Alternatively, the antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain a monomeric              VH   or VL
domain.
[0037] In certain embodiments, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain at
least one variable domain covalently linked to at least one constant domain. Non-limiting,
exemplary configurations of variable and constant domains that may be found within an
antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention include: (i)          VH-CH1;  (ii) VH
CH2 ; (iii) VH-CH3; (iv) VH-CHI-CH 2 ; (v) VH-CHI-CH 2 -CH 3 ; (vi) VH-CH2 -CH 3 ; (vii) VH-CL; (viii) VL
CH1; (iX) VL-CH2; (X) VL-CH3; (Xi) VL-CHI-CH 2 ; (Xii) VL-CHI-CH 2 -CH 3 ; (Xiii) VL-CH 2 -CH 3 ; and (xiv)
VL-CL. In any configuration of variable and constant domains, including any of the exemplary
configurations listed above, the variable and constant domains may be either directly linked to
one another or may be linked by a full or partial hinge or linker region. A hinge region may
consist of at least 2 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60 or more) amino acids which result in a flexible
or semi-flexible linkage between adjacent variable and/or constant domains in a single
polypeptide molecule. Moreover, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present
invention may comprise a homo-dimer or hetero-dimer (or other multimer) of any of the
variable and constant domain configurations listed above in non-covalent association with one
another and/or with one or more monomeric        VH or VL domain (e.g., by disulfide bond(s)).
[0038] The molecules of the present invention may comprise or consist of human antibodies
and/or recombinant human antibodies, or fragments thereof. The term "human antibody", as
used herein, includes antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human
germline immunoglobulin sequences. Human antibodies may nonetheless include amino acid
                                                   8

residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations
introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for
example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term "human antibody", as used
herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the
germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human
framework sequences.
[0039] The molecules of the present invention may comprise or consist of recombinant
human antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof. The term "recombinant human
antibody", as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared,
expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a
recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell (described further below),
antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library (described
further below), antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human
immunoglobulin genes (see e.g., Taylor et al. (1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295) or
antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing
of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant
human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline
immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human
antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig
sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the
VH  and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and
related to human germline    VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human
antibody germline repertoire in vivo.
Anti-IL-6R Antibodies and Antigen-Binding Fragments Thereof
[0040] The methods of the present invention, according to certain embodiments, comprises
administering an anti-IL-6R antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, to a subject. The
terms "interleukin-6 receptor", "IL-6R", and the like, as used herein, are intended to refer to a
human cytokine receptor that specifically binds interleukin-6 (IL-6). The extracellular domain
of human IL-6R has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1. Anti-IL-6R
antibodies are mentioned in, e.g., US Patent Nos. 5,795,695; 5,817,790; 6,410,691;
6,670,373; and 7,582,298.      Any of the anti-IL-6R antibodies mentioned and/or described in
any of the foregoing publications, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, can be used in the
context of the present invention. A non-limiting, exemplary anti-IL-6R antibody that can be
used in the context of the present invention is an anti-IL-6R antibody, or antigen-binding
fragment thereof, comprising the heavy and light chain CDRs of the HCVR/LCVR amino acid
pair comprising SEQ ID NOs: 2/3. For example, the anti-IL-6R antibody can be an antibody,
or antigen-binding fragment thereof, comprising heavy chain CDRs (HCDR1, HCDR2 and
                                                  9

HCDR3) having the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 4, 5, and 6, respectively; and light
chain CDRs (LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3) having the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs:
7, 8, and 9, respectively.
VEGF Antagonists
[0041] The methods of the present invention, according to certain embodiments, comprises
administering a VEGF antagonist to a subject. As used herein, the expression "VEGF
antagonist" means any molecule that blocks, reduces or interferes with the normal biological
activity of VEGF. VEGF antagonists include molecules which interfere with the interaction
between VEGF and a natural VEGF receptor, e.g., molecules which bind to VEGF or a VEGF
receptor and prevent or otherwise hinder the interaction between VEGF and a VEGF receptor.
Specific exemplary VEGF antagonists include anti-VEGF antibodies, anti-VEGF receptor
antibodies, and VEGF receptor-based chimeric molecules (also referred to herein as "VEGF
Traps").
[0042] VEGF receptor-based chimeric molecules include chimeric polypeptides which
comprise two or more immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains of a VEGF receptor such as VEGFR1
(also referred to as Flt1) and/or VEGFR2 (also referred to as FIk1 or KDR), and may also
contain a multimerizing domain (e.g., an Fc domain which facilitates the multimerization [e.g.,
dimerization] of two or more chimeric polypeptides). An exemplary VEGF receptor-based
chimeric molecule is a molecule referred to as VEGFR1 R2-FcAC1 (a) which is encoded by the
nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:10. VEGFR1R2-FcAC1(a) comprises three
components: (1) a VEGFR1 component comprising amino acids 27 to 129 of SEQ ID NO:1 1;
(2) a VEGFR2 component comprising amino acids 130 to 231 of SEQ ID NO: 11; and (3) a
multimerization component ("FcAC1 (a)") comprising amino acids 232 to 457 of SEQ ID NO: 11
(the C-terminal amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 11 [i.e., K458] may or may not be included in the
VEGF antagonist used in the methods of the invention; see e.g., US Patent 7,396,664).
Amino acids 1-26 of SEQ ID NO: 11 are the signal sequence.
Combination Therapies
[0043] The methods of the present invention, according to certain embodiments, comprise
administering to the subject an IL-6 antagonist in combination with one or more additional
therapeutic agent(s) such as a VEGF antagonist and/or an EGFR antagonist. As used herein,
the expression "in combination with" means that the additional therapeutic agents are
administered before, after, or concurrent with the IL-6 antagonist. For example, when
administered "before" the IL-6 antagonist, the additional therapeutic agent may be
administered about 72 hours, about 60 hours, about 48 hours, about 36 hours, about 24
hours, about 12 hours, about 10 hours, about 8 hours, about 6 hours, about 4 hours, about 2
hours, about 1 hour, about 30 minutes, about 15 minutes or about 10 minutes prior to the
                                                10

administration of the IL-6 antagonist. When administered "after" the IL-6 antagonist, the
additional therapeutic agent may be administered about 10 minutes, about 15 minutes, about
30 minutes, about 1 hour, about 2 hours, about 4 hours, about 6 hours, about 8 hours, about
10 hours, about 12 hours, about 24 hours, about 36 hours, about 48 hours, about 60 hours or
about 72 hours after the administration of the IL-6 antagonist. Administration "concurrent" with
the IL-6 antagonist means that the additional therapeutic agent is administered to the subject
in a separate dosage form within less than 5 minutes (before, after, or at the same time) of
administration of the IL-6 antagonist, or administered to the subject as a single combined
dosage formulation comprising both the additional therapeutic agent and the IL-6 antagonist
(e.g., a single formulation comprising an anti-IL-6R antibody + a VEGF Trap; or a single
formulation comprising an anti-IL-6R antibody + an anti-EGFR antibody; or a single
formulation comprising an anti-IL-6R antibody + an anti-ErbB3 antibody; etc.).
Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Administration
[0044] The present invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising an IL-6
antagonist. The present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising an
IL-6 antagonist and a second active component such as a VEGF antagonist and/or an EGFR
antagonist. For example, the present invention includes pharmaceutical compositions
comprising an anti-IL-6R antibody and a VEGF-Trap molecule; the present invention also
includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising an anti-IL-6R antibody and an anti-EGFR
antibody. Methods of treatment comprising administering such pharmaceutical compositions
to a patient are also encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
[0045] The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are formulated with suitable
carriers, excipients, and other agents that provide suitable transfer, delivery, tolerance, and
the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in, e.g., Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA. Suitable formulations
include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or
anionic) containing vesicles (such as LIPOFECTIN     TM
                                                        ), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption
pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of
various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax.
Additional suitable formulations are also described in Powell et al. "Compendium of excipients
for parenteral formulations" PDA (1998) J Pharm Sci Technol 52:238-311.
[0046] Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes,
microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses,
receptor mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu et al., 1987, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432).
Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular,
intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The
                                                11

compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus
injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal
and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active
agents.
[0047] A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered
subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect
to subcutaneous delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a
pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be
reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable
cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical
composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty
cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the
pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable
pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery
device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the
device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition, the entire device is
discarded.
[0048] Numerous reusable pen and autoinjector delivery devices have applications in the
subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Examples
include, but are not limited to AUTOPEN      TM
                                                (Owen Mumford, Inc., Woodstock, UK),

                     pen (Disetronic Medical Systems, Bergdorf, Switzerland), HUMALOG MIX
75/25TM pen, HUMALOG T M pen, HUMALIN 70/30TM pen (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN),
NOVOPEN T M 1,11and III (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), NOVOPEN JUNIOR T M
(Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), BD TM pen (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ),
OPTIPEN    TM
               , OPTIPEN PRO T M , OPTIPEN STARLET T M , and OPTICLIK        TM
                                                                                (sanofi-aventis,
Frankfurt, Germany), to name only a few. Examples of disposable pen delivery devices
having applications in subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present
invention include, but are not limited to the SOLOSTAR T M pen (sanofi-aventis), the
FLEXPEN     TM
                 (Novo Nordisk), and the KWIKPEN    TM
                                                       (Eli Lilly), the SURECLICKTM Autoinjector
(Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), the PENLETTM (Haselmeier, Stuttgart, Germany), the EPIPEN
(Dey, L.P.), and the HUMIRATM Pen (Abbott Labs, Abbott Park IL), to name only a few.
[0049] In certain situations, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be
delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see
Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201). In another embodiment,
polymeric materials can be used; see, Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and
Wise (eds.), 1974, CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Florida. In yet another embodiment, a controlled
release system can be placed in proximity of the composition's target, thus requiring only a
fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, 1984, in Medical Applications of Controlled
                                                  12

Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the
review by Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533.
[0050] The injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous, subcutaneous,
intracutaneous and intramuscular injections, drip infusions, etc. These injectable preparations
may be prepared by known methods. For example, the injectable preparations may be
prepared, e.g., by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described
above in a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As
the aqueous medium for injections, there are, for example, physiological saline, an isotonic
solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents, etc., which may be used in
combination with an appropriate solubilizing agent such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), a
polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant [e.g.,
polysorbate 80, HCO-50 (polyoxyethylene (50 mol) adduct of hydrogenated castor oil)], etc.
As the oily medium, there are employed, e.g., sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., which may be
used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc.
The injection thus prepared is preferably filled in an appropriate ampoule.
[0051] Advantageously, the pharmaceutical compositions for oral or parenteral use described
above are prepared into dosage forms in a unit dose suited to fit a dose of the active
ingredients. Such dosage forms in a unit dose include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules,
injections (ampoules), suppositories, etc.
Dosage
[0052] The amount of active ingredient(s) (e.g., IL-6 antagonist, VEGF antagonist, EGFR
antagonist, etc.) that can be administered to a subject is, generally, a therapeutically effective
amount. As used herein, the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means a dose of
antigen-specific binding proteins and/or antigen-binding molecules that results in a decrease
in tumor growth or weight of at least 5%, relative to a negative control, when administered to a
tumor bearing animal (See, e.g., Example 1 herein). For example, a "therapeutically effective
amount" of an IL-6R-specific binding protein, a VEGF-specific binding protein, and/or an
EGFR-specific binding protein includes, e.g., an amount of such antigen-specific binding
protein(s) that, when administered to a tumor bearing animal, causes a decrease in tumor
growth or weight of at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%,
60%, 65%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 100%, relative to negative control-treated animals.
[0053] In the case of antigen-specific binding proteins of the present invention (e.g., anti-IL
6R antibodies, anti-EGFR antibodies, anti-ErbB3 antibodies, and/or VEGF-Trap molecules), a
therapeutically effective amount can be from about 0.05 mg to about 600 mg; e.g., about 0.05
mg, about 0.1 mg, about 1.0 mg, about 1.5 mg, about 2.0 mg, about 10 mg, about 20 mg,
about 30 mg, about 40 mg, about 50 mg, about 60 mg, about 70 mg, about 80 mg, about 90
mg, about 100 mg, about 110 mg, about 120 mg, about 130 mg, about 140 mg, about 150 mg,
                                                 13

about 160 mg, about 170 mg, about 180 mg, about 190 mg, about 200 mg, about 210 mg,
about 220 mg, about 230 mg, about 240 mg, about 250 mg, about 260 mg, about 270 mg,
about 280 mg, about 290 mg, about 300 mg, about 310 mg, about 320 mg, about 330 mg,
about 340 mg, about 350 mg, about 360 mg, about 370 mg, about 380 mg, about 390 mg,
about 400 mg, about 410 mg, about 420 mg, about 430 mg, about 440 mg, about 450 mg,
about 460 mg, about 470 mg, about 480 mg, about 490 mg, about 500 mg, about 510 mg,
about 520 mg, about 530 mg, about 540 mg, about 550 mg, about 560 mg, about 570 mg,
about 580 mg, about 590 mg, or about 600 mg, of the respective antigen-specific binding
protein. For example, according to certain specific embodiments in which an anti-IL-6R
antibody is administered (e.g., mAb1 discussed herein), the antibody may be administered to
a subject at a dose of 100 mg, 150 mg, or 200 mg, (e.g., at a frequency of once a week, once
every two weeks, etc.).
[0054] The amount of antigen-specific binding proteins of the present invention contained
within the individual doses may be expressed in terms of milligrams of antibody per kilogram
of patient body weight (i.e., mg/kg). For example, the anti-IL-6R antibodies, anti-EGFR
antibodies, anti-ErbB3 antibodies, and/or VEGF-Trap molecules of the present invention may
be administered to a patient at a dose of about 0.0001 to about 50 mg/kg of patient body
weight (e.g. 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 16
mg/kg, 17 mg/kg, 18 mg/kg, 19 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 21 mg/kg, 22 mg/kg, 23 mg/kg, 24 mg/kg,
25 mg/kg, 26 mg/kg, 27 mg/kg, 28 mg/kg, 29 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 35 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, etc.).
According to certain exemplary embodiments, the amount of VEGF-Trap molecule
administered to the patient in a particular dose is 4 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg.
[0055] The active ingredients (e.g., anti-IL-6R antibodies, anti-EGFR antibodies, anti-ErbB3
antibodies, and/or VEGF-Trap molecules) may be present in the compositions of the present
invention in equal amounts, or alternatively, may be present in amounts that vary from one
another by a factor of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, or more. A person of ordinary skill in the art,
using routine experimentation, will be able to determine the appropriate amounts of the
individual components in the compositions of the present invention necessary to produce a
desired therapeutic effect.
Administration Regimens
[0056] According to certain embodiments of the present invention, multiple doses of the
compositions of the present invention (e.g., compositions comprising an IL-6 antagonist, a
VEGF antagonist and/or an EGFR antagonist), may be administered to a subject over a
defined time course. The methods according to this aspect of the invention comprise
sequentially administering to a subject multiple doses of the composition(s) of the present
invention. As used herein, "sequentially administering" means that each dose of the
composition(s) of the present invention are administered to the subject at a different point in
                                                   14

time, e.g., on different days separated by a predetermined interval (e.g., hours, days, weeks
or months). The present invention includes methods which comprise sequentially
administering to the patient an initial dose of a composition of the present invention, followed
by one or more secondary doses of the composition, and optionally followed by one or more
tertiary doses of the composition.
[0057] The terms "initial dose," "secondary doses," and "tertiary doses," refer to the temporal
sequence of administration of the compositions of the present invention. Thus, the "initial
dose" is the dose which is administered at the beginning of the treatment regimen (also
referred to as the "baseline dose"); the "secondary doses" are the doses which are
administered after the initial dose; and the "tertiary doses" are the doses which are
administered after the secondary doses. The initial, secondary, and tertiary doses may all
contain the same amount of active ingredient(s), but will generally differ from one another in
terms of frequency of administration. In certain embodiments, however, the amount of active
ingredient(s) contained in the initial, secondary and/or tertiary doses will vary from one
another (e.g., adjusted up or down as appropriate) during the course of treatment.
[0058] In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, each secondary and/or tertiary
dose is administered 1 to 30 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, or more) days after the immediately preceding
dose. The phrase "the immediately preceding dose," as used herein, means, in a sequence of
multiple administrations, the dose(s) of the compositions of the present invention which are
administered to a subject prior to the administration of the very next dose in the sequence with
no intervening doses.
[0059] The methods according to this aspect of the invention may comprise administering to
a patient any number of secondary and/or tertiary doses of the compositions of the present
invention. For example, in certain embodiments, only a single secondary dose is
administered to the patient. In other embodiments, two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or
more) secondary doses are administered to the patient. Likewise, in certain embodiments,
only a single tertiary dose is administered to the patient. In other embodiments, two or more
(e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more) tertiary doses are administered to the patient.
[0060] In embodiments involving multiple secondary doses, each secondary dose may be
administered at the same frequency as the other secondary doses. For example, each
secondary dose may be administered to the patient 1 to 29 days after the immediately
preceding dose. Similarly, in embodiments involving multiple tertiary doses, each tertiary
dose may be administered at the same frequency as the other tertiary doses. For example,
each tertiary dose may be administered to the patient 1 to 60 days after the immediately
preceding dose. Alternatively, the frequency at which the secondary and/or tertiary doses are
administered to a patient can vary over the course of the treatment regimen. The frequency of
                                                   15

administration may also be adjusted during the course of treatment by a physician depending
on the needs of the individual patient following clinical examination.
                                            EXAMPLES
[0061] The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art
with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the methods and
compositions of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors
regard as their invention. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to
numbers used (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.) but some experimental errors and deviations
should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, molecular
weight is average molecular weight, temperature is in degrees Centigrade, and pressure is at
or near atmospheric.
Example 1. An Anti-IL-6R Monoclonal Antibody Inhibits Tumor Xenograft Growth as a
Single Agent and in Combination with Other Anti-Tumor Agents
Therapeutic Agents
[0062] This example demonstrates the administration of an anti-IL-6R antibody, alone and in
combination with a VEGF-Trap, an anti-EGFR antibody or an anti-ErbB3 antibody, to tumor
bearing mice. The anti-IL-6R antibody used in this Example, also referred to herein as "anti
IL-6R mAb1," is an antibody comprising heavy chain CDRs (HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3)
having the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 4, 5, and 6, respectively; and light chain
CDRs (LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3) having the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 7, 8,
and 9, respectively (i.e., the anti-IL-6R antibody designated VQ8F1 1-21 in US Patent No.
7,582,298). The VEGF-Trap used in this Example is a dimer of two fusion polypeptides, each
comprising: (1) a VEGFR1 component comprising amino acids 27 to 129 of SEQ ID NO:11;
(2) a VEGFR2 component comprising amino acids 130 to 231 of SEQ ID NO: 11; and (3) a
multimerization component ("FcAC1 (a)") comprising amino acids 232 to 457 of SEQ ID NO: 11
(i.e., the VEGF-Trap designated VEGFR1R2-FcAC1(a) in US Patent No. 7,396,664.) The
anti-EGFR antibody used in this Example, also referred to herein as "anti-EGFR mAb2," is a
fully human antibody generated against the extracellular domain of human
EGFR/ErbB1/HER1. The anti-ErbB3 antibody used in this Example, also referred to herein as
"anti-ErbB3 mAb3," is a fully human antibody generated against ErbB3 (i.e., the antibody
designated H4H1821N in US Patent Appl. No. 13/623,885, filed on September 21, 2012).
Experimental Procedures and Results
[0063] As an initial experiment, cultured A549, Calu3 and Du145 cells were treated with: (i)
10 pg/ml human Fc control protein ("hFc"), (ii) 10 pg/ml of anti-IL-6R mAb1, (iii) 10 ng/ml IL-6
plus 10 pg/ml hFc, or(iv) 10 ng/ml of IL-6 plus 10 pg/ml anti-IL-6R mAb1. Human Fc or anti
                                                 16

IL-6R mAb1 was added into cultured cells for 16 hours, and IL-6 was added into hFc or anti
IL-6R mAb1 pre-treated cells for 30 minutes. Cells were then lysed and Western blots were
performed to assess the levels of phospho-STAT3 and total STAT3. As shown in Figure 1, all
three tumor cell lines exhibited both constitutive and IL-6-inducible phospho-STAT3, which
was inhibited by anti-IL-6R mAb1.
[0064] Next, the effect of anti-IL-6R mAb1, VEGF-Trap, or a combination of anti-IL-6R mAb1
plus VEGF-Trap on the growth of Du145 human prostate carcinoma cells was tested. Briefly,
5 x 106 Du145 cells (ATCC) were implanted subcutaneously into the flank of 6-8 week old
SCID mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY). After tumors reached an average volume of -200 mm3 ,
mice were randomized into groups for treatment (n = 5 mice per group). Mice were
administered human Fc control protein (25 mg/kg), anti-IL-6R mAb1 (25 mg/kg), VEGF-Trap
(25 mg/kg) or the combination of anti-IL-6R mAb1 plus VEGF-Trap (25 + 25 mg/kg). All
proteins were administered via subcutaneous injection twice per week. Tumor volumes were
measured twice per week over the course of the experiment (on days 35, 39, 42, 46, 49, 53,
56, 60, 63 and 67 after implantation). The average tumor growth from the start of treatment
was calculated for each group. The percent decrease of tumor growth was calculated from
comparison to the Fc control group. The results are summarized in Table 1.

that the tumor growth reduction observed in mice treated with the combination of anti-IL-6R
mAb1 + VEGF-trap was statistically significant in comparison to the reduction observed in
mice treated with anti-IL-6R mAb1 alone (p=0.0004).
[0066] Du145 tumors from mice treated with hFc (25 mg/kg) or anti-IL-6R mAb1 (25 mg/kg)
were excised and sectioned. Immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies specific to
phospho-STAT3 or cleaved caspase 3 as a marker of apoptosis. Tumors treated with anti-IL
6R mAb1 exhibited less staining for phospho-STAT3 and increased staining for cleaved
caspase 3, indicating that Du145 tumors have active IL-6/STAT3 signaling that contributes to
tumor cell survival. This suggests that IL-6 provides a survival signal to tumor cells.

[0067] In a next experiment, the effect of anti-IL-6R mAb1, an inhibitory anti-EGFR antibody
("anti-EGFR mAb2"), or a combination of anti-IL-6R mAb1 plus anti-EGFR mAb2 on the
growth of Calu3 human lung adenocarcinoma xenografts was tested. Briefly, 5 x 106 Calu3
cells (ATCC) were implanted subcutaneously into the flank of 6-8 week old SCID mice
(Taconic, Hudson, NY). After tumors reached an average volume of 150-200 mm3 , mice were
randomized into groups for treatment (n = 5 mice per group). Mice were administered human
Fc control protein (25 mg/kg), anti-IL-6R mAb1 (12.5 mg/kg), anti-EGFR mAb2 (12.5 mg/kg) or
the combination of anti-IL-6R mAb1 plus anti-EGFR mAb2 (12.5 + 12.5 mg/kg). All proteins
were administered via subcutaneous injection twice per week. Tumor volumes were
measured twice per week over the course of the experiment (on days 34, 37, 41, 44, 48, 51,
54 and 57 after implantation) and tumor weights were determined upon excision of tumors at
the conclusion of the experiment. Averages of the tumor growth from the start of treatment
and the tumor weights were calculated for each group. The percent decreases of tumor
growth and tumor weight were calculated from comparison to the Fc control group. The
results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

Conclusion
[0071] This Example illustrates that anti-IL-6R mAb1 inhibited the growth of Du145, Calu3
and A549 tumor xenografts as a single agent. Furthermore, combination treatment with anti
IL-6R mAb1 plus VEGF-Trap inhibited the growth of Du145 tumor xenografts more potently
than either single agent. Also, combination treatment with anti-IL-6R mAb1 plus an inhibitory
anti-EGFR antibody (anti-EGFR mAb2) inhibited the growth of Calu3 tumor xenografts more
potently than either single agent.
[0072] These results show that anti-IL-6R mAb1 preferentially inhibited the growth of tumors
that exhibit autocrine IL-6/STAT3 signaling, suggesting the possibility that
immunohistochemical analysis of tumor biopsies for IL-6 and/or phospho-STAT3 levels might
be useful in identifying patients that are most likely to benefit from anti-IL-6R treatment.
Moreover, anti-IL-6R mAb1 decreased phospho-STAT3 and increased cleaved caspase-3
levels in tumor xenografts, suggesting that IL-6/STAT3 signaling contributes to tumor cell
survival.

Example 2. An Anti-IL-6R Monoclonal Antibody in Combination with a VEGF
Antagonist Inhibits the Growth of Anti-VEGF-Resistant Tumors
Introduction
[0073] A variant of the A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cell line that is resistant to the
effects of VEGF Trap was isolated by serial passage in the presence of VEGF-Trap in vivo.
The variant cell line is referred to herein as "A431-V2," and the parental A431 cell line is
referred to herein as "A431-P".
[0074] Experiments were first conducted to assess the relative levels of IL-6 expressed from
the A431-V2 cell line as compared to the A431-P cell line. For this purpose, conditioned
medium was collected from cultured A431 -P or A431 -V2 cells and ELISA was performed to
measure the concentration of human IL-6. As shown in Figure 2(a), A431-V2, expresses
much higher levels of IL-6 than does the parental A431 cell line (178 pg/ml vs 29 pg/ml).
[0075] Next, the levels of phospho-STAT3 were measured in the variant and parental A431
cells. Specifically, cultured A431-P and A431-V2 cells were treated with human Fc (10 pg/ml)
or anti-IL-6R mAb1 (10 pg/ml). Cell lysates were prepared and a Western blot was performed
to assess the levels of phospho-STAT3. As shown in Figure 2(b), the basal level of phospho
STAT3 was increased in A431-V2 cells as compared to A431-P cells, and was significantly
reduced by anti-IL-6R mAb1 treatment.
[0076] In view of the foregoing experimental observations, the effect of a combination
treatment comprising a fully human anti-IL-6R antibody plus VEGF-Trap on the growth of
A431-V2 tumor xenografts was next tested in this Example.
Experimental Procedures and Results
[0077] Briefly, 1 x 106 A431 -V2 cells were implanted subcutaneously into the flank of 6-8
week old SCID mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY). After tumors reached an average volume of
-200 mm3 , mice were randomized into groups for treatment (n = 5 mice per group). Mice
were administered human Fc control protein (25 mg/kg), anti-IL-6R mAb1 (25 mg/kg), VEGF
Trap (25 mg/kg) or the combination of anti-IL-6R mAb1 plus VEGF-Trap (25 + 25 mg/kg). All
proteins were administered via subcutaneous injection twice per week. Tumor volumes were
measured twice per week over the course of the experiment (on days 15, 18, 22, 25 and 28
after implantation). The average tumor growth from the start of treatment was calculated for
each group. The percent decrease of tumor growth was calculated from comparison to the Fc
control group. The results are summarized in Table 7.

                 (25 + 25)
[0078] An analysis of the raw data underlying the results summarized in Table 7 confirmed
that the tumor growth reduction observed in mice treated with the combination of anti-IL-6R
mAb1 + VEGF-trap was statistically significant in comparison to the change in tumor growth
observed in mice treated with either anti-IL-6R mAb1 alone (p=0.0001) or VEGF-trap alone
(p=0.0041).
Conclusion
[0079] As shown in this Example, A431-V2 tumors are resistant to VEGF-Trap single agent
treatment, producing only a 36% decrease in tumor growth relative to control-treated subjects.
These tumors, however, were responsive to anti-IL-6R mAb1 plus VEGF-Trap combination
treatment, suggesting that IL-6 contributes to the VEGF-Trap-resistant phenotype of A431-V2
tumors.    Preliminary data indicate that the increased IL-6 signaling in the A431-V2 tumors
does not prevent the ability of VEGF-Trap to decrease tumor vascularity, suggesting that IL-6
signaling enhances the ability of tumor cells to proliferate and/or survive when the function of
the tumor vasculature is impaired. This observation is consistent with the ability of anti-IL-6R
mAb1 to potentiate the effect of VEGF-Trap in Du145 tumors as well (see Example 1).
[0080] In summary, the data presented herein above indicate that levels of IL-6/STAT3
signaling can be used to identify anti-VEGF-resistant tumors, and that IL-6 antagonism (e.g.,
treatment with anti-IL-6R mAb1) is a useful therapeutic strategy for treating multiple types of
cancer, either as a single agent or in combination with VEGF antagonists, especially in the
context of anti-VEGF-resistant tumors.
