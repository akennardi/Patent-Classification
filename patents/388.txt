              CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS
 [0001] The entire content of the complete specification of Australian Patent Application
No. 2013249650 as originally filed is incorporated herein by reference.
 [0001A] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 13/692,739,
filed December 3, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and claims
the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 61/625,437, filed April 17, 2012, which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
                                        BACKGROUND
 [0002]    The present invention generally relates to internal combustion engines and outdoor
power equipment powered by such engines, such as lawn mowers, snow throwers, portable
generators, etc. More specifically, the present invention relates to a starter system and
energy storage system for an engine.
 [00031    Outdoor power equipment may use an internal combustion engine to drive a tool of
the equipment, such as a rotary blade of a lawn mower or an axial cam pump of a pressure
washer. Typically the outdoor power equipment includes a brake mechanism that
 selectively prevents or stops rotation of the tool. The brake may stop a flywheel of the
 engine, correspondingly stopping the crankshaft and rotating tool coupled to the power
 takeoff of the crankshaft.
 [0004]    Starting the braked outdoor power equipment may be cumbersome, requiring
 release of the brake followed by activation of the engine. For lawn mowers and other types
 of outdoor power equipment, release of the brake may include rotating a bail to draw an
 inner-wire of a Bowden cable that lifts the brake mechanism. Then, activation of the engine
 typically further includes manually pulling a recoil starter rope or activating an electric
 starter for the engine. A need exists for a less-cumbersome and faster process to start the
 outdoor power equipment.
 [00051     Furthermore, the outdoor power equipment may include the engine mounted to a
 frame or a base plate, If an electric starter is included, the starter motor is typically
 connected to an interface on the handle of the outdoor power equipment so that the operator
 may activate the starter motor while standing in an operational position, such as behind the
 handle. During assembly of the outdoor power, a power source, control circuitry, and
                                                  -I-

wiring associated with the starter motor are coupled to the handle, the frame, and the
engine, the attachment of which may be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. A
need exists for an engine having a starter motor that facilitates efficient assembly of the
outdoor power equipment.
                                          SUMMARY
[0006]     One embodiment of the invention relates to a lawn mower including an internal
combustion engine, an electric motor configured to start the internal combustion engine, a
blade driven by the internal combustion engine, and an assembly for stopping at least one of
the blade and the internal combustion engine. The assembly includes a brake mechanism, a
release mechanism movable to an engaged position to release the brake mechanism, an
interlock configured to selectively prevent the release mechanism from moving to the
engaged position, and an interface allowing an operator to release the interlock to allow the
release mechanism to move to the engaged position. The lawn mower further includes a
switch actuated by the release mechanism and a control module coupled to the switch so
that the switch provides a signal to the control module when the release mechanism is in the
engaged position and the control module turns on the electric motor in response to the signal
to start the internal combustion engine.
[0007]     Another embodiment of the invention relates to outdoor power equipment
including an internal combustion engine, an electric motor configured to start the internal
combustion engine, an implement driven by the internal combustion engine, a release
mechanism movable to an engaged position to put the implement in a ready-to-run
condition in which the implement is ready to be driven by the internal combustion engine, a
run sensor configured to detect the ready-to-run condition, a switch actuated by the release
mechanism, and a control module coupled to the switch so that the switch provides a signal
to the control module when the release mechanism is in the engaged position and the control
module turns on the electric motor to start the internal combustion engine in response to the
signal from the switch and the run sensor detecting the ready-to-run condition.
 [00081    Another embodiment of the invention relates to an electric start control module for
outdoor power equipment including an internal combustion engine, an electric motor
configured to start the internal combustion engine, an implement driven by the internal
combustion engine, a release mechanism movable to an engaged position to put the
                                               -2-

implement in a ready-to-run condition in which the rotary tool is ready to be driven by the
internal combustion engine, and a run sensor configured to detect the ready-to-run
condition. The electric start control module includes a switch actuated by the release
mechanism to provide a signal when the release mechanism is in the engaged position, and
a controller coupled to the switch to receive the signal. The controller is configured to turn
on the electric motor to start the internal combustion engine upon receipt of the signal and
the run sensor detecting the ready-to-run condition.
 [00091    Alternative exemplary embodiments relate to other features and combinations of
 features as may be generally recited in the claims.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 [0025]    Before turning to the figures, which illustrate the exemplary embodiments in
detail, it should be understood that the present application is not limited to the details or
methodology set forth in the description or illustrated in the figures. It should also be
understood that the terminology is for the purpose of description only and should not be
regarded as limiting.
 [0026]    Referring to FIG. 1, outdoor power equipment, in the form of a lawn mower 110,
 includes an internal combustion engine 112 coupled to a rotary tool, such as the blade in a
 deck 114 of the lawn mower 110, an auger, a saw, tines, a drill, a pump, or other rotary
tools. In some embodiments, the lawn mower 110 further includes wheels 116 and a
rearward extending handle 118 designed to be pushed by an operator walking behind the
 lawn mower 110. In other contemplated embodiments, the outdoor power equipment may
be in the form of a rotary tiller, a pressure washer, a snow thrower, a lawn tractor or riding
 mower, an edger, a portable generator, or other equipment, with a corresponding powered
 tool, such as tines, a pump, an auger and impeller, an alternator, a drive train, or other tools.
 [0027]    Still referring to FIG. 1, the lawn mower I10 includes a starter system. According
 to an exemplary embodiment, the starter system includes an electric motor 120 that is
 selectively coupled to the engine 112 such that the electric motor 120 is configured to rotate
                                                 -4-

the crankshaft of the engine 112 to start the engine 112, and is then configured to disengage
once the engine 112 is running. In some embodiments, the motor 120 is fastened to the
engine 112, such as being mounted on top of or to a side of the engine 112. Gearing (e.g.,
gear reduction, transmission) may extend between the motor 120 and the crankshaft of the
 engine 112, or the motor 120 may be connected directly to the crankshaft of the engine 112.
 [0028]     According to an exemplary embodiment, an operator may engage the starter
 system via the handle 118 of the lawn mower 110. In some embodiments, the handle 118
 includes a lever 122, button, toggle, or other interface that the operator may use to
 command the starter system to start the engine 112. In some embodiments, the command is
 relayed from the handle 118 via a linkage 124, such as an electric wire transmitting an
 electrical signal, a Bowden cable communicating a mechanical signal, or another type of
 linkage. In contemplated embodiments, a transmitter and start button are coupled to the
 handle (e.g., clipped on, integrally mounted with), and the starter system includes an
 integrated receiver configured to receive commands wirelessly provided by the transmitter
 to start the engine. According to an exemplary embodiment, the command from the
 operator is received directly or indirectly by the motor 120, and the motor 120 rotates the
 crankshaft to start the engine 112.
 [0029]     In some embodiments, the starter system is integrated with a bail 126 of the lawn
 mower 110. A brake mechanism (e.g., friction brake, ignition interrupt switch or circuit,
 etc.) may be holding the blade or other tool, locking the crankshaft of the engine 112, or
 otherwise preventing operation of the power equipment. When the operator actuates the
 bail 126 to release the brake mechanism from rotating members (e.g., blade, crankshaft,
 power takeoff, flywheel) of the lawn mower 110, the action simultaneously actuates the
 motor 120 to start the engine 112. As such, releasing of the brake mechanism
 synergistically also starts the engine 112, easing operation of the lawn mower 110 or other
 outdoor power equipment by reducing the steps necessary for activation.
 10030]     In some embodiments, the lawn mower 110 includes an interlock 128 (e.g., lock
 out device, signal interrupt) to prevent release of the brake and engagement of the motor
  120. According to an exemplary embodiment, the operator must release the interlock 128
 before the bail 126 can be operated to engage the motor 120 to start the engine 112.
 Different types of mechanical and electrical interlocks may be used in varying contemplated
 embodiments to prevent inadvertent release of the brake and starting of the engine, such as
                                                 -5-

when a user moves the power equipment into or out of a garage or storage shed by grabbing
the handle, or if the bail is unintentionally bumped. Furthermore, engagement of the
interlock 128, in some embodiments, is also configured to prevent inadvertent release of the
brake when the handle 118 is being folded over the deck 114 to put the lawn mower 110 in
a storage configuration.
 10031]     In some embodiments, the interlock 128 may prevent a signal from being sent via
the linkage 124 to engage the motor 120 and release the brake. The interlock 128 may
physically disconnect the linkage 124 from the bail 126, such as by removing a linking pin
 that joins the bail 126 to the linkage 124, removing a clamp that holds the linkage 124 to the
 bail 126, or otherwise physically separating the bail 126 and linkage 124. Release of the
 interlock 128 then physically or electrically connects the bail 126 (or other brake release) to
 the controller 132 (e.g., control system, control circuit, computerized controller) such that
 operation of the bail 126 is communicated to the controller 132 to simultaneously start the
 engine 112.
 [0032]     In other embodiments, the interlock 128 physically prevents (e.g., blocks, holds,
jams) rotation of the bail 126 when the interlock 128 is engaged. In some such
 embodiments, a cam may be rotated into or out of the path of the bail 126, optionally
 preventing rotation of the bail 126. In other such embodiments, a clamp of the interlock
  128 may bind the bail 126 to the handle 118, preventing rotation of the bail 126 until
 released. In still other such embodiments, a sleeve or latch may slide over the bail 126,
 holding the bail at a fixed angle until released. The mechanical interlock described in this
 paragraph may be used in an embodiment where no electrical wiring harness on the handle
  118 is required to support the starting of the electric motor 120 and engine 112.
 [0033]     In contemplated embodiments, an electrical signal may indicate to the controller
  132 that the interlock 128 has been released, such as a signal communicated via the linkage
  124, via radio frequency communication, hardwired, or otherwise. The signal is provided in
 addition to a separate signal associated with movement of the bail 126. Without the signal
 indicating release of the interlock, the signal associated with movement of the bail will not
 be sufficient to instruct the controller to start the engine. The electrical signal may be
 associated with a pass code, a key, a scanned finger print, or other access-limiting device.
  [00341    According to an exemplary embodiment, the lever 122 (e.g., interface, release
 mechanism, trigger) may serve to release the interlock 128, allowing operation of the bail
                                                   -6-

126 to release the brake and to start the motor 120. In some embodiments, pulling of the
lever 122 may move a physical obstacle out of the rotational path of the bait 126. In other
embodiments, pulling of the lever 122 may mechanically or electrically connect the bail 126
and the linkage 126. Other mechanisms, such as buttons, switches, toggles, dials, etc., may
serve as release mechanisms to release the interlock 128. In some embodiments,
conventional mechanical rotational interlocks or electrical switches (e.g., signal
disconnects) are used as the interlock.
 [00351   In general, integration of the starter system with a handle of outdoor power
equipment allows the operator to start the engine from the rear of the outdoor power
equipment, such as several feet from the powered tool of the outdoor power equipment
(e.g., snow thrower auger, lawn mower blades). Further, the integration supports an electric
starting system for a walk behind mower that can be engaged by a user without actuation of
a key or push-button. In other embodiments, the starter system may include a start button or
other interface to engage the starter system that is located on the engine or elsewhere. For
example, in contemplated embodiments, such an interface may include a smart phone
application or remote control that wirelessly provides a start command or authorization code
to a receiver coupled to the outdoor power equipment.
 [0036]   According to an exemplary embodiment, the starter system further includes an
energy storage device 130 (e.g., electrical storage device) and a controller 132. The energy
storage device 130 may include one or more batteries, capacitors, or other devices. When
the operator engages the starter system, the linkage 124 communicates the command to start
the engine directly or indirectly to the controller 132, which electrically connects the energy
storage device 130 to power the motor 120. In some embodiments, the controller 132 is
coupled to a governor of the engine 112 (see, e.g., speed sensor 420 as shown in FIG. 4),
and disengages the motor 120 (e.g., cuts power to the motor 120, high-side switching of the
battery power source, low-side switching of the ground side of the circuit) when the engine
 112 is running at a sufficient speed.
 [00371    In some embodiments, the motor 120, the energy storage device 130, and the
controller 132 are fastened directly to the engine 112, which may be configured for efficient
assembly of outdoor power equipment using the engine 112. As such, the starter system in
some embodiments may come fully assembled with the engine 112 and ready for
connection to a linkage configured to provide a signal from the handle (e.g., linkage 124).
                                                 -7-

In some embodiments, an interface (e.g., start button, toggle, switch) for starting the engine
is positioned on the engine itself, and no additional connections are necessary-the
manufacturer need only attach the engine to the deck or corresponding feature and attach
the tool to the power takeoff of the engine. In any such case, considerable time and effort
may be saved during the manufacturing process and a potential source of manufacturing
 difficulty may be removed (i.e., that associated with the fastening and electrical connection
 of the components of the starter system during assembly of the outdoor power equipment).
 In still other embodiments, some or all of the starter assembly may be fastened to the deck
 of a lawn mower or corresponding feature of other power equipment.
 [0038]     Referring to FIGS. 2-3, handles 210, 310 for outdoor power equipment, such as a
 lawn mower, rotary tiller, snow thrower, etc., each include a bail 212, 312 and an interlock
 214, 314 with a release button 216, 316. In contemplate embodiments, the release button
 216, 316 may release the bail 212, 312 from being interlocked by allowing the bail 212, 312
 to move, or by coupling the bail 212, 312 and linkage 124. In FIG. 2, the release button 216
 is to the side of the bail 212, while in FIG. 3, the release button 316 for the interlock 314 is
 on top of the bail 312. The release button 216 of FIG. 2 may disengage a member from
 blocking movement of the bail, while the release button 316 may connect the bail 312 and
 linkage 124. In other contemplated embodiments, release buttons or other release
 mechanisms may be positioned elsewhere on the handle, the engine, or on another
 component of the outdoor power equipment.
 [00391     Still referring to FIGS. 2-3, in other contemplated embodiments, the buttons 216,
 316 may be used to provide a signal directly or indirectly to a motor to start an engine,
 without regard to the bail 212, 312. However, integrating the buttons 216, 316 with the bail
 212, 312 allows for a two-step process to start the engine (i.e., release interlock and operate
 bail), while synergistically using the operation of the bail 212, 312 to both release the brake
 as well as to engage the starter. In still other embodiments, other forms of interlocks and
 release mechanisms for the interlocks may be used, such as a biased lever (see lever 122 of
 interlock 128 as shown in FIG. 1), latch, thumb-print reader, etc.
  [0040]    In some embodiments, a three-step process is used to engage the power equipment,
 such as first disabling or releasing an interlock; second presenting a key, a code, or other
 device to release an access-control mechanism (e.g., lock out, lock); and third pulling the
                                                  -8-

bail. In alternate embodiments, the key hole or interface for the access-control mechanism
may be positioned on the handle or on the engine.
[0041]    Referring to FIG. 4, outdoor power equipment 410 (shown schematically) includes
an engine 412 and a powered tool 414 (e.g., rotary blade) driven by the engine 412. In
some embodiments, a motor 416 is coupled to the engine 412, and the powered tool 414 is
coupled to a power takeoff 418 of the engine 412. A speed sensor 420 (e.g., governor) may
be coupled to the engine 412 to regulate the speed of the engine 41.2. Also, a brake 422 may
be coupled to a rotary member of the outdoor power equipment 410, such as the flywheel of
the engine, the power takeoff 418 of the engine, etc., to stop the engine as well as the
associated powered tool.
 [0042]   In some embodiments, the outdoor power equipment 410 includes a handle 424
having a release mechanism 426, where the release mechanism 426 is configured to allow a
user to release the brake 422 from the handle 424. The release mechanism 426 may allow a
user to release the brake 422 by engaging the bail (or other element) with a linkage
connected to the brake 422, or by disengaging an element blocking movement of the bail.
The handle 424 may be coupled to the engine 412 and tool 414 directly, or via an
intermediary member (e.g., deck 114 as shown in FIG. 1). The engine 412 may further
include a battery 428 for powering the motor 416 and a control system 430 for operating the
motor 416.
 [0043]   According to an exemplary embodiment, the control system 430 is configured to
receive inputs associated with the release mechanism 426. In some embodiments, when the
release mechanism 426 is actuated to release the brake 422, the release mechanism 426
triggers a switch 432, which provides to the control system 430 a signal that is indicative of
the release of the brake 422. The signal may be provided via a mechanical linkage,
wirelessly, a hardwired electrical connection, or otherwise. In some embodiments, the
control system 430 then actuates the motor 416 to start the engine 412 or uses the
 information in control logic configured to start the engine as a function of the status of the
brake and other factors. As such, operation of the release mechanism 426 may
simultaneously provide a start signal to the control system 430 as well as release the brake
422. No additional operations to start the engine 412 may be required.
 [0044]   According to an exemplary embodiment, the control system 430 is configured to
receive additional inputs from the speed sensor 420 or another component of the engine 412
                                               -9-

(e.g., ignition circuit). The speed sensor 420 or other component provides the control
system 430 with information associated with the speed of the engine 412. When the engine
412 is running at a sufficient speed, the control system 430 then disengages the motor 416
(e.g., turns off, disconnects, cuts power to, etc.).
[00451     In contemplated embodiments, the control system 430 associated with the start
system may receive additional or different inputs used to control starting of the engine, such
input from a sensor configured to indicate whether the outdoor power equipment has moved
recently. Movement of an axle or wheels of such outdoor power equipment may trigger a
sensor that provides a signal to the control system. The signal, in combination with an
electric timer providing time-related context for the movement, may serve as an additional
indicator that the operator intends to activate the engine. In contemplated embodiments, the
control system 430 includes a timer and is configured to deactivate the motor if the engine
has not started within a predetermined amount of time. In some contemplated
embodiments, the control system 430 includes a temperature sensor and is configured to
prime the engine with an automated primer pump or adjust the choke or throttle plate if
ambient temperature is above or below a predetermined temperature, if a portion of the
engine is above or below a predetermined temperature, or if the difference between ambient
 and engine temperature is above or below a predetermined amount. In contemplated
embodiments, the control system 430 may also provide a signal output to the operator, such
as a visible indicator on a display coupled to the handle or engine, or an audible alert. In
some such embodiments, the signal output may include as an error message, a low-fuel
message, a replace-oil message, or another such message.
 [0046]    Referring to FIG. 5, components of a system 510 include a brake cable 512 (e.g.,
Bowden cable) and a brake pad 514 for an associated engine of outdoor power equipment.
According to an exemplary embodiment, the brake cable 512 is configured to be coupled to
the bail of a handle of outdoor power equipment (see, e.g., bails 126, 212, and 312 as shown
 in FIGS. 1-3). When an operator activates the bail, the brake cable 512 moves a pivot 516
 coupled to the brake pad 514. The brake pad 514 then releases, allowing the engine
 associated with the system 510 to drive a powered tool of the outdoor power equipment.
 [00471    According to an exemplary embodiment, the engine associated with the system
 510 further includes a starter system including a switch 518, an electronic control 520, a
battery 522, and an electric starter motor 524. When the operator activates the bail to lift
                                               -10-

the brake pad 514, the pivot 516 simultaneously activates the switch 518. The switch 518
then provides a signal to the electronic control 520 that the brake pad 514 has been lifted
and that the electronic control 520 may start the engine associated with the system 510 with
the electric starter 524. The electronic control 520 then connects the electric starter 524 to
the battery 522. The switch 518 may be a switch already associated with the brake, but used
to provide signals to both an actuator of the brake and the starter system (e.g., ignition
 ground), or the switch 518 may be an additional switch solely used for the starter system.
 [00481     Still referring to FIG. 5, the electronic control 520 includes hard-wired circuitry
 and is configured to receive additional inputs from the engine associated with the system
 510. In some embodiments, the additional inputs include an indication of the speed of the
 engine associated with the system 510 from a governor or other component of the engine
 (e.g., electrical pulses from the ignition system). The additional inputs may include a
 current state of the engine associated with the system 510, such as whether the engine
 associated with the system 510 is running, etc. The starter system is also coupled to a
 ground 526.
 [0049]     Referring to FIGS. 6-9, an engine 610 includes an exhaust 612, a fuel tank 614, an
 engine cover 616, an air intake 618 for combustion processes, an air intake 620 for cooling
 the engine, and a starter system having an energy storage device, such as a battery 622, a
 capacitor, multiple batteries or capacitors, or another energy storage device. Applicants
 note that the engine 610 of FIGS. 6-9 mirrors the engine 112 of FIG. 1, and both are single
 cylinder, four-stroke cycle, vertically-shafted, small engines. Other engine types and
 designs may be used, such as engines that are horizontally-shafted, two- or more cylindered,
 diesel powered, cold-weather structured, etc.
 [0050]     Although shown as proximate to the fuel tank 614 and exhaust 612 in FIGS. 6 and
 8-9, the energy storage device may be positioned elsewhere on the exterior and/or in an
 internal port of the engine 610. In some embodiments, where the energy storage device is
 sensitive to high temperature, it may be preferred to position the energy storage device away
 from the exhaust 612, which may become hot during operation of the engine 610.
  [0051]    According to an exemplary embodiment, the energy storage device is configured
 to power a starter motor (see, e.g., motor 120 as shown in FIG. 1) integrated with the engine
 610. In some embodiments, the energy storage device may be further configured to power
 other systems of the engine 610, such as an engine control unit (ECU) having control
                                                   -11-

circuitry coupled to sensors or detectors integrated with the engine (e.g., brake release, fuel
level detector, ignition-fouling detector, governor, etc.).
[0052]     According to an exemplary embodiment, the energy storage device is the battery
622, which is rechargeable. As shown in FIG. 7, the battery 622 may be charged at a
charging station 624 or may include a charging port integrated with the battery (e.g., battery
pack with charging port to receive a connection from a wire coupled to an outlet or the
charging station). The battery 622, in other embodiments, may alternatively plug directly
into a wall outlet, or the charging station may be wall mounted or plug directly into a wall
outlet.
 [00531    In some embodiments, the energy storage device is or includes a bank of
capacitors, where the capacitors are configured to charge and release electrical energy in a
relatively short (e.g., less than 10 seconds), high-powered output. In some such
embodiments, some of the capacitors of the bank are coupled with one another in groups
(e.g., series or parallel), and the groups are configured to output sequentially in time with
respect to one another. Accordingly, the capacitors are specifically configured to be able to
power the motor to start the engine 610 without much additional energy storage capacity so
 as to be relatively compact in size and inexpensive. Use of capacitors may also allow for
 faster charging when compared to batteries, such as faster charging on the charging station
 624 (FIG. 7).
 [0054]    In contemplated embodiments, the starter motor is configured to draw power from
the engine 610, such as during periods of lesser loads on the engine. The starter motor is
then driven by the engine 610 to provide an electric output. The electric output may then be
routed by the ECU or otherwise to the charge the energy storage device. Such a system
may be particularly useful for an engine driving an alternator of a portable generator, where
the alternator may temporarily be powered by the energy storage device to start the engine
 and then, once the engine has started, the alternator may be used to recharge the energy
 storage device.
 [0055]    Referring to FIG. 8, the battery is configured to be inserted (e.g., dropped,
 lowered, placed) into a receiving port 626 integrated with the engine. Integrating the
 receiving port with the engine reduces the assembly burdens for manufacturing outdoor
power equipment, as disclosed above. However in contemplated embodiments, the
                                                -12-

receiving port may not be integrated with the engine. For example, FIG. 7 shows a charging
station 624 or charging port, which may be similar to such a port on a deck of the engine.
 [0056]    In some embodiments, the battery 622 has a cross section forming an isosceles
trapezoid, triangle, diamond, or other wedge shape, or shape having a narrower lower
portion 628 relative to an upper portion 630 in contact with the receiving port 626. The
receiving port 626 is contoured (e.g., V-shaped, U-shaped, etc.) to receive the battery 622,
 which may be guided into position by interfacing with the contours of the receiving port 626
 and gravity.
 [0057]     In some embodiments, the battery 622 includes slots or grips 632 for lifting and
 holding the battery 622. A locking mechanism, such as a hook or latch may snap into place
 when the battery 622 is inserted into the receiving port 626 and hold the battery 622 in the
 receiving port 626. Pinching the grips 632 together may release the locking mechanism to
 allow removal of the battery 622 from the receiving port 626.
  [0058]    According to an exemplary embodiment, the starter system further includes a
 switch 636 (e.g., toggle, lever, key) that is integrated with the battery 622, the receiving port
 626, or elsewhere on the engine 610. As shown in FIGS. 8-9, the switch 636 may rotate
 from an off position (FIG. 8), where the battery 622 is not electrically connected to
 components of the engine 610 (e.g., starter motor, ECU), to an on position (FIG. 9), where
 the battery 622 is electrically connected to the components. In other embodiments, rotation
 of the switch 636 also or alternatively engages the locking mechanism to hold the battery
 622 in the receiving port 626. In various contemplated embodiments, the switch 636 may
 be configured to interrupt electrical connectivity of the battery, the control circuit, or both.
  [0059]    According to an exemplary embodiment, the starter system includes an interface,
 such as a button 634 on the receiving port 626. The button 634 faces outward and is
 accessible when the battery 622 is seated in the receiving port 626. In some embodiments,
 the interface allows the operator to start the engine via the starter system. In other
 embodiments, the interface may be used to initiate charging of the battery or another
 function.
  [00601    According to an exemplary embodiment, the electrical control circuits shown in
 FIGS. 10-11 are each configured provide hard-wired logic for a starter system according to
 the disclosure provided herein. In some embodiments, each circuit contains essentially all
  analog parts. In some embodiments, each circuit or another such circuit is configured to
                                                 -13-

detect when the bail closes (or opens) a switch (see, e.g., switch 518 as shown in FIG. 5). In
other embodiments, a circuit is configured to sense when the brake is pulled (see, e.g., brake
pad 514 as shown in FIG. 5), and then to enable ignition of the engine. In other
contemplated embodiments, a circuit may be further configured to sense vibration of the
engine or Venturi vacuum strength in the carburetor, and cut power to the motor when the
associated information indicates that the engine is running.
[00611     According to an exemplary embodiment, the circuits of FIGS. 10-11 are contained
on circuit boards that are integrated with the engine (see, e.g., controller 132 as shown in
FIG. 1), and may be fully powered by the battery or other on-board source. Accordingly,
the circuits may require no electrical interface to components of the lawn mower or other
outdoor power equipment aside from those carried by or integrated with the engine. No
additional wiring or hook ups are required. Accordingly, the assembly process for the
associated outdoor power equipment may be improved, as discussed above.
[0062]     Alternatively, in accordance with another exemplary embodiment, the circuits of
FIGS. 10- 11 may be contained on a circuit board (or circuit boards) within the housing of
the energy storage device (see, e.g., energy storage device 130 as shown in FIG. 1), and
may be fully powered by the energy storage device (e.g., battery or other power source). As
is known, energy storage devices generally have integrated circuitry contained therein that
is configured to monitor operating variables of the energy storage device (current, voltage,
etc.) related to its charge state. Thus, the addition of the circuits of FIGS. 10-11 to the
existing circuit board(s) or on an additional circuit board within the housing of the energy
storage device is possible. In this way, the circuits may require no electrical interface to
components of the lawn mower or other outdoor power equipment, and no additional wiring
or hook ups are necessary. Accordingly, the assembly process for the associated outdoor
power equipment may be simplified and improved. Furthermore, the circuits of FIGS. 10
 11 are only exemplary, and the specifies of the circuitry may be altered to optimize the
integration of their functionality onto the existing circuit board(s) or additional circuit
board(s) within the energy storage device.
 [0063]    Referring now to FIG. 12, a pressure washer system 710 includes the engine 610
of FIG. 6. To start the engine 610, an operator may press the button 634 shown in FIGS. 8
9. In some such embodiments, braking of the system may occur via an ignition interrupt
that prevents sparks from igniting fuel and air in a combustion chamber of the engine 610.
                                               -14-

Resistance provided by the water pump of the pressure washer system 710 then slows (i.e.,
brakes) the engine 610. In other contemplated embodiments, an engine of a portable
generator may use a similar starter system and battery 622, as well as a similar braking
system. Power provided by the generator may be used to charge the battery 622 of the
starter system.
[00641      Referring now to FIG. 13, outdoor power equipment 810 is illustrated
schematically. Outdoor power equipment 810 is similar to outdoor power equipment 410
described above.
 {00651     Outdoor power equipment 810 includes an engine 812 and an implement 814 (e.g.,
mower blade, pump, auger, tiller, alternator, brush, log-splitter, etc.) driven by the engine
 812. In some embodiments, an electric motor 816 (e.g., a starter motor) is coupled to the
engine 812, and the implement 814 is coupled to a power takeoff 818 of the engine 812. A
speed sensor 820 may be coupled to the engine 812 to detect the speed of the engine 812. A
run sensor 822 is configured to detect when the implement 814 is in a ready-to-run
 condition. Depending on the type of outdoor power equipment 810, the run sensor 822 can
take different forms. For example, the run sensor 822 may be a switch configured to detect
the state (e.g., engaged or disengaged) of a brake or clutch (e.g., for a lawn mower), a
 switch configured to detect operator presence in the operating position (e.g., a seat switch
 on a tractor or a hand-actuated switch or bail on a handle), an enable fob or key configured
to allow the engine 812 to start when actuated or present and prevent the engine 812 from
 starting when not actuated or present, a switch configured to sense water or another fluid
 (e.g., a capacitive water detection sensor, a pressure sensor, a flow sensor) to ensure that a
pump has sufficient fluid to operate safely (e.g., for a pressure washer or waste pump).
 [0066]     For example, in a lawn mower including a mower blade as the implement 814, the
 run sensor 822 detects when a brake that selectively prevents the blade from rotating is in a
 released position so that the blade is allowed to rotate. The mower blade is in the ready-to
 run condition when the brake is released. In another example, in a pressure washer
 including a fluid pump as the implement 814, the run sensor 822 detects a threshold fluid
 flow through the fluid pump to a spray gun. The fluid pump is in the ready-to-run condition
 when the threshold fluid flow is detected (e.g., by flow rate, by flow volume, by fluid
 pressure, etc.) that is indicative of sufficient fluid supplied to the fluid pump to allow for
 operation of the fluid pump. In another example of a pressure washer including a fluid
                                                  -15-

pump as the implement 814, the fluid pump is in the ready-to-run condition when the run
sensor 822 detects the presence or actuation of an enable key or fob. In some embodiments,
the outdoor power equipment 810 includes more than one run sensor 822 and all the run
sensors 822 must be satisfied before the implement 814 is considered to be in the ready-to
run condition.
[00671     A release mechanism 826 (e.g., a bail for a lawn mower, a spray gun trigger for a
pressure washer, a start button or switch, etc.) is movable to an engaged position to put the
implement 814 in the ready-to-run condition. In a lawn mower example, the release
mechanism 826 can be a bail connected to a handle 824 and the bail is configured to allow a
user to release the brake by moving the bail to the engaged position. The run sensor 822
detects that the brake is released, thereby putting the mower blade into the ready-to-run
condition. If the bail is not moved to the engaged position (e.g., when the bail is blocked by
 an interlock as described above), the brake is not released and the mower blade will not be
put in the ready-to-run condition.
 [00681    In a pressure washer example, the release mechanism can be the trigger of a spray
 gun fluidly connected to a fluid pump. The trigger is configured to allow fluid to flow
through the spray gun when the trigger is moved to the engaged or open position. The
 trigger in the open position allows a threshold fluid flow through the fluid pump that is
 indicative of the fluid pump in the ready-to-run condition. The run sensor 822 detects the
 threshold fluid flow. If the threshold fluid flow is not established, the fluid pump is not in
 the ready-to-run condition and the ready-to-run condition is not detected by the run sensor
 822. For example, this may happen if the pressure washer is not connected to a fluid supply
 (e.g., a water faucet or outlet), or there is a leak or loose connection between the pressure
 washer and a fluid supply. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the release mechanism 826
 can be a start actuator (e.g., a start push-button or key-switch).
 [0069]    Outdoor power equipment 810 also includes a battery 828 for powering the motor
 816 and other components of the outdoor power equipment 810 and an electric start control
 module 830 for operating the motor 816. As illustrated in FIG. 13, the control module 830
 is spaced apart from (separate from, distinct from) the engine 812. The control module 830
 is configured to receive inputs associated with the release mechanism 826 and the run
 sensor 822. In some embodiments, when the release mechanism 826 is moved to the
 engaged position, the release mechanism 826 actuates a switch 832, which provides a signal
                                                  -16-

to the control module 830. The signal may be provided via a mechanical linkage,
wirelessly, a hardwired electrical connection, or otherwise. The control module 830 checks
the run sensor 822 to determine if the implement 814 is in the ready-to-run condition.
When both the switch 832 and the run sensor 822 provide signals or inputs indicating the
implement 814 is in the ready-to-run condition, the control module 830 then actuates the
motor 816 to start the engine 812. Additional information or control logic may also be
configured to start the engine in combination with the status of the switch 832, the run
sensor 822 and/or other factors. Movement of the release mechanism 826 to the engaged
position can simultaneously provide a start signal to the control module 830 via the switch
 832 as well as put the implement 814 in the ready-to-run condition as detected by the run
sensor 822, such that no additional user operations are required to start the engine 812.
 [00701     According to an exemplary embodiment, the control module 830 is configured to
receive additional inputs from the speed sensor 820. The speed sensor 820 provides the
 control module 830 with information associated with the speed of the engine 820. In some
 embodiments, the speed sensor 820 is configured to detect when the engine 812 is running
 at a threshold speed. When the engine 812 is running at the threshold speed, the control
module 830 then turns off the motor 816 (e.g., disengages, disconnects, cuts power to, etc.).
 In some embodiments, the speed sensor 820 is a component of or otherwise coupled to an
 ignition coil of the engine to detect the engine speed. In other embodiments, the speed
 sensor 820 is a component of or otherwise coupled to a governor to detect the engine speed.
 [00711     In contemplated embodiments, the control module 830 associated with the start
 system may receive additional or different inputs used to control starting of the engine, such
 input from a sensor configured to indicate whether the outdoor power equipment has moved
 recently. Movement of an axle or wheels of such outdoor power equipment may trigger a
 sensor that provides a signal to the control module. The signal, in combination with an
 electric timer providing time-related context for the movement, may serve as an additional
 indicator that the operator intends to activate the engine. In contemplated embodiments, the
 control module 830 includes a timer and is configured to deactivate the motor if the engine
 has not started within a predetermined amount of time. In some contemplated
 embodiments, the control module 830 includes a temperature sensor and is configured to
 prime the engine with an automated primer pump or adjust the choke or throttle plate if
 ambient temperature is above or below a predetermined temperature, if a portion of the
 engine is above or below a predetermined temperature, or if the difference between ambient
                                                -17-

and engine temperature is above or below a predetermined value. In contemplated
embodiments, the control module 830 may also provide a signal output to the operator, such
as a visible indicator on a display coupled to the handle or engine, or an audible alert. In
some such embodiments, the signal output may include as an error message, a low-fuel
message, a replace-oil message, or another such message.
[00721     Referring now to FIG. 14, the control module 830 is illustrated according to an
exemplary embodiment. The control module 830 includes a housing 834, a controller 836
configured to implement control logic for operation of the outdoor power equipment 810, a
connector 838 configured to be electrically coupled to a release assembly wiring harness
840, and a connector 842 configured to be electrically coupled to the electric motor 816.
The connectors 838 and 842 are located on opposite sides of the housing 834 to
accommodate connecting the control module 830 inline with one or more wiring harnesses.
The controller 836 is positioned within the housing 834. In some embodiments, the control
module 830 includes a connector 844 configured to be electrically coupled to the speed
sensor 820. The connector 844 is located on an opposite side of the housing 834 from one
of the connectors 838 and 842. In some embodiments, the switch 832 is a component of the
control module 830 and is positioned within the housing 834.
 [00731    In some embodiments, the control module 830 also includes one or more
connectors 846 and 848 configured to be electrically coupled to a run sensor 822 to provide
inputs from the run sensor 822 to the controller 836. The run sensors 822 are considered to
be connected in parallel to the control module 830. Alternatively, more than one run sensor
822 can be connected to a single connector 846 so that the controller 836 receives a single
run sensor input, but only when all of the run sensors 822 are satisfied that the implement
 814 is in the ready-to-run condition. In such an embodiment, the run sensors 822 are
considered to be connected in series to the control module 830. In some embodiments, the
input from the run sensor is provided via a wiring harness (e.g., the release assembly wiring
harness 840), electrically coupled to connectors 838 or 842, so no separate connector for a
run sensor is required to provide a run sensor input to the controller 836. Each connector
 846 and 848 is located on an opposite side of the housing 834 from one of the connectors
 838 and 842.
 [00741    The controller 836 may include components configured to implement hard wired
 control logic or a processing circuit. The processing circuit can include a processor and
                                               -18-

memory device. The processor can be implemented as a general purpose processor, an
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), one or more field programmable gate arrays
(FPGAs), a group of processing components, or other suitable electronic processing
components. The memory device (e.g., memory, memory unit, storage device, etc.) is one
or more devices (e.g., RAM, ROM, Flash memory, hard disk storage, etc.) for storing data
and/or computer code for completing or facilitating the various processes, layers and
modules described in the present application. The memory device may be or include
volatile memory or non-volatile memory. The memory device may include database
components, object code components, script components, or any other type of information
structure for supporting the various activities and information structures described in the
present application. According to an exemplary embodiment, the memory device is
communicably connected to the processor via the processing circuit and includes computer
code for executing (e.g., by processing circuit and/or processor) one or more processes
described herein.
 [00751    The release assembly wiring harness 840 electrically couples the electric motor
 816, the run sensor 822, and the battery 828 together. For example, in the lawn mower
example, the release assembly wiring harness is the bail wiring harness electrically
connecting the release assembly including the release mechanism or bail 826 to the electric
motor 816 and the motor 816. By connecting the connector 838 to the release assembly
wiring harness 840 (e.g., the bail wiring harness of a lawn mower) and connecting the
 connector 842 to the electric motor 816, the control module 830 is electrically coupled to
the release assembly wiring harness 840.
 [0076]    By connecting the control module 830 to exiting wiring, outdoor power equipment
 configured to be pull started (e.g., by a recoil starter) is converted to electric start. The
 control module 830 is easily connected inline with existing wiring, thereby eliminating the
need for adding additional wiring or significantly rerouting wiring for an electric start
outdoor power equipment model as compared to a pull start outdoor power equipment
model The control module 830 is relatively small in size and light weight. This allows the
 control module 830 to be connected to existing wiring and not physically mounted to any
 other component of the outdoor power equipment. That is, once connected to the existing
wiring, the control module 830 is free to remain otherwise unsupported (e.g. dangle with the
 existing wiring harnesses) by a mount, bracket, or other physical support structure on the
 outdoor power equipment. The control module 830 allows a manufacturer to provide an
                                                -19-

outdoor power equipment product available as either a pull start model or an electric start
model while simplifying the manufacturing process. The manufacturing process is
simplified because the control module 830 that converts the outdoor power equipment to
electric start is connected to existing components (i.e., the release assembly wiring harness
840 and the electric motor 816) of the pull start outdoor power equipment and does not
require a separate physical mounting structure.
 [0077]    The construction and arrangements of the starter system for an engine, as shown
in the various exemplary embodiments, are illustrative only. Although only a few
embodiments have been described in detail in this disclosure, many modifications are
possible (e.g., variations in sizes, dimensions, structures, shapes and proportions of the
various elements, values of parameters, mounting arrangements, use of materials, colors,
orientations, etc.) without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of
the subject matter described herein. Some elements shown as integrally formed may be
constructed of multiple parts or elements, the position of elements may be reversed or
otherwise varied, and the nature or number of discrete elements or positions may be altered
or varied. The order or sequence of any process, logical algorithm, or method steps may be
varied or re-sequenced according to alternative embodiments. Other substitutions,
modifications, changes and omissions may also be made in the design, operating conditions
and arrangement of the various exemplary embodiments without departing from the scope
of the present invention.
