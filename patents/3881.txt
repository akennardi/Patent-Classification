BACKGROUND
Field
100021   Embodiments described herein generally relate to collector compositions and methods

one or more amines.
Description of the Related Art
100031 Froth flotation is a physiochemical mineral concentration method that uses the natural
and created differences in the hydrophobicity of the minerals to be separated from aqueous
slurries.   To enhance an existing or to create new water repellencies on the surface of the
minerals, certain heteropolar or nonpolar chemicals called collectors are added to an aqueous
slurry containing the minerals to be separated or purified. These collectors are designed to
selectively attach to one or more of the minerals to be separated, forming a hydrophobic
monolayer on their surfaces.        The formation of the hydrophobic monolayer makes the
minerals more likely to attach to air bubbles upon collision. The mass of the combined air
bubble/mineral particles is less dense than the displaced mass of the aqueous slurry, which
causes the air bubble/mineral particles to float to the surface where they form a mineral-rich
froth that can be skimmed off from the flotation unit, while the other minerals remain
submerged in the pulp.       The flotation of minerals with a negative surface charge, such as
silica, silicates, feldspar, mica, clays, chrysocola, potash and others, from an aqueous slurry
can be achieved using cationic collectors.
[0004]       In reverse flotation, impurities are floated out of and away from the unpurified or
crude materials to be beneficiated or otherwise purified. In particular, phosphate minerals,
iron ore, copper ores, calcium carbonate, feldspar, and other minerals and/or ores are
                                                 -1I-

frequently beneficiated by reverse flotation. In many cases, minerals containing silicate are
the main components of these impurities which cause quality reductions in the end product.
The minerals containing silicate include quartz, mica, feldspar, muscovite, and biotite. A
high silicate content lowers the quality of iron ore concentrate, which can be purified via
flotation using collectors so that high-grade steels can be produced from the low-silicate
concentrate.     Conventional collectors for silicate flotation, however, exhibit inadequate
results with respect to selectivity and yield.
[0005]   There is a need, therefore, for improved collector compositions and methods for
making and using same in flotation processes.

is not to be taken as an admission that that document or matter was known or that the
information it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of
any of the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0009]   It has been surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that a collector composition
containing a combination of one or more amidoamines and one or more amines can be used
in a separation process, e.g., froth flotation, for the purification of ores containing silica or
silicates to significantly increase the recovery or collection of enriched or purified ore as
compared to using a collector that contains the amidoamine or the amine alone.                    The
combination of the amine and the amidoamine provides good selectivity and high yield of the
silicate in the float, while the bottom fraction contains the purifiable material in a high yield
and low silicate content. For example, the collector containing both the amidoamine and the
amine can increase the recovery or collection of purifiable material as compared to using a
collector that contains only the amine alone in an amount from a low of about 0.2%, about
0.5%, about 1%, about 2 %, about 3 %, or about 4 %, to a high of about 5%, about           6
                                                                                             %, about
7%, about 8%, about 9%, about 10%, or more. In another example, the collector containing
both the amidoamine and the amine can increase the recovery or collection of purifiable
material as compared to using a collector that contains only the amine alone in an amount of
about 0. 2 % to about 0.5%, about 0.5% to about 1%, about 1% to about 3%, about                2
                                                                                                 % to
about 5%, or about 4% to about 10%. In another example, the collector containing both the
amidoamine and the amine can increase the recovery or collection of a purifiable material as
compared to using a collector that contains only the amidoamine alone in an amount from a
low of about 0. 2 %, about 0.5%, about 1%, about       2
                                                         %, about 3%, or about 4%, to a high of
about 5%, about 6%, about 7%, about 8%, about 9%, about 10%, or more.                     In another
example, the collector containing both the amidoamine and the amine can increase the
recovery or collection of purifiable material as compared to using a collector that contains
only the amidoamine alone in an amount of about 0. 2 % to about 0.5%, about 0.5% to about
 1%, about 1% to about 3%, about 2 % to about 5%, or about 4% to about 10%.
[0010]   It has also been surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that further adding one or
more etheramines to the collector composition containing the one or more amidoamines and
                                                 -5-

the one or more amines can also provide good selectivity and high yield. For example, the
collector composition containing a mixture of the amidoamine, the amine, and the etheramine
can increase the recovery or collection of purifiable material as compared to using a collector
that contains only the amine alone in an amount of about 0.2% to about 0.5%, about 0.5% to

amine, and the etheramine can increase the recovery or collection of purifiable material as

                                                                                    %, or about  4
                                                                                                   %, to a high of
about 5%, about 6%, about 7%, about 8%, about 9%, about 10%, or more.                                    In another

[0017] The carboxylic acid undergoes nucleophilic attack by the amine. The nucleophilic
attack can take place through any of the polyamine's amino groups; however, the amino
groups that have different neighboring groups will have different chemoselectivity with
respect to the other amino groups. The reaction conditions can be used to favor the reaction
at the terminal amine positions.

where R 1 can be as discussed and described above with respect to Formula I and X is OH.
The carboxylic acid can be hydrolyzed to form a carboxylate salt where X is OLi, ONa, or
OK. The carboxylic acid can be a carboxylic acid derivative, such as an acyl chloride where
X is Cl. The carboxylic acid derivative can also be an ester where X is OR, and R is a (C1
C6)alkyl.
[0019]   The carboxylic acid reactants can be or include a fatty acid, a mixture of fatty acids, a
fatty acid ester, a mixture of fatty acid esters, or a mixture of one or more fatty acids and one
or more fatty acid esters. Representative fatty acids include oleic acid, lauric acid, linoleic
acid, linolenic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, ricinoleic acid, myristic acid, arachidic acid,
behenic acid and mixtures thereof. The carboxylic acid can be or include one or more tall oil
fatty acids.    As used herein, "tall oil fatty acids" or "TOFA", consistent with industry
standards, encompasses compositions that can include a mixture of rosin acids, fatty acids,
triglycerides, sterols, high-molecular weight alcohols, and/or other alkyl chain materials. Tall
oil refers to the resinous yellow-black oily liquid obtained as an acidified byproduct in the
Kraft or sulfate processing of pine wood. As recognized by those skilled in tall oil chemistry,
the actual distribution of these three major constituents in a crude tall oil depends on a variety
of factors, such as the particular coniferous species of the wood being processed (wood type),
the geographical location of the wood source, the age of the wood, the particular season that
the wood is harvested, and others. Thus, depending on the particular source, crude tall oil can
contain of about 20-75 wt% fatty acids (more often 30-60 wt%), of about 20-65 wt% rosin
acids (more often 30-60%) and the balance being the neutral and non-saponifiable
components, but crude tall oil usually contains at least 5 wt% neutral and non-saponifiable
components.      Usually, crude tall oil contains at least 8 wt% by weight neutral and non
saponifiable components        and often   10 wt% or higher neutral and non-saponifiable
components. One or more of TOFA can be concentrated be fractional distillation of the crude
tall oil. Fatty acid triglycerides can be present in an amount of less than 10 wt%, less than 5
wt%, or less than 2.5 wt% of the collector composition.

distillation products that can be used as the fatty acids or at to make up at least a portion of
the fatty acids discussed and described herein can include, but are not limited to, tall oil fatty
acids, distilled tall oil (DTO), tall oil pitch, or any mixture thereof.

acid value from a low of about 20, about 25, or about 30 to a high of about 40, about 45, or
about 50. The distilled tall oil fraction can have a viscosity (centipoise at 85'C) from a low of
about 10 cP, about 20 cP, about 30 cP, or about 40 cP to a high of about 100 cP, about 120

[0026]  The carboxylic acid derivative reactant of Formula II can also be or include one or
more triglycerides. Most plant and animal oils are mixtures of triglycerides and fatty acids.
Triglycerides are generally produced or otherwise made from fatty acids having about 10
carbon atoms to about 24 carbon atoms and from 0 unsaturated carbon bonds to about 3
unsaturated carbon bonds in their chains. Some triglycerides are made from hydroxyl fatty
acids that have an alcohol group somewhere in the chain, e.g., castor oil. Vegetable oils such
as canola and corn oil can be used as feedstocks for the carboxylic acids. Through the use of
known saponification techniques, a number of vegetable oils (triglycerides), such as linseed
(flaxseed) oil, castor oil, tung oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, olive oil, canola oil, corn oil,
sunflower seed oil, peanut oil, coconut oil, safflower oil, palm oil and mixtures thereof, to
name just a few, can be used as a source of the fatty acid(s) for making a collector
composition. In some examples, a source of fatty acids can be tall oil. One particular source
of fatty acid can be distilled tall oil containing no more than about 6% rosin acid and other
constituents and referred to as TOFA.

less than 1 wt%, or less than 0.5 wt%, based on the solids weight of the concentration. The

be less than 35 wt%, less than 33 wt%, less than 30 wt%, less than 27 wt%, less than 25 wt%,
or less than 23 wt%.
[0038]   The collector composition can also be used in combination with one or more frothers
and/or one or more depressants. To avoid, in the case of silicate flotation from iron ore, this
being co-discharged, hydrophilic polysaccharides, such as, for example, modified starch,
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) or gum arabic, can be added as depressants in dosages of
about 10 g/tonne to about 1,000 g/tonne.

beneficiation of a wide variety of unpurified or crude materials.        Illustrative purifiable or
purified materials can include, but are not limited to, minerals or metals such as phosphate,
potash, lime, sulfate, gypsum, iron, platinum, gold, palladium, titanium, molybdenum,
copper, uranium, chromium, tungsten, manganese, magnesium, lead, zinc, clay, coal, silver,
graphite, nickel, bauxite, borax, borate, high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as bitumen,
oxides thereof, complexes thereof, salts thereof, or any mixture thereof.                 In some
embodiments, purifiable or purified materials can include, but are not limited to, iron, iron
oxides (e.g., ferric and/or ferrous oxides), phosphorous, phosphorous oxides, phosphates,
oxides thereof, complexes thereof, salts thereof, and mixture thereof. Often, the raw or crude
materials to be purified and recovered contain sand and/or clay. The collector compositions
containing the one or more amidoamines and the one or more amines can be selective toward
sand and/or clay.
[0041]  Although clay is often considered an impurity in conventional metal or mineral ore
beneficiation, clay can also be present in relatively large quantities, and can be the desired or
purifiable material or main component to be recovered. Some clays, for example kaolin clay,
are purifiable minerals that can be used in a number of applications, such as mineral fillers in
the manufacture of paper and rubber. Thus, one froth flotation process in which the collector
composition can be employed can include the separation of clay from a clay-containing ore.
The impurities in such ores can be metals and their oxides, such as iron oxide and titanium
dioxide, which can be floated via froth flotation. Other impurities of clay-containing ores
include coal. For example, impurities present in most Georgia kaolin include iron-bearing
titania and various minerals such as mica, ilmenite, and/or tourmaline, which are generally
also iron-containing.     Thus, the clay, which selectively associates with the collector
composition, is separately recoverable from metals, metal oxides, and coal.
[0042]  The separation processes       discussed      and described herein are applicable        to
suspensions, dispersions, and slurries of solid particles. These terms are sometimes defined
equivalently and sometimes are distinguished based on the need for the input of at least some
agitation or energy to maintain homogeneity in the case of a "slurry."             As used herein,
however, the terms "suspension" and "slurry" are used interchangeably with one another.
[0043]  In one or more embodiments, the purification of clay, the collector composition can
include one or more anionic collectors, flocculants, clay dispersants, or any mixture thereof to
control frothing. The anionic collector can be or include oleic acid, the flocculant can be or

[0044]  The collector composition can be used in froth flotation processes for the
beneficiation of coal, phosphate or potash, as well as other purifiable materials, including
metals and minerals discussed above, in which the removal of siliceous gangue materials
such as sand and/or clay and other impurities is an important factor in achieving favorable
process economics.     Potassium ores and other ores, for example, generally comprise a
mixture of minerals in addition to sylvite (KCl), which is desirably recovered in the froth
concentrate. Other ores include halite (NaCl), clay, and carbonate minerals which are non
soluble in water, such as aluminum silicates, calcite, dolomite, and anhydrite.         Other ore
impurities include iron oxides, titanium oxides, iron-bearing titania, mica, ilmenite,
tourmaline, aluminum silicates, calcite, dolomite, anhydrite, ferromagnesian, feldspar, and
debris or various other solid impurities such as igneous rock and soil. In the case of coal
beneficiation, non-combustible solid materials such as calcium magnesium carbonate are
considered impurities.
[0045]  Coals to be beneficiated can include anthracite, lignite, bituminous, sub-bituminous,
and the like.    The coal can be pulverized and cleaned using any available technology.
Ultimately, an aqueous slurry of coal particles having a concentration of solids which
promotes rapid flotation can be prepared. Generally, a solids concentration of about 2 wt% to
about 25 wt% coal solids, more usually of about 5 wt% to about 15 wt%, is suitable.
[0046]  The average particle size diameter of the coal in the flotation feed can be less than 600
pm. For example, the coal particles in the flotation feed to be treated can have a average
particle size diameter of less than 600 pm, less than 500 pm, less than 400 pm, less than 300
pm, less than 200 pm, less than 100 pm, or less than 50 pm.
[0047]  The amount of the collector composition added to the aqueous coal slurry for
obtaining the greatest recovery or collection of combustible coal particles with an acceptable
ash content can be dependent, at least in part, on a variety of diverse factors such as particle
size, coal rank, degree of surface oxidation, the initial ash content of the coal feed, and the
amount of any frothing agents and/or other adjuvants added to the aqueous coal slurry. A
suitable loading of the collector mixture can be determined by routine experiments. When
the collector composition is employed with only a frothing agent, the collector composition

can be present in an amount of about 0.001 wt% to about 0.4 wt%, or of about 0.005 wt% to
about 0.1 wt%, based on the weight of coal solids in the aqueous coal slurry.
[0048]   The collector composition can be used in combination with one or more frothing
agents. A frothing agent can be used to promote the formation of a suitably structured froth.
Illustrative frothing agents can include, but are not limited to, pine oils, cresol, 2-ethyl
hexanols, aliphatic alcohols such as isomers of amyl alcohol and other branched C4 to CS
alkanols, polypropylene glycols, ethers, methyl cyclohexyl methanols, or any mixture
thereof. Particularly suitable frothing agents can include, but are not limited to, methyl
isobutyl carbinol (MIBC), polypropylene glycol alkyl, and/or phenyl ethers. The amount of
frothing agent added to aqueous coal slurry can be influenced by a number of factors, which
can include, but are not limited to, particle size, rank of the coal, and degree of oxidation of
the coal. The amount of the frothing agent added to the aqueous slurry of coal can range of
about 0.001 wt% to about 0.1 wt% or about 0.01 wt% to about 0.05 wt%, based on the weight
of coal solids in the aqueous coal slurry.
[0049]   The collector composition can be used for the separation of coal in combination with
one or more other adjuvants or additives. For example, activators, conditioners, dispersants,
depressants, pour point depressants, and/or freeze point depressants.
[0050]   The addition of a pour point depressant or a freezing point depressant to the collector
composition can be useful in cold climates for maintaining the fluidity of the collector
composition. Suitable pour point depressants or freeze point depressants can include, but are
not limited to, fatty acids esters, particularly when esterified with a low molecular weight
alcohol like ethanol or methanol, poly alkyl acrylates, poly alkyl methacrylates, copolymers
of styrene and dialkyl maleates, copolymers of styrene and dialkyl fumarates, copolymers of
styrene and alkyl acrylates, copolymers of styrene and alkyl methacrylates, alkylphenoxy
poly(ethylene oxide)ethanol, alkylphenoxy poly(propylene oxide)propane diol, propylene
glycol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, acetate salts, acetate esters, chloride salts, formate
esters, formate salts, glycerin, diesters of diacids, copolymers of dialkyl fumarates and vinyl
acetate, copolymers of dialkyl maleate and vinyl acetate, copolymers of alkyl acrylate and
vinyl acetate, copolymers of alkyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, or any mixture thereof.
The pour point depressant can be present in an amount from a low of about 1 wt%, about 3
wt%, about 5 wt% or about 10 wt% to a high of about 30 wt%, about 40 wt%, about 50 wt%,
or about 60 wt%, based on the weight of the collector composition.

 WO 2015/054381                                                              PCT/US2014/059685
[0051]  The coal can be floated at the natural pH of the aqueous coal slurry, which usually can
vary of about 3 to about 9.5 depending upon the composition of the feed. The pH, however,
can optionally be adjusted to maintain the pH of the aqueous coal slurry prior to and during
flotation at a value of about 4 to about 9 or about 5.5 to about 9. If the coal is acidic, the pH
value of the aqueous coal slurry can be adjusted by including an alkaline material, such as
soda ash, lime, ammonia, potassium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide, and/or sodium
hydroxide. If the aqueous coal slurry is alkaline, a carboxylic acid, such acetic acid, and/or a
mineral acid, such as sulfuric acid and/or hydrochloric acid, can be used to adjust the pH, if
desired.
[0052]  The collector-treated and pH-adjusted aqueous coal slurry can be aerated in a
conventional flotation machine or bank of rougher cells to float the coal. Any conventional
flotation unit can be employed. The collector composition can be used to separate a wide
variety of contaminants or gangue from a liquid, e.g., water.        For example, the collector
composition can be used to separate siliceous contaminants such as sand, clay, and/or ash
from aqueous liquid suspensions or slurries containing one or more of these siliceous
contaminants.    Aqueous suspensions or slurries can therefore be treated with the collector
composition allowing for the effective separation of at least a portion of the contaminants, in
a contaminant-rich fraction, to provide a purified liquid.       The contaminant-rich fraction
contains a higher percentage of solid contaminants than originally present in the liquid
suspension or slurry.     Conversely, the purified liquid has a lower percentage of solid
contaminants than originally present in the liquid suspension or slurry.
[0053]  The treatment can involve adding an effective amount of the collector composition to
interact with and either coagulate or flocculate one or more solid contaminants into larger
agglomerates. An effective amount can be readily determined depending, at least in part, on
a number of variables (e.g., the type and concentration of contaminant), as is readily
appreciated by those having skill in the art. In other embodiments, the treatment can involve
contacting the liquid suspension continuously with a fixed bed of the collector composition,
in solid form.
[0054]  During or after the treatment of a liquid suspension with the collector composition,
the coagulated or flocculated solid contaminant (which can now be, for example, in the form
of larger, agglomerated particles or flocs) can be removed.        Removal can be affected by
flotation (with or without the use of rising air bubbles as described previously with respect to
                                               - 22 -

 WO 2015/054381                                                                PCT/US2014/059685
froth flotation) or sedimentation.     The optimal approach for removal will depend on the
relative density of the floes and other factors.           Increasing the quantity of collector
composition amine that can be used to treat the suspension can in some cases increase the
tendency of the flocs to float rather than settle. Filtration or straining can also be an effective
means for removing the agglomerated flocs of solid particulates, regardless of whether they
reside predominantly in a surface layer or in a sediment.
[0055]   Examples of liquid suspensions that can be purified include oil and gas drilling fluids,
which accumulate solid particles of rock or drill cuttings in the normal course of their use.
These drilling fluids are important in the drilling process for several reasons, including
transporting these drill cuttings from the drilling area to the surface, where their removal
allows the drilling mud to be recirculated. The addition of collector composition to oil well
drilling fluids, including water-based (i.e., aqueous) drilling fluids, effectively coagulates or
flocculates solid particle contaminants into larger clumps (or flocs), thereby facilitating their
separation by settling or flotation. The collector composition can be used in conjunction with
known flocculants       such   as polyacrylamides      and/or    hydrocolloidal polysaccharides.
Generally, in the case of suspensions of water-based oil or gas drilling fluids, the separation
of the solid contaminants can be sufficient to provide a purified drilling fluid for reuse in
drilling operations.
[0056]   Other kinds of aqueous suspensions can include the clay-containing aqueous
suspensions or brines, which accompany ore refinement processes, including those described
above.     The production of purified phosphate from mined calcium phosphate rock, for
example, generally relies on multiple separations of solid particulates from aqueous media,
whereby such separations can be improved using the collector composition. In the overall
process, calcium phosphate can be mined from deposits and the phosphate rock can be
initially recovered in a matrix containing sand and clay gangue or impurities. The matrix can
be mixed with water to form a slurry, which after mechanical agitation, can be screened to
retain phosphate pebbles and to allow fine clay particles to pass through as a clay slurry
effluent with large amounts of water.
[0057]   These clay-containing effluents can have high flow rates and typically carry less than
 10 wt% solids and more often contain only of about 1 wt% to about 5 wt% solids. The
dewatering (e.g., by settling or filtration) of this waste clay, which allows for recycle of the
water, poses a significant challenge for reclamation. The time required to dewater the clay,
                                                - 23 -

 WO 2015/054381                                                              PCT/US2014/059685
however, can be decreased through treatment of the clay slurry effluent, obtained in the
production of phosphate, with the collector composition. Reduction in the clay settling time
allows for efficient re-use of the purified water, obtained from clay dewatering, in the
phosphate production operation. In one embodiment of the purification method, where the
liquid suspension is a clay-containing effluent slurry from a phosphate production facility, the
purified liquid can contain less than 1 wt% solids after a settling or dewatering time of less
than 1 month.
[0058]   In addition to the phosphate pebbles that can be retained by screening and the clay
slurry effluent described above, a mixture of sand and finer particles of phosphate can also
obtained in the initial processing of the mined phosphate matrix. The sand and phosphate in
this stream can be separated by froth flotation which, as described above, can be improved
using the collector composition as a depressant for the sand.
[0059]   In the area of slurry dewatering, another specific application of the collector
composition can be in the filtration of coal from water-containing slurries. The dewatering of
coal is important commercially, since the BTU value per unit weight and hence the quality of
the coal decreases with increasing water content. In one embodiment, therefore, the collector
composition can be used to treat an aqueous coal-containing suspension or slurry prior to
dewatering the coal by filtration.
[0060]  As used herein, the term "beneficiation" broadly refers to any process for purifying
and/or upgrading a crude, raw, or unpurified material to produce a beneficiated or purified
material as described herein. In the case of coal ore purification, a number of beneficiation
operations are conventionally used in an effort to improve the quality of coal that is burned,
for example, in electricity-generating power plants. As discussed previously, for example,
such quality improvement processes address environmental concerns that have resulted in
lower tolerances for metallic contaminants such as mercury and arsenic, as well as nitrogen
and sulfur-containing compounds. Froth flotation, as discussed above, can be one method for
the purification of a coal ore via treatment of an aqueous slurry of the ore with the collector
composition. Treatment can alternatively occur prior to or during conventional coal size or
density classification operations to facilitate the reduction in the amount(s) of one or more of
the mercury, nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, ash, and pyrite impurities in the purified coal, wherein
these impurities are measured on a volatile free weight basis and as described previously.
The collector composition can also be used in conjunction with size or density classification
                                                - 24 -

 WO 2015/054381                                                             PCT/US2014/059685
operations to reduce moisture and/or increase the fuel value of the purified coal (e.g.,
measured in BTU/lb). The reduction of the amount(s) of one or more (e.g., two or more, or
all) of the impurities described above, in the purified coal recovered in the size or density
classification operation can be less than the corresponding reference amount(s) in a purified
reference coal recovered in the same size or density classification operation, but without
using the collector composition.
[0061]   In general, the reduction of one of the impurities noted above in the purified coal,
results in a corresponding reduction in the amount of one or more other undesired impurities.
For example, a reduction in pyrite generally leads to a reduction in mercury and other
inorganic materials such as silicon-containing ash. In one embodiment, the use of one or
more size or density classification operations in conjunction with the collector composition
results in a reduction in amounts of all the impurities noted above.
[0062]   Suitable conventional size or density classification operations include cyclone
separation, heavy medium (or heavy media or dense medium) separation, filtration, and/or
screening, any of which can be used in combination (e.g., serially and/or in parallel) with
each other or with froth flotation.     Generally, these operations precede froth flotation to
provide, in combination with froth flotation, an upgraded or purified coal meeting the various
specifications (e.g., nitrogen and sulfur levels) required for combustion in electricity
generating power plants. For example, water-only or clarifying cyclone operations process a
feed stream of a raw coal ore slurry, which can be fed tangentially under pressure into a
cyclone. Centrifugal force can move heavier material to the cyclone wall, where it is
subsequently typically transported to the underflow at the apex (or spigot).       Lighter coal
particles that are disposed toward the center of the cyclone can be removed via a pipe (or
vortex finder) to the overflow. The targeted density at which light and heavy particles are
separated can be adjusted by varying pressure, vortex finder length, and/or apex diameter.
Such water-only or clarifying cyclones typically treat material in the size range of about 0.5
mm to about 1 mm and can involve two ore more stages of separation to improve separation
efficiency.
[0063]   Heavy medium separation can use a dense liquid medium (e.g., magnetite at a
specified magnetite/water ratio) to float particles (e.g., coal) having a density below that of
the medium and depress particles (e.g., sand or rock) having a density above that of the
medium. Heavy medium separation can be employed in a simple deep or shallow "bath"

configuration or can be included as part of a cyclone separation operation to enhance the
gravitational separation forces with centrifugal forces.       Often, one or more stages of a
clarifying cyclone separation operation are followed by one or more stages of heavy medium
cyclone separation and one ore more screening steps to yield an appropriately sized and
purified (e.g., a pre-conditioned or pre-treated) coal feedstock for subsequent froth flotation.
[0064]  Another application of the collector composition can be in the area of sewage
treatment, accompanied by various processes that are undertaken to remove contaminants
from industrial and municipal waste water. Such processes can purify sewage to provide
both purified water that is suitable for disposal into the environment (e.g., rivers, streams, and
oceans) as well as a "sludge." Sewage refers to any type of water-containing wastes which
are normally collected in sewer systems and conveyed to treatment facilities.              Sewage
therefore includes municipal wastes from toilets (sometimes referred to as "foul waste") and
basins, baths, showers, and kitchens (sometimes referred to as "sullage water"). Sewage can
also include industrial and commercial waste water, (sometimes referred to as "trade waste"),
as well as stormwater runoff from hard-standing areas such as roofs and streets.
[0065]   Conventional processes for purifying sewage often involve preliminary, primary, and
secondary steps. Preliminary steps often include the filtration or screening of large solids
such as wood, paper, rags, as well as coarse sand and grit, which would normally damage
pumps. Subsequent primary steps are then employed to separate most of the remaining solids
by settling in large tanks, where a solids-rich sludge is recovered from the bottom of these
tanks and processed further. A purified water is also recovered and normally subjected to
secondary steps involving biological processes.
[0066]   Thus, in one embodiment, the purification of sewage water by settling or
sedimentation can comprise treating the sewage water, before or during the settling or
sedimentation operation, with the collector composition.         This treatment can be used to
improve settling operation (either batch or continuous), for example, by decreasing the
residence time required to effect a given separation (e.g., based on the purity of the purified
water and/or the percent recovery of solids in the sludge). Otherwise, the improvement can
be manifested in the generation of a higher purity of the purified water and/or a higher
recovery of solids in the sludge, for a given settling time.
[0067] After treatment of sewage with the collector composition and removing a purified
water stream by sedimentation, it is also possible for the collector composition to be
                                               -26-

 WO 2015/054381                                                             PCT/US2014/059685
subsequently used for or introduced into one or more secondary steps as described above to
further purify the water. These secondary operations normally rely on the action of naturally
occurring microorganisms to break down organic material. In particular, aerobic biological
processes substantially degrade the biological content of the purified water recovered from
primary steps.     The microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and protozoa) consume biodegradable
soluble organic contaminants (e.g., sugars, fats, and other organic molecules) and bind much
of the less soluble fractions into flocs, thereby further facilitating the removal of organic
material.
[0068]  The collector composition can also be applied to the purification of pulp and paper
mill effluents. These aqueous waste streams normally contain solid contaminants in the form
of cellulosic materials (e.g., waste paper; bark or other wood elements, such as wood flakes,
wood strands, wood fibers, or wood particles; or plant fibers such as wheat straw fibers, rice
fibers, switchgrass fibers, soybean stalk fibers, bagasse fibers, or cornstalk fibers; and
mixtures of these contaminants). The effluent stream containing one or more cellulosic solid
contaminants can be treated with the collector composition and purified water can be
removed via sedimentation, flotation, and/or filtration.
[0069]  In the separation of bitumen from sand and/or clay impurities as described previously,
various separation steps can be employed either before or after froth flotation of the bitumen
containing slurry. These steps can include screening, filtration, and/or sedimentation, any of
which can benefit from treatment of the oil sand slurry with the collector composition,
followed by removal of a portion of the sand and/or clay contaminants in a contaminant-rich
fraction (e.g., a bottoms fraction) or by removal of a purified bitumen fraction. As described
above with respect to phosphate ore processing, water effluents, which generally contain
solid clay particles, can be subjected to a treating step that can include flocculating the
contaminants to facilitate their removal (e.g., by filtration).    Waste water effluents from
bitumen processing facilities can also contain sand and/or clay impurities and therefore can
benefit from treatment with the collector composition to dewater the waste water effluents
and/or remove at least a portion of the solid impurities in a contaminant-rich fraction. A
particular process stream of interest that can be generated during bitumen extraction is known
as the "mature fine tails," which is an aqueous suspension of fine solid particulates that can
benefit from dewatering. Generally, in the case of sand and/or clay containing suspensions
from a bitumen production facility, separation of the solid contaminants can be sufficient to
                                               - 27 -

 WO 2015/054381                                                              PCT/US2014/059685
allow the recovery, collection, and/or removal of a purified liquid or water stream that can be
recycled to the bitumen process.
[0070]   The treatment of various intermediate streams and effluents in bitumen production
processes with the collector composition is not limited only to those process streams that are
at least partly subjected to froth flotation. As is readily appreciated by those of skill in the
art, other techniques (e.g., centrifugation via the "Syncrude Process") for bitumen purification
will generate aqueous intermediate and byproduct streams from which solid contaminant
removal is desirable.
[0071]   The collector composition can be employed in the removal of suspended solid
particulates, such as sand and clay, in the purification of water, and particularly for the
purpose of rendering it potable. Moreover, the collector composition can have the additional
ability to complex metallic cations (e.g., lead and mercury cations) allowing these unwanted
contaminants to be removed in conjunction with solid particulates. Therefore, the collector
composition can be used to effectively treat impure water having both solid particulate
contaminants as well as metallic cation contaminants. Without being bound by theory, it is
believed that electronegative moieties, such as the carbonyl oxygen atom on the collector
composition, complex with undesired cations to facilitate their removal.         Generally, this
complexation occurs when the water is at a pH of greater than 5, and typically at a pH of
about 7 to about 9.
[0072]   Another possible mechanism for the removal of metallic cations can be based on the
cationic association with negatively charged solid particulates. Flocculation and removal of
these particulates will therefore also cause, at least to some extent, the removal of metallic
cations.   Regardless of the mechanism, in one embodiment, the treatment and removal of
both of these contaminants can be carried out to yield potable water.

non-limiting examples are offered.        Although the examples can be directed to specific
embodiments, they are not to be viewed as limiting the invention in any specific respect.

cleaner feed collected in January 2013 and supplied by the CF Industries, Inc.         In this
phosphate reverse cleaner stage, the cleaner feed was conditioned at approximately 70 wt%
solids and neutral pH with the addition of the collector composition for five minutes in a 2 L
stainless steel beaker at 1,500 rpm using a Denver D12 Laboratory Flotation Machine. The
conditioned ore was transferred to a two-liter Denver cell for flotation. The solids content
was lowered to 25 wt% for flotation. The ore was agitated for approximately 15-30 seconds
before the air was introduced into the cell. Once the froth began to form, it was pulled for
two minutes.        After the two minute flotation step was completed, the two separate
components, phosphate concentrate and silica tail, were separately filtered and dried. The
dried tail samples were slightly ground in a mortar and pestle, and a small portion was
collected for analysis. The dried concentrate samples were mixed well, and a small portion
was collected for analysis. Bone phosphate of lime (BPL) analysis and inductively coupled
plasma analysis (ICP) on the acid insolubles (A.I.) were performed on the samples.
