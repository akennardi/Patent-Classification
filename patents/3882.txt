FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a panel of biomarkers useful for detection of types,
grades and: stages of human breast cancer. The present invention particularly relates to
the development of these identified biomarkers as a miRNA chip for the early and
accurate diagnosis of human breast cancer. This patent application highlights the

 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART
 Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for women in the world. It
 is the second most common cancer in females in India and the early detection and
 treatment improve prognosis and survival rate, motivating the need for finding out
 novel non-invasive methods for early diagnosis of this disease. Presently, biopsy is
 the only method which confirms the diagnosis and different grades of cancer. Being
 an invasive method, it is time consuming and often uncomfortable for the patient.
 Moreover, the negative biopsy rate is significantly high, especially in screen detected
 and non palpable cancers suggesting that better molecular diagnostic techniques are
 needed to replace or compliment current biopsy techniques. Tissue characterization
 by pathologists for ER, PR and HER 2/Neu status and axillary lymph node status are
 the most important prognostic factors and 90% of those patients without nodal
 involvement have no further breast cancers detected in their lifetime. Presently, there
 is no established non-invasive test for confirming the axillary node status. Axillary
 nodal status is of major importance from a therapeutic and prognostic point of view.
 Moreover, majority of patients end up doing chemotherapy due to lack of reliable
 markers. Chemotherapeutic drugs currently used are also not specific to breast cancer.
 Therefore it is imperative to find novel biomarkers f6r early and accurate diagnosis
 and prognosis in breast cancer sparing the majority of patients from undergoing an
 axillary dissection. Such molecular signatures can also lead to good prognosis and
                                                     1

    help develop novel targeted treatments. Moreover, such an approach can accurately
    identify subgroups of patients who will really benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy
   with its debilitating side effects.
   The diagnosis of breast tumor starts with the screening techniques to confirm whether
 5  a lump is present or not. The noninvasive examination techniques existing are
    mammography, ultrasound or MR imaging which determine the presence of any
   tumors and also detect tumor size, invasion etc.        To further confirm the tumor
   diagnosis and grading, Fine Needle Aspiration and Cytology (FNAC), core biopsy
    and excisional biopsy is required. Additional testing may include genetic screening
10 that test for the status of hormones like ER, PR, and genes like HER2/neu etc.
   Chemotherapy is currently used for all cases of Infiltrating duct carcinomas of breast.
    Mammography and ultrasound may identify a potential area of concern. MRI imaging
   requires injection of a dye, the side effects of which are not yet proven. Fine Needle
   Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is not always as reliable as surgical biopsies in
15 producing a conclusive diagnosis. Immunohistochemical            analysis of ER, PR,
    HER2/neu, BRCA and PTEN requires lot of time to arrive at any final conclusion of
   disease progression. The available diagnostic methods present in the market are not
   up to the expectation that one can diagnose the early stages of disease and therapeutic
   measures can be optimized to completely prevent and cure the tumor at right time.
20 These above mentioned imaging tools are not sensitive methods to detect early
   molecular changes occurring in the cell during initiation of the cancer. Tissue
   embedding, sectioning, staining are all cumbersome procedures and time consuming.
   Moreover, staging could be determined only after getting the final histopathology
   report and extensive metastatic workup. No existing technologies are there for more
25 accurate staging of the disease for identifying suitable patient sub groups to tailor
   systemic treatment.*There are no proper fast and accurate molecular diagnostic tool
   for pathologists till now for accurate staging and grading. As far as current
   chemotherapy regimens are concerned, no targeted therapy is currently used.
   Biomarkers     constitute the most important field in cancer diagnosis. Cancer
30 biomarkers are especially useful for early detection or diagnosis of the disease.
   Biomarkers can be used to screen patients, for classifying the different stages or
                                               2

           grades of cancers and to predict prognosis and resistance to therapy. A tumour marker
           can be produced by tumour itself or by the body as a result of the disease. These
           biomolecules are quite often produced in abnormally large numbers in the cancerous
          tissues and often secreted to body fluids like blood, serum, urine etc. To identify
  5        molecular changes setting-in much before the disease initiation and progression,
           development of molecular biomarkers is extremely important.
           MicroRNAs are small RNAs of 22-25 nucleotides in length with a major role in gene
           regulation. Since they are highly conserved between the genomes of related species
           and show a characteristic evolutionary divergence, computational analysis of
10         miRNAs would augment the experimental analysis to identify those which are
           involved in the regulation of common genes and pathways leading to the development
           of cancer. Recently, oncomiRs, special classes of non-coding microRNAs are found to
           be associated with a large number of cancers. Consequently impaired miRNA
           expression is implicated in various tumours. This class of novel non-coding RNAs or
15         microRNAs is expected to eventually identify previously unappreciated tumour
           suppressors and oncogenes and also address many questions about the origin,
           development and progression of breast cancer. Many studies have shown a deregulation
           with respect to the expression of these small RNAs in many tumours. It is imperative to
           know the expression profile of these microRNAs which would help us to classify, and
20         associate these miRNAs with different stages and grades of tumours so as to develop
           them as novel biomarkers of various cancers. Thus the expression profiles could be
           used for classification, prognosis and diagnosis of human malignancies

    Other examples of similar studies:
    OncomiRs are a special class of non-coding microRNAs found to be associated with a
    large number of cancers. Consequently impaired miRNA expression is implicated in
    various tumours.Various in vitro and in vivo studies have implicated an active role of
 5  microRNAs in breast cancer. Many reports on microRNAs indicated their role in cell
    proliferation and apoptosis growth and migration (1&2) suggesting that deregulation
    of these microRNA could lead to proliferative diseases like cancer. Also studies have
    shown that microRNA cluster mapped to the hotspot areas of the genome that are
    prone for cancer mutations (3 &4). Their expression patterns show a general trend of
10  down regulation in human cancer samples (5) indicating that most of them function as
    tumour suppressors. Though many profiling studies have' revealed a different
    signature of the cancer samples compared to normal tissues, very few studies have
    been conducted which elucidates the functional role of each of these nicroRNAs. In
    breast cancer, microRNA miR 206 was found to inhibit the function of estrogen
15  receptor gene ESRI. Later, it was found to be targeted by a set of microRNAs like
    miR 18a, miR 18b, miR193b and miR 302c (6 & 7). CyclinD1 which is over
                                              4

    expressed in majority of the cancers was identified as a direct target of miR 17-5p (8).
    Under expression status of miR 125 a & b in HER 2 positive tumours indicated their
    role as a tumour suppressor of this gene. Analysis of triple negative (ER, PR and
    HER2/Neu) breast cancer patients showed that expression levels of miR 210, miR 21,
 5  and miR221 play a significant role in the primary breast cancer vs normal samples
    (15). Down regulation of miR 200 family members in highly metastatic tumours and
    their up regulation in mesenchymal cells which initiated mesenchymal to epithelial
    transition depicted.its role in metastasis (10). Let 7, one of the founder members of
    microRNAs are usually under expressed in tumours. One of the studies revealed that
10 their down regulation induced BTI-Cs (Breast - Tumour initiating Cells) for tumour
    initiation, progression and metastasis and vice versa (11). MicroRNAs miR 21,
    miR155 and miR10b have been shown to play a role in tumour metastasis by
   targeting anti metastatic genes (12, 13,14). MiR-21 is over expressed in both male and
    female breast tumors compared with normal breast tissue and has been associated with
15 advanced stage, lymph node positivity, and reduced survival time. Furthermore,
   existence of microRNAs either floating or in exosomes in the systemic circulation,
   has led to the possibility that such molecules may serve as biomarkers for early
   detection of cancers. Thus microRNA profiling is emerging as a powerful tool for
   diagnosis of breast cancer         types, grades and stages.        Although   additional
20 investigations are necessary to fully exploit the therapeutic use of miRNAs in breast
   cancer, there is increasing evidence that miRNAs have potential not only to facilitate
   the determination of diagnosis and prognosis and the prediction of response to
   treatment, but also to act as therapeutic targets and replacement therapies.
   The drawback of these studies is that none of them was carried out in the specified
25 stages of grades or subtypes of human breast cancer samples. Hence identifying the
   exact grade and stage of Breast Cancer is a boon for treatment of such kind of
   diseases.

15 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION
   Breast cancer is a complex heterogeneous genetic disease, involving a variety of
   changes in gene expression and structure. MicroRNAs are recently discovered tiny
   RNA molecules which play an important role in the gene regulation. They are found
   to have an altered expression in majority of cancers and are termed as oncomiRs.
20 Recently, advances in molecular profiling has shed new light on the etiology of the
   disease and also acclaimed great potential for the development of novel biomarkers
   for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic targets. This attracts the scientific domain for
   extensive investigation to further elucidate their precise role as novel biomarkers in
   malignancy.
25 MicroRNAs are tiny biological molecules that play a regulatory role in biological
   processes and cellular functions. Therefore these molecules could be used as
   indicators of changes in the cells, when they transform from normal to diseased
   condition. This invention specifically relates to the identification of changes in these
   small RNA regulations that play an important role in the development of breast
30 cancer. Thus creating an expression signature of these microRNAs involved in cancer

     (oncomiRs) at particular stages of development or disease progression qualifies them
     as ideal biomarkers. Thus we have identified changes in the expression pattern of
     small RNAs called oncomiRs from breast cancer patients at different grades and
     stages of development of cancer. The expression profile of these miRNAs formed a
  5  classic signature, as breast cancer progressed from stage I to stage III, in both, grades.
     These differentially up and down regulated microRNAs are significant in one type,
     stage and grade of cancer and not in the other. Therefore we have classified them into
    type, grade and stage specific biomarkers which could be useful tools in the diagnosis
     and prognosis of breast cancer
10  The role of miRNAs as gene regulators distinguishes them as novel biomarkers for
    diagnosis and prognosis in various cancers. MiRNAs possess unique features that
    classify them as ideal tumor markers include their tissue specificity, stability, ease of
    detection and association with the disease status..Thus miRNAs have vast possibility
     in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of diseases especially malignancies like breast
15  cancer, where still no reliable tumor markers for particular stages and grades are
    available at present. Potentially these molecular biomarkers can be used to accurately
     identify subgroups of patients who will really benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy
    with its debilitating side effects. Thus this proves to be an additional, accurate, quick
    and high throughput molecular diagnostic tool for pathologists especially when
20  patient number is high.
    Molecular changes starts in a cell much before morphological changes occur. Our
    invention has made it possible to detect these early changes, which lead to the
    initiation and progression of breast cancer. Moreover, large number of samples could
    be tested at one go in less than 2 hours time, making this a high through put assay and
25  cost effective assay Finding the deregulated targets of microRNAs has great potential
    in targeted therapy.
    The novelty of these miRNAs is that they detect the early molecular changes in the
    cell. Thus they are ideal and potential biomarkers for detecting different grades and
    stages of breast cancer. A few to hundred samples can be checked within a span of 2
30  to 3 hrs and hence this becomes an easy, fast and high throughput technology.
                                                12

    Though microRNAs are present in the cells and altered signatures are detected and
     reported in cancer samples, the identification of the different subtype, grade and stage
     specific microRNAs along with its fold regulation demarcated them as ideal
     biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis and targeted therapy.
  5  Specific microRNAs are identified by LNA microarray and is verified with Taqman
     Low Density arrays. The fold regulation of each microRNA was also found by TLDA
    analysis. Additional validation of these microRNAs were carried out using Taqman
     individual assays in individual cancer samples samples and identified for making this
    as a diagnostic chip (Table 11).
10                              Workflow of miRNA profiling
     >   RNA was isolated from Breast cancer tissues along with adjacent normals using
    mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit.
         11-350ng total RNA was used for Quantitative Reverse transcriptase reaction.
    >    Megaplex Reverse Transcription rxn (40 cycles) is done using Megaplex RT
15  Primers, (TaqMan@ MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit) -dNTPs with dTTP,
    MultiscribeTM reverse Transcriptase, 10 X RT Buffer and RNase Inhibitor.
    * The reverse transcription (RT) reaction was done in a final volume of 7.5 tL
    which contains: 3 pL total RNA and 4.5 tL of RT reaction mix. Thermocycling
    condition was set as default and Ramp speed or mode: 9700 using Std or Max ramp.
20  >   Preamplification (12 cycles) were done using Megaplex PreAmp Primers,
    TaqMan@ PreAmp Master Mix, 2 X.
        In this step, pre amplified specific cDNA targets were subjected to increase, the
    quantity of desired cDNA for miRNA expression analysis using TaqMan@
    MicroRNA Arrays. The preamplification reaction was performed in a final volume of
25  25 pL where: 2.5 [tL RT product and 22.5 pL PreAmp reaction mix was present.
    >   Real-Time PCR Reaction wesre done using TaqMan@ Universal PCR Master
    Mix, No AmpErase UNG 2 X, TaqMan@ MicroRNA Array.
                                               13

    *    Here the DNA polymerase from the TaqMan@ Universal PCR Master Mix
    amplifies the target cDNA using. sequence-specific primers and probe on the
    TaqMan@ MicroRNA Array. The presence of the target is detected 'in real time
    through cleavage of the TaqMan probe by the polymerase 5' - 3' exonuclease activity.
 5   1. Megaplex RT product and TaqMan Universal PCR Master mix in total volume of
    900 ptL was mixed.
    2. Dispensed 100 pL of the PCR reaction mix into each port of the TaqMan
    MicroRNA Array centrifuged and then sealed the array.
    3. Imported the SDS setup file (SDS.txt) SDS software v2.2 and set for Relative
10  Quantification (AACt) in 384 well TaqMan Low Density Array.
    4. Loaded and ran the array using the 384 well TaqMan Low Density Array default
    thermal-cycling conditions.
    >   Data analysis
    1. To analyze the results the SDS files were transferred into an RQ study format.
15  2. Amplification plots, baseline and threshold values were adjusted
    3. Threshold cycles (CTs) were compared and analyzed using arithmetic formulas
   that determines the change in expression of a target gene in an experimental sample
    relative to the same target in a reference sample. This method was used for high
   throughput measurements of relative gene expression.
20 4. Statminer software was used for fold expression analysis of miRNAs and
   classified as detector not amplified, significant and nonsignificant based on their p
   values. Highly significant (>0.05) miRNAs were selected for study and biomarker
   identification in the respective types of breast cancer.
                                         EXAMPLES
25 The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and
   therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.
                                               14

   Example 1: Total RNA isolation and quality control
   Tissue samples (100mg) were homogenized using automated tissue homogenizer and
   total RNAs were isolated using miRvana kit (Ambion) from all the samples. The
   quantity of these RNAs was checked using nanodrop and spectophotometer and
 5 quality using RIN (RNA Integrity Number) values in Agilent Bioanalyzer. These
   RNAs were used in all downstream experiments. The reverse transcription reaction
   was performed using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit followed by
   Polymerase Chain Reaction. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction was performed
   using an Applied Biosystems 7900-Taqman              Low Density Array    Real-Time
10 Polymerase Chain Reaction System. Each TaqMan Assay was run in quadruplicate.
   All the samples displayed good RIN value, linearity (R2>0.96), good abundance
   (average CT range 22-28) and NTC (Non-Template Control) CT >38.
   Example 2: Taqman Low Density Arrays (TLDA)
   MicroRNA profiling was done using TaqManMicroRNA Arrays, which contains
15 megaplex Primer Pools covering Sanger miRBase versionlO. Megaplex Reverse
   Transcription Primers are novel stem-looped RT primer pools that streamline the
   profiling of hundreds of miRNA targets in a single experiment and reduce the number
   of Reverse Transcription reactions and the amount of total RNA required for
   generating a comprehensive miRNA expression profile. A pre amplification step of
20 cDNA with preamp megaplex pool primers was done to significantly enhance the
   ability to detect slowly expressed miRNAs.
   Example 3: Real Time amplification of miRNA pool by loading in TLDA plates
   The TaqMan human MicroRNA arrays consists of 2 plates pool A and pool B. 'A'
   Array Sanger's V 10.0 contains 667human taqman microRNA Assays, Three TaqMan
25 MicroRNA Assay. Endogenous controls are included for data normalization and one
   TaqMan MicroRNA Assay, not related to human is also included as a negative
   control. The set enables accurate quantitation of 667 human microRNAs.
                                              15

      Results of Taqman Low Density Arrays analysis
      The statistical analysis was performed using statminer software. This contains a
      filtering procedure for outlier removal; various normalization methods based on
      single or multiple genes and provides relative quantification analysis of gene
  5   expression through a combination of statistical analysis and interactive visualization.
      The CT (threshold cycle) values for each well were adjusted and included/excluded
      for analysis based on the following analysis settings:
      if a CT >= Max CT, it was adjusted to Max CT. and calculated the deviation G in
      units of the standard deviation (SD): G = (max CT - mean CT) / SD . If the
10    following test is true, and (max CT - mean CT) >= 0.25, then the replicate with max
      CT is removed as outlier. Arithmetic Mean uses the arithmetic mean of CT values of
      the selected controls as the normalization factor (NF), while Geometric Mean uses
      their geometric mean as the NF. Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient (r)
      was calculated for CT or ACT values of sample pairs, and plotted on the Signal
15    Correlation Plot and Scatter Plot respectively. T-test was performed to calculate p
      value. Standard deviation (SD) was calculated for CT values of the technical
      replicates, and is used to calculate the RQ (fold change).
      Based on this analysis, different sets of microRNAs were selected which pertains to
      different subtypes (ER+ve, ER-ve), grades and stages (Table 1, 2 and 3).

         LNA Microarray
         The differentially expressed microRNAs identified by Taqman Low Density Arrays
         were further confirmed with LNA (Locked Nucleic Acid) Array. The RNA isolated
         from the same cancer samples were hybridized against 2002 microRNAs consisting of
  10     904 human, 388 rat and 710 mouse microRNAs. The normals were labeled with Hy5
         dye and samples were labeled with Hy3 and also reversely hybridised and taken the
         mean intensities for calculation.
         The normalized median signal intensities for the Hy3 (sample) and Hy5 (common
         reference) indicate the relative expression level of each microRNA in the samples and
  15     in the common reference. If the Hy3 value is higher than the Hy5 value there is a
         higher expression in the sample than in the common reference and if the Hy3 value is
         lower than that of Hy5 value there is a lower expression in the samples compared to
         the common reference. Then we take the ratios between the Hy3 and Hy5 signal and
                                                    21

   the log2 to that ratio. A positive number indicates a higher expression in the sample
   (Hy3) compared to the common reference and vice versa. The NA means that the
   microRNA is not expressed based on certain cut-off criteria. One criterion is the
   signal intensity of the Hy3 and Hy5 channel. If both Hy3 and Hy5 signals are below
 5  1.5 times the median of all capture probes on the array we say that it is background
   and below our cut-off. This cut-off is set to avoid too many false positives.
   Call rate is the number of expressed microRNAs compared to the total number of
   microRNAs analyzed (the % of identified microRNAs). This call rate is expected to
   be between 20 and 50% for human samples and it is clear that we have a very nice
10 and high call rate in our samples. That human samples have call rates between 20 and
   50% has been documented in the literature, both based on deep sequencing, array and
   PCR profiling. A call rate much higher than 50% indicates a high risk of having false
   positives in the data set Therefore we used the 1.5X median of all capture probes as a
   cut off.
15 The microRNAs have been analyzed based on the samples groups. A two-tailed
   statistical t-test has been performed between the samples groups grade 2 and grade
   3.The heat map has been made based on a cut-off of P< 10-.          "Expression matrix
   (analysis)" looked like typical breast cancer microRNAs. A very long list of breast
   cancer miRNAs from literature, web databases are all present in our samples. Just to
20 mention some examples, miR-21, miR-155, miR-148a, miR210 and miR-29b.These
   typical breast cancer signatures clearly classify our samples as breast cancer samples.
   The identification of miRNAs in particular stages or grades shows its behavior which
   is highly correlated with the expression of translational regulators or targets that are
   involved in tumor progression. The miRNAs which are down regulated at stage I, gets
25 up or down regulated successively at stage II and stage III with in a grade. This
   classical pattern of miRNA expression indicates their importance in controlling the
   progressive growth of breast cancer.
   The findings of these significant novel miRNAs in specific stages and grades will
   enable us to design individual assays for their validation in vitro and invivo. These
                                               22

    validated miRNAs may give new insight for the diagnosis and treatment of tumor,
     progressing at specific stages or grades.
    Furthermore, these differentially up/down regulated miRNAs in various stages of
    breast cancer identified by TLDA technique, have also been confirmed by LNA
  5 microarry technology. This also reconfirms the trend of expression pattern in
    aforesaid stages and grades of breast cancer. These finding indicated that the
    expression of common miRNAs in both the techniques have some defined role in the
    tumor progression. Among these common miRNAs, few highly up/down ones are
    selected for their individual assay validation is been done to prove these candidate
10  miRNAs as novel biomarker for particular grade /stage of breast cancer.
    Example 5
    Validation of highly up/down regulated microRNAs by q-pcr
    Six of the highly up and down regulated category of microRNAs which are common
    among the TLDA microarray and LNA microarray were selected for its further
15  validation among the rest of individual samples in grade 2 and grade 3 by q-per
    analysis. (Table 11)
    ADVANTAGES
    These novel biomarkers could be developed as a diagnostic kit for early and accurate
    diagnosis of human breast cancer. They are direct indicators of cellular changes
20  during the initiation and development of breast cancer. These biomarkers complement
    the pathologists for the accurate grading and staging of breast cancer. These
    biomarkers provided a utility angle to the already existing biological molecules called
    microRNAs which play a major role in gene regulation. These biomarkers could
    provide a fast, cheaper, accurate, robust and high throughput diagnostic kit for
25  accurate diagnosis of human breast cancer.
