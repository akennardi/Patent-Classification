DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0010]       In the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally indicates an embodiment
of a cabin assembly in accordance with the invention. Various components of the
cabin assembly 10 are not shown for the purposes of simplicity and ease of
description. Furthermore, the cabin assembly 10 is suitable for use with a wide
variety of cabins, including cabins for habitation and cabins for storage and transport.
[0011]       The cabin assembly 10 includes a base assembly 12 that is mountable
on a chassis 14 of a vehicle, such as a caravan or motorhome. The chassis 14 can
be that of other vehicles and the cabin assembly 10 is not necessarily suited for
habitation. For example, the cabin assembly 10 can also be suited for storage and
transport of goods, and which can be expanded.
[0012]       The base assembly 12 includes a base frame 16. The base frame 16 is
mounted on the chassis 14. Wall frame members 15 for wall assemblies of the cabin
assembly 10 are mounted on the base frame 16.
[0013]       The base assembly 12 incudes a spacing arrangement so that the base
frame 16 is spaced from the chassis 14. The spacing arrangement includes one or
more bearers or spacers that are interposed between the chassis 14 and the base
frame 16.
[0014]       The chassis 14 can be of the type that includes two spaced chassis
beams 18.1, 18.2 that extend longitudinally and over a rear axle 20 of the vehicle.
The bearers may be in the form of two elongate bearers 22.1, 22.2 positioned on
respective beams 18. The base frame 16 includes a side section 23 on one side and
a longitudinal slide support beam 25 on an opposite side. A rear frame member 24
interconnects rear ends of the section 23 and the support beam 25. A front frame
member 27 interconnects front ends of the section 23 and the support beam 25.
[0015]       Transverse slide support beams 21 interconnect the side section 23 and
the slide support beam 25.
[0016]       The cabin assembly 10 includes a slide-out sub-assembly 26 that is
displaceable, sideways with respect to the base frame 16, between expanded and

                                             3
retracted positions, as indicated by the arrow 13 in figure 2. Figure 2 shows the
expanded position, while figure 4 shows the retracted position.
[0017]       The sub-assembly 26 includes a support structure in the form of a
support frame 28 that is positioned above the base frame 16 to overlap the base
frame 16 when retracted. The support frame 28 is configured for supporting an
expanding portion of the cabin assembly 10. A storage assembly 30 depends from
the support frame 28 and is accessible externally of the cabin assembly 10.
[0018]       A displacement mechanism interconnects the base assembly 12 and the
sub-assembly 26 to facilitate relative displacement of the sub-assembly 26 and the
base assembly 12 between the expanded and retracted positions, such that the
storage assembly 30 is displaced together with the sub-assembly 26 to be accessible
when the sub-assembly 26 is in the expanded position.
[0019]       The displacement mechanism includes two roller assemblies 32 mounted
on each slide support beam 21 to depend from the beams 21. Elongate runners 34
engage the roller assemblies 32 on respective beams 21 and extend between the
base frame 16 and the chassis 14. The bearers 22 have openings 36 that
accommodate the runners 34.
[0020]       Each runner 34 extends from the external side 38 of the support frame 28
to a position at or near the chassis beam 18.1 when the support frame 28 is in the
expanded position. An external end of each runner 34 is connected to the support
frame 28 with a runner support 40 that depends from the support frame 28.
[0021]       Each two roller assemblies 32 on respective beams 21 include an outer
roller assembly 32.1 that is positioned underneath the support beam 25, at an end of
the slide support beam 21, and an inner roller assembly 32.2 that is positioned on an
inner side of the chassis beam 18.1.
[0022]       Each slide support beam 21 includes two spaced support members 44.
Each roller assembly 32 includes a hanger 46 connected between associated
support members 44 and depending from the support members 44. Each hanger 46
includes two spaced hanger plates 48 that are fastened to respective, opposed inner
surfaces 60 of the members 44.
[0023]       Each roller assembly 32 included two opposed rollers, for example, upper
and lower rollers 50.1, 50.2, respectively, that are rotatably mounted between the
plates 48. The runners 34 are each received between the upper and lower rollers

                                             4
50.1, 50.2 of respective outer and inner roller assemblies 32.1, 32.2. The rollers 50
and the runners 34 are shaped so that the runners 34 nest between the rollers 50
and lateral movement of the runners 34 is inhibited.
[0024]       Each roller 50 has a radially recessed contact surface 52 (figures 5 and
6). For example, each roller 50 has a generally V-shaped radial profile. Thus, the
rollers 50 of each assembly 32 define an operative zone 53 that is at least partially
enclosed.
[0025]       Each runner 34 has a generally square cross-section. Each runner 34 is
also secured to the associated runner support 40 such that cross-sectional vertices
55 of the runners 34 correspond with the contact surfaces 52 of the rollers 50. Thus,
the vertices 55 can be operatively vertically aligned.
[0026]       Each runner support 40 is shaped to nest between the hanger plates 48
of respective outer roller assemblies 32.1 when the assembly 26 is retracted. The
hanger plates 48 of the outer roller assemblies 32.1 extend into gaps or apertures 49
in the slide out support beam 25. Cover or link plates 51 are secured between the
hanger plates 48 to cover the roller assemblies 32.
[0027]       Any number of runners 34 can be provided depending on the length of
the slide-out sub-assembly 26.
[0028]       The storage assembly 30 includes a storage frame 56. The storage frame
56 includes a series of front sections 58 that depend from the external side 38 of the
support frame 28. The runner supports 40 extend inwardly from the front sections 58.
The front sections 58 are positioned to abut the lower roller 50.2 when the sub
assembly is retracted.
[0029]       The storage frame 56 also includes a rear support strut 62 that depends
from each runner 34 between the slide out support beam 25 and the chassis beam
 18.1. The support strut 62 abuts the lower roller 50.2 when the sub-assembly 26 is
extracted. The support strut 62 is shaped to nest with the roller 50.2. It will thus be
appreciated that the roller 50.2 serves as a stop against over-extraction of the sub
assembly 26.
[0030]       A bottom support frame 64 is connected to lower ends of the front
sections 58 and the rear support struts 62. The bottom support frame 64 is
configured to support storage bins 66.

                                             5
[0031]      The above embodiment describes a sub-assembly that is displaced
sideways with respect to the chassis 14. It is envisaged that the above description
could be equally applicable to a longitudinally displaceable sub-assembly with some
minor, workshop variations.
[0032]      Instead of the roller assemblies, it is envisaged that other forms of
displacement mechanisms could be used. For example, linear bearing or slide
mechanisms could be used. An expandable or retractable linkage assembly could
also be used.
[0033]      The appended claims are to be considered as incorporated into the
above description.
[0034]      Words indicating direction or orientation, such as "front", "rear", "back",
etc, are used for convenience. The inventor(s) envisages that various embodiments
can be used in a non-operative configuration, such as when presented for sale. Thus,
such words are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.
[0035]      It is to be understood that the terminology employed above is for the
purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The described
embodiments are intended to be illustrative of the invention, without limiting the
scope thereof. The invention is capable of being practised with various modifications
and additions as will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
