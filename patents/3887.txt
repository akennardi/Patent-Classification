Description of the Background
         The mucosal epithelial cells at the interface between the environment and the body
have evolved a number of "innate defenses", i.e., protective mechanisms. A principal
function of such innate defense is to cleanse these surfaces from microorganisms, particles
and other foreign material. This process requires the presence of a layer of liquid to propel
these microorganisms, particles and other foreign material away from the body to avoid
colonization of microorganisms and/or tissue damage. Typically, the quantity of the liquid
layer on a mucosal surface reflects the balance between epithelial liquid secretion, often
reflecting anion (Cl~ and/or HC0 3_) secretion coupled with water (and a cation counter-ion),

  WO 2013/181232                                                            PCT/US2013/043080
 and epithelial liquid absorption, often reflecting Na+ absorption, coupled with water and
 counter anion (Cl- and/or HC0 3 ). Many diseases of mucosal surfaces are caused by too little
 protective liquid on those mucosal surfaces created by an imbalance between secretion (too
 little) and absorption (relatively too much). The critical salt transport processes that
 characterize a number of mucosal dysfunctions resides in the epithelial layer of the mucosal
 surface.
          Chronic dry eye disease, also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is one of the most
 frequently diagnosed ocular diseases, affecting more than 5 million people in the United
 States alone. Dry eye is characterized by inadequate aqueous tear fluid on the eyes, resulting
 in painful irritation, inflammation on the ocular surface, and impaired vision, and is caused
 by failure of lacrimal glands to secrete liquid in the face of continued Na* dependent liquid
 absorption on conjunctival surfaces. Dry eye is a multi-factorial disease, resulting from a
 common etiology of insufficient tear film, causing ocular surface damage and symptoms of
 ocular discomfort.
          The few current therapies available, which include both immunosuppressive agents
 and over-the-counter tear replacements, are not sufficiently efficacious for many users or
only provide transient relief from dry eye symptoms. The dry eye market is dominated by
over-the-counter (OTC) tear replacements or artificial tears, estimated to be used by ~80% of
dry eye patients . Artificial tears provide immediate symptomatic relief from the sensation of
ocular burning and irritation by adding liquid to the ocular surface. Yet, the benefits from
artificial tears are short-lived as the fluid drops are rapidly cleared from the ocular surface,
providing, at most, palliative relief and requiring frequent application throughout the day.
          While individuals with dry eye may not exhibit overt ocular inflammation such as red,
inflamed eyes, chronic ocular inflammation is now well recognized as a significant factor
perpetuating the chronic cycle of dry eye. The one approved prescription drug for the
treatment of chronic dry eye is Restasis@ (0.05% Cyclosporine A emulsion, Allergan), which
is marketed to increase tear output "in patients whose tear production is presumed to be
suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca." In a six
month, Phase 3 pivotal trial in subjects with dry eye, Restasis statistically increased tear
volume (assessed by Schirmer wetting) in 15% of the treated individuals, compared to 5% on
vehicle. While the mechanism of Restasis is not fully understood, it is speculated that the
inhibition of chronic ocular inflammation may, over time, restore corneal sensitivity and
improve reflex tearing. However, Restasis has a low responder rate, a 3 month delay for full
therapeutic benefit, and side effects, such as burning on application.
                                                2

  WO 2013/181232                                                            PCT/US2013/043080
         Therefore, the development of novel hydrating agents to treat dry eye would be of
 tremendous benefit to the therapeutic milieu. The volume of tear film on the ocular surface
represents a balance between tear fluid output versus fluid loss via drainage, evaporation, or
 epithelial absorption. Similar to other epithelial tissues, the epithelium of the conjunctiva and
 cornea are capable of regulating the hydration status of the mucosal surface through active
 salt and water transport.
         One approach to replenish the protective liquid layer on mucosal surfaces is to "re
balance" the system by blocking Na* channel and liquid absorption. The epithelial protein
that mediates the rate-limiting step of Na* and liquid absorption is the epithelial Na* channel
(ENaC) and is a key regulator of sodium (and water) absorption in numerous tissues,
including the eye. ENaC is expressed on the apical surface of the corneal and conjunctival
epithelia in rodents, larger mammals, and man where it functions as a critical pathway for
sodium (and water) absorption (Krueger B, Schlatzer-Schrehardt U, Haerteis S, Zenkel M,
Chankiewitz VE, Amann KU, Kruse FE, Korbmacher C. Four subunits (apy5) of the
epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) are expressed in the human eye in various locations.

         In a series of in vivo bioelectric studies, Levin et al. (Levin MH, Kim JK, Hu J,
Verkman
AS. Potential difference measurements of ocular surface Na+ absorption analyzed using an
electrokinetic model. Invest Opthalmol Vis Sci. 2006; 47(l):306-16) confirmed ENaC
mediated sodium transport is a substantial contributor to the ocular surface electrical potential
difference    Furthermore, the topical addition of the ENaC blocker amiloride produced an
approximate doubling of tear volume that remained elevated for >60 minutes post
administration in rats (Yu D, Thelin WR, Rogers TD, Stutts MJ, Randell SH, Grubb BR,
Boucher RC. Regionaldifferences in rat conjunctival ion transport activities. Am J Physiol
Cell Physiol. 2012; 303(7):C767-80.) and rabbits (Hara S, Hazama A, Miyake M, Kojima T,

Drops on Tear Quantity in Rabbits. Molecular Vision 2010; 16:2279-2285).
         Taken together, these data provide an important proof-of-concept that the inhibition of
ENaC will increase tear volume. The inhibition of ENaC in the eye is predicted to preserve
lacrimal secretions and maintain hydration on the ocular surface. Because ENaC is positioned
on the apical surface of the epithelium, i.e. the mucosal surface-environmental interface, to
inhibit ENaC mediated Na* and liquid absorption, an ENaC blocker of the amiloride class
(which blocks from the extracellular domain of ENaC) must be delivered to the mucosal

  WO 2013/181232                                                             PCT/US2013/043080
 surface and, importantly, be maintained at this site, to achieve therapeutic utility. The present
invention describes diseases characterized by too little liquid on mucosal surfaces and
"topical" sodium channel blockers designed to exhibit the increased potency, reduced
mucosal absorption, and slow dissociation ("unbinding" or detachment) from ENaC required
for therapy of these diseases.
         The use of ENaC blockers has been reported for a variety of diseases which are
ameliorated by increased mucosal hydration. In particular, the use of ENaC blockers in the
treatment of respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis (CB), cystic fibrosis (CF), and
COPD, which reflect the body's failure to clear mucus normally from the lungs and ultimately
result in chronic airway infection, has been reported.          See, Evidence for airway surface
dehydration as the initiating event in CF airway disease, R. C. Boucher, Journal of Internal
Medicine, Vol. 261, Issue 1, January 2007, pages 5-16; and Cystic fibrosis: a disease of
vulnerability to airway surface dehydration, R.C. Boucher, Trends in Molecular Medicine,
Vol. 13, Issue 6, June 2007, pages 231-240.
        Data indicate that the initiating problem in both chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis
is the failure to clear mucus from airway surfaces. The failure to clear mucus reflects an
imbalance in the quantities of mucus as airway surface liquid (ASL) on airway surfaces. This
imbalance results in a relative reduction in ASL which leads to mucus concentration,
reduction in the lubricant activity of the periciliary liquid (PCL), mucus adherence to the
airway surface, and failure to clear mucus via ciliary activity to the mouth. The reduction in
mucus clearance leads to chronic bacterial colonization of mucus adherent to airway surfaces.
The chronic retention of bacteria, inability of local antimicrobial substances to kill mucus
entrapped bacteria on a chronic basis, and the consequent chronic inflammatory response to
this type of surface infection, are manifest in chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis.
        Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases are characterized by dehydration of airway
surfaces and the retention of mucous secretions in the lungs. Examples of such diseases
include cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and primary or secondary ciliary dyskinesia. Such
diseases affect approximately 15 million patients in the United States, and are the sixth
leading cause of death. Other airway or pulmonary diseases characterized by the
accumulation of retained mucous secretions include sinusitis (an inflammation of the
paranasal sinuses associated with upper respiratory infection) and pneumonia.
        Chronic bronchitis (CB), including the most common lethal genetic form of chronic
bronchitis, cystic fibrosis (CF), are diseases that reflect the body's failure to clear mucus
normally from the lungs, which ultimately produces chronic airways infection. In the normal
                                               4

  WO 2013/181232                                                             PCT/US2013/043080
 lung, the primary defense against chronic intrapulmonary airways infection (chronic
bronchitis) is mediated by the continuous clearance of mucus from bronchial airway surfaces.
This function in health effectively removes from the lung potentially noxious toxins and
pathogens. Recent data indicate that the initiating problem, i.e., the "basic defect," in both
CB and CF is the failure to clear mucus from airway surfaces. The failure to clear mucus
reflects an imbalance between the amount of liquid and mucin on airway surfaces. This
"airway surface liquid" (ASL) is primarily composed of salt and water in proportions similar
to plasma (i.e., isotonic). Mucin macromolecules organize into a well-defined "mucus layer"
which normally traps inhaled bacteria and is transported out of the lung via the actions of
cilia which beat in a watery, low viscosity solution termed the "periciliary liquid" (PCL). In
the disease state, there is an imbalance in the quantities of mucus as ASL on airway surfaces.
This results in a relative reduction in ASL which leads to mucus concentration, reduction in
the lubricant activity of the PCL, and a failure to clear mucus via ciliary activity to the mouth.
The reduction in mechanical clearance of mucus from the lung leads to chronic bacterial
colonization of mucus adherent to airway surfaces. It is the chronic retention of bacteria, the
failure of local antimicrobial substances to kill mucus-entrapped bacteria on a chronic basis,
and the consequent chronic inflammatory responses of the body to this type of surface
infection, that lead to the syndromes of CB and CF.
         The current afflicted population in the U.S. is 12,000,000 patients with the acquired
(primarily from cigarette smoke exposure) form of chronic bronchitis and approximately
30,000 patients with the genetic form, cystic fibrosis. Approximately equal numbers of both
populations are present in Europe. In Asia, there is little CF but the incidence of CB is high
and, like the rest of the world, is increasing.
         There is currently a large, unmet medical need for products that specifically treat CB
and CF at the level of the basic defect that cause these diseases. The current therapies for
chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis focus on treating the symptoms and/or the late effects of
these diseases. Thus, for chronic bronchitis,     p-agonists, inhaled steroids, anti-cholinergic
agents, and oral theophyllines and phosphodiesterase inhibitors are all in development.
However, none of these drugs treat effectively the fundamental problem of the failure to clear
mucus from the lung. Similarly, in cystic fibrosis, the same spectrum of pharmacologic
agents is used. These strategies have been complemented by more recent strategies designed
to clear the CF lung of the DNA ("Pulmozyme"; Genentech) that has been deposited in the
lung by neutrophils that have futilely attempted to kill the bacteria that grow in adherent
mucus masses and through the use of inhaled antibiotics ("TOBI") designed to augment the
                                                5

  WO 2013/181232                                                                PCT/US2013/043080
 lungs' own killing mechanisms to rid the adherent mucus plaques of bacteria. A general
 principle of the body is that if the initiating lesion is not treated, in this case mucus
 retention/obstruction, bacterial infections became chronic and increasingly refractory to
 antimicrobial therapy. Thus, a major unmet therapeutic need for both CB and CF lung
 diseases is an effective means of re-hydrating airway mucus (i.e., restoring/expanding the
 volume of the ASL) and promoting its clearance, with bacteria, from the lung.
         R.C. Boucher, in U.S. 6,264,975, describes the use of pyrazinoylguanidine sodium
 channel blockers for hydrating mucosal surfaces. These compounds, typified by the well
 known diuretics amiloride, benzamil, and phenamil, are effective. However, these
 compounds suffer from the significant disadvantage that they are (1) relatively impotent,
 which is important because the mass of drug that can be inhaled by the lung is limited; (2)
rapidly absorbed, which limits the half-life of the drug on the mucosal surface; and (3) are
 freely dissociable from ENaC. The sum of these disadvantages embodied in these well
known diurectics produces compounds with insufficient potency and/or effective half-life on
mucosal surfaces to have therapeutic benefit for hydrating mucosal surfaces.
         R. C. Boucher, in U.S. patent No. 6,926,911, suggests the use of the relatively
impotent sodium channel blockers such as amiloride, with osmolytes for the treatment of
airway disesases. This combination gives no practical advantage over either treatment alone
and is clinically not useful (see Donaldson et al, N Eng J Med2006; 353:241-250). Amiloride
was found to block the water permeability of airways and negate the potential benefit of
concurrent use of hypertonic saline and amiloride.
         U.S. patent No. 5,817,028 to Anderson describes a method for the provocation of air
passage narrowing (for evaluating susceptibility to asthma) and/or the induction of sputum in
subjects via the inhalation of mannitol. It is suggested that the same technique can be used to
induce sputum and promote mucociliary clearance. Substances suggested include sodium
chloride, potassium chloride, mannitol and dextrose.
         Clearly, what is needed are drugs that are more effective at restoring the clearance of
mucus from the lungs of patients with CB/CF. The value of these new therapies will be
reflected in improvements in the quality and duration of life for both the CF and the CB
populations.
         Other mucosal surfaces in and on the body exhibit subtle differences in the normal
physiology of the protective surface liquids on their surfaces but the pathophysiology of
disease reflects a common theme, i.e., too little protective surface liquid.          For example, in
xerostomia (dry mouth) the oral cavity is depleted of liquid due to a failure of the parotid
                                                 6

 sublingual and submandibular glands to secrete liquid despite continued Na* (ENaC)
 transport mediated liquid absorption from the oral cavity.
          In rhinosinusitis, there is an imbalance, as in CB, between mucin secretion and
 relative ASL depletion. Finally, in the gastrointestinal tract, failure to secrete Cl- (and
 liquid) in the proximal small intestine, combined with increased Na* (and liquid) absorption
 in the terminal ileum leads to the distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). In older
 patients excessive Na+ (and volume) absorption in the descending colon produces
 constipation and diverticulitis.

         There remains a need for novel sodium channel blocking compounds with enhanced

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
        As used herein, the following terms are defined as indicated.
        "A compound of the invention" means a compound of Formula I or a salt, particularly
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
        "A compound of Formula I" means a compound having the structural formula
designated herein as Formula I. Compounds of Formula I include solvates and hydrates (i.e.,
adducts of a compound of Formula I with a solvent).           In those embodiments wherein a
compound of Formula I includes one or more chiral centers, the phrase is intended to
encompass each individual        stereoisomer including optical isomers (enantiomers        and
                                             22

  WO 2013/181232                                                          PCT/US2013/043080
 diastereomers) and geometric isomers (cis-/trans-isomerism) and mixtures of stereoisomers.
 In addition, compounds of Formula I also include tautomers of the depicted formula(s).
         Throughout the description and examples, compounds are named using standard
 IUPAC naming principles, where possible, including the use of the ChemDraw Ultra 11.0
 software program for naming compounds, sold by CambridgeSoft Corp./PerkinElmer.
         In some chemical structure representations where carbon atoms do not have a
 sufficient number of attached variables depicted to produce a valence of four, the remaining
carbon substituents needed to provide a valence of four should be assumed to be hydrogen.
 Similarly, in some chemical structures where a bond is drawn without specifying the terminal
group, such bond is indicative of a methyl (Me, -CH 3) group, as is conventional in the art.
         The present invention is based on the discovery that the compounds of formula (I) are
more potent and/or absorbed less rapidly from mucosal surfaces, and/or are less reversible as
compared to known compounds.
         The present invention is also based on the discovery that the compounds of formula
(I) are more potent and/or absorbed less rapidly and/or exhibit less reversibility, as compared
to compounds such as amilorde, benzamil, and phenamil. Therefore, the compounds will
give a prolonged pharmacodynamic half-life on mucosal surfaces as compared to known
compounds.
         The present invention is also based on the discovery that certain compounds embraced
by formula (I) (1) are absorbed less rapidly from mucosal surfaces, especially ocular surfaces,
as compared to known compounds and (2) when absorbed from musosal surfaces after
administration to the mucosal surfaces, are excreated mainly non-renally in order to minimize
the chances of hyperkalemia. The present invention is also based on the discovery that
certain compounds embraced by formula (I) (1) are absorbed less rapidly from mucosal
surfaces, especially ocular surfaces, as compared to known compounds and (2) are converted
in vivo into metabolic derivitives thereof which have reduced efficacy in blocking sodium
channels as compared to the administered parent compound in order to minimize the chances
of hyperkalemia.
         The present invention is also based on the discovery that certain compounds embraced
by formula (I) (1) are absorbed less rapidly from mucosal surfaces, especially ocular surfaces,
as compared to known compounds and (2) are not converted in vivo into metabolic
derivitives thereof which have enhanced or similar efficacy in blocking sodium channels as
compared to the administered parent compound in order to minimize the chances of
hyperkalemia

         The present invention is also based on the discovery that certain compounds embraced
 by formula (I) provide methods of treatment that take advantage of the pharmacological
 properties of the compounds described above.
         In particular, the present invention is also based on the discovery that certain
 compounds embraced by formula (I) rehydrate mucosal surfaces.
         In particular, the present invention is also based on the discovery that certain
 compounds embraced by formula (I) are useful in treating dry eye and related ocular diseases.
        In the compounds represented by formula (I), X may be hydrogen, halogen,
trifluoromethyl, lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl, unsubstituted or substituted phenyl, lower
alkyl-thio, phenyl-lower alkyl-thio, lower alkyl-sulfonyl, or phenyl-lower alkyl-sulfonyl.
Halogen is preferred.
        Examples of halogen include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Chlorine and
bromine are the preferred halogens. Chlorine is particularly preferred. This description is
applicable to the term "halogen" as used throughout the present disclosure.
        As used herein, the term "lower alkyl" means an alkyl group having less than 8
carbon atoms. This range includes all specific values of carbon atoms and subranges there
between, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 carbon atoms. The term "alkyl" embraces all types of
such groups, e.g., linear, branched, and cyclic alkyl groups. This description is applicable to
the term "lower alkyl" as used throughout the present disclosure. Examples of suitable lower
alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, cyclopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, etc.
        Substituents for the phenyl group include halogens. Particularly preferred halogen
substituents are chlorine and bromine.
        Y may be hydrogen, hydroxyl, mercapto, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl-thio, halogen,
lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl, mononuclear aryl, or -N(R2 ) 2 . The alkyl moiety of the lower
alkoxy groups is the same as described above. Examples of mononuclear aryl include phenyl
groups. The phenyl group may be unsubstituted or substituted as described above. The
preferred identity of Y is -N(R 2) 2. Particularly preferred are such compounds where each R2
is hydrogen.
        RI may be hydrogen or lower alkyl. Hydrogen is preferred for R'.

          Selected substituents within the compounds of the invention are present to a recursive
degree. In this context, "recursive substituent" means that a substituent may recite another
instance of itself. Because of the recursive nature of such substituents, theoretically, a large
number of compounds may be present in any given embodiment. For example, R9 contains a
R13 substituent. R13 can contain an R10 substituent and R 10 can contain a R9 substituent. One
of ordinary skill in the art of medicinal chemistry understands that the total number of such
substituents is reasonably limited by the desired properties of the compound intended. Such

properties include, by way of example and not limitation, physical properties such as
molecular weight, solubility or log P, application properties such as activity against the
intended target, and practical properties such as ease of synthesis.
          By way of example and not limitation, R9 , R13 and R10 are recursive substituents in
certain embodiments. Typically, each of these may independently occur 20, 19, 18, 17, 16,
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0, times in a given embodiment. More
typically, each of these may independently occur 12 or fewer times in a given embodiment.
More typically yet, R9 will occur 0 to 8 times in a given embodiment, R13 will occur 0 to 6
times in a given embodiment and R10 will occur 0 to 6 times in a given embodiment. Even
more typically yet, R9 will occur 0 to 6 times in a given embodiment, R13 will occur 0 to 4
times in a given embodiment and R10 will occur 0 to 4 times in a given embodiment.
          Recursive substituents are an intended aspect of the invention. One of ordinary skill
in the art of medicinal chemistry understands the versatility of such substituents. To the
degree that recursive substituents are present in an embodiment of the invention, the total
number will be determined as set forth above.

carbocycle or aromatic heterocycle, the two OR" may form a methylenedioxy group; i.e., a
group of the formula -O-CH 2 -0-.
         In addition, one or more of the R6 groups can be one of the R5 groups which fall
within the broad definition of R6 set forth above.
         R may be hydrogen. Therefore, provided that the aromatic carbocycle or aromatic
heterocycle is substituted with R , the remaining R6 may be hydrogen. Preferably, at most, 3
of the R6 groups are other than hydrogen. More preferably, provided that the aromatic
carbocyle or aromatic heterocycle is substituted with R5 , then R6 is H.

         It is to be noted that all enantiomers, diastereomers, and racemic mixtures, tautomers,
polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds within
the scope of formula (I), formula II, or formula III are embraced by the present invention. All
mixtures of such enantiomers and diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention.
         A compound of formula I-III and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts may exist as
different polymorphs or pseudopolymorphs. As used herein, crystalline polymorphism
means the ability of a crystalline compound to exist in different crystal structures. The
crystalline polymorphism may result from differences in crystal packing (packing
polymorphism) or differences in packing between different conformers of the same molecule
(conformational polymorphism). As used herein, crystalline pseudopolymorphism means the
ability of a hydrate or solvate of a compound to exist in different crystal structures. The
pseudopolymorphs of the instant invention may exist due to differences in crystal packing
(packing pseudopolymorphism) or due to differences in pakcing between different
conformers of the same molecule (conformational pseudopolymorphism). The instant
invention comprises all polymorphs and pseudopolymorphs of the compounds of formula I
III and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
         A compound of formula I-III and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also exist
as an amorphous solid. As used herein, an amorphous solid is a solid in which there is no
long-range order of the positions of the atoms in the solid. This definition applies as well
when the crystal size is two nanometers or less. Additives, including solvents, may be used
to create the amorphous forms of the instant invention. The instant invention comprises all
amorphous forms of the compounds of formula I-III and their pharmaceutically acceptable
salts.
         The compounds of formula I-III may exist in different tautomeric forms. One skilled
in the art will recognize that amidines, amides, guanidines, ureas, thioureas, heterocycles and
the like can exist in tautomeric forms. By way of example and not by way of limitation,
compounds of formula I-III can exist in various tautomeric forms as shown below:

         "Enantiomers" refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non
superimposable mirror images of one another.
         Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker,
Ed., McGraw-HillDictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New
York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) John Wiley
& Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they
have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active
compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of
the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1, D and L, or (+) and (-) are
employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with S,
(-), or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory while a compound prefixed with R, (+),
or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical
except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be
referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric
mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate,
which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical
                                                56

  WO 2013/181232                                                             PCT/US2013/043080
 reaction or process. The terms "racemic mixture" and "racemate" refer to an equimolar
 mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.
         A single stereoisomer, e.g. an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may
 be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of
 diastereomers using optically active resolving agents ("Stereochemistry of Carbon
 Compounds," (1962) by E. L. Eliel, McGraw Hill; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J. Chromatogr.,
 113:(3) 283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated
 and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts
 with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2)
 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the
 diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the
 substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions.
         "Diastereomer" refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and
 whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different
physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities.
Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as
electrophoresis and chromatography.
         Without being limited to any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of
formula (I), formula II, or formula III function in vivo as sodium channel blockers. By
blocking epithelial sodium channels present in mucosal surfaces the compounds of formula
(I), formula II, or formula III reduce the absorption of water by the mucosal surfaces. This
effect increases the volume of protective liquids on mucosal surfaces, rebalances the system,
and thus treats disease.
         The present invention also provides methods of treatment that take advantage of the
properties of the compounds described herein as discussed above. The present invention may
be used to hydrate mucosal surfaces including ocular surfaces or surfaces of the eye, airway
surfaces, gastrointestinal surfaces, oral surfaces, genito-urethral surfaces, the inner ear and
the middle ear. The active compounds disclosed herein may be administered in an effective
amount to mucosal surfaces by any suitable means, including topically, orally, rectally,
vaginally, ocularly and dermally, etc. For example, for the treatment of constipation, the
active compounds may be administered orally or rectally to the gastrointestinal mucosal
surface. The active compound may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier

administration, etc. Excipients may be included in the formulation to enhance the solubility
of the active compounds, as desired. Thus, subjects that may be treated by the methods of the
present invention include, but are not limited to, patients afflicted with chronic dry eye,
 Sjagren's disease, dry mouth (xerostomia), vaginal dryness, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary
dyskinesia, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis chronic obstructive airway disease, artificially
ventilated patients, patients with acute pneumonia, etc.
         The present invention may be used to obtain a sputum sample from a patient by
administering the active compounds to at least one lung of a patient, and then inducing or
collecting a sputum sample from that patient. Typically, the invention will be administered to
respiratory mucosal surfaces via aerosol (liquid or dry powders) or lavage.
         Subjects that may be treated by the method of the present invention also include
patients being administered supplemental oxygen nasally (a regimen that tends to dry the
airway surfaces); patients afflicted with an allergic disease or response (e.g., an allergic
response to pollen, dust, animal hair or particles, insects or insect particles, etc.) that affects
nasal airway surfaces; patients afflicted with a bacterial infection e.g., staphylococcus
infections such as Staphylococcus aureus infections, Hemophilus influenza infections,
Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, Pseudomonas aeuriginosa infections, etc.) of the nasal
airway surfaces; patients afflicted with an inflammatory disease that affects nasal airway
surfaces; or patients afflicted with sinusitis (wherein the active agent or agents are
administered to promote drainage of congested mucous secretions in the sinuses by
administering an amount effective to promote drainage of congested fluid in the sinuses), or
combined, rhinosinusitis. The invention may be administered to rhino-sinal surfaces by
topical delivery, including aerosols and drops.
        The present invention is concerned primarily with the treatment of human subjects,
but may also be employed for the treatment of other mammalian subjects, such as dogs and
cats, for veterinary purposes.
        As discussed above, the compounds used to prepare the compositions of the present
invention may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable free base. Because the free
base of the compound is generally less soluble in aqueous solutions than the salt, free base
compositions are employed to provide more sustained release of active agent to the lungs.
An active agent present in the lungs in particulate form which has not dissolved into solution
is not available to induce a physiological response, but serves as a depot of bioavailable drug
which gradually dissolves into solution.

         Another aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a
compound of formula (I) in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (e.g., an aqueous carrier
 solution). In general, the compound of formula (I) is included in the composition in an
amount effective to inhibit the reabsorption of water by mucosal surfaces.
         Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for ophthalmic indications include solutions,
emulsions, suspensions, and sustained release forms including, but not limited to, dissolvable
inserts, plugs, or contact lenses. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not
limited to buffers (including phosphate, citrate, bicarbonate, and borate); tonicity adjusting
agents (sodium chloride, potassium chloride, Mannitol, dextrose); viscosity enhancing agents
(carboxymethyl cellulose, glycerol). Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be sterile or
preserved with agents including, but not limited to benzalkonium chloride.
         Without being limited to any particular theory, it is believed that sodium channel
blockers of the present invention block epithelial sodium channels present in mucosal
surfaces. The sodium channel blocker described herein reduces the absorption of salt and
water by the mucosal surfaces. This effect increases the volume of protective liquids on
mucosal surfaces, rebalances the system, and thus treats disease.
USES
         The compounds of the invention exhibit activity as sodium channel blockers. Without
being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of the invention may
function in vivo by blocking epithelial sodium channels present in mucosal surfaces and
thereby reduce the absorption of water by the mucosal surfaces. This effect increases the
volume of protective liquids on mucosal surfaces, and rebalances the system.
        As a consequence, the compounds of the invention are useful as medicaments,
particularly for the treatment of clinical conditions for which a sodium channel blocker may
be indicated.    Sodium channel blockers may be indicated for the treatment of conditions
which are ameliorated by increased mucosal hydration in mucosal surfaces other than
pulmonary mucosal surfaces. Examples of such conditions include dry mouth (xerostomia),
dry skin, vaginal dryness, sinusitis, rhinosinusitis, nasal dehydration, including nasal
dehydration brought on by administering dry oxygen, dry eye, Sjogren's disease, otitis media,
primary ciliary dyskinesia, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, esophagitis, constipation,
and chronic diverticulitis. The compounds of the invention can also be used for promoting
ocular or corneal hydration.

         Other  conditions that may benefit from treatment with a sodium channel blocker
 include pulmonary conditions, such as diseases associated with reversible or irreversible
 airway obstruction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),            including acute
 exacerbations of COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis (including bronchiectasis due to conditions
 other than cystic fibrosis), acute bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, post-viral cough, cystic
 fibrosis, emphysema, pneumonia, panbronchiolitis, and transplant-associated bronchiolitis,
 including lung- and bone marrow-transplant associated bronchiolitis, in a human in need
thereof. The compounds of the invention may also be useful for treating ventilator-associated
tracheobronchitis and/or preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia in ventilated patients.
The present invention comprises methods for treating each of these conditions in a mammal
in need thereof, preferably in a human in need thereof, each method comprising
administering to said mammal a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of the
present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Also provided are (a) a
method for reducing exacerbations of COPD in a mammal in need thereof; (b) a method for
reducing exacerbations of CF in a mammal in need thereof; (c) a method of improving lung
function (FEVI) in a mammal in need thereof, (d) a method of improving lung function
(FEVI) in a mammal experiencing COPD, (e) a method of improving lung function (FEVi)
in a mammal experiencing CF, (f) a method of reducing airway infections in a mammal in
need thereof.
         Also provided is a method of stimulating, enhancing or improving mucociliary
clearance in a mammal, the method comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a
pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof.   Mucociliary clearance will be understood to include the natural
mucociliary actions involved in the transfer or clearance of mucus in the airways, including
the self-clearing mechanisms of the bronchi.        Therefore, also provided is a method of
improving mucus clearance in the airways of a mammal in need thereof.
         The compounds of the present invention may also be useful in methods for obtaining
a sputum sample from a human.          The method may be carried out by administering a
compound of the invention to at least one lung of the patient, and then inducing and
collecting a sputum sample from that human.
         Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method for the treatment
of a condition in a mammal, such as a human, for which a sodium channel blocker is
indicated.

         The terms "effective amount", "pharmaceutically effective amount", "effective dose",
and "pharmaceutically effective dose" as used herein, refer to an amount of compound of the
invention which is sufficient in the subject to which it is administered, to elicit the biological
or medical response of a cell culture, tissue, system, or mammal (including human) that is
being sought, for instance by a researcher or clinician. The term also includes within its
scope, amounts effective to enhance normal physiological function. In one embodiment, the
effective amount is the amount needed to provide a desired level of drug in the secretions and
tissues of the airways and lungs, or alternatively, in the bloodstream of a subject to be treated
to give an anticipated physiological response or desired biological effect when such a
composition is administered by inhalation. For example an effective amount of a compound
of the invention for the treatment of a condition for which a sodium channel blocker is
indicated is sufficient in the subject to which it is administered to treat the particular

 condition. In one embodiment an effective amount is an amount of a compound of the
 invention which is sufficient for the treatment of COPD or cystic fibrosis in a human.
         The precise effective amount of the compounds of the invention will depend on a
 number of factors including but not limited to the species, age and weight of the subject being
 treated, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the bioavailability, potency,
 and other properties of the specific compound being administered, the nature of the
 formulation, the route of administration, and the delivery device, and will ultimately be at the
 discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian.        Further guidance with respect to
 appropriate dose may be found in considering conventional dosing of other sodium channel
 blockers, such as amiloride, with due consideration also being given to any differences in
potency between amiloride and the compounds of the present invention.
         A pharmaceutically effective dose administered topically to the ocular surfaces of a
 subject (e.g., by applied as a topical eye drop) of a compound of the invention for treatment
of a 70 kg human may be in the range of from about 0.01 to about 1000 pg.
         A pharmaceutically effective dose administered topically to the airway surfaces of a
subject (e.g., by inhalation) of a compound of the invention for treatment of a 70 kg human
may be in the range of from about           0.1 to about 1000 pg. Typically, the daily dose
administered topically to the airway surfaces will be an amount sufficient to achieve
dissolved concentration of active agent on the airway surfaces of from about 10~', 10~', or 10~7
to about 10- 4 , 10-1, 102, or 10~1 Moles/liter, more preferably from about 10~' to about 10~4
Moles/liter.    The selection of the specific dose for a patient will be determined by the
attendant physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill in the art based upon a number
of factors including those noted above.           In one particular embodiment the dose of a
compound of the invention for the treatment of a 70 kg human will be in the range of from
about 0.1 to about 1,000 pg. In one embodiment, the dose of a compound of the invention
for the treatment of a 70 kg human will be in the range of from about 0.5 to about 50 pg. In
another embodiment, the pharmaceutically effective dose will be from about 1 to about 10
pg. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutically effective dose will be from about 10 pg to
about 40 pg. In a further embodiment, the pharmaceutically effective dose will be from
about 15 pg to about 30 pg.          The foregoing suggested doses may be adjusted using
conventional dose calculations if the compound is administered via a different route.
Determination of an appropriate dose for administration by other routes is within the skill of
those in the art in light of the foregoing description and the general knowledge in the art.
These doses and solutions will range from about 0.00001% to 10% on a weight per volume

(w/v) basis.
        Delivery of an effective amount of a compound of the invention may entail delivery
of a single dosage form or multiple unit doses which may be delivered contemporaneously or
separate in time over a designated period, such as 24 hours. A dose of a compound of the
invention (alone or in the form of a composition comprising the same) may be administered
from one to ten times per day. Typically, a compound of the invention (alone or in the form
of a composition comprising the same) will be administered four, three, two, or once per day
(24 hours).
        The compounds of formula (I) of the present invention are also useful for treating
airborne infections.    Examples of airborne infections include, for example, RSV.          The
compounds of formula (I) of the present invention are also useful for treating an anthrax
infection. The present invention relates to the use of the compounds of formula (I) of the
present invention for prophylactic, post-exposure prophylactic, preventive or therapeutic
treatment against diseases or conditions caused by pathogens. In a preferred embodiment, the
present invention relates to the use of the compounds of formula (I) for prophylactic, post
exposure prophylactic, preventive or therapeutic treatment against diseases or conditions
caused by pathogens which may be used in bioterrorism.
        In recent years, a variety of research programs and biodefense measures have been put
into place to deal with concerns about the use of biological agents in acts of terrorism. These
measures are intended to address concerns            regarding bioterrorism     or the use of
microorganisms or biological toxins to kill people, spread fear, and disrupt society. For
example, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has developed a
Strategic Plan for Biodefense Research which outlines plans for addressing research needs in
the broad area of bioterrorism and emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. According
to the plan, the deliberate exposure of the civilian population of the United States to Bacillus
anthracis spores revealed a gap in the nation's overall preparedness against bioterrorism.
Moreover, the report details that these attacks uncovered an unmet need for tests to rapidly
diagnose, vaccines and immunotherapies to prevent, and drugs and biologics to cure disease
caused by agents of bioterrorism.
        Much of the focus of the various research efforts has been directed to studying the
biology of the pathogens identified as potentially dangerous as bioterrorism agents, studying
the host response against such agents, developing vaccines against infectious diseases,
evaluating the therapeutics currently available and under investigation against such agents,
and developing diagnostics to identify signs and symptoms of threatening agents.           Such
                                             66

 WO 2013/181232                                                        PCT/US2013/043080
efforts are laudable but, given the large number of pathogens which have been identified as
potentially available for bioterrorism, these efforts have not yet been able to provide
satisfactory responses for all possible bioterrorism threats.     Additionally, many of the
pathogens identified as potentially dangerous as agents of bioterrorism do not provide
adequate economic incentives for the development of therapeutic or preventive measures by
industry. Moreover, even if preventive measures such as vaccines were available for each
pathogen which may be used in bioterrorism, the cost of administering all such vaccines to
the general population is prohibitive.
        Until convenient and effective treatments are available against every bioterrorism
threat, there exists a strong need for preventative, prophylactic or therapeutic treatments
which can prevent or reduce the risk of infection from pathogenic agents.
        The present invention provides such methods of prophylactic treatment.          In one
aspect, a prophylactic      treatment method is provided comprising           administering   a
prophylactically effective amount of the compounds of formula (I) to an individual in need of
prophylactic treatment against infection from one or more airborne pathogens. A particular
example of an airborne pathogen is anthrax.
        In another aspect, a prophylactic treatment method is provided for reducing the risk of
infection from an airborne pathogen which can cause a disease in a human, said method
comprising administering an effective amount of the compounds of formula (I) to the lungs of
the human who may be at risk of infection from the airborne pathogen but is asymptomatic
for the disease, wherein the effective amount of a sodium channel blocker and osmolye are
sufficient to reduce the risk of infection in the human. A particular example of an airborne
pathogen is anthrax.
        In another aspect, a post-exposure prophylactic treatment or therapeutic treatment
method is provided for treating infection from an airborne pathogen comprising
administering an effective amount of the compounds of formula (I) to the lungs of an
individual in need of such treatment against infection from an airborne pathogen. The
pathogens which may be protected against by the prophylactic post exposure, rescue and
therapeutic treatment methods of the invention include any pathogens which may enter the
body through the mouth, nose or nasal airways, thus proceeding into the lungs. Typically, the
pathogens will be airborne pathogens, either naturally occurring or by aerosolization. The
pathogens may be naturally occurring or may have been introduced into the environment
intentionally after aerosolization or other method of introducing the pathogens into the
environment. Many pathogens which are not naturally transmitted in the air have been or

 may be aerosolized for use in bioterrorism.      The pathogens for which the treatment of the
 invention may be useful includes, but is not limited to, category A, B and C priority
 pathogens as set forth by the NIAID.        These categories correspond generally to the lists
 compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As set up by the CDC,
 Category A agents are those that can be easily disseminated or transmitted person-to-person,
 cause high mortality, with potential for major public health impact. Category B agents are
 next in priority and include those that are moderately easy to disseminate and cause moderate
 morbidity and low mortality.      Category C consists of emerging pathogens that could be
 engineered for mass dissemination in the future because of their availability, ease of
 production and dissemination and potential for high morbidity and mortality.          Particular
 examples of these pathogens are anthrax and plague. Additional pathogens which may be
protected against or the infection risk therefrom reduced include influenza viruses,
rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses, and the like. A further pathogen
which may be protected against is the coronavirus which is believed to cause severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS).
         The present invention also relates to the use of sodium channel blockers of Formula I,
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for preventing, mitigating, and/or treating
deterministic health effects to the respiratory tract caused by exposure to radiological
materials, particularly respirable aerosols containing radionuclides from nuclear attacks, such
as detonation of radiological dispersal devices (RDD), or accidents, such as nuclear power
plant disasters.    As such, provided herein is a method for preventing, mitigating, and/or
treating deterministic health effects to the respiratory tract and/or other bodily organs caused
by respirable aerosols containing radionuclides in a recipient in need thereof, including in a
human in need thereof , said method comprising administering to said human an effective
amount of a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
         A major concern associated with consequence management planning for exposures of
members of the public to respirable aerosols containing radionuclides from nuclear attacks,
such as detonation of radiological dispersal devices (RDD), or accidents, such as nuclear
power plant disasters is how to prevent, mitigate or treat potential deterministic health effects
to the respiratory tract, primarily the lung. It is necessary to have drugs, techniques and
procedures, and trained personnel prepared to manage and treat such highly internally
contaminated individuals.
        Research has been conducted to determine ways in which to prevent, mitigate or treat
potential damage to the respiratory tract and various organs in the body that is caused by
                                              68

  WO 2013/181232                                                         PCT/US2013/043080
 internally deposited radionuclides. To date, most of the research attention has focused on
 strategies designed to mitigate health effects from internally deposited radionuclides by
 accelerating their excretion or removal. These strategies have focused on soluble chemical
 forms that are capable of reaching the blood stream and are deposited at remote systemic sites
 specific to a given radioelement. Such approaches will not work in cases where the deposited
 radionuclide is in relatively insoluble form. Studies have shown that many, if not most of the
 physicochemical forms of dispersed radionuclides from RDDs, will be in relatively insoluble
 form.
         The only method known to effectively reduce the radiation dose to the lungs from
 inhaled insoluble radioactive aerosols is bronchoalveolar lavage or BAL. This technique,
 which was adapted from that already in use for the treatment of patients with alveolar
proteinosis, has been shown to be a safe, repeatable procedure, even when performed over an
extended period of time. Although there are variations in procedure, the basic method for
BAL is to anaesthetize the subject, followed by the slow introduction of isotonic saline into a
single lobe of the lung until the function residual capacity is reached. Additional volumes are
then added and drained by gravity.
The results of studies using BAL on animals indicate that about 40% of the deep lung content
can be removed by a reasonable sequence of BALs. In some studies, there was considerable
variability among animals in the amount of radionuclide recovered. The reasons for the
variability are currently not understood.
         Further, based on a study on animals, it is believed that a significant dose reduction
from BAL therapy results in mitigation of health effects due to inhalation of insoluble
radionuclides. In the study, adult dogs inhaled insoluble 144 Ce-FAP particles. Two groups of
dogs were given lung contents of 144Ce known to cause radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary
fibrosis (about 2 MBq/kg body mass), with one group being treated with 10 unilateral lavages
between 2 and 56 days after exposure, the other untreated. A third group was exposed at a
level of 144Ce comparable to that seen in the BAL-treated group after treatment (about 1
MBq/kg), but these animals were untreated. All animals were allowed to live their lifespans,
which extended to 16 years. Because there is variability in initial lung content of 144Ce
among the dogs in each group, the dose rates and cumulative doses for each group overlap.
Nevertheless, the effect of BAL in reducing the risk from pneumonitis/fibrosis was evident
from the survival curves . In the untreated dogs with lung contents of 1.5-2.5 MBq/kg, the
mean survival time was 370 ± 65 d. For the treated dogs, the mean survival was 1270      + 240
d, which was statistically significantly different.    The third group, which received lung
                                              69

  WO 2013/181232                                                            PCT/US2013/043080
               14 4
 contents of       Ce of 0.6-1.4 MBq had a mean survival time of 1800 ± 230, which was not
 statistically different from the treated group. Equally important to the increased survival, the
 dogs    in the     high-dose    untreated  group    died from    deterministic   effects to lung
 (pneumonitis/fibrosis) while the treated dogs did not. Instead, the treated dogs, like the dogs
 in the low-dose untreated group, mostly had lung tumors (hemangiosarcoma or carcinoma).
 Therefore, the reduction in dose resulting from BAL treatment appears to have produced
 biological effects in lung that were predictable based on the radiation doses that the lungs
received.
          Based on these results, it is believed that decreasing the residual radiological dose
further by any method or combination of methods for enhancing the clearance of particles
from the lung would further decrease the probability of health effects to lung. However,
BAL is a procedure that has many drawbacks. BAL is a highly invasive procedure that must
be performed at specialized medical centers by trained pulmonologists.            As such, a BAL
procedure is expensive. Given the drawbacks of BAL, it is not a treatment option that would
be readily and immediately available to persons in need of accelerated removal of radioactive
particles, for example, in the event of a nuclear attack. In the event of a nuclear attack or a
nuclear accident, immediate and relatively easily administered treatment for persons who
have been exposed or who are at risk of being exposed is needed. Sodium channel blockers
administered as an inhalation aerosol have been shown to restore hydration of airway
surfaces. Such hydration of airway surfaces aids in clearing accumulated mucus secretions
and associated particulate matter from the lung.          As such, without being bound by any
particular theory, it is believed that sodium channel blockers can be used to accelerate the
removal of radioactive particles from airway passages.
          As discussed above, the greatest risk to the lungs following a radiological attack, such
as a dirty bomb, results from the inhalation and retention of insoluble radioactive particles.
As a result of radioactive particle retention, the cumulative exposure to the lung is
significantly     increased,   ultimately  resulting   in pulmonary     fibrosis/pneumonitis   and
potentially death.     Insoluble particles cannot be systemically cleared by chelating agents
because these particles are not in solution. To date, the physical removal of particulate matter
through BAL is the only therapeutic regimen shown to be effective at mitigating radiation
induced lung disease.        As discussed above, BAL is not a realistic treatment solution for
reducing the effects of radioactive particles that have been inhaled into the body. As such, it
is desirable to provide a therapeutic regimen that effectively aids in clearing radioactive
particles from airway passages and that, unlike BAL, is relatively simple to administer and

 scalable in a large-scale radiation exposure scenario. In addition, it is also desirable that the
therapeutic regimen be readily available to a number of people in a relatively short period of
time.
         In an aspect of the present invention, a method for preventing, mitigating, and/or
treating deterministic health effects to the respiratory tract and/or other bodily organs caused
by respirable aerosols containing radionuclides comprises administering an effective amount
of a sodium channel blocker of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to an
individual in need. In a feature of this aspect, the sodium channel blocker is administered in
conjunction with an osmolyte. With further regard to this feature, the osmolyte is hypertonic
saline (HS).      In a further feature, the sodium channel blocker and the osmolyte are
administered in conjunction with an ion transport modulator. With further regard to this
feature, the ion transport modulator may be selected from the group consisting of -agonists,
CFTR potentiators, purinergic receptor agonists, lubiprostones, and protease inhibitors. In
another feature of this aspect, the radionuclides are selected from the group consisting of
Colbalt-60, Cesium-137, Iridium-192, Radium-226, Phospohrus-32, Strontium-89 and 90,
Iodine-125, Thallium-201, Lead-210, Thorium-234, Uranium-238, Plutonium, Cobalt-58,
Chromium-51, Americium, and Curium. In a further feature, the radionuclides are from a
radioactive disposal device.        In yet another feature, the sodium channel blocker or
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in an aerosol suspension of
respirable particles which the individual inhales. In an additional feature, the sodium channel
blocker or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered post-exposure to the
radionuclides.

          The pharmaceutically      acceptable excipient(s),   diluent(s) or carrier(s) must be
acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and
not deleterious to the recipient thereof.          Generally, the pharmaceutically acceptable

toxic" meaning that it/they is/are deemed safe for consumption in the amount delivered in the
formulation and "inert" meaning that it/they does/do not appreciable react with or result in an
undesired effect on the therapeutic activity of the active ingredient(s).         Pharmaceutically
acceptable excipients, diluents and carriers are conventional in the art and may be selected

2005). Preferably, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s), diluent(s) or carrier(s) are
Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) according to the FDA.
         Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention include those suitable for oral
administration; parenteral administration, including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular,
intravenous and intraarticular; topical administration, including topical administration to the
skin, eyes, ears, etc; vaginal or rectal administration; and administration to the respiratory
tract, including the nasal cavities and sinuses, oral and extrathoracic airways, and the lungs,
including by use of aerosols which may be delivered by means of various types of dry powder
inhalers, pressurized metered dose inhalers, softmist inhalers, nebulizers, or insufflators. The
most suitable route of administration may depend upon, several factors including the patient
and the condition or disorder being treated.
         The formulations may be presented in unit dosage form or in bulk form as for example
in the case of formulations to be metered by an inhaler and may be prepared by any of the
methods well known in the art of pharmacy.           Generally, the methods include the step of
bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, diluent or excipient and
optionally one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by
uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with one or more
liquid carriers, diluents or excipients or finely divided solid carriers, diluents or excipients, or
both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.
         Pharmaceutical compositions for topical administration may be formulated as
ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols or
oils.   Compositions designed for the treatment of the eyes or other external tissues, for
example the mouth and skin, may be applied as a topical ointment, cream or eye drops.
When formulated as an ointment, the active ingredient may be employed with either a
paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be
formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base.
         Other compositions designed for topical administration to the eyes or ears include eye
drops and ear drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable
carrier, such as for example an aqueous solvent, including saline.
         Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such
as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active
ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non
                                              73

 aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The
 active ingredient may also be presented as a sachet, bolus, electuary or paste.
         A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more
 accessory ingredients.    Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable
 machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally
 mixed with a binders, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded
tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound
moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and
may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein.
         Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or
sublingually, include lozenges, comprising the active ingredient in a flavored base such as
sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a base such
as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.
         Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile
injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which
render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non
aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The
formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed
ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried lyophilizedd) condition requiring only
the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example saline or water-for-injection, immediately
prior to use.    Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from
sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.
         Oral fluids such as solutions, syrups and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so
that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Syrups can be
prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while
elixirs are prepared through the use of a pharmaceutically acceptable alcoholic vehicle.
Suspensions can be formulated by dispersing the active ingredient in a pharmaceutically
acceptable vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and
polyoxy ethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or
natural sweeteners or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be
incorporated into oral liquid compositions.
         Liposome delivery systems such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar
vesicles and multilamellar vesicles may also be employed as delivery means for the
                                                74

 compounds of the invention. Liposomes may be formed from a variety of phospholipids such
 as cholesterol, stearylamine and phosphatidylcholines.
         Compositions     designed    for nasal    administration   include   aerosols,  solutions,
 suspensions, sprays, mists and drops. Aerosolable formulations for nasal administration may
 be formulated in much the same ways as aerosolable formulations for inhalation with the
 condition that particles of non-respirable size will be preferred in formulations for nasal
 administration.    Typically, particles of about 5 microns in size, up to the size of visible
 droplets may be employed. Thus, for nasal administration, a particle size in the range of 10
 500 pm may be used to ensure retention in the nasal cavity.
         Transdermal patches may also be employed, which are designed to remain in contact
 with the epidermis of the patient for an extended period of time and promote the absorption of
the active ingredient there through.
         Compositions for vaginal or rectal administration include ointments,              creams,
 suppositories and enemas, all of which may be formulated using conventional techniques.
         In one preferred embodiment, the composition is an inhalable pharmaceutical
composition which is suitable for inhalation and delivery to the endobronchial space.
Typically, such composition is in the form of an aerosol comprising particles for delivery
using a nebulizer, pressurized metered dose inhaler (MDI), softmist inhaler, or dry powder
inhaler (DPI). The aerosol formulation used in the methods of the present invention may be a
liquid (e.g., solution) suitable for administration by a nebulizer, softmist inhaler, or MDI, or a
dry powder suitable for administration by an MDI or DPI.
        Aerosols used to administer medicaments to the respiratory tract are typically
polydisperse; that is they are comprised of particles of many different sizes. The particle size
distribution is typically described by the Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD) and
the Geometric Standard Deviation (GSD). For optimum drug delivery to the endobronchial
space the MMAD is in the range from about 1 to about 10 tm and preferably from about 1 to
about 5 ptm, and the GSD is less than 3, and preferably less than about 2. Aerosols having a
MMAD above 10 pim are generally too large when inhaled to reach the lungs. Aerosols with
a GSD greater than about 3 are not preferred for lung delivery as they deliver a high
percentage of the medicament to the oral cavity. To achieve these particle sizes in powder
formulation, the particles of the active ingredient may be size reduced using conventional
techniques such as micronisation or spray drying. Non-limiting examples of other processes
or techniques that can be used to produce respirable particles include spray drying,
precipitation, supercritical fluid, and freeze drying. The desired fraction may be separated out

   WO 2013/181232                                                          PCT/US2013/043080
by air classification or sieving.    In one embodiment, the particles will be crystalline.    For
liquid formulations, the particle size is determined by the selection of a particular model of
nebulizer, softmist inhaler, or MDI.
         Aerosol particle size distributions are determined using devices well known in the art.
For example a multi-stage Anderson cascade impactor or other suitable method such as those
specifically cited within the US Pharmacopoeia Chapter 601 as characterizing devices for
aerosols emitted from metered-dose and dry powder inhalers.
         Dry powder compositions for topical delivery to the lung by inhalation may be
formulated without excipient or carrier and instead including only the active ingredients in a
dry powder form having a suitable particle size for inhalation. Dry powder compositions may
also    contain   a   mix    of   the    active   ingredient   and  a   suitable   powder    base
(carrier/diluent/excipient substance) such as mono-, di- or poly-saccharides (e.g., lactose or
starch).   Lactose is typically the preferred excipient for dry powder formulations. When a
solid excipient such as lactose is employed, generally the particle size of the excipient will be
much greater than the active ingredient to aid the dispersion of the formulation in the inhaler.
         Non-limiting examples of dry powder inhalers include reservoir multi-dose inhalers,
pre-metered multi-dose inhalers, capsule-based inhalers and single-dose disposable inhalers.
A reservoir inhaler contains a large number of doses (e.g. 60) in one container.         Prior to
inhalation, the patient actuates the inhaler which causes the inhaler to meter one dose of
medicament from the reservoir and prepare it for inhalation. Examples of reservoir DPls
include but are not limited to the Turbohaler@ by AstraZeneca and the ClickHaler® by
Vectura.
         In a pre-metered multi-dose inhaler, each individual dose has been manufactured in a
separate container, and actuation of the inhaler prior to inhalation causes a new dose of drug
to be released from its container and prepared for inhalation. Examples of multidose DPI
inhalers include but are not limited to Diskus® by GSK, Gyrohaler® by Vectura, and
Prohaler® by Valois. During inhalation, the inspiratory flow of the patient accelerates the
powder out of the device and into the oral cavity. For a capsule inhaler, the formulation is in
a capsule and stored outside the inhaler. The patient puts a capsule in the inhaler, actuates the
inhaler    (punctures the capsule), then inhales.          Examples include     the RotohalerTM
                                                                               TM (PH&T). With
 (GlaxoSmithKline), Spinhaler TM (Novartis), HandiHalerTM (IB), TurboSpin
 single-dose disposable inhalers, the patient actuates the inhaler to prepare it for inhalation,
 inhales, then disposes of the inhaler and packaging.        Examples include the TwincerTM (U
                        TM

        Generally, dry powder inhalers utilize turbulent flow characteristics of the powder
path to cause the excipient-drug aggregates to disperse, and the particles of active ingredient
are deposited in the lungs. However, certain dry powder inhalers utilize a cyclone dispersion
chamber to produce particles of the desired respirable size. In a cyclone dispersion chamber,
the drug enters a coin shaped dispersion chamber tangentially so that the air path and drug
move along the outer circular wall. As the drug formulation moves along this circular wall it
bounces around and agglomerates are broken apart by impact forces. The air path spirals
towards the center of the chamber exiting vertically.       Particles that have small enough
aerodynamic sizes can follow the air path and exit the chamber.        In effect, the dispersion
chamber works like a small jet mill. Depending on the specifics of the formulation, large
lactose particles may be added to the formulation to aid in the dispersion through impact with
the API particles.
        The TwincerTM single-dose disposable inhaler appears to operate using a coin-shaped
cyclone dispersion chamber referred to as an "air classifier." See, U.S. Published Patent
Application No. 2006/0237010 to Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.          Papers published by the
University of Groningen, have stated that a 60 mg dose of pure micronized colistin
sulfomethate could be effectively delivered as an inhalable dry powder utilizing this
technology.
        In preferred embodiments, the aerosol formulation is delivered as a dry powder using
a dry powder inhaler wherein the particles emitted from the inhaler have an MMAD in the
range of about 1 mtrto about 5 pm and a GSD about less than 2.
        Examples of suitable dry powder inhalers and dry powder dispersion devices for use
in the delivery of compounds and compositions according to the present invention include but
are not limited to those disclosed in US7520278; US7322354; US7246617; US7231920;

        In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention is a
dry powder for inhalation which is formulated for delivery by a Diskus@-type device. The
Diskus@ device comprises an elongate strip formed from a base sheet having a plurality of
recesses spaced along its length and a lid sheet hermetically but peelably sealed thereto to
define a plurality of containers, each container having therein an inhalable formulation
containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient either alone or in admixture with one
or more carriers or excipients (e.g., lactose) and/or other therapeutically active agents.
Preferably, the strip is sufficiently flexible to be wound into a roll. The lid sheet and base

   WO 2013/181232                                                          PCT/US2013/043080
sheet will preferably have leading end portions which are not sealed to one another and at
least one of the leading end portions is constructed to be attached to a winding means. Also,
preferably the hermetic seal between the base and lid sheets extends over their whole width.
To prepare the dose for inhalation, the lid sheet may preferably be peeled from the base sheet
in a longitudinal direction from a first end of the base sheet.
        In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention is a dry
powder for inhalation which is formulated for delivery using a single-dose disposable inhaler,
and particularly the Twincer      inhaler. The TwincerTM inhaler comprises a foil laminate
blister with one or more recesses and a lid sheet hermetically but peelably sealed thereto to
define a plurality of containers. Each container has therein an inhalable formulation
containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient(s) either alone or in admixture with
one or more carriers or excipeints (e.g., lactose). The lid sheet will preferably have a leading
end portion which is constructed to project from the body of the inhaler. The patient would
operate the device and thereby administer the aerosol formulation by 1) removing the outer
packaging overwrap, 2) pulling the foil tab to uncover the drug in the blister and 3) inhaling
the drug from the blister.
        In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention is a
dry powder for inhalation wherein the dry powder is formulated into microparticles as
described in PCT Publication No. W02009/015286 or W02007/114881, both to NexBio.
Such microparticles are generally formed by adding a counterion to a solution containing a
compound of the invention in a solvent, adding an antisolvent to the solution; and gradually
cooling the solution to a temperature below about 25'C, to form a composition containing
microparticles comprising the compound. The microparticles comprising the compound may
then be separated from the solution by any suitable means such as sedimentation, filtration or
lyophillization. Suitable counterions, solvents and antisolvents for preparing microparticles
of the compounds of the invention are described in W02009/015286.
        In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is
delivered as a dry powder using a metered dose inhaler. Non-limiting examples of metered
dose inhalers and devices        include those disclosed in US5,261,538;           US5,544,647;
US5,622,163; US4,955,371; US3,565,070; US3,361306 and US6,116,234 and US7,108,159.
In a preferred embodiment, a compound of the invention is delivered as a dry powder using a
metered dose inhaler wherein the emitted particles have an MMAD that is in the range of
about 1 pm to about 5 [tm and a GSD that is less than about 2 tm.

         Liquid aerosol formulations for delivery to the endobronchial space or lung by
inhalation may for example be formulated as aqueous solutions or suspensions or as aerosols
delivered from pressurized packs, such as metered dose inhalers, with the use of suitable
liquefied propellants, softmist inhalers, or nebulizers. Such aerosol compositions suitable for
inhalation can be either a suspension or a solution and generally contain the active
ingredient(s) together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent (e.g., water
(distilled or sterile), saline, hypertonic saline, or ethanol) and optionally one or more other
therapeutically active agents.
         Aerosol compositions for delivery by pressurized metered dose inhalers typically
further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable propellant.        Examples of such propellants
include fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing           chlorofluorocarbon or mixtures thereof,
particularly   hydrofluoroalkanes,     e.g.,  dichlorodifluoromethane,    trichlorofluoromethane,
dichlorotetrafluoroethane, especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane,     1,1,1,2,3,3,3,-heptafluoro-n
propane or a mixture thereof.        The aerosol composition may be excipient free or may
optionally contain additional formulation excipients well known in the art such as surfactants
e.g., oleic acid or lecithin and cosolvents e.g., ethanol.         Pressurized formulations will
generally be retained in a canister (e.g., an aluminum canister) closed with a valve (e.g., a
metering valve) and fitted into an actuator provided with a mouthpiece.
         In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is
delivered as a liquid using a metered dose inhaler. Non-limiting examples of metered dose
inhalers and devices include those disclosed in US Patent Nos. 6,253,762, 6,413,497,
7,601,336, 7,481,995, 6,743,413, and 7,105,152. In a preferred embodiment, a compound of
the invention is delivered as a dry powder using a metered dose inhaler wherein the emitted
particles have an MMAD that is in the range of about 1 tm to about 5 ptm and a GSD that is
less than about 2.
         In one embodiment the aerosol formulation is suitable for aerosolization by a jet
nebulizer, or ultrasonic nebulizer including static and vibrating porous plate nebulizers.
Liquid aerosol formulations        for nebulization may be generated by solubilizing             or
reconstituting a solid particle formulation or may be formulated with an aqueous vehicle with
the addition of agents such as acid or alkali, buffer salts, and isotonicity adjusting agents.
They may be sterilized by in-process techniques such as filtration, or terminal processes such
as heating in an autoclave or gamma irradiation. They may also be presented in non-sterile
form.

   WO 2013/181232                                                            PCT/US2013/043080
        Patients can be sensitive to the pH, osmolality, and ionic content of a nebulized
solution. Therefore these parameters should be adjusted to be compatible with the active
ingredient and tolerable to patients. The most preferred solution or suspension of active
ingredient will contain a chloride concentration >30 mM at pH 4.5-7.4, preferably 5.0-5.5,
and an osmolality of from about 800-1600mOsm/kg.               The pH of the solution can be
controlled by either titration with common acids (hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, for
example) or bases (sodium hydroxide, for example) or via the use of buffers. Commonly
used buffers include citrate buffers, acetate buffers, and phosphate buffers. Buffer strengths
can range from 2mM to 50mM.
         Such formulations may be administered using commercially available nebulizers or
other atomizer that can break the formulation into particles or droplets suitable for deposition
in the respiratory tract. Non-limiting examples of nebulizers which may be employed for the
aerosol delivery of a composition of the invention include pneumatic jet nebulizers, vented or
breath enhanced jet nebulizers, or ultrasonic nebulizers including static or vibrating porous
plate nebulizers.
        A jet nebulizer utilizes a high velocity stream of air blasting up through a column of
water to generate droplets.         Particles unsuitable for inhalation impact on walls or
aerodynamic baffles. A vented or breath enhanced nebulizer works in essentially the same
way as a jet nebulizer except that inhaled air passes through the primary droplet generation
area to increase the output rate of the nebulizer while the patient inhales.
         In an ultrasonic nebulizer, vibration of a piezoelectric crystal creates surface
instabilities in the drug reservoir that cause droplets to be formed. In porous plate nebulizers
pressure fields generated by sonic energy force liquid through the mesh pores where it breaks
into droplets by Rayleigh breakup. The sonic energy may be supplied by a vibrating horn or
plate driven by a piezoelectric crystal, or by the mesh itself vibrating. Non-limiting examples
of atomizers include any single or twin fluid atomizer or nozzle that produces droplets of an
appropriate size. A single fluid atomizer works by forcing a liquid through one or more
holes, where the jet of liquid breaks up into droplets. Twin fluid atomizers work by either
forcing both a gas and liquid through one or more holes, or by impinging a jet of liquid
against anotherjet of either liquid or gas.
        The choice of nebulizer which aerosolizes the aerosol formulation is important in the
administration of the active ingredient(s). Different nebulizers have differing efficiencies
based their design and operation principle and are sensitive to the physical and chemical
properties of the formulation. For example, two formulations with different surface tensions
                                               80

   WO 2013/181232                                                              PCT/US2013/043080
may have different particle size distributions. Additionally, formulation properties such as
pH, osmolality, and permeant ion content can affect tolerability of the medication, so
preferred embodiments conform to certain ranges of these properties.
          In a preferred embodiment, the formulation for nebulization is delivered to the
endobronchial space as an aerosol having an MMAD between about 1 pm and about 5 ptm
and a GSD less than 2 using an appropriate nebulizer. To be optimally effective and to avoid
upper respiratory and systemic side effects, the aerosol should not have a MMAD greater than
about 5 ptm and should not have a GSD greater than about 2. If an aerosol has an MMAD
larger than about 5 pLm or a GSD greater than about 2 pm.a large percentage of the dose may
be deposited in the upper airways decreasing the amount of drug delivered to the desired site
in the lower respiratory tract. If the MMAD of the aerosol is smaller than about 1 pmni then a
large percentage of the particles may remain suspended in the inhaled air and may then be
exhaled during expiration.
          The compounds of the invention may also be administered by transbronchoscopic
lavage.
          In another aspect, the invention provides a method of promoting hydration of mucosal
surfaces or restoring mucosal defense in a human in need thereof, comprising administering
to the human a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention,
wherein said compound is administered in an effective amount.                     In one preferred
embodiment, the method comprises administering the pharmaceutical composition as an
inhalable composition comprising an amount of a compound of the invention that is sufficient
to achieve dissolved concentration of the compound on the airway surfaces of from about
 10-9 , 10~', or 10-' to about 10~4,10-', 10.2, or 10-1 Moles/liter, more preferably from about 10
to about 10-4 Moles/liter.
          In another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating any one of: a disease
associated with reversible or irreversible airway obstruction, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis (including bronchiectasis due to conditions other
than cystic fibrosis), acute bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, post-viral cough, cystic fibrosis,
emphysema, pneumonia, panbronchiolitis, transplant-associate bronchiolitis, and ventilator
associated tracheobronchitis or preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia in a human in
need thereof, comprising administering to the human a pharmaceutical composition
comprising a compound of the invention, wherein said compound is administered in an
effective amount.        In one preferred embodiment, the method comprises administering the
pharmaceutical composition as an inhalable composition comprising an amount of a
                                                   81

   WO 2013/181232                                                          PCT/US2013/043080
compound of the invention that is sufficient to achieve dissolved concentration of the
compound on the airway surfaces of from about 10-9, 10-8, or 10~ to about 10-4,10-,      10-, or
 10- Moles/liter, more preferably from about 10-9 to about 10-4 Moles/liter.
        In another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating any one of dry mouth
(xerostomia),. dry skin, vaginal dryness, sinusitis, rhinosinusitis, or nasal dehydration,
including nasal dehydration brought on by administering dry oxygen, dry eye, Sjogren's
disease-associated dry eye, promoting ocular or corneal hydration, treating distal intestinal
obstruction syndrome, treating otitis media, primary ciliary diskinesia, distal intestinal
obstruction syndrome, esophagitis, constipation, or chronic diverticulitis in a human in need
thereof, comprising administering to the human a pharmaceutical composition comprising a
compound of the invention, wherein said compound is administered in an effective amount.
        Preferred unit dosage formulations for the compounds of the invention are those
containing an effective amount of the active ingredient or an appropriate fraction thereof.
        It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned
above, the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art
having regard to the type of formulation in question for example those suitable for oral
administration may include flavoring agents.
        The compositions of the present invention may be formulated for immediate,
controlled or sustained release as desired for the particular condition being treated and the
desired route of administration.     For example, a controlled release formulation for oral
administration may be desired for the treatment of constipation in order to maximize delivery
of the active agent to colon. Such formulations and suitable excipients for the same are well
known in the art of pharmacy. Because the free base of the compound is generally less
soluble in aqueous solutions than the salt, compositions comprising a free base of a
compound of Formula I may be employed to provide more sustained release of active agent
delivered by inhalation to the lungs. An active agent present in the lungs in particulate form
which has not dissolved into solution is not available to induce a physiological response, but
serves as a depot of bioavailable drug which gradually dissolves into solution. As another
example, a formulation may employ both a free base and salt form of a compound of the
invention to provide both immediate release and sustained release of the active ingredient for
dissolution into the mucus secretions of, for example, the nose.
        ENaC blockers described in this invention can be administered by topical
administration to the eyes of a patient in need of such treatment. ENaC blockers of Formula I
are administered to the ocular surface of a subject, in an amount effective to reduce dry eye
                                               82

   WO 2013/181232                                                            PCT/US2013/043080
symptoms and to improve hydration of the tear film. Preferably, ENaC blockers are
administered as a liquid or gel suspension in the form of drops, spray or gel. Alternatively,
ENaC blockers can be applied to the eye via liposomes. ENaC blockers can also be
contained within, carried by, or attached to contact lenses, punctual plugs or other compatible
controlled release materials, which are placed on the eye. ENaC blockers can also be
contained within a swab or sponge which can be applied to the ocular surface. ENaC
blockers can also be contained within a liquid spray which can be applied to the ocular
surface. Another embodiment of the present invention involves an injection of ENaC
blockers directly into the lacrimal tissues or onto the eye surface.
         The topical solution containing ENaC blockers can contain a physiologically
compatible vehicle, as those skilled in the ophthalmic art can select using conventional
criteria. The ophthalmic vehicles include, but are not limited to, saline solution, water
polyethers such as polyethylene glycol, polyvinyls such as polyvinyl alcohol and povidone,
cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,
polycarbophil, petroleum derivatives such as mineral oil and white petrolatum, animal fats
such as lanolin, polymers of acrylic acid such as carboxypolymethylene gel, vegetable fats
such as peanut oil and polysaccharides such as dextrans, and glycosaminoglycans such as
sodium hyaluronate and salts such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride.
         The topical formulation optionally includes a preservative, such as benzalkonium
chloride and other inactive ingredients such as EDTA. The pH of the formulation is adjusted
by adding any physiologically and ophthamologically acceptable pH adjusting acids, bases or
buffers to within the range of about 4.5 to 7.5; preferably 5 to 7. Examples of acids include
acetic, boric, citric, lactic, phosphoric, hydrochloric, and the like, and examples of bases
include sodium hydroxide, sodium phosphate, sodium borate, sodium citrate, sodium acetate,
sodium lactate, tromethamine, THAM (trishydroxymethylamino-methane), and the like.
Salts and buffers include citrate/dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, ammonium chloride and
mixtures of the aforementioned acids and bases.
         The osmotic pressure of the topical formulation of ENaC blockers is generally from
about 200 to about 400 milliosmolar (mOsM), more preferably from 260 to 340 mOsM. The
osmotic pressure can be adjusted by using appropriate amounts of physiologically and
ophthamologically acceptable ionic or non-ionic agents. Sodium chloride is a preferred ionic
agent, and the amount of sodium chloride ranges from about 0.01% to about 1% (w/v), and
preferably from about 0.05% to about 0.85% (w/v). Equivalent amounts of one or more salts
made up of cations such as potassium, ammonium and the like and anions such as chloride,
                                                83

   WO 2013/181232                                                            PCT/US2013/043080
citrate, ascorbate, borate, phosphate, bicarbonate, sulfate, thiosulfate, bisulfate, sodium
bisulfate, ammonium sulfate, and the like can be used in addition to or instead of sodium
chloride to achieve osmolality within the above-stated range. Further, non-ionic agents such
as mannitol, dextrose, sorbitol, glucose and the like can also be used to adjust the osmolality.
         The concentration of ENaC blockers included in the topical formulation is an amount
sufficient to reduce dry eye symptoms and/or improve hydration of the tear film. This
formulation is preferably an aqueous solution of ENaC blockers and is in the range of 0.0001
.3%, preferably 0.001% to 0.1%, more preferably 0.003-0.05%, and most preferably about
0.03% (w/v). "About" as used herein, refers to ± 15% of the recited value. The formulation
optionally includes a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride (0.003% w/v) and inactive
ingredients: edetate sodium, purified water, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate monobasic,
sodium hydroxide, and/or hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH to about 4-8.
         The daily topical dose to reduce dry eye symptoms and improve tear film composition
can be divided among one or several unit dose administrations. The total daily dose for
ENaC blockers, for example, can range from one drop (about 50 pl), one to four times a day,
depending upon the age and condition of the subject. A preferred regimen for ENaC blockers
is one drop of 0.03% (w/v) solution, about one to two times a day.
         Liquid pharmaceutical compositions of ENaC blockers for producing eye drops can
be prepared by combining ENaC blockers with a suitable vehicle, such as sterile pyrogen free
water or sterile saline by techniques known to those skilled in the art.
COMBINATIONS
         The compounds of the invention may be formulated and/or used in combination with
other therapeutically active agents.    Examples of other therapeutically active agents which
may be formulated or used in combination with the compounds of the invention include but
are not limited to osmolytes, anti-inflammatory agents, anticholinergic agents, p-agonists
(including selective   p2-agonists), P2Y2 receptor agonists, peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor (PPAR) delta agonists, other epithelial sodium channel blockers (ENaC receptor
blockers), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, kinase
inhibitors, antiinfective agents, antihistamines, non-antibiotic anti-inflammatory macrolides,
elastase and protease inhibitors, and mucus or mucin modifying agents, such as surfactants.
         The present invention thus provides, as another aspect, a composition comprising an
effective amount of a compound of the invention and one or more other therapeutically active
agents selected from osmolytes, anti-inflammatory agents, anticholinergic agents,        p-agonists
                                               84

   WO 2013/181232                                                             PCT/US2013/043080
(including selective p2-agonists), P2Y2 receptor agonists, PPAR delta agonists, ENaC
receptor blockers, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators,
kinase inhibitors, antiinfective agents, antihistamines, non-antibiotic anti-inflammatory
macrolides, elastase and protease inhibitors, and mucus or mucin modifying agents, such as
surfactants. Use of the compounds of the invention in combination with one or more other
therapeutically active agents (particularly osmolytes) may lower the dose of the compound of
the invention that is required to sufficiently hydrate mucosal surfaces, thereby reducing the
potential for undesired side-effects attributable to systemic blocking of sodium channels such
as for example in the kidneys.
         "Osmolytes" according to the present invention are molecules or compounds that are
osmotically active.       "Osmotically active" molecules and compounds are membrane
impermeable (i.e., essentially non-absorbable) on the airway or pulmonary epithelial surface.
The terms "airway surface" and "pulmonary surface," as used herein, include pulmonary
airway surfaces such as the bronchi and bronchioles, alveolar surfaces, and nasal and sinus
surfaces.    Suitable osmolytes include ionic osmolytes (i.e., salts), and non-ionic osmolytes
(i.e., sugars, sugar alcohols, and organic osmolytes). In general, osmolytes (both ionic and
non-ionic) used in combination with the compounds of the invention are preferably osmolytes
that do not promote, or in fact deter or retard bacterial growth. Osmolytes suitable for use in
the present invention may be in racemic form or in the form of an enantiomer, diastereomer,
tautomer, polymorph or pseudopolymorph.
          Examples of ionic osmolytes useful in the present invention include any salt of a
pharmaceutically acceptable anion and a pharmaceutically acceptable cation.              Preferably,
either (or both) of the anion and cation are osmotically active and not subject to rapid active
transport, in relation to the airway surfaces to which they are administered. Such compounds
include but are not limited to anions and cations that are contained in FDA approved
commercially marketed salts, see, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,
 Vol. I, pg. 1457 (19th Ed. 1995), and can be used in any combination as known in the art.
          Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable osmotically active anions include
but are not limited to, acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bitartrate, bromide,
 calcium edetate, camsylate (camphorsulfonate), carbonate, chloride, citrate, dihydrochloride,

embodiment, the present invention provides a combination of a compound of the invention
and two different osmotically active salts. When different salts are used, one of the anion or
cation may be the same among the differing salts. Hypertonic saline is a preferred ionic
osmolyte for use in combination with the compounds of the invention.
        Non-ionic osmolytes include sugars, sugar-alcohols, and organic osmolytes. Sugars
and sugar-alcohols useful as osmolytes in the present invention include but are not limited to
3-carbon sugars (e.g., glycerol, dihydroxyacetone); 4-carbon sugars (e.g., both the D and L
forms of erythrose, threose, and erythrulose); 5-carbon sugars (e.g., both the D and L forms
of ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, psicose, fructose, sorbose, and tagatose); and 6-carbon
sugars (e.g., both the D and L forms of altose, allose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose,
galactose, and talose, and the D and L forms of allo-heptulose, allo-hepulose, gluco
heptulose,    manno-heptulose,      gulo-heptulose,    ido-heptulose,    galacto-heptulose,   talo
heptulose). Additional sugars useful in the practice of the present invention include raffinose,

raffinose series oligosaccharides, and stachyose. Both the D and L forms of the reduced form
of each sugar/sugar alcohol are also suitable for the present invention. For example, glucose,
when reduced, becomes sorbitol; an osmolyte within the scope of the invention.
Accordingly, sorbitol and other reduced forms of sugar/sugar alcohols (e.g., mannitol,
dulcitol, arabitol) are suitable osmolytes for use in the present invention.     Mannitol is a
preferred non-ionic osmolyte for use in combination with the compounds of the invention.
        "Organic osmolytes" is generally used to refer to molecules that control intracellular
osmolality in the kidney. See e.g., J. S. Handler et al., Comp. Biochem. Physiol, 117, 301
306 (1997); M. Burg, Am. J Physiol. 268, F983-F996 (1995). Organic osmolytes include
but are not limited to three major classes of compounds: polyols (polyhydric alcohols),
methylamines, and amino acids.       Suitable polyol organic osmolytes include but are not
limited to, inositol, myo-inositol, and sorbitol.    Suitable methylamine organic osmolytes
include but are not limited to, choline, betaine, carnitine (L-, D- and DL forms),
phosphorylcholine, lyso-phosphorylcholine, glycerophosphorylcholine, creatine, and creatine
phosphate. Suitable amino acid organic osmolytes include but are not limited to, the D- and
L-forms of glycine, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, proline and taurine. Additional
organic osmolytes suitable for use in the present invention include tihulose and sarcosine.
Mammalian organic osmolytes are preferred, with human organic osmolytes being most
preferred. However, certain organic osmolytes are of bacterial, yeast, and marine animal
origin, and these compounds may also be employed in the present invention.
        Osmolyte precursors may be used in combination with the compounds of the
invention An "osmolyte precursor" as used herein refers to a compound which is converted
into an osmolyte by a metabolic step, either catabolic or anabolic. Examples of osmolyte
precursors include but are not limited to, glucose, glucose polymers, glycerol, choline,
phosphatidylcholine,    lyso-phosphatidylcholine    and   inorganic   phosphates,  which   are
precursors of polyols and methylamines.         Precursors of amino acid osmolytes include
proteins, peptides, and polyamino acids, which are hydrolyzed to yield osmolyte amino acids,
and metabolic precursors which can be converted into osmolyte amino acids by a metabolic
step such as transamination. For example, a precursor of the amino acid glutamine is poly-L
glutamine, and a precursor of glutamate is poly-L-glutamic acid.
        Chemically modified osmolytes or osmolyte precursors may also be employed. Such
chemical modifications involve linking the osmolyte (or precursor) to an additional chemical
group which alters or enhances the effect of the osmolyte or osmolyte precursor (e.g., inhibits
degradation of the osmolyte molecule). Such chemical modifications have been utilized with
                                             87

drugs or prodrugs and are known in the art. (See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,479,932 and

        Preferred osmolytes for use in combination with the compounds of the invention
include sodium chloride, particular hypertonic saline, and mannitol.
        For the formulation of 7% and >7% hypertonic saline, formulations containing
bicarbonate anions may be particularly useful, especially for respiratory disorders with cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction such as CF or COPD.
Recent findings indicate that, although the relative ratio of HCO3- conductance/Cl
conductance is between 0.1 and .2 for single CFTR channels activated with cAMP and ATP,
the ratio in the sweat duct can range from virtually 0 to almost 1.0, depending on conditions
of stimulation. That is, combining cAMP + cGMP + a-ketoglutarate can yield CFTR HCO3
conductance almost equal to that of Cl- conductance (Quiton et al. Physiology, Vol. 22, No.
3, 212-225, June 2007). Furthermore, formulations of 7% and >7% hypertonic saline
containing bicarbonate anions may be particularly useful due to better control of the pH in the
airway surface liquid. First, it has shown that that airway acidification occurs in CF (Tate et
al. 2002) and that absent CFTR-dependent bicarbonate secretion can lead to an impaired
capacity to respond to airway conditions associated with acidification of airway surface liquid
layer (Coakley et al. 2003). Second, addition of HS solution without bicarbonate to the
surface of the lung may further dilute the bicarbonate concentrations, and potentially reduce
the pH or the ability to respond to airway acidification within the airway surface liquid layer.
Therefore addition of bicarbonate anions to HS may help maintain or improve the pH of
airway surface liquid layer in CF patients.
        Due to this evidence, inclusion of bicarbonate anion in the formulation of 7% or >7%
hypertonic saline administered by the method of this invention would be particularly useful.
Formulations containing up to 30 to 200 mM concentrations of bicarbonate anions are of
particular interest for 7% or >7% HS solutions.
        Hypertonic saline is understood to have a salt concentration greater than that of
normal saline, i.e. greater than 9 g/L or 0.9% w/v, and hypotonic saline has a salt
concentration less than that of normal saline.       Hypotonic saline solutions useful in the
formulations and methods of treatment herein may have a salt concentration from about 1%
to about 23.4% (w/v).       In one embodiment the hypertonic saline solution has a salt
concentration from about 60 g/L (6% w/v) to about 100 g/L (10% w/v).                 In another

(12% w/v), 130 g/L (13% w/v), 140 g/L (14% w/v), and 150 g/L (15% w/v)..            Saline
concentrations between each of these listed concentrations/percentages may also be used,
such as saline of 1.7 g/L (0.17% w/v), 28 g/L (2.8% w/v), 35 g/L (3.5% w/v), and 45 g/L
(4.5% w/v). Each of the ranges and specific concentrations of saline may be used with the
formulations, methods of treatment, regimens, and kits described herein.

         Mucus or mucin modifying agents useful in the combinations and methods herein
include reducing agents, surfactants and detergents, expectorants, and deoxyribonuclease
agents.
         Mucin proteins are organized into high molecular weight polymers via the formation
of covalent (disulfide) and non-covalent bonds. Disruption of the covalent bonds with
reducing agents is a well-established method to reduce the viscoelastic properties of mucus in
vitro and is predicted to minimize mucus adhesiveness and improve clearance in vivo.
Reducing agents are well known to decrease mucus viscosity in vitro and commonly used as
an aid to processing sputum samples8 .         Examples of reducing agents include sulfide
containing molecules or phosphines capable of reducing protein di-sulfide bonds including,
but not limited to, N-acetyl cysteine, N-acystelyn, carbocysteine, glutathione, dithiothreitol,
thioredoxin containing proteins, and tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine.
         N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is approved for use in conjunction with chest physiotherapy
to loosen viscid or thickened airway mucus I.      Clinical studies evaluating the effects of oral
or inhaled NAC in CF and COPD have reported improvements in the rheologic properties of
mucus and trends toward improvements in lung function and decreases in pulmonary
exacerbations9 . However, the preponderance of clinical data suggests that NAC is at best a
marginally    effective therapeutic agent for treating       airway mucus obstruction when
administered orally or by inhalation. A recent Cochrane review of the existing clinical
literature on the use of NAC found no evidence to support the efficacy of NAC for CF'".The
marginal clinical benefit of NAC reflects:
         NAC is a relative inefficient reducing agent which is only partially active on the
airway surface. Very high concentrations of NAC (200 mM or 3.26%) are required to fully
reduce Muc5B, a major gel-forming airway mucin, in vitro.              Furthermore, in the pH
environment of the airway surface (measured in the range of pH 6.0 to 7.2 in CF and COPD
airways)", NAC exists only partially in its reactive state as a negatively charge thiolate.
Thus, in the clinic, NAC is administered at very high concentrations.            However, it is
predicted that current aerosol devices will not be able to achieve therapeutic concentrations of
even a 20% Mucomyst solution on distal airway surfaces within the relatively short time
domains (7.5 - 15 minutes) typically used.
         In non-clinical studies, 14C-labled NAC, administered by inhalation, exhibits rapid
elimination from the lungs with a half-life ranging from 6 to 36 minutes12
         NAC is administered as a highly concentrated, hypertonic inhalation solution (20% or
1.22 molar) and has been reported to cause bronchoconstriction and cough. In many cases, it
                                                94

     WO 2013/181232                                                         PCT/US2013/043080
is recommended that NAC be administered with a bronchodilator to improve the tolerability
of this agent.
         Thus, reducing agents such as NAC are not well suited for bolus aerosol
administration.    However, it is anticipated that delivery of reducing agents by pulmonary
aerosol infusion would increase the effectiveness, while allowing for a decrease in the
concentration of reducing agent in the inhalation solution (predicted to increase tolerability).
         Surfactants   and detergents are    spreading   agents shown to decrease mucus
viscoelasticity, improving mucus clearability. Examples of surfactants include DPPC, PF,
palmitic acid, palmitoyl-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol, surfactant proteins (e.g. SP-A, B, or C),
or may be animal derived (e.g. from cow or calf lung lavage or extracted from minced pig
lung) or combinations thereof. See, e.g., US Patent Nos. 7,897,577; 5,876,970; 5,614,216;

4, Venticute, Alveofact, Curosurf, Infasurf, and Survanta. Examples of detergents include,
but are not limited to, Tween-80 and triton-X 100.

e.g., US Patent No. 7,345,051). Any suitable deoxyribonuclease can be used, including but
not limited to Dornase Alpha. (see, e.g., US Patent No. 7,482,024).

        Several assays may be used to characterize the compounds of the present invention.
Representative assays are discussed below.
Animal Models of Dry Eye Disease
        (1) In Vitro Measure of Sodium Channel Blocking Activity
      One assay used to assess mechanism of action and/or potency of the compounds of the
present invention involves the determination of lumenal drug inhibition of airway epithelial
sodium currents measured under short circuit current (Isc) using airway epithelial monolayers
mounted in Ussing chambers. This assay is described in detail in Hirsh, A.J., Zhang, J.,
Zamurs, A., et al. Pharmacological properties of N-(3,5-diamino-6-chloropyrazine-2
carbonyl)-N'-4-[4-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)phenyl]butyl-guanidine methanesulfonate (552
02), a novel epithelial sodium channel blocker with potential clinical efficacy for CF lung
disease. J. Pharmacol.Exp. Ther. 2008; 325(1): 77-88.
        Cells obtained from freshly excised human, dog, sheep or rodent airways are seeded
onto porous 0.4 micron SnapwelITM Inserts (CoStar), cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI)
conditions in hormonally defined media, and assayed for sodium transport activity (Isc) while
bathed in Krebs Bicarbonate Ringer (KBR) in Using chambers. All test drug additions are to
the lumenal bath with half-log dose addition protocols (from 1 x 10-" M to 3 x 10- M), and
the cumulative change in Isc (inhibition) recorded. All drugs are prepared in dimethyl
sulfoxide as stock solutions at a concentration of 1 x 10.2 M and stored at -200 C. Eight
preparations are typically run in parallel; two preparations per run incorporate amiloride
and/or benzamil as positive controls. After the maximal concentration (5 x 10-5 M) is
administered, the lumenal bath is exchanged three times with fresh drug-free KBR solution,
 and the resultant Isc measured after each wash for approximately 5 minutes in duration.
 Reversibility is defined as the percent return to the baseline value for sodium current after the
third wash. All data from the voltage clamps are collected via a computer interface and
 analyzed off-line.
         Dose-effect relationships for all compounds are considered and analyzed by the Prism
 3.0 program. IC 50 values, maximal effective concentrations, and reversibility are calculated

        (2) Pharmacological Effects of Compounds on Tear Volume in an Animal Model of
Dry Eye Disease in vivo.
        The effects of compounds on tear volume was assessed in a rat model of dry eye
disease in which Sprague Dawley rats undergo surgical lacrimal gland excision (ExLac
Model) to reduce normal tear volume. The lacrimal excision reduces normal tear volume by
 -50% (Table 2).
        Both the ipsilateral and contralateral eyes were dosed with 5 pl of test article solution.
Tear production was measured using the ZoneQuick cotton thread with impregnated phenol
red dye. The folded end of the thread was held in the lateral-ventral conjunctival cul-de-sac

length of the thread that changes color from yellow to red. Use of a stereomicroscope was
assist in the accurate measurement (recorded in millimeters) of the wicking / color change.
Tear volume was assessed pre-dose, and 15, 30, 60, 120, and 360 minute post-dose. The

         Virtually all amiloride-like molecules fluoresce in the ultraviolet range. This property
 of these molecules may be used to directly measure cellular update using confocal
 microscopy. Corneal cells were labeled using calcein-AM dye by incubating with corneas for
 45 minutes at 37 C in DMEM media. Equimolar concentrations of 2 microliters of
 compound 9 or amiloride were placed on the apical (epithelial) surface of mouse comeas for
 one hour at 37 C. Serial x-y images were obtained one hour post-drug addition by confocal
 microsopy. The data shown in Figure 16, show a x-z image of the corneas made up from the
 composite of the x-y image stack. Figure 16 shows that amiloride can fully penetrate the
 cornea is one hour post-administration, but Compound 9 remains associated with the apical
 (epithelial) surface.

        (4) In Vitro Drug Metabolism
The metabolic stability of 9 and 15 was assessed in plasma (rat, rabbit, dog and human) and
hepatocytes (rat and dog). Compounds were added either directly to plasma or to hepatocyte
suspensions at a final concentration of 2.5 or 10 ptM, respectively, and incubated at 37'C for
up to six hours. Aliquots were removed at various time points and quenched. The amount of
parent compound was quantified via UPLC-fluorescence analysis. The amount of parent
compound remaining was calculated based on the total peak area at the time of sampling
divided by the total peak area at initiation. The results presented in Tables 3 and 4 show that
9 was stable towards metabolic hydrolysis in both plasma and hepatocytes among the species
evaluated, whereas, 15 was rapidly metabolized in both plasma and hepatocytes. These
results confirm that the 15 with amide linkages in the naturally occurring S configuration is
susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis, whereas, the aide linkages in the R configuration are
stable towards hydrolysis.

        (5) In vitro Assays of Compound Metabolism
        Airway epithelial cells have the capacity to metabolize drugs during the process of
transepithelial absorption. Further, although less likely, it is possible that drugs can be
metabolized on airway epithelial surfaces by specific ectoenzyme activities. Perhaps more
likely as an ecto-surface event, compounds may be metabolized by the infected secretions
that occupy the airway lumens of patients with lung disease, e.g. cystic fibrosis. Thus, a
series of assays is performed to characterize the compound metabolism that results from the
interaction of test compounds with human airway epithelia and/or human airway epithelial
lumenal products.
        In the first series of assays, the interaction of test compounds in KBR as an "ASL"
stimulant are applied to the apical surface of human airway epithelial cells grown in the T
Col insert system. For most compounds, metabolism (generation of new species) is tested for
using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to resolve chemical species and the
endogenous fluorescence properties of these compounds to estimate the relative quantities of
test compound and novel metabolites. For a typical assay, a test solution (25 pl KBR,
containing 10 gM test compound) is placed on the epithelial lumenal surface. Sequential 5 to
10 pl samples are obtained from the lumenal and serosal compartments for HPLC analysis of
(1) the mass of test compound permeating from the lumenal to serosal bath and (2) the
potential formation of metabolites from the parent compound. In instances where the
fluorescence properties of the test molecule are not adequate for such characterizations,
radiolabeled compounds are used for these assays. From the HPLC data, the rate of
disappearance and/or formation of novel metabolite compounds on the lumenal surface and
the appearance of test compound and/or novel metabolize in the basolateral solution is
quantitated. The data relating the chromatographic mobility of potential novel metabolites
with reference to the parent compound are also quantitated.
        To analyze the potential metabolism of test compounds by CF sputum, a
"representative" mixture of expectorated CF sputum obtained from 10 CF patients (under
IRB approval) has been collected. The sputum has been be solubilized in a 1:5 mixture of
KBR solution with vigorous vortexing, following which the mixture was split into a "neat"
sputum aliquot and an aliquot subjected to ultracentrifugation so that a "supernatant" aliquot
was obtained (neat=cellular; supernatant=liquid phase). Typical studies of compound
metabolism by CF sputum involve the addition of known masses of test compound to "neat"
CF sputum and aliquots of CF sputum "supernatant" incubated at 37 'C, followed by
                                                  103

sequential sampling of aliquots from each sputum type for characterization of compound
stability/metabolism by HPLC analysis as described above. As above, analysis of compound
disappearance, rates of formation of novel metabolities, and HPLC mobilities of novel
metabolites are then performed.
(6) Pharmacological Effects and Mechanism of Action of the Drug in Animals
         The effect of compounds for enhancing mucociliary clearance (MCC) can be
measured using an in vivo model described by Sabater et al., Journal of Applied Physiology,
1999, pp. 2191-2196, incorporated herein by reference.
Methods
Animal Preparation: Adult ewes (ranging in weight from 25 to 35 kg) were restrained in an
upright position in a specialized body harness adapted to a modified shopping cart. The
animals' heads were immobilized and local anesthesia of the nasal passage was induced with
2% lidocaine. The animals were then nasally intubated with a 7.5 mm internal diameter
endotracheal tube (ETT). The cuff of the ETT was placed just below the vocal cords and its
position was verified with a flexible bronchoscope. After intubation the animals were
allowed to equilibrate for approximately 20 minutes prior to initiating measurements of
mucociliary clearance.
Administration ofRadio-aerosol:Aerosols of 99 mTc-Human serum albumin (3.1 mg/ml;
containing approximately 20 mCi) were generated using a Raindrop Nebulizer which
produces a droplet with a median aerodynamic diameter of 3.6 jim. The nebulizer was
connected to a dosimetry system consisting of a solenoid valve and a source of compressed
air (20 psi). The output of the nebulizer was directed into a plastic T connector; one end of
which was connected to the endotracheal tube, the other was connected to a piston respirator.
The system was activated for one second at the onset of the respirator's inspiratory cycle.
The respirator was set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, an inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:1,
and at a rate of 20 breaths per minute to maximize the central airway deposition. The sheep
breathed the radio-labeled aerosol for 5 minutes. A gamma camera was used to measure the
clearance of 99 mTc-Human serum albumin from the airways. The camera was positioned
above the animal's back with the sheep in a natural upright position supported in a cart so
that the field of image was perpendicular to the animal's spinal cord. External radio-labeled

markers were placed on the sheep to ensure proper alignment under the gamma camera. All
images were stored in a computer integrated with the gamma camera. A region of interest
was traced over the image corresponding to the right lung of the sheep and the counts were
recorded. The counts were corrected for decay and expressed as percentage of radioactivity
present in the initial baseline image. The left lung was excluded from the analysis because its
outlines are superimposed over the stomach and counts can be swallowed and enter the
stomach as radio-labeled mucus.
Treatment Protocol (Assessment of activity at t-zero): A baseline deposition image was
obtained immediately after radio-aerosol administration. At time zero, after acquisition of the
baseline image, vehicle control (distilled water), positive control (amiloride), or experimental
compounds were aerosolized from a 4 ml volume using a Pari LC JetPlus nebulizer to free
breathing animals. The nebulizer was driven by compressed air with a flow of 8 liters per
minute. The time to deliver the solution was 10 to 12 minutes. Animals were extubated
immediately following delivery of the total dose in order to prevent false elevations in counts
caused by aspiration of excess radio-tracer from the ETT. Serial images of the lung were
obtained at 15-minute intervals during the first 2 hours after dosing and hourly for the next 6
hours after dosing for a total observation period of 8 hours. A washout period of at least 7
days separated dosing sessions with different experimental agents.
Treatment Protocol(Assessment ofActivity at t-4hours): The following variation of the
standard protocol was used to assess the durability of response following a single exposure to
vehicle control (distilled water), positive control compounds (amiloride or benzamil), or
investigational agents. At time zero, vehicle control (distilled water), positive control
(amiloride), or investigational compounds were aerosolized from a 4 ml volume using a Pari
LC JetPlus nebulizer to free-breathing animals. The nebulizer was driven by compressed air
with a flow of 8 liters per minute. The time to deliver the solution was 10 to 12 minutes.
Animals were restrained in an upright position in a specialized body harness for 4 hours. At
                                                                              99mTc-Human
the end of the 4-hour period animals received a single dose of aerosolized
serum albumin (3.1 mg/ml; containing approximately 20 mCi) from a Raindrop Nebulizer.
Animals were extubated immediately following delivery of the total dose of radio-tracer. A
baseline deposition image was obtained immediately after radio-aerosol administration.
Serial images of the lung were obtained at 15-minute intervals during the first 2 hours after
administration of the radio-tracer (representing hours 4 through 6 after drug administration)
and hourly for the next 2 hours after dosing for a total observation period of 4 hours. A
washout period of at least 7 days separated dosing sessions with different experimental

agents.
Statistics: Data were analyzed using SYSTAT for Windows, version 5. Data were analyzed
using a two-way repeated ANOVA (to assess overall effects), followed by a paried t-test to
identify differences between specific pairs. Significance was accepted when P was less than
or equal to 0.05. Slope values (calculated from data collected during the initial 45 minutes
after dosing in the t-zero assessment) for mean MCC curves were calculated using linear least
square regression to assess differences in the initial rates during the rapid clearance phase.

(bis(3 -aminopropyl)amino)ethoxy)phenyl)butylcarbamate (4)
         All non-aqueous reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of either nitrogen or
argon. Reagents and solvents were used as received from suppliers. Deionized water (DI
water) was used for workups and to prepare diluted solutions. Thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed using Merck silica-gel plates and visualized by UV light (254 nm) or
appropriate stain. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AVANCE-400
Ultra Shield spectrometer at 400 MHz for proton and 100 MHz for carbon, using CDCl 3,
D2 0, or DMSO-d6 as the solvents. The mass spectra were obtained on an Agilent
spectrometer using electrospray or atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI).
Step 1. Preparation of 5
A stirred solution of benzyl [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butyl]carbamate (17, 500 g, 1670 mmol,
1.0 equiv, ), tert-butyl (2-hydroxyethyl)carbamate (18, 350.0 g, 2170 mmol, 1.3 equiv), and
PPh 3 (568.0 g, 2170 mmol, 1.3 equiv, AVRA) in THF (7500 mL, 15 vol, Finar lot) was
charged with DIAD (438.0 g, 2170 mmol, 1.3 equiv, AVRA ) dropwise at 0 'C over 30 min,
and stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC
analysis (7:3 hexanes: EtOAc), which confirmed the presence of ~1O% compound 17. 18 (81

g, 503 mmol, 0.3 equiv), PPh 3 (132 g, 503 mmol, 0.3 equiv), and DIAD (102 g, 503 mmol,
0.3 equiv) were added at <10 'C and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h.
Having confirmed the complete consumption of compound 17, the solvent was evaporated
under vacuum to afford crude 19 (2.50 kg, crude), which was used as produced in the next
step.
Step 2. Preparation of 20
A stirred solution of 19 (2500 g) and HCl in dioxane (10,000 mL, Durga) was stirred at room
temperature for 3-4 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (30% EtOAc:
hexanes). After completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum to 1/3
volume. The resulting solid was triturated with MTBE (5000 mL, Savla Chemicals) and the
precipitate was filtered and dried under vacuum to afford 20 (370.0 g, 58%) as a white solid.
Step 3. Preparation of 22
Preparation of 20 Free Base
Compound 20 (140.0 g) was dissolved in DI water (1500 mL) and the pH was adjusted to Z9
using solid Na 2 CO 3 (Finar Reagents). The aqueous layer was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3 x 500
mL, MSN lot). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and
evaporated under vacuum to afford the free base of 20 [75 g, 60%].
Reductive Amination
A stirred solution of 20 free base [75 g, 219 mmol, 1.0 equiv] and 21 (95.0 g, 549 mmol, 2.5
equiv) in CH 2 C 2 (1500 mL, MSN ) was charged with CH 3 COOH (13.0 g, 219 mmol, 1.0
equiv, S.D. Fine-Chem ) and stirred for 30 min at room temperature, then cooled to 0-5 'C.
Na(OAc) 3BH (140.0 g, 660 mmol, Aldrich lot) was added portionwise over 30 min, and the
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The progress of the reaction was
monitored by TLC (9.5:0.5 CH2 Cl2 : MeOH, 2 runs). After the reaction was complete, the
reaction mixture was quenched with aqueous 1 N NaOH solution, adjusting the pH to ~9.
 The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (2 x 500 mL,
 MSN ). The combined organic layers were washed with water (1 x 300 mL), dried over
 anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , and evaporated under vacuum to afford crude 22 (160.0 g) as a thick,
 light green liquid. The crude was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 100-200

Step 4. Preparation of 4
A mixture of 22 [130.0 g, 198 mmol] and HCl in IPA (~20%, 650 mL, Durga Industries ) was
stirred for 3 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (9.5:0.5, CH 2 Cl 2 :
MeOH). After the completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated to 1/3 volume and
MTBE (650 mL, Savla Chemicals ) was added. A thick solid was precipitated; the solvent
was decanted. The mixture was solvent-swapped with toluene (2 x 500 mL) and MTBE (2 x
1000 mL, Savla Chemicals ) and dried under vacuum. The resulting sticky solid was stirred
in MTBE (1000 mL) for 1 h, the solvent was decanted, and the product was dried under
vacuum to afford 4 ( 94.0 g, 84%, AMRI) as a highly hygroscopic, off-white solid.

temperature for 2 h, monitoring the progress of the reaction by TLC (9:1, CH 2CI 2 :MeOH).
After the complete consumption of the 2-aminoethanol, DI water (2500 mL) was added and
the mixture was stirred for 10 min. The two layers were separated and the organic layer was
washed with 0.2 N HCl (3000 mL) and DI water (1000 mL), dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 ,
and evaporated under vacuum to afford 18 (482 g, 91%) as a pale green liquid.
Step 6. Preparation of 23
A stirred solution of 3-aminopropanol (250 g, 3334 mmol, 1.0 equiv, Alfa Aesar ) and TEA
(505 g, 5000 mmol, 1.5 equiv, AVRA ) in CH 2 Cl 2 (3000 mL, 12 vol, MSN 1) was charged
with (Boc)2 0 (872 g, 4000 mmol, 1.2 equiv, Globe Chemie lot) at 0-5 'C, and was stirred at
room temperature for 2 h, monitoring the progress of the reaction by TLC (9:1,
CH 2Cl 2 :MeOH). After the completion of the reaction, water (3000 mL) was added and the
mixture was stirred for 10 min. The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed
with 0.2 N HCl (3000 mL) and DI water (1000 mL), dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , and

Preparation of Compound 32
A solution of compound 26 (180 mg, 0.197 mmol) in MeOH (5.0 mL) was charged with
compound 31 (132 mg, 0.493 mmol) and AcOH (60 mg, 0.985 mmol). The reaction mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 20 min and NaCNBH 3 (57.3 mg, 0.788 mmol) was
added. After the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h, the solvent was
removed in vacuum. The residue was washed with saturated Na 2 CO 3 , azeotroped with
MeOH, and purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 10:1 CH 2 Cl 2/MeOH, 5:1:0.1
CHCl 3/MeOH/NH 4 0H) to afford compound 32 (183 mg, mixture) as a colorless oil, which
was used directly in the next step.
