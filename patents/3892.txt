                        METHODS OF TREATING CANCER
                             FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to a method of treating cancer. In particular, the
 5 present invention relates to inhibitors that target chromatin remodeling factors.
                                    BACKGROUND
   Cancer is the most common cause of death all over the world. In addition to
10 genetic changes of driver genes in cancer, epigenetic alterations such as
   changes     in  DNA    methylation,    histone    modifications, and   chromatin
   organization (e.g., nucleosome remodeling) impact gene expression and
   cellular gene function, and play an important role in the onset and progression
   of cancer. Bromodomains are proteins with acetyl-lysine binding modules and
15 have a key role in transcriptional activation. Clinical trials are underway
   evaluating inhibition of several members of the bromodomains and extra
   terminal (BET) family proteins (i.e., Brd2, 3, 4) in cancer.
   In view of the demand for treating cancer in a patient, more methods and
20 compositions that effectively treat cancer are desired.

                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION
  Example embodiments relate to methods of treating cancer. The methods
  include administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound to a
5 patient. The compound is represented by Formula 1:
                      H4+          H              H
                    -HN            N               N          O
                                01
                                    Formula 1.
  In one example embodiment, the cancer is associated with overexpression or
  high   expression   of  Bromodomain     Plant   Homeodomain      (PHD)   Finger
  Transcription Factor (BPTF).
  BPTF is the largest unit of nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF), which
  mainly regulates genes transcription and mediates histone modification
  essential for the development of key tissues in chromatin remodeling. High
  BPTF expression is significantly associated with tumor progression and
  promotes tumor cell proliferation and metastasis in cancer. In an example
  embodiment, the cancer includes but not limited to colorectal cancer,
  melanoma, breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and brain cancer. BPTF is
  also related with poor prognosis in cancer including lung adenocarcinomas.
  BPTF displays an essential role in tumor cell growth and survival by targeting
  multiple signaling pathways in cancer including non-small cell lung cancer.
  The bromodomain of BPTF specifically recognizes histone H4K16 acetylation,
  which performs its essential regulation of chromatin structure in development.
  Overexpression of BPTF that interacts with histone H4K16 acetylation
  promotes tumor cell growth, proliferation and metastasis. An example
  embodiment provides compound C620-0696 (i.e., the compound of Formula I)
                                         5

which inhibits the interaction between the bromodomain of BPTF and histone
H4K1 6 acetylation in cancer, such that the cancer can be treated.
An example embodiment provides a method to target a bromodomain factor
meditated tumorigenesis in cancers with small molecules. An example
embodiment also provides a BPTF inhibitor, compound C620-0696, that
targets the bromodomain of BPTF with -9.187 kcal/mol docking score
determined by the molecular docking analysis. Compound C620-0696 exhibits
a high binding affinity to the bromodomain of BPTH with KD of 35.5pM in vitro
by using biolayer interferometry (BLI). Compound C620-0696 is cytotoxic in
BPTF high expressing cancer cells. Compound           C620-0696 inhibits the
migration and colony formulation of cancer cells. Compound C620-0696
induces cell apoptosis by increasing the levels of cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) protein and blocked cell cycle by inhibiting the expression
of cyclin D1 in cancer cells. Compound C620-0696 suppresses the expression
of an oncogenic transcriptional regulator c-MYC, which can regulate cell
growth and drive tumorigenesis.
An example embodiment provides a method of treating cancer in a patient by
administering    compound     C620-0696   to the   patient. In one example
embodiment, tumor cells of the cancer express a higher level of BPTF than
normal cells express. In one example embodiment, tumor cells of the cancer
express a higher level of BPFT than healthy cells express. In one example
embodiment, the cancer is selected from a group consisting of colorectal
cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and brain cancer. In
one example embodiment, the cancer is non-small cell lung cancer.
In one example embodiment, compound C620-0696               is administered in
combination with one or more additional BPTF inhibitors to the patient.
In one example embodiment, a patient is diagnosed as the patient with the
cancer by determining an expression level of BPTF. If the expression level of
BPTF is higher than that of normal or healthy cells or tissues, the patient is
diagnosed as the cancer that can be treated by compound C620-0696.
                                       6

An example embodiment provides a method of treating a disease associated
with overexpression of BPTF. The disease associated with overexpression of
BPTF relates to the interaction between the overexpressed BPRF and histone
H4K16 acetylation. Compound C620-0696 inhibits the interaction between
BPTF and histone H4K16 acetylation and thereby ameliorate the progress of
the disease associated with overexpression of BPTF.
In one example embodiment, the disease associated with overexpression of
BPTF     includes but not limited to cancer including colorectal           cancer,
melanoma, breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and brain cancer.
An example embodiment provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes
compound C620-0696.
In one example embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is used to treat
cancer. In one example embodiment, tumor cells of the cancer express a
higher level of BPTF than normal cells do. In one example embodiment, the
cancer is selected from a group consisting of colorectal cancer, melanoma,
breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and brain cancer. In one example
embodiment, the cancer is non-small cell lung cancer. In one example
embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is used to treat a disease
associated with overexpression of BPTF.
In one example embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition includes one or
more    additional    BPTF    inhibitors.  In one    example   embodiment,     the
pharmaceutical composition includes a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient
or carrier. The pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier includes but
not limited to fillers (diluents), binders, disintegrating agents, lubricants, and
glidants.
In one example embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions can be
administered    by various routes, e.g., oral, subcutaneous, transdermal,
intramuscular, intravenous, or intraperitoneal. Routes of administering the
                                          7

pharmaceutical composition include systematic delivery or local delivery to an
organ or tissue.
Example 1 Material and Methods
Cell culture
A549 and H358 cell lines were stored in liquid nitrogen. A549 and H358 cells
were cultured by RPMI 1640 medium after recovery. RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/mL penicillin and
100 pg/mL streptomycin. A549 and H358 cells were grown at 370C incubator
with 5% C02.
MTT assay
All compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at -40
oC. HCC78 cells were plated in 96-well micro-plate and plated 3000 cells/well.
Then the 96-well micro-plate was put back in the incubator and overnight for
cell adhesion. After cell adhesion, the medium was removed and each well
was added with 100pl drug-containing medium. There were three different
concentrations for each drug and three duplicate wells for each concentration.
Then cell adhesion was cultured overnight for 72hr. After 72hr, each well was
added with 10pl of MTT solution and the 96-well plate was put back in the
incubator for 4hr. Then 100pl of the SDS solution (10%SDS and 0.1 mM HCL)
was added to each well and incubated at 37 oC for 4hr. Finally the absorbance
of the plate was measured by an absorbance reader (Tecan, Morrisvill, NC,
USA).
Colony formation assay
Cell survival was assessed by colony formation as previously described. A549
cells were seeded to six-well plate (500-1000 /well). Then cells were exposed
to various doses of compound C620-0696. After 7 days, colonies were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and stained with crystal violet for
10-15 minutes. Finally, the staining solution was slowly washed off with water
and the cells were air dried.
Wound healing assay
                                       8

A549 cells were seeded onto 6 well plates. When the cell confluence reached
about >90% and scratch wounds were made by scraping the cell layer across
each plate using the tip of 200pl pipette. Wounded cultures were incubated in
medium for 48hr, and then visualized by Olympus inverted microscopy to
assess cell migration ability.
Western blot analysis
The cell culture dish was placed in the ice and washed the cells with PBS.
Then the PBS was removed to ensure that the cells were lysed in cell lysis
buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Adherent cells were
scraped off from the plate and transferred the lysate into a new tube. The tube
was maintained at a constant agitation for 15 min in the ice. Then the tubes
were centrifuged at 40C 12000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred
into a new tube and 4Xloading buffer was added to the supernatant. Each
sample was boiled at 100 oC for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein (50pg) were
loaded into the wells of a SDS-PAGE gel, along with 3pl markers. The gel was
placed in transfer buffer in sandwich and was transferred to a nitrocellulose
filter membrane. After transferring for 3hr in an ice bucket at a constant
current of 300 mA, the membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in TBST
at room temperature for 1hr. The membrane was incubated overnight with the
primary antibody solution, against the target protein at 40C. The blot was
rinsed 3 times within 5min with TBST. The secondary antibody solution was
incubated for 1hr at room temperature. All primary antibodies were diluted
1:1000, while their recommended secondary antibodies were diluted 1:10000.
The LI-COR Odessy scanner (Befast, ME, USA) was used to detect the result
of western blot.
Kinetic binding analysis by biolayer interferometry.
The Octet Red96 system (Forte Bio, Pall) was used to determine the binding
between compound C620-0696 and BPTF. BPTF protein was loaded to
saturation onto anti-His capture sensors (ForteBio), then was placed for 2 min
in wells containing C620-0696 (concentrations: 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100,
                                        9

   200pM). The baseline and dissociation steps were carried out in the kinetics
   buffer as per the instrument manufacturer's recommendations. Kinetic binding
   data in all cases were adequately described accurately by a 1:1 binding model.
   Molecular docking
   The 3D structure of BRD4-benzoisoxazoloazepine 3 complex (PDBID: 5HMO)
   was obtained from PDB database. After the preparation of BPTF with Prep
   Wiz in Maestro (Schrodinger 2015), a grid file was generated centered on
   benzoisoxazoloazepine 3 in this complex. Compound C620-0696 was then
   preprocessed by LigPrep under OPLS-2005 force field. Finally, Glide with the
   standard precision (SP) scoring mode was used to dock compound C620
   0696 into BPTF binding pocket. The pose with the lowest docking score was
   chosen for further binding mode analysis.
   Example 2 A small-molecule compound C620-0696 identified as an inhibitor
   of the bromodomain ligand of BPTF
   Figure 1A shows the interaction 100 between compound C620-0696 and
   BPTF.     The   docking    site between   compound     C620-0696     and    the
   bromodomain of BPTF is shown in the red circle of Figure 1A.
 5
   Compound C620-0696 was identified as a small molecule that inhibits the
   interaction between the bromodomain of BPTF and H4K16ac. The molecular
   docking calculation was performed on analyzing the interaction of the
   bromodomain of BPTF with compound C620-0696 by Induced Fit Docking
10 module in Schrodingerl5 software. After computationally docking and testing,
   the small-molecule compound C620-0696 as the BPTF inhibitor has the
   docking score -9.187kcal/mol.
   Figure 1B shows the binding mode 200 between compound C620-0696 and
15 the bromodomain of BPTF. Green dashed lines represent hydrogen bonds.
   The    large  aromatic   plane of compound     C620-0696     inserted  into   a
   hydrophobic pocket including Pro92, AsplOl, Tyr105, Asn148 and Phe154.
   When interacting with the bromodomain of BPTF, compound C620-0696
                                         10

   formed five hydrogen bonds with residue Pro92, AsplOl, Tyr105 and Asn148
   as shown in Figure 1B. In addition, compound C620-0696 also formed pai-pai
   stacking interaction with Phe154, further strengthening the binding between
   the bromodomain of BPTF and compound C620-0696.
 5 Example 3 Kinetics of the interaction between compound C620-0696 and the
   bromodomain ligand of BPTF
   Figure 2A is a graph 200 showing the binding affinity of the bromodomain of
   BPTF with compound C620-0696 by Biolayer interferometry assay (BLI). BLI
10 is a label-free technology for measuring biomolecular interactions. The
   bromodomain was immobilized on the streptavidin (SA) biosensors, and then
   mixed with different concentration of compound C620-0696 at 3.125, 6.25,
   12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200pM. Finally, the steady-state analysis was performed to
   obtain the binding affinity with KD value of 35.5pM (Figure 2B). These results
15 indicated that compound C620-0696 exhibited a high binding affinity to the
   bromodomain of BPTF.
   Example 3 Cytotoxicity of compound C620-0696 in non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC) cells with high BPTF expression
20
   Figure 3A shows the western blot analysis 300 for the BPTF expression in the
   Human Bronchial Epithelial Cell (BEAS-2B), A549 and H358 cells.
   To investigate whether compound C620-0696 could inhibit BPTF function in
25 vitro, BPTF high expressing NSCLC cell lines (A549 and H358) as the cell
   models were selected for this study, compared to BEAS-2B as shown in
   Figure 3A. GAPDH was used as loading control. The result of Figure 3A
   shows that the expressions of BPTF in A549 and H358 cells are higher than
   that in BEAS-2B.
30
   Figure 3B is a graph 302 showing the effect of compound C620-0696 on the
   cell viability of A549 cells. A549 cells were treated by different concentrations
   of compound C620-0696, i.e. 3, 6, 9 and 12pM for 72hr. Figure 3C is a graph
                                            11

   304 showing the effect of compound C620-0696 on the cell viability of H358
   cells. H358 cells were treated by different concentrations of compound C620
   0696, i.e. 3, 6, 9 and 12pM for 72hr. Figure 3D is a table 306 showing the IC5o
   value in A549 and H358 cells treated by compound C620-0696. Compound
 5 C620-0696 inhibited cell viability with   IC50 of 11.2pM for A549 cells and
   6.72pM for H358 cells at 72hr treatment, respectively. These results indicated
   that compound C620-0696 exhibited significantly cytotoxic effect on NSCLC
   with high BPTF expression.
10 Example 4 Effect of compound C620-0696 on the inhibition of the migratory
   capacity of A549 cells
   Figure 4 are drawings 400 showing the wound healing assay in A549 cells
   treated by compound C620-0696.
15
   To evaluate the effect of C620-0696 on cell migration and cellular processes
   in NSCLC, the wound healing assay was employed to assess the directional
   cell motility in A549 cells. The results of Figure 4 indicated that over time
   A549 cells migrated more slowly in compound C620-0696 treatment group
20 compared with the control cells, supporting that inhibition of BPTF reduced
   the migratory capacity of NSCLC cells.
   Example 5 Effect of compound C620-0696 on the inhibition of colony
   formation of A549 cells
   Figure 5 shows colony formation assay 500 in A549 cells treated by
   compound C620-0696.
   To determine the effect of the compound C620-0696 on A549 cell growth
   behavior, a colony formation assay was performed. A549 cells were treated
   by different concentrations of compound C620-0696, i.e. 0 (control group), 0.5,
25 1, 1.5pM. As shown in Figure 5, a significant loss of colony formation in A549
   cells treated with compound C620-0696 in dose-dependent manner was
                                          12

   observed, compared with        control group.   These   results indicated that
   compound C620-0696 inhibited cell growth and proliferation.
   Example 6 Effect of compound C620-0696 in inducing apoptosis in H358 cells
 5 and suppressing cell cycle
   Figure 6 shows the western blot analysis 600 for the expression level of
   PARP1, c-MYC and Cyclin D1. GAPDH was used as loading control in H358
   cells treated with compound C620-0696 at 0, 3, 6, 9pM for 24hr.
10
   To determine whether the induction of apoptosis in NSCLC cells was
   contributed by compound C620-0696-mediated growth inhibition, cleaved
   PARP1 in compound C620-0696 treated H358 cells was detected. Compound
   C620-0696     significantly increased     the levels of   cleaved   PARP1   at
15 concentration of 9pM as shown in Figure 6. Compound C620-0696 induced
   apoptosis by increasing the levels of cleaved PARP1. In addition, compound
   C620-0696 reduced the expression of cyclin D1 related to cell cycle in H358
   cells, and suppressed the expression of an oncogenic transcriptional regulator
   c-MYC (Figure 6), which was a BPTF target gene in tumorigenesis. These
20 data suggested that compound C620-0696 inhibited BPTF transcriptional
   regulation of its target oncogenic genes, thereby leading to cell apoptosis
   induction and cell cycle suppression in NSCLC.
   Figures 1-6 shows that compound C620-0696 as an inhibitor could target the
   bromodomain of chromatin remodeling factor BPTF. Compound C620-0696
   exhibited a high binding affinity to the bromodomain of BPTF. Moreover, MTT
   assay showed compound C620-0696 was cytotoxic in BPTF high expressing
   NSCLC cell lines H358 and A549. Compound C620-0696 also inhibited the
   migration and colony formation of A549 cells. In addition, compound C620
   0696 induced apoptosis in H358 cells and suppressed the expression of c
   MYC and Cyclin D1. These findings indicated an effective strategy to target a
   bromodomain factor meditated tumorigenesis in cancers with compound
   C620-0696. It also provides methods of treating diseases associated with high
   expression of BPTF by targeting the bromodomain of BPTF.

   Figure 7 shows a method 700 of treating cancer in a patient. Block 701 states
   diagnosing a patient with a cancer. In one example embodiment, a biological
   sample is obtained from a patient. Whether BPTF is overexpressed in the
   biological sample is detected by comparing a level of BPTF overexpression in
   the biological sample with a level of BPTF expression in a control group. If the
   level of the BPTF expression in the biological sample is higher than that in the
   control group, the patient is diagnosed as the patient with the cancer.
   In one example embodiment, the biological sample is a tissue sample, a blood
   sample or a plasma sample from the patient. In one example embodiment, the
   biological sample is obtained by biopsies. In one example embodiment, the
   control group is a biological sample from a normal or healthy sample, cells or
   tissues. In one example embodiment, the control group is a biological sample
   from a normal or healthy person.
   Block 703 states administering compound C620-0696 to the patient to treat
   the cancer.
 5 In one example embodiment, the compound is administered directly or in the
   form of pharmaceutical compositions with suitable carriers or excipients. In
   one example embodiment, suitable routes of administration may, for example,
   include oral, rectal, transmucosal, nasal, or intestinal administration and
   parenteral delivery. The compound or the pharmaceutical composition that
10 includes the compound can be administered locally. For example, the
   compound can be delivered via injection or in a targeted drug delivery system,
   such as a depot or sustained release formulation.
   In one example embodiment, the cancer is the cancer associated with
15 overexpression of BPTF. In one example embodiment, the cancer is the
   cancer whose tumor cells express a higher level of BPTF than normal cells
   express. In one example embodiment, the cancer is lung cancer. In one
   example embodiment, the cancer is non-small cell lung cancer.
