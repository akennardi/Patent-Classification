            STERILIZATION SYSTEM WITH INDEPENDENT VACUUM CHAMBERS
                                              BACKGROUND
[0001]             Re-usable medical devices such as certain surgical instruments, endoscopes, etc.,
          may be sterilized before re-use in order to minimize the likelihood that a contaminated
          device might be used on a patient, which could cause an infection in the patient. Various
          sterilization techniques may be employed, such as steam, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic
          acid, and vapor phase sterilization, either with or without a gas plasma and ethylene oxide
          (EtO). Each of these methods may depend to a certain extent on the diffusion rates of the
          sterilization fluids (e.g., gases) upon or into the medical devices to be sterilized.
[0002]             Before sterilization, medical devices may be packaged within containers or
          pouches having a semi-permeable barrier that allows transmission of the sterilizing
          fluid-sometimes referred to as a sterilant-but prevents admission of contaminating
          organisms, particularly post-sterilization and until the package is opened by medical
          personnel. For the sterilization cycle to be efficacious, the contaminating organisms
          within the package must be killed because any organisms that survive the sterilization
          cycle could multiply and re-contaminate the medical device. Diffusion of the sterilant
          may be particularly problematic for medical devices that have diffusion-restricted spaces
          therein because these diffusion-restricted spaces may reduce the likelihood that a
          sterilization cycle may be effective.     For example, some endoscopes have one or more
          long narrow lumens into which the sterilant must diffuse in sufficient concentration for
          sufficient time to achieve a successful sterilization cycle.
[00031             Sterilization of medical devices may be performed with an automated sterilization
          system such as a STERRAD® System by Advanced Sterilization Products of Irvine,
          California. Examples of automated sterilization systems are described in U.S. Pat. No.

          Method for Sterilizing Medical Devices," filed April 1, 2016, the disclosure of which is
          incorporated by reference herein.
[0004]             Some sterilization systems may use vaporized chemical sterilants or chemical gas
          such as hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, ozone, chlorine dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, etc.,
          to sterilize medical devices. Examples of such systems are described in U.S. Pat. No.
          6,365,102,    entitled  "Method   of Enhanced      Sterilization with Improved      Material
          Compatibility," issued April 2, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference
          herein, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,325,972, entitled "Apparatus and Process for Concentrating a
          Liquid Sterilant and Sterilizing Articles Therewith," issued December 4, 2001, the
          disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Some such systems provide a
          hydrogen peroxide/gas plasma sterilization system comprising a vacuum chamber and
          plasma source and increased concentration of hydrogen peroxide for sterilization. Some
          such systems may have difficulty sterilizing lumens of some medical devices if their
          length exceeds a certain value; or the processing time of such systems may still not be
          fast enough for some applications. Thus, some medical devices such as long and/or
          narrow flexible endoscopes may not be completely sterilized by these systems due to the
          insufficient reach of sterilant vapor to the inside of the channels. Such medical devices
          might therefore only be disinfected without being sterilized.     Sterilization systems that
          use ethylene oxide may have a relatively long processing time (e.g., longer than 24
          hours), which may be undesirable in some cases.
[0005]             Operator error may result in medical devices that are erroneously believed to be
          decontaminated being returned to service. Confirming that a sterilization cycle has been
          efficacious may help medical personnel avoid using a contaminated medical device on a
          patient. The sterilized medical device might not itself be checked for contaminating
                                                   -2

          organisms because such an activity may introduce other contaminating organisms to the
          medical device, thereby re-contaminating it. Thus, an indirect check may be performed
          using a sterilization indicator. A sterilization indicator is a device that may be placed
          alongside or in proximity to a medical device being subject to a sterilization cycle, such
          that the sterilization indicator is subject to the same sterilization cycle as the medical
          device.      For instance, a biological indictor having a predetermined quantity of
          microorganisms may be placed into a sterilization chamber alongside a medical device
          and subject to a sterilization cycle. After the cycle is complete, the microorganisms in the
          biological indicator may be cultured to determine whether any of the microorganisms
          survived the cycle. The presence or absence of living microorganisms in the biological
          indicator will indicate whether the sterilization cycle was effective.
[00061             While a variety of systems and methods have been made and used for surgical
          instrument sterilization, it is believed that no one prior to the inventor(s) has made or
          used the technology as described herein.

[00181             I.      Overview of Exemplary Sterilization System
[0019]             FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary sterilizing cabinet (150) that is operable to sterilize
          medical devices such as endoscopes, etc. Sterilizing cabinet (150) of the present example
                                                     -4

          includes a sterilization chamber (152), which is configured to receive one or more
          medical devices for sterilization.     In some other versions (e.g., as described further
          below), sterilizing cabinet (150) may include more than one sterilization chamber (152).
          While not shown, sterilizing cabinet (150) also includes a door that opens and closes
          sterilization chamber (152) in response to actuation of a kick plate. An operator may
          thereby open and close sterilization chamber (152) in a hands-free fashion. Of course,
          any other suitable features may be used to provide selective access to sterilization
          chamber.      Sterilizing cabinet (150) also includes a sterilization module (156) that is
          operable to dispense a sterilant into sterilization chamber (152) in order to sterilize
          medical devices contained in sterilization chamber (152).          In the present example,
          sterilization module (156) is configured to receive replaceable sterilant cartridges (158)
          containing a certain amount of sterilant. By way of example only, each sterilant cartridge
          (158) may contain enough sterilant to perform five sterilization procedures.
[0020]             In the present example, sterilization module (156) is operable to apply a sterilant
          in the form of a vapor within sterilization chamber (152).        By way of example only,
          sterilization module (156) may comprise a combination of a vaporizer and a condenser.
          The vaporizer may include a chamber that receives a particular concentration of sterilant
          solution (e.g., a liquid hydrogen peroxide solution with a concentration of about 59%
          nominal, or between about 20% and about 59%, or between about 53% and about
          59.6%); where the sterilant solution changes phase from liquid to vapor. The condenser
          may provide condensation of the sterilant solution vapor, and the concentration of the
          sterilant solution may be thereby increased (e.g., from about 59% nominal to somewhere
          between about 83% nominal and about 95% nominal), by removal of water vapor.
          Alternatively, any other suitable methods and components may be used to apply sterilant
          in the form of a vapor within sterilization chamber (152).     It should also be understood
          that condensation within sterilization chamber (152) may serve as a potential reservoir of
          sterilant that could be tapped by manipulation of conditions in a sterilization chamber
          (152) to re-vaporize the condensation.
[0021]             In some examples, to supplement the application of the sterilant in the form of a
          vapor, the sterilant may also be applied to the inside of lumen(s) and/or other internal
                                                    -5
3429543vl

          spaces within the medical device and/or the outside of the medical device, before the
          medical device is placed in sterilization chamber (152).        By way of example only,
          sterilant may be applied in liquid form to the inside of lumen(s) and/or other internal
          spaces within the medical device and/or the outside of the medical device. As another
          merely illustrative example, a capsule that contains liquid sterilant may be placed in in
          fluid communication with the lumen(s) after activation of sterilization cabinet (150). In
          versions where a sterilant is applied to the inside of lumen(s) and/or other internal spaces
          within the medical device and/or the outside of the medical device, before the medical
          device is placed in sterilization chamber (152), the sterilant may evaporate while a
          vacuum is applied to sterilization chamber (152) (e.g., as described in greater detail
          below with reference to block 310 of FIG. 3) and even after vacuum is applied; and
          provide more concentration of sterilant to the areas of the medical device with less
          penetration range, thereby further promoting effective sterilization.
[0022]             Sterilizing cabinet (150) of the present example further includes a touch screen
          display (160). Touch screen display (160) is operable to render the various user interface
          display screens, such as those described in U.S. Provisional Pat. App. No. 62/316,722,
          the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.       Of course, touch screen
          display (160) may display various other screens as well.      Touch screen display (160) is
          further configured to receive user input in the form of the user contacting touch screen
          display (160) in accordance with conventional touch screen technology. In addition, or in
          the alternative, sterilizing cabinet (150) may include various other kinds of user input
          features, including but not limited to buttons, keypads, keyboards, a mouse, a trackball,
          etc.
[00231             Sterilizing cabinet (150) of the present example further includes a processor
          (162), which is in communication with sterilization module (156) and with touch screen
          display (160).      Processor (162) is operable to execute control algorithms to drive
          sterilization module (156) in accordance with user input.        Processor (162) is further
          operable to execute instructions to display the various screens on touch screen display
          (160); and to process instructions received from a user via touch screen display (160)
          (and/or via other user input features).     Processor (162) is also in communication with
                                                    -6

          various other components of sterilization cabinet (150) and is thereby operable to drive
          those components and/or process input and/or other data from those components.
          Various suitable components and configurations that may be used to form processor
          (162) will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.
[0024]             Sterilizing cabinet (150) of the present example further includes an identification
          tag reader (166), which is operable to read an identification tag of a biological indicator
          as described herein.      By way of example only, identification tag reader (166) may
          comprise an optical reader that is operable to read an optical identification tag (e.g.,
          barcode, QR code, etc.) of a biological indicator.         In addition, or in the alternative,
          identification tag reader (166) may comprise RFID reader that is operable to read an
          RFID identification tag of a biological indicator.         Various suitable components and
          configurations that may be used to form identification tag reader (166) will be apparent to
          those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Data received through
          identification tag reader (166) is processed through processor (162).          Such data may
          indicate the contents of the biological indicator, the source of the biological indicator,
          other identifying information associated with the biological indicator, and/or various
          other kinds of information as will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.
[0025]             Sterilizing cabinet (150) of the present example further includes a memory (168),
          which is operable to store control logic and instructions and that are executed by
          processor (162) to drive components such as sterilization module (156), touch screen
          display (160), communication module (154), and identification tag reader (166).
          Memory (168) may also be used to store results associated with setup of a sterilization
          cycle, performance of a load conditioning cycle, performance of a sterilization cycle,
          and/or various other kinds of information. Various suitable forms that memory (168)
          may take, as well as various ways in which memory (168) may be used, will be apparent
          to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.
[00261             Sterilizing cabinet (150) of the present example further includes a printer (170),
          which is operable to print information such as results associated with setup of a
          sterilization cycle, performance of a load conditioning cycle, performance of a
          sterilization cycle, and/or various other kinds of information. By way of example only,

          printer (170) may comprise a thermal printer, though of course any other suitable kind of
          printer may be used. Various suitable forms that printer (170) may take, as well as
          various ways in which printer (170) may be used, will be apparent to those of ordinary
          skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. It should also be understood that printer
          (170) is merely optional and may be omitted in some versions.
[00271             Sterilizing cabinet (150) of the present example further includes a vacuum source
          (180) and a venting valve (182). Vacuum source (180) is in fluid communication with
          sterilization chamber (152) and is also in communication with processor (162).       Thus,
          processor (162) is operable to selectively activate vacuum source (180) in accordance
          with one or more control algorithms. When vacuum source (180) is activated, vacuum
          source (180) is operable to reduce the pressure within sterilization chamber (152) as will
          be described in greater detail below. Venting valve (182) is also in fluid communication
          with sterilization chamber (152).     In addition, venting valve (182) is in communication
          with processor (162) such that processor (162) is operable to selectively activate venting
          valve (182) in accordance with one or more control algorithms.          When venting valve
          (182) is activated, venting valve (182) is operable to vent sterilization chamber (152) to
          atmosphere as will be described in greater detail below. Various suitable components
          that may be used to provide vacuum source (180) and venting valve (182) will be

[00301             FIG. 2 depicts a high level flowchart of an exemplary set of steps that sterilizing
          cabinet (150) could perform to sterilize a used medical device, such as an endoscope.
          Sterilizing cabinet (150) may be configured to perform one or more sterilization cycles,
          with different sterilization cycles being appropriate for different types and quantities of
          medical devices. Thus, as an initial step, sterilizing cabinet (150) may display one or
          more available sterilization cycles via touch screen display (160) and then receive a
          sterilization cycle selection (block 200) from the user.
[0031]             Sterilizing cabinet (150) may also display instructions indicating whether a
          biological indicator should be used with the selected sterilization cycle, and receive a
          biological indicator identification (block 202). Such a biological indicator identification
          (block 202) may be provided via identification tag reader (166), via touch screen display
          (160), or otherwise.     A biological indicator may be placed inside sterilization chamber
          (152) of sterilizing cabinet (150) before the sterilization cycle begins and may remain in
          sterilization chamber (152) during the sterilization cycle. The user may thus identify the
          particular biological indicator (block 202) before the biological indicator is placed in
          sterilization chamber (152). In versions where more than one sterilization chamber (152)
          is included in a sterilizing cabinet (150), separate biological indicators may be placed in
          separate    sterilization chambers     (152).    Each biological     indicator may    contain
          microorganisms that are responsive to a particular sterilization cycle. Upon completion
          of the sterilization cycle, the biological indicator may be tested for the microorganisms in
          order to provide a measure of the effectiveness of the sterilization cycle. A biological
          indicator may not necessarily be required for all sterilization cycles, but may be required
          based on hospital rules or local regulations.
[0032]             Selection of a sterilization cycle (block 200) and identification of a biological
          indicator (block 202) may define one or more requirements for the configuration and
          arrangement of medical devices within sterilization chamber (152).          Thus, in order to
          provide preparation for the sterilization cycle (204) once the sterilization cycle has been
          selected (block 200) and the biological indicator has been identified (block 202),
          sterilizing cabinet (150) may provide a display via touch screen display (160) indicating a
          proper medical device placement. This display may serve as a visual guide to a user's
                                                     -9

          placement of medical device(s) (and perhaps a biological indicator) within sterilization
          chamber (152) of sterilizing cabinet (150), based on the sterilization cycle selection
          (block 200). A door of sterilization chamber (152) may be opened to enable the user to
          place the medical device(s) (and perhaps a biological indicator) within sterilization
          chamber (152) as instructed.
[0033]             Once the user has placed the medical device in sterilization chamber (152) based
          on these instructions, the user may press a start button or other button indicating that
          medical device placement is complete. In some versions, sterilizing cabinet (150) is
          configured to automatically verify proper medical device placement. By way of example
          only, sterilizing cabinet (150) may employ photo sensors, imaging devices, weight
          sensors, and/or other components to verify proper medical device placement in
          sterilization chamber (152).    It should be understood, however, that some versions of
          sterilizing cabinet (150) may lack the capability of automatically verifying proper
          placement of a medical device within sterilization chamber (152).
[0034]             If medical device placement is verified and/or the user has otherwise completed
          the cycle preparation (block 204), sterilizing cabinet (150) may start a load conditioning
          process (block 206).      Load conditioning process (block 206) prepares sterilization
          chamber (152) and the medical device(s) within sterilization chamber (152) for optimal
          sterilization during a sterilization cycle.   Conditioning may include controlling and
          optimizing one or more characteristics of sterilization chamber (152).         For example,
          during load conditioning, sterilizing cabinet (150) may continuously monitor the level of
          moisture within sterilization chamber (152) while reducing the level of moisture by, for
          example, circulating and dehumidifying the air of sterilization chamber (152), creating a
          vacuum within sterilization chamber (152), heating sterilization chamber (152), and/or
          other methods for dehumidifying a sealed chamber. This may continue until sterilizing
          cabinet (150) determines that an acceptable level of moisture has been reached.
[0035]             As part of load conditioning cycle (block 206), sterilizing cabinet (150) may also
          continuously detect the temperature within sterilization chamber (152) while heating
          sterilization chamber (152) by, for example, convection of heated air, conduction through
          an interior surface of sterilization chamber (152), and/or using other techniques. This
                                                  -10
3429543vl

          may continue until sterilizing cabinet (150) determines that an acceptable internal
          temperature has been reached.          Various conditioning actions such as controlling
          temperature or humidity may be performed in parallel or in sequence. It should also be
          understood that load conditioning cycle (block 206) may verify that sterilization chamber
          (152) is sealed; verifying contents of sterilization chamber (152); checking physical
          characteristics of the contents of sterilization chamber (152) such as content volume,
          content weight, or other characteristics; and/or performing one or more conditioning steps
          that may include chemical treatment, plasma treatment, or other types of treatment to
          reduce moisture, raise temperature, and/or otherwise prepare the medical devices in
          sterilization chamber (152) for sterilization cycle (block 208).
[0036]             While the one or more conditioning actions are being performed as part of load
          conditioning cycle (block 206), sterilizing cabinet (150) may display information via
          touch screen display (160) indicating to a user the duration of time before sterilization
          cycle (block 208) performance may begin. Once all load conditioning criteria have been
          successfully met, load conditioning cycle (block 206) is complete, and sterilization cycle
          (block 208) may then be performed.         It should therefore be understood that sterilizing
          cabinet (150) is configured such that sterilization cycle (block 208) is not actually
          initiated until after load conditioning cycle (block 206) is complete. It should also be
          understood that load conditioning cycle (block 206) may be omitted or varied in some
          versions of sterilizing cabinet (150) operation.
[00371              As noted above, sterilization cabinet (150) may begin performing the sterilization
          cycle (block 208) automatically and immediately after load conditioning (block 206) has
          been completed.       Sterilization cycle (block 208) may include exposing the medical
          device(s) in the sterilizing chamber to pressurized sterilant gas, further heat treatment,
          chemical treatment, plasma treatment, vacuum treatment, and/or other types of
          sterilization procedures.       During performance of sterilization cycle (block 208),
          sterilization cabinet (150) may display information via touch screen display (160) such as
          a duration remaining for sterilization cycle (block 208), the current stage of sterilization
          cycle (block 208) (e.g. plasma, vacuum, injection, heat, chemical treatment), and/or other
          information.

[00381             In some versions, sterilization cycle (block 208) includes the exemplary sub-steps
          shown in FIG. 3.       FIGS. 6 and 7 show exemplary alternative sub-steps that may be
          performed during sterilization cycle (block 208). In the example shown in FIG. 3, the
          cycle begins with a vacuum being applied (block 310) within sterilization chamber (152).
          In order to provide such a vacuum, processor (162) may activate vacuum source (180) in
          accordance with a control algorithm. Processor (162) will then determine (block 312)
          whether a sufficient vacuum pressure level has been reached within sterilization chamber
          (152).    By way of example only, processor (162) may monitor data from one or more
          pressure sensors within sterilization chamber (152) as part of determination step (block
          312).    Alternatively, processor (162) may simply activate vacuum source (180) for a
          predetermined time period and assume that the appropriate pressure has been reached in
          sterilization (152) based upon the duration for which vacuum source (180) is activated.
          Other suitable ways in which processor (162) may determine (block 312) whether a
          sufficient pressure level has been reached within sterilization chamber (152) will be
          apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Until the
          appropriate pressure level has been reached within sterilization chamber (152), vacuum
          source (180) will remain activated.
[00391             Once sterilization chamber (152) reaches an appropriate pressure level (e.g.,
          between about 0.2 torr and about 10 torr), processor (162) then activates sterilization
          module (156) to apply a sterilant (block 314) in sterilization chamber (152). This stage of
          the process may be referred to as the "transfer phase."        By way of example only, the
          sterilant may comprise a vapor of oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, peroxy
          acids (e.g. peracetic acid, performic acid, etc.), ozone, or a mixture thereof. Furthermore,
          the sterilant may comprise chlorine dioxide.         Various other suitable forms that the
          sterilant may take are described herein; while other forms will be apparent to those of
          ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. It should also be understood that,
          in some versions, the sterilant may be applied (block 314) in different ways based on the
          user's selection of cycle (block 200) as described above.
[0040]             Once the sterilant has been applied (block 314) to sterilization chamber (152),
          processor (162) monitors the time (block 316) to determine whether a sufficient,
                                                    -12
3429543vl

          predetermined duration has passed. By way of example only, this predetermined duration
          may be anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes.              Until the predetermined
          duration has passed, sterilization chamber (152) remains in a sealed state at the above
          noted predetermined pressure level, with the applied sterilant acting upon the medical
          device(s) contained within sterilization chamber (152).        In some variations, processor
          (162) may monitor data from one or more pressure sensors within sterilization chamber
          (152) to conform whether a sufficient vacuum pressure is being maintained within
          sterilization chamber (152).
[0041]             After the predetermined duration has passed, processor (162) activates (block
          318) venting valve (182) to vent sterilization chamber (152) to atmosphere.          In some
          versions, sterilization chamber (152) is allowed to reach atmospheric pressure, while in
          other versions sterilization chamber (152) only reaches sub-atmospheric pressure.         The
          venting stage of the process may be referred to as the "diffusion phase." In the present
          example, the sterilization cycle is then complete (block 320) after completion of the
          diffusion phase. In some other instances, vacuum is again applied to sterilization chamber
          (152) after completion of the diffusion phase; and then a plasma is applied to sterilization
          chamber (152), It should be understood that the entire sterilization cycle shown in FIG. 3
          (including the above-noted variation where a subsequent vacuum then sterilization are
          applied) may be repeated one or more times after being completed once. In other words,
          a medical device may remain within sterilization chamber (152) and experience two or
          more iterations of the entire cycle shown in FIGS. 3 (including the above-noted variation
          where a subsequent vacuum then sterilization are applied). The number of iterations may
          vary based on the cycle selection (block 200), which may be influenced by the particular
          kind of medical device that is being sterilized in sterilization chamber (152).
[0042]             Upon completion of the sterilization cycle (block 208), sterilization cabinet (150)
          may cycle the results (block 210) of the sterilization cycle (block 208). For instance, if
          sterilization cycle (block 208) was canceled or unable to complete due to error or by a
          user action, sterilizing cabinet (150) may remain sealed and may also display a
          sterilization cycle cancellation message via touch screen display (160); as well as various
          details relating to the sterilization cycle, such as date, time, configuration, elapsed time,
                                                    -13
3429543vl

          sterilization cycle operator, the stage at which the sterilization cycle failed, and other
          information that may be used to identify why the sterilization cycle. If sterilization cycle
          (block 208) is completed successfully, sterilization cabinet (150)           may display a
          notification    via touch screen display (160)        indicating successful   completion of
          sterilization cycle (block 208).       In addition, sterilization cabinet (150) may display
          information such as sterilization cycle identifier, sterilization cycle type, start time,
          duration, operator, and other information (666).
[00431             In some variations, a pre-plasma may be applied in the sterilization cycle (block
          208) to heat up the medical device contained in sterilization chamber (152). By way of
          example only, plasma may be applied between applying a vacuum (block 310) and
          applying sterilant (block 314). In addition, or in the alternative, a post-plasma may be
          applied at the end of sterilization cycle (block 208) to degrade any residual sterilant that
          may be adsorbed to the surface of the medical device contained in sterilization chamber
          (152).    It should be understood that, before applying the post-plasma, a vacuum would
          first need to be applied to sterilization chamber (152).
[0044]             By way of example only, the process depicted in FIG. 3 may be carried out at
          temperatures where the walls of sterilization chamber (152) are between about 30'C and
          about 56'C, or more particularly between about 47'C and about 56'C, or even more
          particularly about 50'C; and where the temperature of the medical device in sterilization
          chamber (152) is between about 5-10 0 C and about 40-55C.
[0045]             In addition to the foregoing, sterilizing cabinet (150) may be configured to
          perform sterilization processes in accordance with at least some of the teachings of U.S.
          Pat. No. 6,939,519, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein; U.S. Pat.

[00461             While the foregoing examples are described in the context of sterilizing medical
          devices, and particularly endoscopes, it should be understood that the teachings herein
          may also be readily applied in the context of sterilizing various other kinds of articles.
          The teachings are not limited to endoscopes or other medical devices.           Other suitable
          articles that may be sterilized in accordance with the teachings herein will be apparent to
          those of ordinary skill in the art.
[00471              III.  Overview of Exemplary Sterilization System with Independent Vacuum
                          Chambers
[00481             As noted above, after sterilant vapor is applied (block 314) in a sterilization
          chamber (152) and remains in sterilization chamber (152) for a certain period of time, the
          sterilant is vented to atmosphere (block 318). It should be understood that the vented
          sterilant vapor is lost to the atmosphere and cannot be re-used.            Thus, if another
          sterilization cycle (block 208) is desired, new sterilant vapor must be added into
          sterilization chamber (152).        Once the additional sterilization cycle (block 208) is
          completed, the sterilant vapor is once again vented to the atmosphere and cannot be re
          used. Sterilization of medical devices having long, narrow lumens may require multiple
          sterilization cycles (block 208).      Consequently, multiple doses of new sterilant vapor
          may be required in order to provide for sufficient sterilization.
[0049]             In view of the foregoing, it may be desirable to provide a variation of sterilization
          cabinet (150) that enables re-use of the same sterilant vapor, thereby enabling repetition
          of sterilization cycles (block 208) while avoiding (or at least reducing) the loss of
          sterilant while repeating sterilization cycles (block 208). In addition, or in the alternative,
          it may be desirable to provide a variation of sterilization cabinet (150) that allows
          dynamic adjustment of sterilant dosage to account for sterilant depletion that occurs via
          breakdown, absorption, adsorption, reaction, condensation, etc.        A merely illustrative
          example of a variation of sterilization cabinet (150) that may be used to provide either or
          both of these functionalities is described in greater detail below.
[0050]             FIG. 4 depicts an exemplary sterilizing cabinet (450) that is operable to sterilize
          two or more medical devices, such as endoscopes, etc., simultaneously.              Sterilizing

          cabinets may comprise at least two sterilization chambers.         Sterilizing cabinet (450) of
          the present example comprises two sterilization chambers (453, 454), which are each
          configured to receive at least one medical device for sterilization.         While not shown,
          sterilizing cabinet (450) also comprises two doors.          Each door opens and closes a
          respective one of sterilization chambers (453, 454) in response to actuation of one or
          more corresponding kick plates (not shown). An operator may thereby open and close
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) in a hands-free fashion. In some versions, sterilization
          chamber (453) may be opened and closed independently of sterilization chamber (454),
          and vice versa. Of course, any other suitable features may be used to provide selective
          access to sterilization chambers (453, 454).
[0051]             It should also be understood that, in some versions, one sterilization chamber
          (453) may be nested within the other sterilization chamber (454). As another merely
          illustrative variation, sterilization chambers (453, 454) may be positioned adjacent to
          each other, with one door being operable to selectively open and close both sterilization
          chambers (453, 454) simultaneously.         As still another merely illustrative variation,
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) may be positioned adjacent to each other, with a sliding
          wall separating sterilization chamber (453) from sterilization chamber (454).                In
          particular, when the sliding wall translates in a first direction, the sliding wall may reduce
          the capacity of sterilization chamber (453) while simultaneously increasing the capacity
          of sterilization chamber (454). When the sliding wall translates in a second direction, the
          sliding wall may reduce the capacity of sterilization chamber (454) while simultaneously
          increasing the capacity of sterilization chamber (453).        The sliding wall may thus be
          configured like a piston in a double acting cylinder.        Moreover, the sliding wall may
          provide transfer of sterilant from sterilization chamber (453) to sterilization chamber
          (454), and from sterilization chamber (454) to sterilization chamber (453), as will be
          described in greater detail below.
[0052]             Sterilizing cabinets may also comprise a pump in fluid communication with the at
          least two sterilization chambers.       Sterilizing cabinet (450) of the present example
          comprises pump (490) that is in fluid communication with first sterilization chamber
          (453) and second sterilization chamber (454).         Pump (490) is configured to transfer

          sterilant vapor from first sterilization chamber (453) to second sterilization chamber
          (454) and vice versa. Various suitable components and configurations that may be used
          to provide pump (490), including the capability of selectively pumping in a selected one
          of two opposite directions, will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of
          the teachings herein. It should also be understood that sterilization chambers (453, 454)
          may be configured such that one or lumens of endoscopes or other medical devices
          disposed in sterilization chambers (453, 454) provide a pathway for sterilant to pass
          between sterilization chambers (453, 454) as described below.                In other words,
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) may be configured such that sterilant must pass through
          one or lumens of endoscopes or other medical devices disposed in sterilization chambers
          (453, 454) in order for the sterilant to pass between sterilization chambers (453, 454) as
          described below. In addition, or in the alternative, sterilization chambers (453, 454) may
          be configured such that sterilant must pass through one or lumens of endoscopes or other
          medical devices disposed in sterilization chambers (453, 454) in order for the sterilant to
          pass from sterilization modules (456, 457) to sterilization chambers (453, 454) as
          described below.
[0053]             In some variations, two separate pumps are used-one pump to transfer sterilant
          vapor from first sterilization chamber (453) to second sterilization chamber (454) and
          another pump to transfer sterilant vapor from second sterilization chamber (454) to first
          sterilization chamber (453). In some versions, sterilization chambers (453, 454) may be
          selectively vented (by activating venting valves (482, 483) to assist in transfer of vapor
          from first sterilization chamber (453) to second sterilization chamber (454) and vice
          versa.
[0054]             Sterilizing cabinets may also comprise at least one sterilization module that is
          operable to dispense sterilant into one or more of the at least two sterilization chambers in
          order to sterilize medical devices contained in the sterilization chambers.         Sterilizing
          cabinet (450) of the present example comprises first sterilization module (456) and
          optional second sterilization module (457). First sterilization module (456) is operable to
          dispense sterilant into first sterilization chamber (453) and second sterilization module
          (457) is operable to dispense sterilant into second sterilization chamber (454). In the
                                                    -17

          present example, first sterilization module (456) is configured to receive replaceable
          sterilant cartridges (458) containing a certain amount of sterilant, and second sterilization
          module (457) is configured to receive replaceable sterilant cartridges (459) containing a
          certain amount of sterilant. By way of example only, each sterilant cartridge (458, 459)
          may each contain enough sterilant to perform one to fifty or five to ten sterilization
          procedures. Alternatively, the sterilant may be provided in a bulk form (e.g., in a large
          bottle or other container and dosed into chamber (453, 454) in a specified amount).
[0055]             In the present example, first sterilization module (456) and second sterilization
          module (457) are each operable to respectively apply sterilant in the form of vapor within
          first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454). By way of example only, sterilization
          modules (456, 457) may comprise a combination of a vaporizer and a condenser. The
          vaporizer may include a chamber that receives a particular concentration of sterilant
          solution (e.g., a liquid hydrogen peroxide solution with a concentration of about 20% to
          about 59% nominal, or between about 20% to 59%, or or between about 58% and about
          59.6%); where sterilant solution changes phase from liquid to vapor on re-vaporization.
          The    condenser may provide        condensation of sterilant solution vapor, and the
          concentration of sterilant solution may be thereby increased (e.g., from about 59%
          nominal to somewhere between about 83% nominal and about 95% nominal), by removal
          of water vapor. Alternatively, any other suitable methods and components may be used
          to apply sterilant in the form of a vapor within first and second sterilization chambers
          (453, 454).
[0056]             In any case, to supplement the application of sterilant in the form of a vapor,
          sterilant may also be applied (in liquid form) to the inside of lumen(s) and/or other
          internal spaces within medical devices and/or outside of medical devices, before medical
          devices are placed in first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454). In such versions,
          sterilant may evaporate while a vacuum is applied to first and second sterilization
          chambers (453, 454) (e.g., as described in greater detail below with reference to block
          610 of FIG. 6) and even after vacuum is applied; and provide more sterilant to areas of
          medical devices with less penetration range, thereby further promoting effective
          sterilization.

[00571             In some variations, only one sterilization module (456, 457) is provided. It should
          be understood from the description below that a single sterilization module (456, 457)
          may provide sufficient sterilization for use in both sterilization chambers (453, 454), such
          that each sterilization chamber (453, 454) does not need a corresponding dedicated
          sterilization module (456, 457).        It should also be understood that two or more
          sterilization modules (456, 457) may be arranged to dispense sterilant into a single
          sterilization chamber (453) in an alternating fashion, with sterilization chamber (454)
          receiving the sterilant from sterilization chamber (453).        Thus, sterilization chamber
          (453) may serve as a primary chamber while sterilization chamber (454) serves as a
          secondary chamber.
[0058]             Sterilizing cabinet (450) of the present example further comprises a touch screen
          display (460). Touch screen display (460) is operable to render the various user interface
          display screens, such as those described in U.S. Provisional Pat. App. No. 62/316,722,
          the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.         Of course, touch screen
          display (460) may display various other screens as well.        Touch screen display (460) is
          further configured to receive user input in the form of user contacting touch screen
          display (460) in accordance with conventional touch screen technology. In addition, or in
          the alternative, sterilizing cabinet (450) may include various other kinds of user input
          features, including but not limited to buttons, keypads, keyboards, a mouse, a trackball,
          etc.
[0059]             Sterilizing cabinets may further comprise a processor that is in communication
          with at least one sterilization module and with a touch screen display. In the present
          example, processor (462) is in communication with first sterilization module (456), with
          optional second sterilization module (457), and with touch screen display (460).
[0060]              In accordance with user input, processor (462) is operable to execute control
          algorithms to drive at least one sterilization module (456), and is optionally operable to
          execute control algorithms to drive optional second sterilization module(s) (457).
          Processor (462) is further operable to execute instructions to display the various screens
          on touch screen display (460); and to process instructions received from a user via touch
          screen display (460) (and/or via other user input features).       Processor (462) is also in
                                                    -19

          communication with various other components of sterilizing cabinet (450) and is thereby
          operable to drive those components and/or process input and/or other data from those
          components. Various suitable components and configurations that may be used to form
          processor (462) will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the
          teachings herein.
[0061]             In the example shown in FIG. 4, processor (462) is in communication with pump
          (490) and processor (462) is operable to selectively activate pump (490) to transfer
          sterilant vapor from first sterilization chamber (453) to second sterilization chamber
          (454) and vice versa. As described in greater detail below, in such versions, pump (490)
          may first transfer sterilant vapor from first sterilization chamber (453) to second
          sterilization chamber (454) and then subsequently transfer the sterilant vapor from second
          sterilization chamber (454) back to first sterilization chamber (453).
[0062]             Sterilizing cabinet (450) further comprises an identification tag reader (466),
          which is operable to read an identification tag of a biological indicator as described
          herein. By way of example only, identification tag reader (466) may comprise an optical
          reader that is operable to read an optical identification tag (e.g., barcode, QR code, etc.)
          of a biological indicator. In addition, or in the alternative, identification tag reader (466)
          may comprise RFID reader that is operable to read an RFID identification tag (e.g.,
          barcode, QR code, etc.) of a biological indicator.        Various suitable components and
          configurations that may be used to form identification tag reader (466) will be apparent to
          those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Data received through
          identification tag reader (466) is processed through processor (462).
[0063]             Sterilizing cabinet (450) of the present example further comprises a memory
          (468), which is operable to store control logic and instructions and that are executed by
          processor (462) to drive components such as sterilization modules (456, 457), touch
          screen display (460), communication module (464), and identification tag reader (466).
          Memory (468) may also be used to store results associated with setup of a sterilization
          cycle, performance of a load conditioning cycle, performance of a sterilization cycle,
          and/or various other kinds of information. Various suitable forms that memory (468)

          may take, as well as various ways in which memory (468) may be used, will be apparent
          to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.
[0064]             Sterilizing cabinet (450) of the present example further comprises a printer (470),
          which is operable to print information such as results associated with setup of a
          sterilization cycle, performance of a load conditioning cycle, performance of a
          sterilization cycle, and/or various other kinds of information. By way of example only,
          printer (470) may comprise a thermal printer, though of course any other suitable kind of
          printer may be used. Various suitable forms that printer (470) may take, as well as
          various ways in which printer (470) may be used, will be apparent to those of ordinary
          skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. It should also be understood that printer
          (470) is merely optional and may be omitted in some versions.
[0065]             Sterilizing cabinet (450) of the present example further comprises at least one
          vacuum source (480) and at least one venting valve (482). Vacuum source (480) is in
          fluid communication with at least first sterilization chamber (453) and is also in
          communication with processor (462). In some variations, a single vacuum source (480)
          provides vacuum for first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454). However, in the
          example shown in FIG. 4, first vacuum source (480) is in fluid communication with first
          sterilization chamber (453) and first venting valve (482); and optional second vacuum
          source (481) is in fluid communication with second sterilization chamber (454) and
          second venting valve (483).       Thus, each sterilization chamber (453, 454) has its own
          dedicated vacuum source (480, 481) in the present example, though as noted above, both
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) may share a single common vacuum source (480) in
          other variations.
[0066]             In the present example, processor (462) is operable to selectively activate vacuum
          source (480) in accordance with one or more control algorithms.          Processor (462) is
          further operable to selectively activate vacuum source (481) in accordance with one or
          more additional control algorithms.       When vacuum source (480) is activated, vacuum
          source (480) is operable to reduce pressure within sterilization chamber (453) as will be
          described in greater detail below.         In versions, where vacuum source (480) is in
          communication with both sterilization chambers (453, 454), vacuum source (480) is
                                                     -21

          operable to reduce pressure within both sterilization chambers (453, 454). In versions
          where each sterilization chamber (453, 454) has its own dedicated vacuum source (480,
          481), when second vacuum source (481) is activated, vacuum source (481) is operable to
          reduce pressure within second sterilization chamber (454) as will be described in greater
          detail below.
[00671             In some versions, only one vacuum source (480, 481) is provided. It should be
          understood that, since sterilization chambers (453, 454) are in fluid communication with
          each other via pump (490), a single vacuum source (480, 481) may be used to create a
          vacuum in both sterilization chambers (453, 454). In some such versions, pump (490)
          may provide a simple open pathway between sterilization chambers (453, 454) when
          vacuum source (480, 481) is activated. In some other versions, pump (490) may also be
          activated simultaneously with the single vacuum source (480, 481) to thereby cooperate
          with the single vacuum source (480, 481) to provide a vacuum in both sterilization
          chambers (453, 454). Other suitable arrangements and relationships that may be used for
          vacuum source (480, 481) and pump (490) will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in
          the art in view of the teachings herein.     In some versions, pump (490) also acts as a
          vacuum pump for chamber (453) and/or for chamber (454).
[0068]             At least one venting valve (482) is also in fluid communication with sterilization
          chamber (453). In addition, at least one venting valve (482) is in communication with
          processor (462) such that processor (462) is operable to selectively activate venting valve
          (482) in accordance with one or more control algorithms. In the example shown in FIG.
          4, optional second venting valve (483) is also in communication with processor (462)
          such that processor (462) is operable to selectively activate optional second venting valve
          (483) in accordance with one or more control algorithms.
[0069]             When at least one venting valve (482) is activated, venting valve (482) is operable
          to vent sterilization chamber (453). In the example shown in FIG. 4, when either or both
          of first venting valve (482) and optional second venting valve (483) are activated, venting
          valves (482, 483) are respectively operable to vent first and second sterilization chambers
          (453, 454) to atmosphere as will be described in greater detail below. Various suitable
          components that may be used to provide vacuum sources (480, 481) and venting valves

          (482, 483) will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings
          herein.
[00701             In some versions, only one venting valve (482, 483) is used to vent both
          sterilization chambers (453, 454).         It should be understood that since sterilization
          chambers (453, 454) are in fluid communication with each other via pump (490), pump
          (490) may be configured to provide an open fluid pathway between the sterilization
          chambers (453, 454) to enable the venting of both sterilization chambers (453, 454)
          through single venting valve (482, 483).        Other suitable arrangements and relationships
          that may be used for venting valve (482, 483) and pump (490) will be apparent to those
          of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.
[00711             In addition to the foregoing, sterilizing cabinet (450) may be configured and
          operable in accordance with at least some of the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6,939,519, the
          disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein; U.S. Pat. No. 6,852,279, the

[0073]             FIG. 5 depicts a high level flowchart of an exemplary set of steps that sterilizing
          cabinet (450) could perform to sterilize at least two medical devices, for example, two
          endoscopes.      Sterilizing cabinet (450) may be configured to perform one or more
          sterilization cycles, with different sterilization cycles being appropriate for different types
          and quantities of medical devices. Thus, as an initial step, sterilizing cabinet (450) may
          display one or more available sterilization cycles via touch screen display (460) and then
          receive a sterilization cycle selection (block 500) from user.

[00741             Sterilizing cabinet (450) may also display instructions indicating whether a
          biological indicator should be used with selected sterilization cycle, and receive a
          biological indicator identification (block 502). Such a biological indicator identification
          (block 502) may be provided via identification tag reader (466), via touch screen display
          (460), or otherwise.    A biological indicator may be placed inside at least one or all
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) of sterilizing cabinet (450) before sterilization cycle
          begins and may remain in sterilization chamber(s) (453, 454) during sterilization cycle.
          In the present example, a separate biological indicator would be placed in each
          sterilization chamber (453, 454). A user may identify the particular biological indicators
          (block 502) before the biological indicators are placed in sterilization chambers (453,
          454).    As noted above, the biological indicators may contain microorganisms that are
          responsive to a particular sterilization cycle. Upon completion of sterilization cycle, the
          biological indicators may be tested for the microorganisms in order to provide a measure
          of the effectiveness of the sterilization cycle.
[00751             Selection of a sterilization cycle (block 500) and identification of a biological
          indicator (block 502) may define one or more requirements for the configuration and
          arrangement of medical devices within at least one sterilization chamber (453, 454).
          Thus, in order to provide preparation for sterilization cycle (508), once sterilization cycle
          has been selected (block 500) and biological indicator has been identified (block 502),
          sterilizing cabinet (450) may provide a display via touch screen display (460) indicating a
          proper medical device placement. This display may serve as a visual guide to a user's
          placement of medical device(s) (and perhaps a biological indicator) within at least two
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) of sterilizing cabinet (450), based on sterilization cycle
          selection (block 500). The doors of sterilization chambers (453, 454) may be opened to
          enable the user to place medical devices (and perhaps biological indicators) within
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) as instructed.
[0076]             Once the user has placed medical devices in chambers (453, 454) based on these
          instructions, the user may press a start button or other button indicating that medical
          device placement is complete. In some versions, sterilizing cabinet (450) is configured to
          automatically verify proper medical device placement.          By way of example only,

          sterilizing cabinet (450) may employ photo sensors, imaging devices, weight sensors,
          and/or other components to verify proper medical device placement in sterilization
          chambers (453, 454). It should be understood, however, that some versions of sterilizing
          cabinet (450) may lack the capability of automatically verifying proper placement of a
          medical device within sterilization chambers (453, 454).
[00771             If medical device placement is verified and/or the user has otherwise completed
          cycle preparation (block 504), sterilization chambers (453, 454) may start a load
          conditioning process (block 506).       Load conditioning process (block 506) prepares
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) and medical device(s) within sterilization chambers
          (453, 454) for optimal sterilization during a sterilization cycle. Conditioning may include
          controlling and optimizing one or more characteristics of sterilization chambers (453,
          454). For example, during load conditioning, sterilizing cabinet (450) may continuously
          monitor level of moisture within sterilization chambers (453, 454) while reducing level of
          moisture by, for example, circulating and dehumidifying air of sterilization chambers
          (453, 454), creating a vacuum within sterilization chambers (453, 454), heating
          sterilization chambers (453, 454), and/or other methods for dehumidifying a sealed
          chamber. This may continue until sterilizing cabinet (450) determines that an acceptable
          level of moisture has been reached.
[0078]             As part of load conditioning cycle (block 506), sterilizing cabinet (450) may also
          continuously detect temperature within sterilization chambers (453, 454) while heating
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) by, for example, convection of heated air, conduction
          through an interior surface of chambers (453, 454), and/or using other techniques. This
          may continue until sterilizing cabinet (450) determines that an acceptable internal
          temperature has been reached. Various conditioning actions in one or more sterilization
          chambers (453, 454) such as controlling temperature or humidity, may be performed in
          parallel or in sequence. It should also be understood that load conditioning cycle (block
          506) may verify that sterilization chambers (453, 454) are sealed; verifying contents of
          sterilization chambers (453, 454); checking physical characteristics of         contents of
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) such as content volume, content weight, or other
          characteristics; and/or performing one or more conditioning steps that may include
                                                   -25

          chemical treatment, plasma treatment, or other types of treatment to reduce moisture,
          raise temperature, and/or otherwise prepare       medical devices in sterilization chambers
          (453, 454) for sterilization cycle (block 508).
[00791             While one or more conditioning actions are being performed as part of load
          conditioning cycle (block 506), sterilizing cabinet (450) may display information via
          touch screen display (460) indicating to user the duration of time before sterilization
          cycle (block 508) performance may begin. Once all load conditioning criteria have been
          successfully met, load conditioning cycle (block 506) is complete, and sterilization cycle
          (block 508) may then be performed.        It should therefore be understood that sterilizing
          cabinet (450) is configured such that sterilization cycle (block 508) is not actually
          initiated until after load conditioning cycle (block 506) is complete. It should also be
          understood that load conditioning cycle (block 506) may be omitted or varied in some
          versions of sterilizing cabinet (450) operation.
[0080]              As noted above, sterilizing cabinet (450) may begin performing sterilization
          cycle (block 508) automatically and immediately after load conditioning (block 506) has
          been completed. Sterilization cycle (block 508) may include exposing medical device(s)
          in sterilization chambers (453, 454) to pressurized sterilant gas, further heat treatment,
          chemical treatment, plasma treatment, vacuum treatment, and/or other types of
          sterilization procedures.     During performance        of sterilization cycle (block 508),
          sterilizing cabinet (450) may display information via touch screen display (460) such as a
          duration remaining for sterilization cycle (block 508), the current stage of sterilization
          cycle (block 508) (e.g. plasma, vacuum, injection, heat, chemical treatment), and/or other
          information.
[0081]             In some versions, sterilization cycle (block 508) comprises the set of exemplary
          sub-steps shown in FIG. 6.       In particular, sterilization cycle (block 508) begins with
          applying vacuum (block 610) to sterilization chambers (453, 454). FIG. 7 shows one
          exemplary set of sub-steps that may be used to apply vacuum (610) to sterilization
          chambers (453, 454) using just a single vacuum source (480).            FIG. 8 shows another
          exemplary set of sub-steps that may be used to apply vacuum (610) to sterilization
          chambers (453, 454) using two vacuum sources (480, 481).             Each of these exemplary
                                                   -26

          methods will be described in greater detail below. However, it should be understood that
          various other suitable methods may be used to apply vacuum (610) to sterilization
          chambers (453, 454). Other alternative methods will be apparent to those of ordinary
          skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.
[0082]             In versions of sterilizing cabinet (450) having only one vacuum source (480),
          applying vacuum (block 610) may occur via the sub-steps shown in FIG. 7. In these
          versions, processor (462) is operable to transition pump (490) between an open state, in
          which there is an open fluid communication pathway between sterilization chambers
          (453, 454), and a closed state, in which the fluid communication pathway between
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) is closed. Various suitable configurations that may be
          used to provide selection between these two states will be apparent to those of ordinary
          skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. In some other variations, a separate valve
          is used to selectively provide an open path for fluid communication between chambers
          (453, 454), such that pump (490) is not used to selectively provide an open path for fluid
          communication between chambers (453, 454). Returning to the present example, in
          accordance with a control algorithm, processor (462) transitions pump (490) to the open
          state (block 710) and then activates vacuum source (480) (block 712) to provide vacuum
          to first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454).
[0083]             Processor (462) will then determine (block 714) whether a sufficient pressure
          level has been reached within first sterilization chamber (453) and/or second sterilization
          chamber (454). By way of example only, processor (462) may monitor data from one or
          more pressure sensors within first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) as part of
          determination step (block 714).        Alternatively, processor (462) may simply activate
          vacuum source (480) for a predetermined time period and assume that appropriate
          pressures have been reached in first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) based
          upon the duration for which vacuum source (480) is activated. Other suitable ways in
          which processor (462) may determine (block 714) whether sufficient pressure levels have
          been reached within first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) will be apparent to
          those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Until the appropriate
          pressure levels have been reached within first and second sterilization chambers (453,
                                                    -27

          454), vacuum source (480) will remain activated, and pump (490) will remain in an open
          state.
[0084]             Once first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) both reach an appropriate
          pressure level, the vacuum cycle ends (block 720). At this stage, sterilizing cabinet (450)
          may proceed with applying a sterilant (block 620) as shown in FIG. 6 and as described in
          greater detail below.
[0085]             In versions of sterilizing cabinet (450) having only one vacuum source (480),
          applying vacuum (block 610) may alternatively occur as follows. While vacuum source
          (480) is activated, pump (490) is in an open state and drives air from second sterilization
          chamber (454) into first sterilization chamber (453), thereby assisting in creation of a
          vacuum in second sterilization chamber (454). Processor (462) is operable to monitor the
          pressure level in one or both chambers (453, 454). Once the appropriate pressure level
          has been reached in second sterilization chamber (454), processor (462) may deactivate
          vacuum source (480) and transition pump (490) to a closed state, thereby closing the fluid
          communication pathway between sterilization chambers (453, 454). Of course, pump
          (490) and vacuum source (480) may likewise be activated by processor (462) to force air
          from, and create a vacuum in, first sterilization chamber (453). In any case, at this stage,
          sterilizing cabinet (450) may proceed with applying a sterilant (block 620) as shown in
          FIG. 6 and as described in greater detail below.
[0086]             In versions of sterilizing cabinet (450) comprising at least two vacuum sources
          (480, 481), applying vacuum (block 610) may occur via the sub-steps shown in FIG. 8.
          In particular, processor (462) may activate vacuum source (480) in accordance with a
          control algorithm to apply vacuum (block 810) to first sterilization chamber (453). In
          parallel or in sequence, processor (462) may activate vacuum source (481) to apply
          vacuum (block 820) to second sterilization chamber (454). It should be understood that
          processor (462) may activate vacuum sources (480, 481) in reverse order, i.e., to apply
          vacuum (block 810) to second sterilization chamber (454) before applying vacuum to
          first sterilization   chamber (453); or activate both vacuum          sources   (480, 481)
          simultaneously.

[00871             After activating vacuum sources (480, 481) (blocks 810, 820), processor (462)
          will then determine (block 812) whether a sufficient pressure level has been reached
          within first sterilization chamber (453) and/or second sterilization chamber (454). By
          way of example only, processor (462) may monitor data from one or more pressure
          sensors within first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) as part of determination
          step (block 812).    Alternatively, processor (462) may simply activate vacuum sources
          (480, 481) for predetermined time periods and assume that appropriate pressures have
          been reached in first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) based upon the
          duration for which vacuum sources (480, 481) are activated.          Other suitable ways in
          which processor (462) may determine (block 812) whether sufficient pressure levels have
          been reached within first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) will be apparent to
          those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Until the appropriate
          pressure levels have been reached within first and second sterilization chambers (453,
          454), vacuum sources (480, 481) will remain activated.              Once first and second
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) both reach an appropriate pressure level, vacuum cycle
          (block 610) ends (block 830). At this stage, sterilizing cabinet (450) may proceed with
          applying a sterilant (block 620) as shown in FIG. 6 and as described in greater detail
          below.
[0088]             In some versions, once first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) reach an
          appropriate pressure level (e.g., between about 0.2 torr and about 10 torr), sterilization
          cycle (block 508) continues by applying sterilant (block 620) to first sterilization chamber
          (453) while maintaining vacuum in second sterilization chamber (454). Thus, the fluid
          path between sterilization chambers (453, 454) (via pump (490), via a valve, or
          otherwise), remains closed. When sterilant is applied (block 620) to first sterilization
          chamber (453) the pressure inside first sterilization chamber (453) may increase.
[0089]             By way of example only, sterilant vapor may comprise a vapor of oxidizing agent
          such as hydrogen peroxide, peroxy acids (e.g. peracetic acid, performic acid, etc.), ozone,
          or a mixture thereof. Furthermore, sterilant may comprise chlorine dioxide.           Various
          other suitable forms that sterilant may take are described herein; while other forms will
          be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. It should
                                                   -29

          also be understood that, in some versions, sterilant may be applied (block 620) in
          different ways based on user's selection of cycle (block 500) as described above.
[0090]             Once sterilant has been applied (block 620) to first sterilization chamber (453),
          processor (462) monitors time (block 622) to determine whether a sufficient,
          predetermined duration has passed. By way of example only, this predetermined duration
          may be anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes.             Until the predetermined
          duration has passed, first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) remain in a sealed
          state at the above-noted predetermined pressure level, with applied sterilant acting upon
          medical device(s) contained within first sterilization chamber (453).             Until the
          predetermined duration has passed, one or more sensors may be used to monitor the
          pressure inside first sterilization chamber (453) after sterilant is applied (block 620) to
          first sterilization chamber (453). Moreover, one or more sensors may be used to monitor
          the pressure inside second sterilization chamber (454) during this same time period.
[0091]             Once the predetermined duration has passed, the transfer phase begins when
          processor (462) activates pump (490) to transfer all of the sterilant vapor (block 630)
          from first sterilization chamber (453) into second sterilization chamber (454). When
          transferring the sterilant vapor (block 630) from first sterilization chamber (453) to
          second sterilization chamber (454), the pressure in first sterilization chamber (453) may
          drop and the pressure in second sterilization chamber (454) may increase. The transfer of
          sterilant vapor from first sterilization chamber (453) into second sterilization chamber
          (454) and the associated change in pressure may provide movement and diffusion of the
          sterilant vapor within a medical device contained in first sterilization chamber (453),
          thereby providing for increased diffusion of the sterilant vapor into hard-to-reach spaces
          within the medical device.
[0092]             Processor (462) monitors time (block 632) to determine whether a sufficient,
          predetermined duration has passed. By way of example only, this predetermined duration
          may be anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes.             Until the predetermined
          duration has passed, first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) remain in a sealed
          state, with applied sterilant acting upon medical device(s) contained within second
          sterilization chamber (454). Again, until the predetermined duration has passed, one or
                                                   -30

          more sensors may be used to monitor the pressure inside second sterilization chamber
          (454) after sterilant is transferred (block 630) to second sterilization chamber (454).
          Moreover, one or more sensors may be used to monitor the pressure inside first
          sterilization chamber (453) during this same time period.
[0093]             Once the predetermined duration has passed, processor (462) activates pump
          (490) to transfer all or some of sterilant (block 640) from second sterilization chamber
          (454) to first sterilization chamber (453). When transferring sterilant (block 640) from
          second sterilization chamber (454) to first sterilization chamber (453), the pressure in
          second sterilization chamber (454) will drop and the pressure in first sterilization
          chamber (453) will increase. The transfer of sterilant vapor from second sterilization
          chamber (454) into first sterilization chamber (453), and vice-versa, and the associated
          change in pressure will provide movement and diffusion of the sterilant vapor within a
          medical device in either sterilization chamber (453, 454), thereby providing for increased
          diffusion of the sterilant vapor into hard-to-reach spaces within the medical device.
[0094]             Processor (462) monitors time (block 642) to determine whether a sufficient,
          predetermined duration has passed. By way of example only, this predetermined duration
          may be anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes.              Until predetermined the
          duration has passed, first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) remain in a sealed
          state at the above-noted predetermined pressure level, with applied sterilant acting upon
          medical device(s) contained within first sterilization chamber (453).
[0095]             Once the predetermined duration has passed, if sterilization is not complete (block
          650), then the process (blocks 630-650) of transferring sterilant (completely or partially)
          between first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) may be repeated one or more
          times after being completed once. In other words, medical device(s) may remain within
          first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) and experience two or more iterations
          of the partial cycle (blocks 630-650). It should also be understood that medical devices
          may remain within first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) and experience two
          or more iterations of the entire cycle (blocks 610-670) shown in FIG. 6. In any case, the
          number of iterations may vary based on cycle selection (block 200), which may be
          influenced by the particular kind of medical device(s) that are being sterilized in first and
                                                   -31

          second sterilization chambers (453, 454). It should be noted that during the sterilization
          cycle (block 508), additional sterilant may need to be added to either one or both of first
          and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) after one or more instances of transferring
          (blocks 630, 640) sterilant between chambers (453, 454).
[0096]             Once sterilization is complete (block 650), the sterilant vapor may be present in
          either or both of sterilization chambers (453, 454). The diffusion phase begins when
          processor (462) activates (block 660) venting valves (482, 483) to vent first and second
          sterilization chambers (453, 454) to atmosphere. The venting process can be instant or
          stepwise. By way of example only, stepwise venting may be provided where venting
          valve (482, 483) is opened for a few milliseconds and then closed, and after a few
          seconds or minutes, the opening and closing is repeated again one or more times, and
          then sterilization chamber (453, 454) is eventually fully vented to atmosphere. In some
          versions, first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) are allowed to reach
          atmospheric pressure, while in other versions, first and second sterilization chambers
          (453, 454) only reach sub-atmospheric pressure. In the present example, the sterilization
          cycle (block 508) is then complete (block 670) after completion of the diffusion phase.
[00971             Upon completion of sterilization cycle (block 508), sterilizing cabinet (450) may
          process the results (block 510) of sterilization cycle (block 508).          For instance, if
          sterilization cycle (block 508) was canceled or unable to complete due to error or by user
          action, sterilizing cabinet (450) may remain sealed and may also display a sterilization
          cycle cancellation message via touch screen display (460); as well as various details
          relating to sterilization cycle (block 508), such as date, time, configuration, elapsed time,
          sterilization cycle operator, the stage at which       sterilization cycle failed, and other
          information that may be used to identify why sterilization cycle (block 508) was not
          completed. If sterilization cycle (block 508) is completed successfully, sterilizing cabinet
          (450) may display a notification via touch screen display (460) indicating successful
          completion of sterilization cycle (block 608). In addition, sterilizing cabinet (450) may
          display information such as sterilization cycle identifier, sterilization cycle type, start
          time, duration, operator, and other information.

 [00981             In some variations, pre-plasma may be applied in sterilization cycle (block 508) to
           heat up medical device(s) contained in sterilization chambers (453, 454).        By way of
           example only, plasma may be applied between applying a vacuum (block 610) and
           applying sterilant (block 620). In addition, or in the alternative, a post-plasma may be
           applied at the end of sterilization cycle (block 650) to degrade any residual sterilant that
           may be adsorbed to the surface of any medical devices contained in first and second
           sterilization chambers (453, 454). It should be understood that, before applying the post
           plasma, a vacuum would first need to be applied to first and second sterilization
           chambers (453, 454).
[0099]              By way of example only, the process depicted in FIG. 6 may be carried out at
            temperatures where walls of first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) are
            between about 30'C and about 60-70C, or more particularly between about 47'C and
            about 56'C, or even more particularly about 50'C; and where temperature of medical
            device(s) in first and second sterilization chambers (453, 454) is between about 5-10 0 C
            and about 40-55C. Moreover, the process depicted in FIG. 6 may be carried out when
            one or more medical devices are present in only one of sterilization chambers (453,
            454). In other words, the process depicted in FIG. 6 is effective regardless of whether
            medical devices are present in both sterilization chambers (453, 454).            It should
            therefore be understood that the process depicted in FIG. 6 may be carried out with one
            or more medical devices being positioned only in first sterilization chamber (453) or
            only in second sterilization chamber (454).
 [00100]            In some variations, only one chamber (453) is configured to receive one or more
           medical devices while the other chamber (454) is not configured to receive one or more
           medical devices. In such versions, the other chamber (454) may simply be used to push
           sterilant vapor into, and to pull sterilant vapor back from, in order to minimize
           consumption of sterilant during repetition of sterilization cycles (block 208).
 [00101]            It should be understood from the foregoing that, like the venting step (block 318)
           in the sterilization process (block 208) described above with reference to FIG. 3, the
           transfer of the sterilant vapor back and forth (blocks 630, 640) between first and second
           chambers (453, 454) in the process described above with reference to FIG. 6 provides
                                                    -33

          movement of the sterilant vapor within the medical device(s) that is/are contained in
          chamber(s) (453, 454), resulting in diffusion of the sterilant vapor into hard-to-reach
          spaces (e.g., long, narrow lumens) within such medical device(s). However, unlike the
          venting step (block 318) in the sterilization process (block 208) described above with
          reference to FIG. 3, the transfer of the sterilant vapor back and forth (blocks 630, 640)
          between first and second chambers (453, 454) in the process described above with
          reference to FIG. 6 results in the re-use of sterilant vapor during iterations of sterilization
          cycles rather than the release of sterilant vapor into the atmosphere during iterations of
          sterilization cycles. The re-use of the sterilant vapor advantageously allows for repeated
          sterilization cycles of a medical device to be undertaken without the addition of
          subsequent full doses of sterilant into a chamber (453, 454) (though some nominal, lesser
          amount of sterilant may need to be introduced into chamber (453 or 454) after one or
          more iterations of the sterilization cycle in order to "top off' chamber (453 or 454) with
          sterilant). Thus, the process shown in FIG. 6 may provide better conservation of sterilant,
          or more efficient use of sterilant, which may be particularly beneficial for sterilization of
          medical devices that warrant repeated sterilization cycles (e.g., endoscopes with long,
          narrow lumens).
[00102]            In some variations, sterilant is first dispensed into both sterilization chambers
          (453, 454), and after a few seconds to a few minutes, pump (490) transfers some or
          almost all of the sterilant from sterilization chamber (453) to sterilization chamber (454),
          and after a few seconds to a few minutes, pump (490) transfers some or almost all of the
          sterilant from sterilization chamber (454) to sterilization chamber (453), and this process
          is repeated as many times as needed. Once the process has been repeated for the desired
          number of times, both sterilization chambers (453, 454) are vented by air either instantly
          or in a stepwise manner.
[00103]            In addition to the foregoing, sterilizing cabinet (450) may be configured to
          perform sterilization processes in accordance with at least some of the teachings of U.S.
