                               ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
         An interchangeable jewelry system or kit can include a jewelry base, one or more charms,
 and one or more keys. A manufacturer can configure the jewelry base so that a user can wear the
 jewelry system as a ring, necklace, bracelet, or any other type of jewelry. The jewelry base can
 include a recessed surround and a post recess. A manufacturer can size the charm to fit within
 the recessed surround and be configured in a variety of ways to lock into the recessed surround.
 A manufacturer can configure a key in a variety of ways so that a user can unlock the dot fitting
 from the recessed surround with the key. Once unlocked, the owner can remove the charm from
 the recessed surround of the jewelry base and can select an alternative dot fitting with a different
 design to lock into the recessed surround.

                                  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Technical Field
 5           Implementations of the present invention relate to jewelry, in particular customizable
   jewelry.
   Background and Relevant Art
             Jewelry wearers often purchase a wide range of rings, bracelets, or the like to provide a
   large variety of options for accenting an appearance. Of course, buying large amounts of jewelry
10 can create cost and storage issues. The user may find this difficulty particularly problematic when
   the only difference among many of the jewelry items is found in just a portion of the ring or
   bracelet. For example, several rings may have different decorative elements, such as a mounted
   jewel or pattern, but similar base designs.       In other cases, sometimes a person's physical
   dimensions, such as ring finger size, may change over time or in particular environments. This
15 change can make the person's favorite jewelry item, in the form of a ring or bracelet, either too
   loose or too tight. The only option for the user in that case might be to take the jewelry to a dealer
   for resizing, or to remount the decorative element onto another base.
             Conventional attempts to solve such problems involve options for interchanging decorative
   features of jewelry. In particular, the interchangeable jewelry market is becoming increasingly
20 popular as jewelry wearers seek for a more cost effective means of accessorizing. Due to the wide
   variety of jewelry styles a user can presently purchase, a user might choose a particular jewel that
   matches a mood or outfit in order to match a certain desired aesthetic. In particular, it is common
   for users to change jewelry just to suit a particular outfit. One type of interchangeable jewelry
   system allows wearers to invest in a few base jewelry pieces (e.g., a ring, necklace, or bracelet)
25 that have a cavity wherein a wearer can interchange different designs of jewels or charms. In such
   a system, the wearer need only purchase the interchangeable jewels or charms to have a diverse
   jewelry collection.
             Such interchangeable jewelry systems, however, generally only require the wearer to press
   the jewel or charm into the cavity with their finger to secure it within the base jewelry piece, and
30 lift it to remove the jewel or charm. Such an easy exchange creates the risk that the jewel or charm
   may not be completely secure within the cavity, and may fall out without the knowledge of the
                                                      I

   20965.Ia
   wearer. Even when this risk is accounted for with a detent-based locking mechanism, the wearer
   may be required to use a generic tool to remove the jewel or charm. Such tools tend to be universal
   to all jewels and charms used with that jewelry system. The tools add no additional design element
   to the jewelry collection, and add little extra security. Wearers of interchangeable jewelry may
 5 desire a level of security and customization for their jewelry that is not met with current methods
   employed by the given interchangeable jewelry system.
            Accordingly, there are a number of difficulties in conventional jewelry, particularly where
   a wearer desires a high degree of customization.
10                             BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
                Implementations of the present invention comprise systems, kits, methods, and
   apparatus configured to enable users to easily replace decorative features of a jewelry item. In at
   least one implementation, an interchangeable jewelry system can include a base having a recessed
   surround, a charm configured to fit within the recessed surround of the base, and a key configured
15 to remove the charm from the recessed surround of the base. The decorative features can be easily
   secured into a jewelry base to provide a secure attachment that provides the jewelry item with a
   high-end appearance, and that does not readily appear to be removable.
                In one implementation, an interchangeable key for use with an interchangeable jewelry
    system can include a first gripping element, a jewelry release element, and a stop element. The
20 first gripping element and the jewelry release element can both be sized and configured to fit within
   a post recess of a jewelry base that receives a removable charm. In such an implementation, the
   user can remove the charm by inserting the key from the bottom of the jewelry base to release the
   charm. The user can then depress another, different decorative feature into the jewelry base in
   such a way that the overall jewelry item again has an appearance of permanence and high quality.
25              In one implementation, an interchangeable jewelry kit can include a jewelry base, one
   or more interchangeable charms, and one or more keys. The jewelry base can comprise a recessed
   surround and a post recess extending through the base. The one or more interchangeable charms
   can fit in the recessed surround of the jewelry base to be secured thereto. A manufacturer can
   configure the one or more keys so that a user can insert a key through the post recess of the base
30 and separate a specific charm, or a specific group of charms, from the recessed surround of the
   jewelry base.

                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
                    Implementations of the present invention comprise systems, kits, methods, and
 5 apparatus configured to enable users to easily replace decorative features of a jewelry item. In at
   least one implementation, an interchangeable jewelry system can include a base having a recessed
   surround, a charm configured to fit within the recessed surround of the base, and a key configured
   to remove the charm from the recessed surround of the base. The decorative features can be easily
   secured into a jewelry base to provide a secure attachment that provides the jewelry item with a
10 high-end appearance, and that does not readily appear to be removable.
                    In one implementation, an interchangeable key for use with an interchangeable
   jewelry system can include a first gripping element, a jewelry release element, and a stop element.
   The first gripping element and the jewelry release element can both be sized and configured to fit
   within a post recess of a jewelry base that receives a removable charm. In such an implementation,
15 the user can remove the charm by inserting the key from the bottom of the jewelry base to release
   the charm. The user can then depress another, different decorative feature into the jewelry base in
   such a way that the overall jewelry item again has an appearance of permanence and high quality.
                    In one implementation, an interchangeable jewelry kit can include a jewelry base,
   one or more interchangeable charms, and one or more keys. The jewelry base can comprise a
20 recessed surround and a post recess extending through the base. The one or more interchangeable
   charms can fit in the recessed surround of the jewelry base to be secured thereto. A manufacturer
   can configure the one or more keys so that a user can insert a key through the post recess of the
   base and separate a specific charm, or a specific group of charms, from the recessed surround of
   the jewelry base.
25          Accordingly, one will appreciate in view of the present specification and claims that
   implementations of the invention enable users to easily and securely interchange jewels in a secure
   and seamless manner. In particular, implementations of the present invention provide users with
   a wide range of customizations that, in at least one respect, enable a user to easily customize the
   visible parts of a jewelry item without requiring complete replacement of the jewelry item.
30          Referring now to the figures, Figure 1A illustrates an implementation of an interchangeable
   jewelry system 100 that includes a base 105 and a decorative element (or "charm") 110.            In
                                                       A

   20965.Ia
   particular, Figure IA shows that an interchangeable jewelry system 100 can take the form of a
   necklace, wherein a connector 155 secures the jewelry system 100 onto a necklace chain 120. The
   jewelry system 100 can also include connectors that secure the jewelry system 100 to a bracelet or
   other jewelry item. Of course, one will appreciate that jewelry item 100 can take on many forms,
 5 including but not limited to rings, bracelets, earrings, or other types of known adornments,
   including clothing, belts, scarves, hats, and footwear that may incorporate one or more charms
    110. As understood more fully herein, the jewelry system 100 generally comprises a jewelry base
    105 into which a user can insert multiple different charms 110.
            Figure 1B shows the charm 110 and base 105 separated to further illustrate the relationship
10 between the charm 110 and the base 105 of the interchangeable jewelry system 100 shown in
   Figure IA. A user can remove the charm 110 from the base 105, as shown, so that a different
   charm can be removably coupled to the base 105. The base 105 can include a number of features,
   including a recessed surround 115 and a post recess 120, that can geometrically mate with certain
   features of the charm 110 to hold them together. These and other features are described in more
15 detail below in reference to Figures 2 through 4A. Figure 4B, described in more detail below,
   shows how a user can remove the charm 110 from the base105. Referring back to Figure IA, the
   edges of the charm/base alignment appear essentially seamless when a user joins them together.
            One will appreciate that the base 105 and charm can also take several basic forms. For
   example, in addition to the foregoing square shapes of Figures 1A and 1B, an alternative
20 implementation can comprise a rounded version of the base 105, and a set of rounded charms 110
   that can be secured to the corresponding base 105. Beyond the outer perimeter shape variations,
   one will appreciate that the top face 125 of the charm 110 can include many different design forms.
   For example, charms 110 may comprising different decorative designs such as patterns, colors,
   letters, or pictures that include gems, stones, diamonds, various metals, and the like. The user can
25 customize the interchangeable jewelry system 100 to include any number of charms 110 that the
   user desires.
            In addition, while Figures 1A and lB illustrate a generally square charm 110 and base 105,
   other implementations of an interchangeable jewelry system 100 can include other shapes. For
   example, in one implementation, the charm 110 and base 105 can be rounded or oval shaped. In
30 another implementation, the jewelry system 100 can be triangular, polygonal, or otherwise
   irregularly shaped. One will appreciate that a manufacturer can achieve any number of shapes,

   20965.Ia
    sizes, and designs, while maintaining the interchangeability of the charm 110 with the base 105.
   Also, a manufacturer can use a variety of different materials, or combinations thereof, to construct
   the jewelry system 100. For example, a manufacturer can construct an interchangeable jewelry
    system 100 using cast iron, aluminum, brass, gold, plastics, rubbers, or other suitable materials
 5 generally used in jewelry construction.
            Referring back to the figures, Figures 2 through 5B illustrate the various components of an
   implementation of an interchangeable jewelry system 100, similar to that shown in Figures 1A and
    1B, as well as how a user can removably secure a base 105 and charm 110 together. To aid in the
   releasable connection between the charm 110 and base 105, a manufacturer can configure the
10 joining elements and/or recesses with any number of appropriate configurations for a secure
   connection. Figure 2 shows one such configuration that includes a post 205.
            Figure 2 illustrates a bottom view of a charm 110 that includes a post 205 protruding
   therefrom. A manufacturer can make the post 205 at least partially curved, substantially spherical,
   or otherwise shaped so as to coincide with the shape of the post recess 120 of the base. In this
15 configuration, a user can insert the post 205 into the post recess 120 of the base 105. A
   manufacturer can configure the curvature of the post 205, or other features of the charm 110, to
   reciprocate with one or more curves or other detents formed within the base 105 to secure the
   charm 110 within the base 105. For example, a manufacturer can form the outer edge 210 of the
   charm 110 to fit within the recessed surround 115 of the base 105 so that the recessed surround
20  115 and the edge 210 of the charm 110 form a friction fit. The post 205 can also form a friction
   fit within the post recess 120 of the base.
            Figure 2 illustrates a post 205 that is curved, but other implementations of the charm 110
   can include posts of various shapes and sizes. For example, a manufacturer can form a cylindrical
   post 205 that can correspond to a cylindrical post recess 120 of a similar size and shape. Also for
25 example, a manufacturer can form a square or rectangular post 205 to coincide with a square or
   rectangular post recess 120 of the base 105. One will appreciate that a manufacturer can form a
   post 205 in any desired shape so long as a user can fit the post 205 securely in the post recess 120
   of the base 105 and establish a friction fit between the charm 110 and the base 105.
            Along these lines, Figures 3A through 4A show various features, such as the post recess
30  120 and the recessed surround 115 of the base 105, that coincide with the edge 210 and post 205
   of the charm 110, to form the friction fit described above. Figure 3A shows a bottom perspective

   20965.Ia
   view of one implementation of a base 105 that includes a recessed surround 115 and a post recess
   120. The post recess 120 can include one or more pins 325 raised from, and extending laterally
   across, the inside surface of the post recess 120. The pins 325 can allow a user to "snap" the charm
    110 into the base 105 and help form a friction fit between the post 205 of the charm 110 and the
 5 post recess 120 of the base 105, as will be described in more detail below.
            Figure 3A further shows one implementation of a base 105 comprising an outer length or
   width D1 of about 16mm, and an inner length/width D2 of about 14mm, wherein the length or
   width is defined by a set of side walls 305 having a thickness D3 of about 1mm. Figure 3A also
   shows that at least one implementation of the base 105a can have a height or depth D4 from top to
10 bottom of about 4.5mm. In this implementation, the diameter D5 of the post recess 120 can be
   about 5mm. Other implementations of a base 105 can include various other dimensions.
            For example, a manufacturer can form a base 105 in which the side walls are about 0.8mm
   thick. This implementation can include a charm 110 and/or base 105 width/length D1 of about
   16mm so that an inner length/width D2 is about 14.4mm. In this implementation, the manufacturer
15 can form the post recess 120 with a diameter D5 of about 5.5mm. In any of the implementations
   described herein, the manufacturer can form the base 105 so that an inner wall height D6 is about
   1.5mm and an inner circular feature 310 surrounding the post recess 120 has a diameter of about
   12mm. A manufacturer can form the charm 110 to include a complimentary circular feature on
   the bottom face of the charm 110 to correspond in shape with the circular feature 310 of the base
20 105. The inner circular feature 310 can be toroidal, conical, dome shaped, or the like.
            One can also appreciate that a manufacturer can form the base 105 and/or charm 110 into
   other shapes, such as circular, as described above. In one circular implementation of the base 105,
   a manufacturer can form the base 105 with an outer diameter of about 14mm, a wall thickness of
   about 1mm, and a post recess diameter of about 5mm. In another circular implementation, the
25 manufacturer can form the base to have a post recess diameter of about 5.5mm. In yet another
   circular implementation, the manufacturer can form the base 110 to have an outer diameter of
   32mm, an inner diameter of about 30mm, a wall thickness of about 1mm, and a post recess
   diameter of about 9mm. In this embodiment, the base 110 can have an inner wall height of about
   2.5mm.
30          Of course, one will appreciate that different sizes and dimensions are possible with any of
   the implementations described herein without departing from the spirit of the invention.

   20965.Ia
            Turning now to the other side of the base 105, Figure 3B shows a bottom perspective view
   of the implementation of the base 105 shown in Figure 3A. The bottom side of the base 105 can
   include a plurality of cutouts 315. A manufacturer can remove material from one or more surfaces
   of the bottom of the base 105 to create decorative patterns or designs. For example, as shown in
 5 Figure 3B, the manufacturer can provide a pattern of hearts and eyelet shapes for aesthetic
   purposes. To this end, the manufacturer can include any number of various shapes and patterns of
   cutout material. For example, the manufacturer can include similar cutout patterns or designs in
   one or more side surfaces 320 of the base 105.
            Figures lB through 3B all show various aspects and features of the base 105 and charm
10 110 of one or more implementations of an interchangeable jewelry system 100. The features
   described, such as the post 205, post recess 120, and recessed surround 115, among others, can all
   serve to provide a friction fit between a base 105 and charm 110. Figures 4 and 5A serve to shed
   light on how a user can secure the base 105 and charm 110 together and also detach the charm 110
   from the base 105. For example, Figure 4 shows a cross-sectional view of an implementation of
15 an interchangeable jewelry system 100 similar to the system shown in Figure 1A.
            In this implementation, a user can insert the charm 110 into the recessed surround 115 of
   the base 105 so that the post 205 resides within the post recess 120. Various surfaces of the base
   105 and charm 110 can contact each other to create a friction fit that holds the charm 110 and base
   105 together. For example, an interface 405 between the edge 210 of the charm 110 and an inner
20 wall surface 410 of the base 105 can provide at least part of the friction that holds the base 105
   and charm 110 together. Also, friction between the post 205 and post recess 120 contacting one
   another can help secure the charm 110 to the base 105. The user can secure the charm 110 and
   base 105 together by simply pressing them towards one another with the user's fingers.
            The implementations of the jewelry system 100 described herein, including the
25 implementation shown in Figure 4, can provide a simple, streamline configuration that minimizes
   the total volume of the jewelry system 100 when the user inserts the charm 110 completely into
   the recessed surround 115 of the base 105. Figure 4 in particular shows an implementation that
   allows a user to push the charm 110 and base 105 together simply and with only the use of the
   users two hands, or even one hand.
30          In some implementations, a manufacturer can include one or more detents on various
   surfaces of the base 105 and charm 110 to increase the surface area in contact between the charm
                                                      0)

   20965.Ia
   110 and base 105. Detents can include grooves on the various surfaces of the base 105 and charm
   110 where the manufacturer can add or remove material from the surfaces. For example, Figures
   3A, 3B, and 4 illustrate a pair of pins 325 disposed on the inside surface of the post recess 120 of
   the base 105. Figure 4 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the pins 325.
 5          A manufacturer can form the pins 325 using a flexible material, such as rubber, plastic, or
   other elastomeric material, so that the pins 325 flex downward when a user inserts the post 205
   into the post recess 120. Once the user fully inserts the post 205 into the post recess 120, a space
   forms between the post 205 and post recess 205 that allows the pins 325 to flex back into their
   original position. To this end, Figure 4 shows a fully inserted post 205, with pins 325 that are
10 returned into their original position. In this way, the pins 325 can allow a user to "snap" the post
   205 into the post recess 120 beyond the pins 325.        The pins 325 can add resistance to a user
   removing the post 205 from the post recess 120 and provide an enhanced friction fit between the
   charm 110 and the base 105.
            The pins 325 illustrated in Figures 3A through 4, and discussed above, can vary in size,
15 shape, and quantity in other embodiments. Figures 3A through 4 show two pins 325 disposed on
   opposite sides of the post recess 120, but other embodiments can include more or less than two
   pins 325. For example, one embodiment may include three or more pins 325 disposed around the
   circumference of the post recess 120. In some embodiments, the pins 325 can be rounded or have
   straight edges. Also, various embodiments can include pins 325 that extend from the inside surface
20 of the post recess 120 to varying distances. The more pins 325 provided, and the further those pins
   325 extend away from the inside surface of the post recess 102, the greater the resistance provided
   by the pins 325 will be, and vice versa.
            Also for example, in some embodiments, a manufacturer can remove material from the
   inner wall surface 410 of the base 105 to form a grooved detent. The manufacturer can add a ridge
25 of material to the edge 210 of the charm 110 to form a detent on the charm 110 that corresponds
   in position with the detent on the base 105 when a user pushes the base 105 and charm 110 together.
            A manufacturer can also form one or more detents, whether grooves formed by removing
   material or ridges formed by adding material, to the post 205 and post recess 120. Thus, when
   depressed by the user, the charm 110 detents (not shown) can expand into detents of the base 105,
30 and thus help secure the charm 110 along with any other connection mechanisms illustrated or
   understood from the specification and figures herein.         In one or more implementations, a

   20965.Ia
   manufacturer can create detents in the form of rings of material (not shown) extruding from the
   inner wall surface 410 of the base 105 and the edge 210 of the charm 110. One will appreciate
   that a manufacturer can add any number of features similar to detents, including the grooves and
   ridges described herein, as well as other features that aid in holding the charm 110 and base
 5 together 105 via friction.
            As a result, in one or more implementations, a user cannot overcome the friction force
   holding the charm 110 and base 105 together by simply pulling the charm 110 and base 105 apart
   using fingers. Similarly, the user may not be able to grip the charm 110 and base 105 well enough
   once the user secures the charm 110 and base 105 together to create the force necessary to separate
10 them. To this end, the interchangeable jewelry system 100, and various implementations of the
   system described herein, can include a key 500a that a user employs to separate the charm 110 and
   base 105.
            Along these lines, Figure 5A shows how a user can remove a charm 110 from a base 105
   in accordance with an implementation of the present invention. Figure 5A shows a perspective
15 view where the key 500a protrudes into the post recess 120 and releases the charm 110 from the
   base 105. A user can insert the key 500a into the post recess 120 from the bottom of the base 105
   and push the post 205 out of the post recess 210, thus separating the charm 110 from the base 105.
   The implementations of Figures 4 and 5, as well as other implementations described herein,
   provide the user with a simple and easy separation method. That is, the user can separate the charm
20 110 and base 105 with minimal effort or coordination using only two hands. For example, all the
   user needs to do is hold onto the base 105 with one hand, and push on the post 205 through the
   post recess 120 using the key 500a. The user does not need to grab or otherwise manipulate the
   charm 110 during the separation.
            The key 500a can include various features in multiple implementations described herein.
25 For example, Figures 5B and 5C shows one such implementation of a key design for use in
   accordance with implementations of the present invention. Figure 5B shows a perspective view
   of a key 500b and Figure 5C shows a side view of the key 500b. In general, a key 500b can
   comprise a first gripping element 510, a second release element 515, and a charm release element
   520. A manufacturer can form the second gripping element 515 to be slightly curved and/or
30 grooved on one or more sides to provide a surface that is complimentary to the finger of a user for
   gripping.

   20965.Ia
            Figure 5B and 5C show one implementation of a key 500b where the first gripping element
   is pointed at an angle a away from the main axis       P of the charm release element 520 and key 500b
   in general. In some implementations, a manufacturer can form the key 500b so that the angle a
   varies between 90 to 180 degrees. For example, a manufacturer can form the first gripping element
 5 510 so that the angle a is 90 degrees, resulting in the first gripping element 510 being perpendicular
   to the charm release element 520. Also, for example, a manufacturer can form the key 500b so
   that the first gripping element 510 is disposed coaxial with the charm release element 520, the
   angle a being 180 degrees. One will appreciate that a manufacturer can form the key 500b so that
   the angle a is anywhere between 90 and 180 degrees, greater than 180 degrees, or less than 90
10 degrees.
            In one or more implementations, such as the implementation illustrated in Figures 5B-C, a
   manufacturer can configure the first gripping element 510 to have dimensions to also serve as a
   jewelry release portion. The key 500b can further include a stop element 830. The manufacturer
   can configure the stop element 530 to prevent the key 500b from extending through the base 105
15 beyond the stop element 530 when a user inserts the charm release element 520 into the post recess
    120 to remove the charm 110. In additional or alternative implementations, the key 500b can
   include a design element 840.
            In addition, one will appreciate that the gauge and thickness of the first gripping element
   510 and/or release element 520 can vary as needed to correspond to the wide variety of potential
20 circumference dimensions of the post recess 120 of the bases 105 described herein. For example,
   the first gripping element 510 and/or release element 520 can be the same size, or can be any one
   of the following sizes of 2.6mm, 4.5mm, 5mm, 5.5mm, 9mm, or 9.5mm, or just less than that to
   fit within the 3mm, 5mm, 5.5mm and/or 9mm, 9.5mm post recesses 120 shown or described
   herein. The first gripping element 510 and/or release element 520 can have a cross-sectional shape
25 similar to the shape of the post recess 120 in the base 105 so that a user can insert the release
   element 520 and/or first gripping element 510 through the post recess 120.
            Accordingly, one will appreciate that a wide variety of alternate implementations are
   possible within the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the gauge and thickness
   of the first gripping element 510 and/or release element 520 can vary as needed to correspond to
30 the wide variety of potential circumference dimensions of the post recess 120 of the base 105. For
   example, the gripping element 510 and/or release element 520 can be the same size, or can be any
                                                       -I I

   20965.Ia
   one of the following sizes of 5mm, 5.5mm, 9mm, or 9.5mm, or just less than that to fit within the
   5mm, 5.5mm and/or 9mm, 9.5mm cavities/recesses shown or described above.
            In the illustrated implementation, the stop element 530 comprises an approximately oval
   design. A manufacturer can form stop elements 530 in other key designs that are other shapes,
 5 such as round, square, rectangular, or otherwise polygonal or irregularly shaped, so long as the
   stop element 530 the key 500b from inserting through the base 105 beyond the stop element 530
   once the user releases the charm 110 from the base 105. The stop element 530 can protect the user
   from jamming fingers into the base 105 when pushing the charm 110 away with the key 500b.
            In one or more implementations, a manufacturer can form a key with no stop element 530.
10 In one implementation, a manufacturer can form a key with no second gripping element 515.
   Further along these lines, different key designs for use in accordance with implementations of the
   present invention can include, among other things, a wide variety of style elements.
            In addition, one will appreciate that elements of the present invention can be used as a kit.
   In one implementation, for example, a kit for customizing jewelry can comprise one or more
15 jewelry elements, each of which comprises a form of a base 105 and a plurality of charms 110. In
   one implementation, the kit comprises a base 105 and charms 110 that are squared, or alternatively
   only those that are rounded.      In additional or alternative implementations, the kits comprise a
   mixture of squared and rounded versions of the base and charms. In still further implementations,
   the kit comprises one or more keys of differing possible designs such as those shown in Figures
20 5A-5C. The keys can correspond in size and shape to fit within a post recess 120 for inserting and
   releasing a charm 110 into and out of a base 105.
            The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its
   spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects
   only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the
25 appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the
   meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
