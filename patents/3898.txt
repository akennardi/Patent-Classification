   CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
           10001]    This application is a divisional application of Australian patent application
   2014303085,. which claims priority to US Provisional Patent Application 61/839,100 filed June
15 25, 2013, the contents of the entirety of which is incorporated by this reference.
                                           TECHNICAL FIELD
           [00021    Methods for producing natural cocoa products are disclosed. Natural cocoa
   products including, but not limited to, cocoa cakes, cocoa powders, and food products including
20 such cocoa products are disclosed.
                                 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           [0003]    Cocoa bean processing includes fermenting harvested beans, drying the beans,
   de-hulling the beans to produce nibs, sterilizing the nibs, roasting the nibs, crushing the nibs into
25 cocoa liquor, and optionally pressing the cocoa liquor to obtain cocoa butter and cocoa powder.
           [00041    Traditionally, natural cocoa products are light brown in color and have a pH in
   the range of 5.1 to 6.0. A typical L-value of 10 grams of a natural cocoa in 30 grams of water
   measured with a Hunterlab colorimeter is 20 or higher, and a- and b- values are 8.5 and higher.
           [00051    In order to generate darker and more reddish colors in cocoa products, a certain
30 amount and type of alkali is added in an alkalization process. Alkalization is a process where
   cocoa products are alkalized under a certain amount of moisture, at a certain temperature,
   optionally under pressure, and for a certain amount of time. The alkalization process occurs in
   the presence of sodium, potassium, ammonium, or magnesium hydroxide or carbonate, for
   example and without limitation, potash (K 2C0 3). The alkalization process alters the flavor, color,
35 and solubility of the cocoa powder in water
           [00061    Current commercial demands require a cocoa manufacturer to produce cocoa
   products in a broad palette of colors, flavors, or both. While each manufacturer understands that
    1

   manipulation of processing conditions such as temperature, water content, duration of processing
   time, and pH will affect the color and flavor of the cocoa product, there is no general consensus
   as to how to produce a cocoa product of a consistently desirable color, flavor, or both.
           [0007]   While the alkalization process may be used to produce darker and/or more
 5 reddish cocoa products, the presence of the alkalizing agent also affects the labeling of such
   cocoa products. Such alkalized cocoa products are often labeled as being "processed with alkali."
   Thus, the presence of the alkalizing agent means such cocoa product cannot be considered
   "natural" and consumers are demanding "all natural" products which are typically lighter brown
   in color.
10         [0008]   Thus, a growing need exists for cocoa products that possess the color of
   alkalized cocoa products, yet are considered "natural."
                                  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           [0009]   In each of various embodiments, the present invention helps fulfill these needs
15 and discloses processes for producing "natural" cocoa products that have the color of alkalized
   cocoa products. Cocoa products produced by such methods are also disclosed.
           10010]   In one embodiment, a process for producing a dark brown, natural cocoa
   product includes mixing cocoa cake and water, thus producing a mixture. Subjecting the mixture
   to an elevated pressure, and drying the mixture. The dark brown, natural cocoa product is not
20 alkalized.
           [0011]   In a further embodiment, a natural, cocoa product has an L-value of between
   about 10 and about 15, an a-value of between about 4 and about 6.2, a b-value of between about
   3.5 and about 6.0, and a pH of less than about 6.

                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
            [00191    In one embodiment, dark, natural cocoa is produced. The dark, natural cocoa
10 may be dark brown. The cocoa may be cocoa cake or cocoa powder.
            10020]    In a further embodiment, a process for producing the dark, natural cocoas
   includes mixing cocoa cake with water, thus producing a mixture, subjecting the mixture to an
   elevated pressure, and/or drying the mixture. The moisture of the mixture may be between about
   26% and about 35%. The water may also be heated to a temperature of less than about 125'C, a
15 temperature of between about 85'C and 120'C, or a temperature of about 190OF to about 250 0 F.
            [00211    In another embodiment, the mixture of the cocoa cake and the water may be
   subjected to pressure, such as between about 5 and about 25 psi. The mixture may be reacted at
   the pressure for a time of between about 30 and about 200 minutes. The mixture may be dried,
   such as at atmospheric pressure or under vacuum. The cocoa cake may also be ground into a
20 cocoa powder, which may have a fineness of a minimum of 98% through a 200 mesh screen.
            [0022]    In an embodiment, the cocoa cake may be of a West African origin and in other
   embodiment, may be of other origins.
            [00231    In yet an additional embodiment, the nibs, the de-shelled beans, or the
   combination thereof are sterilized.
25          [0024]    In yet a further embodiment, the cocoa nibs, the de-shelled beans, or the
   combination thereof are ground, thus producing cocoa liquor. The cocoa liquor may be separated
   into cocoa butter and cocoa presscake, or the cocoa liquor may be defatted. The cocoa presscake
   may be further ground into cocoa powder.
            [00251    In another embodiment, the natural cocoa products of the present invention may
30 have a dark color which refers to cocoa products with an L-value less than about 15.0, 14.0, 13.0,
    12.0, 11.0, 10.0, 9.0, 8.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, or lower, inclusive of intervals between those values.
   The L-value may also be between about 10 and about 15. The a-values may be between about 4
   and about 6.2. The b-values may be between about 3.5 and about 6.5. The calculated C-values
    3

   may be between about 5 and about 10. The calculated H-values may be between about 42 and
   about 49.
            [0026]   In yet an additional embodiment, a natural cocoa product of the present
   invention has a pH of less than about 6, between about 3 to about 6, a pH of between about 4.5 to
 5 about 6, or a pH of between about 5 to about 6.
            [0027]   In one embodiment, a starting material for the processes described herein may
   be de-shelled cocoa beans which refers to any suitable cocoa bean fraction/product having the
   shells substantially removed, broken, and/or winnowed. Non-limiting examples of de-shelled
   cocoa beans include, but are not limited to, nibs, kernels, and cotyledons. De-shelled cocoa beans
10 typically contain a small fraction of contaminating shells that are within commercially acceptable
   tolerances since no de-shelling process is 100% complete.
            [00281   In an additional embodiment, the cocoa beans used to produce the natural cocoa
   products of the present invention are good fermented. In a further embodiment, the cocoa beans
   used to produce the natural cocoa products of the present invention are under- or un- fermented.
15          [0029]   In one embodiment, the natural cocoa products produced herein are suitable for
   many commercial purposes, including, without limitation, food products. Examples of food
   products include, but are not limited to, chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, semi-sweet
   chocolate, baking chocolate, candies, pralines, truffles, candy bars, flavoring syrup,
   confectionary coatings, compound coatings, fillings, beverages, dairy products, milk, ice cream,
20 beverage mixes, smoothies, soy milk, cakes, cheesecakes, cookies, pies, diet bars, meal-substitute
   solid foods and beverages, energy bars, chocolate chips, yogurt, yogurt drinks, pudding, mousse,
   mole, chocolates with lower bitterness, chocolate with fillings such as yogurt, and/or cheesecake.
            [00301   A number of objective methods for measuring the color of cocoa products are
   known. In one method, the Hunter color system or CIE 1976 (CIELAB) and like systems, color
25 may be described in terms of three parameters: Lightness (L)--the light or dark aspect of a color,
   where the lower the L-value, the darker the cocoa powder will appear; Chroma (C)--the intensity
   of a color by which one distinguishes a bright or gray color, where the higher the C-value, the
   brighter the powder will be; and Hue (H)-- referring to color in daily speech, such as red, yellow,
   or blue. For cocoa powders, a low H value indicates a red color and a high H-value indicates a
30 brown color.
            [00311   The CIE 1976 color system describes colors in terms of coordinates L, "a*" and
   "b*". The L coordinate is consistent with the Value of Lightness, and from the a* and b*
   coordinates, the Chroma and Hue can be calculated as follows: C*= {square root over
   (a* 2 +b* 2)}; H=arctan(b*/a*).
    4

           [00321    The spectral color is the result of the source of light and the reflecting surface.
   For a good reproducible measurement of color, the source of light is standardized. There are two
   basic approaches for measuring color: visually or by instrumentation. There is a natural human
   tendency to trust only "one's own eyes." For this reason, colors are still frequently judged
 5 visually. To be able to do this in a reproducible manner, certain standard conditions should be
   met: the light source., for example and without limitation, a CIE standard light source; the
   positions of the sample, relative to the light source, which are preferably at an angle of 45' to
   each other; the background of the sample, uniform and preferably gray; the distance between the
   eyes and the sample and position of the eyes relative to the sample; and the size of the sample.
10         [0033]    In practice, color cabinets are used with standard light sources for visual color
   determinations. Color meters and spectrophotometers are used for instrument color readings.
   Instrument color measurements were made in the Examples herein using 10 grams of a natural
   cocoa in 30 grams of water measured with a Hunterlab colorimeter. Unless otherwise indicated,
   the color values described in the Examples, and all reference herein to color values L, a and b
15 are readings using the Hunterlab colorimeter. The color parameters described herein refer to the
   L, a, and b readings, and C values and H values were calculated. The color values recited herein
   are approximate in the sense that color measurements may vary from spectrophotometer-to
   spectrophotometer, typically in the range of +/- 0.5 for L, a, b, C, and H values.
           [0034]    The following examples illustrate various non-limiting embodiments of the
20 compositions within the present disclosure and are not restrictive of the invention as otherwise
   described or claimed herein.

           [00361    Non-alkalized cocoa cake was treated with water at levels between 27 and 35%,
25 at pressure levels of between 5 and 22 psi, and a treatment time of about 30 minutes. The
   treatments were carried out in an industrial size reactor typically used for cake alkalization
   processes. The conditions of the various trials are shown in Table 1.

   water (using Hunterlab at a 25% slurry of the powder in the water); color in milk (visually at a
 5 4% solution of the powder in milk); for fineness (wet as determined by the percent through a 75

            10041]   The color values of Table 2 indicate a strong color development of the cocoa
   cake treated with water. Trials 1 and 2 show L values between that of a typical alkalized, red and
   typical alkalized, dark brown cocoa, and the L value of Trial 3 has an L value between that of an
 5 alkalized red and a medium, alkalized brown cocoa. The lower C value corresponds to a lower
   brightness and grayish hue. The H value did not change significantly during the water treatment
   indicating that the powder stayed brown and didn't show the red tones that are typical for
   alkalized cocoa powders. Overall, the color values show the natural, dark cocoa of the present
   invention are truly dark brown as compared to traditional natural cocoas. The observed color in
10 milk confirms the results of the measured cocoa values.
            [00421   The flavor of the dark, natural cocoas is significantly different from regular,
   natural cocoas and alkalized cocoas. Typical natural cocoas are acidic, astringent, bitter, may
   have some fruity notes, and may have some additional origin specific notes. In typical alkalized
   cocoas, the acidic notes of natural cocoas are replaced by an increased alkaline impact the overall
15 cocoa impact becomes more intense and the astringency is reduced. The degree of alkalization
   determines the intensity of these notes.
            10043]   The dark, natural cocoas of the present invention have a mild cocoa impact,
   show slight spicy, slight sour, and very slight astringent notes. Trial 2 had some roasted notes and
   Trial 1 had slightly more intense roasted notes. The natural, dark cocoas of the present invention
20 are different from the flavor of traditional, natural cocoa or alkalized cocoa products. The color
   of the natural, dark cocoas of the present invention is also on the dark side of the overall color
   spectrum and may be mixed with a traditional, natural cocoa, such as at a ratio of 1 to 2 in order
   to create a color impact similar to that of a medium, alkalized cocoa, yet having the flavor of a
   natural cocoa.
25          [00441   Example 2.
            10045]   A compound coating was prepared using the dark, natural cocoa products of
   Example 1. The formulations in Table 4 were used to prepare a white base and a cocoa base.

           [00471     The cocoa powders used were a commercially available natural cocoa (N), a
   commercially available red cocoa (R), a commercially available black cocoa (B), the cocoa of
   Trial 1, the cocoa of Trial 2, and the cocoa of Trial 3 of Example 1. The white base and the cocoa
 5 base were mixed to create products having cocoa contents of between 1 and 15%. The L-values
   of the various products was evaluated and are shown in FIG. 1.
           [0048]     FIG. I shows the color strength in the compound coatings of the dark, natural
   cocoas as compared to coatings prepared with the commercially available natural cocoa (N), the
   commercially available red cocoa (R), and the commercially available black cocoa (B). The L
10 value of the compound coating with the cocoa of Trial 3 is between the coatings produced with
   the natural (N) and red (R) cocoa. Between 75-85% of the cocoa of Trial 3 is required to produce
   the same L value as the coating with the natural (N) cocoa. The L-value of the cocoa of Trial 2 in
   the coating is lower than the L-value of the red (R) cocoa in the coating, and between 60-80% of
   the Trial 2 cocoa is needed to achieve the same L-value in a coating as the natural (N) cocoa. The
15 coating with the cocoa from Trial I is the darkest of the coatings produced with the dark, natural
   cocoas of Example 1, and between 50 and 70% of the cocoa of Trial 1 is needed to achieve the
   same L-value as the natural (N) cocoa in the coating.
           [0049]     a- and b- measurements were also taken of the compound coatings produced in
   this Example and are shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, respectively. The a-values of the coatings
20 including the dark, natural cocoas of Trials 1, 2, and 3 are lower than the a-value of the coatings
   having the red (R) cocoa and the natural (N) cocoa. The b-value of the coating including the
   cocoa of Trial 3 is almost the same as the coating having the red (R) cocoa and lower than the b
   value of the coating with the natural (N) cocoa. The b-values for coatings having the dark, natural
   cocoas of Trials 1 and 2 are lower than the b-value of the coating having the red (R) cocoa.
25         [0050]     The calculated C- and H-values show that the coatings having the dark, natural
   cocoas of Trials 1 and 2 are fairly similar in brightness and hue, while the coating with the cocoa
   of Trial 3 is less gray than the coatings with the cocoas of Trials 1 and 2. The three coatings with
   the dark, natural cocoas of Example I are dark brown, with no development of a red hue as
   typically seen with alkalized cocoas.
    8

           [00511    The data in this Example shows that in a compound coating, a lower amount of
   the dark, natural cocoa of the present invention is needed to achieve a certain L-value as
   compared to the commercially available natural (N) cocoa. This would be beneficial since a cost
   savings could be realized by using less cocoa when manufacturing a food containing such cocoa
 5 products.
           [0052]    Example 3.
           10053]    The flavors of compound coatings produced with the dark, natural cocoas of
   Example I were compared against a commercially available cocoa as the reference. The
   following blends were used: reference included 10% of a commercially available natural cocoa
10 plus 5% of a commercially available red cocoa; Trial 1 included 10% of a commercially
   available natural cocoa plus 5% of the cocoa of Trial 1; Trial 2 included 10% of a commercially
   available natural cocoa plus 5% of the cocoa of Trial 2; and Trial 3 included 10% of a
   commercially available natural cocoa plus 5% of the cocoa of Trial 3. The three trials were tasted
   against the reference.
15         [0054]    A group of 17 experienced panelists were asked to use a scale ranging from -6 to
   +6 for a range of descriptors typical for compound coatings. The average of the evaluations was
   calculated and the results are presented in the spider graph of FIG. 4.
           [0055]    The blends including cocoas from Trials 2 and 3 scored very similar and except
   for the sour/acidic impact, were very similar to the reference coating including the reference
20 cocoa. The blend including the cocoa from Trial 1 was less sweet and had a higher impact for
   cocoa/chocolate, sour/acidic, and roasted notes.
           [0056]    Example 4.
           [00571    The blends of Example 3 including the dark, natural cocoas of Trials 1, 2, and 3,
   a reference natural cocoa powder (Ref), and a reference natural cocoa powder mixed with a red
25 cocoa (Red), and an all red cocoa were also tested in chocolate flavored cakes. The cakes were
   made using a conventional recipe and having 5.4% cocoa. The blends evaluated included 2/3
   (3.6% of recipe) of a reference natural cocoa blended with a reference red cocoa or a dark,
   natural cocoa of Example 1, or 5.4% red cocoa.
           [00581    All of the cakes evaluated in this Example had similar baking performances,
30 height, and shapes. The only exception was the cake made with the reference natural cocoa,
   which had a lower height. The color of the cake with the cocoa of Trial I was the darkest and had
   more brown than reddish tones as compared to the reference blends. The cakes with the cocoas of
   Trials 2 and 3 were similar in color, darker, and more brown than one of the reference cocoas,
   and a bit lighter and more brown than the other reference cocoa.
    9

           [00591     The flavor of the cakes was evaluated with a group of seven experienced tasters.
   A spider graph of the results of the taste evaluate is shown in FIG. 5. The cake with the Ref blend
   cocoa (3.6% standard natural cocoa and 1.8% standard red cocoa) was more acidic and had some
   bitter and earthy notes not present in the Red blend. The cake with the cocoa of Trial 1 was more
 5 acidic, had notes of bitter. burnt, and woody not present in the Ref sample. The cake having the
   cocoa of Trial 2 had more chocolate notes than the Ref sample and also had spicy, wood, burnt,
   and fruity notes. The cake with the cocoa of Trial 3 has more chocolate notes, but was otherwise
   similar to the Ref sample.
           [00601     The cocoa from Trial I was also used in a cookie and compared to cookies
10 produced with cocoas of medium/red alkalization. The cookies produced with the cocoa of Trial
    I were more brown than the alkalized powders.
           [00611     Example 5.
           [0062]     The same blends of cocoas evaluated in the compound coatings of Example 3
   (Trial 1, Trial 2, Trial 3, and Ref) were also evaluated in pudding and compared to lightly
15 alkalized cocoa (LA). The pudding recipe used was: 1 package of JELL-O brand vanilla instant
   pudding; 3 cups of 2% milk; and 25 grams of cocoa (2.7% by weight). As seen in the previous
   examples, the cocoa of Trial 1 was darker and more brown than the Ref blend in the puddings.
   The cocoa of Trial 2 in the pudding was darker and more brown than the Ref blend in the
   pudding. The puddings produced with the cocoas of Trials I and 2 were clearly darker and more
20 brown than the pudding produced with the lightly alkalized cocoa.
           [0063]     Flavor evaluations were also performed in the puddings and the results are
   presented in the spider graph of FIG. 6. Consistent with the previous examples, the cocoa from
   Trial 1 in the pudding was more acidic and has less chocolate and milky notes than the Ref
   cocoa. The pudding with the cocoa of Trial 2 was sweeter and lower in cocoa/chocolate, milky,
25 and roasted notes than the pudding with the Ref cocoa. The pudding with the Trial 3 cocoa was
   less sweet and more intense in chocolate and milky notes than the pudding with the Ref cocoa.
           [00641     Example 6.
           [0065]     The natural, dark cocoas of Example I were also evaluated in Greek yogurt.
   CHOBANI brand Greek yogurt was mixed with blends of a reference cocoa and the cocoas of
30 Trials 1 and 2 at levels of 3% and 5% of the cocoa. In a couple of samples, 4% and 6% sugar was
   also added to compensate for the bitterness. The five samples evaluated included: 3% of a
   reference cocoa; 1.5% of the reference cocoa and 1.5% of the Trial I cocoa; 1.5% of the
   reference cocoa and 1.5% of the Trial 2 cocoa; 2% of the reference cocoa, 1% of the Trial I
   cocoa, and 4% sugar; and 2.6% of the reference cocoa, 1.3% of the Trial I cocoa, and 6% sugar.
    10

   An evaluation of the various samples resulted in the last sample, 2.6% of the reference cocoa,
   1.3% of the Trial I cocoa, and 6% sugar, being the favorite because of the color and pleasant
   chocolate flavor.
           [0066]     Example 7.
 5         [00671     Five samples of cocoas were prepared. A commercially available natural cocoa
   (Sample 1), a blend of 2/3 of the commercially available natural cocoa and 1/3 of a reference red
   cocoa (Ref), a blend of 2/3 of the commercially available natural cocoa and 1/3 of the natural,
   dark cocoa of Trial 2 (Sample 2), a blend of 2/3 of the commercially available natural cocoa and
   1/3 of the natural, dark cocoa of Trial 1 Sample 3) were evaluated in ice cream. The ice cream
10 was prepared using the following formulation: 315 ml of half & half; 315 ml of heavy whipping
   cream; 115 grains of sugar; 0.5 teaspoons of vanilla extract; and 15 grams of the cocoa samples.
   The ingredients were mixed, scraped, and frozen in an ice cream maker for about 30-40 minutes.
           [0068]     The ice creams made with the cocoas of Trials 1 and 2 were darker than the ice
   cream made with the reference mix, where the ice cream including the cocoa of Trial I was the
15 darkest. The colors of the ice creams made with the cocoas of Trials 1 and 2 were similar to ice
   creams made with lightly, alkalized cocoas.
           10069]    A sensory evaluation by a panel of 14 experienced tasters was performed with
   the ice creams prepared in this Example. A spider graph of the results of the evaluation is shown
   in FIG. 7. Ice cream made with the natural cocoa (Sample 1) was the most acidic, the ice cream
20 made with the cocoa of Trial 2 (Sample 2) had prominent maple, caramel, and/or spice notes, and
   the ice cream made with the cocoa of Trial I (Sample 3) was a bit lower in chocolate/cocoa
   impact as compared to the rest of the ice creams.
