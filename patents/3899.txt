                     AN INSECT CATCHING MEANS AND INSECT TRAP
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present invention relates to an insect trap and insect catching means. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an insect trap which has been designed to facilitate
simple and efficient servicing, maintenance and cleaning.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]      Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0003]      Insect traps of various types are well known. A particularly common trap type,
particularly for flying insects, comprises an insect attractant means, such as, for example a UV
light source and an insect trapping means, such as, for example an adhesive board or paper
contained in a housing. The flying insects are attracted to the trap, enter the housing through
openings and get caught on the trapping means. To maintain efficiency of capture, the adhesive
board or paper needs to be regularly replaced and the trap cleaned. The adhesive board or
paper also needs to be inspected and records kept. The lights also need to be cleaned as
insects get "welded" to the bulbs and in any case, the lights have a limited life span.
[0004]      The traps are often fitted outdoors or in factories, and are mounted on walls to an
electricity supply. Therefore, if they are to be cleaned with water, or the factories experience jet
washing of floors and walls, the electrical contacts need to be isolated to avoid risk of
electrocution. In some traps, a "sealable" cover is screwed from each light over each
respective electrical contact. This means a person servicing the traps needs to unscrew two
caps for each light and there are often at least two and more typically at least three lights per
trap. Additionally, since the lights are positioned in front of the glue board on a housing base,
access can be difficult and the job unpleasant.
[0005]      It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the
disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.

                                                   -2
PRESENT INVENTION
[0006]      There is disclosed a trap for catching insects comprising
            a. a back housing;
            b. a frame, swing mounted to said housing; and
            c. a cover comprising openings allowing insects to enter the trap wherein said frame
supports one or a plurality of lights such that said frame and lights can be moved from a first
position, where they overlie the back housing, to a second position where they lie clear of the
back housing such that an insect catching means, which may be fitted over the back housing,
is readily accessible for replacement during servicing.
[0007]      Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the
claims, the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive
sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of
"including, but not limited to".
[0008]      Advantageously, by supporting the lights on a separate frame, which can be swung
away from the back housing, allows easier access to both the lights and the insect catching
means. In particular, it avoids a requirement when mounting the trap to provide sufficient
clearance above the trap to allow for fitting of the insect catching means.
[0009]      Typically, one or a plurality of reflectors is preferably fitted behind the one or more
lights and the novel construction allows for these to be fitted in a manner allowing for quick
release and easy maintenance. In this regard, the reflectors may be supported by opposing
retaining stops a gap there between being accessed by flexing the reflector so it "snap locks"
into the gap between the opposing stops.
[0010]      The frame preferably takes the form of a light weight perimeter frame and comprises
a flanged handle at a side opposite to that which is hinged to the back housing. It preferably
comprises ducting or channels which communicate with the back housing in a manner which
prevents water ingress. It is through these channels that the electric wiring is ducted and the
channels are then appropriately sealed.
[0011]      Preferably, the back housing is shaped so that it can also receive fluorescent high
frequency electronic ballast. Such ballast is carbon friendly, provides for flicker free start of the
lights, offers higher UV output and avoids the need for a starter.

                                                 -3
[0012]     In a favoured embodiment, two traps of the invention may be connected back to
back such that they can be suspended.
[0013]     Advantageously, to prevent the risk of accidental breakage of the lights on opening,
the trap is designed to limit the degree of swing of the frame. This may be achieved by the
provision of a stop. It is also held in a shut position by means of a retaining mechanism, such
as a magnetic lock.
[0014]     Preferably the trap further comprises a mechanism which prevents removal of the
cover until the frame has been moved from its closed position. This prevents accidental
displacement of the cover, thereby reducing the possibility of cover breakage.
[0015]     The inner face of the back housing preferably comprises a means for raising the
insect capture means there from at a number of points so as to ease its removal. Such raised
means may comprise protrusions such as pimples or ridges.
[0016]     The insect caching means is preferably retained in position by retaining means which
may be regularly spaced. In a preferred embodiment the retainers are spaced and shaped to
receive a castellated insect capture means allowing it to be positioned in a two step process
comprising aligning the castellated paper with the retainers and then sliding it down so it is
retained in position.
[0017]     The back housing is designed to comprise or allow for the fitting of one or more of, for
example, an electrical IEC socket, a heat sink, mounting means, air vents and cable stowage.
[0018]     Preferably the cover is translucent and comprises an innermost surface which helps
maximise UV emission from the trap as claimed in EP1457111.
[0019]     More preferably it is adapted to ensure the lights are not readily visible through the
cover as claimed in EP0947134. To this end, in a particularly favoured embodiment the cover
comprises louver openings angled to prevent the lights being visible when viewed substantially
perpendicularly to a plane of the back housing. A more favoured arrangement is one in which
the louver openings are paired about a centre point to provide a downward and upward
inflexion respectively. Such an arrangement helps to draw air in at the bottom of the trap.
[0020]     There is also disclosed a trap for catching insects comprising
            a. a back housing;

                                                  -4
            b. a plurality of lights; and
            c. a cover
            wherein said trap is adapted for ease of servicing and jet cleaning by the provision of
shields each of which sealably protect, from water ingress, a plurality of lights at the positions
where they connect to electrical fittings.
[0021]      Preferably, the shields are secured in position by fittings which can be released
manually.
[0022]      A preferred trap comprising these shields further comprises the advantageous
features described with respect to the trap described above at paragraphs [0006] to [0019].
[0023]      According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an insect catching
means comprising at least two insect capture surfaces, a first surface of which is one colour or
shade, and a second surface, which is designed to facilitate ease of counting and or
identification of captured insects, which is a different colour or shade to the first surface.
[0024]      Preferably the second surface can be easily detached from the first surface for record
keeping, there being a line of weakening e.g. perforation, between the first and second surface.
[0025]      In a preferred embodiment the second surface includes a non-glued area which can
have date written or easily appended thereto, such as date of use information. Preferably the
second surface is a light colour or shade designed to highlight the captured insects, and more
preferably contains grid lines to facilitate easy determination of insect number per given area.
[0026]      Preferably the first surface is a darker shade or colour to absorb light and make
captured insects less visible to someone viewing the trap through e.g. a cover.
[0027]      Advantageously, the present invention at least in a preferred form provides one or
more traps which allow for simple and efficient servicing maintenance and cleaning. More
advantageously the invention makes identification of e.g. the number and/ or type of captured
insects easier and to facilitate good record keeping.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0040]     Referring to the Figs an insect trap (10) comprises three basic components: a back
housing (12); a frame (14) and a cover (16). These are clearly illustrated in Fig 5. The frame
(14) is a perimeter frame (Fig 3), comprising upper (14a) and lower (14b) frame members and
two side members (14c; 14d). The perimeter frame (14) is swing, swivel or hinge mounted to
the back housing (12) via a swing mechanism (20) which is substantially hidden (Fig 2).

                                                  -6
[0041]      A plurality of 15W or 25W UV lights (22), three are illustrated in the example, are
connected to paired electrical fittings (24a; 24b) (Fig 2), and wiring (not shown) runs in channels
or conduits (not shown) which are sealed by rubber or silicon gaskets (not shown) and enclosed
by fascia plates (26) (Fig 3) which are preferably metallic such that they provide rigidity to the
moulded plastics frame. The metal also allows the frame to be held shut against a magnetic
contact (28) provided on the back housing (12). The wiring runs through the swing mechanism
(20) (which is hollow) into the back housing (12) where it exits the rear face (30) at an IEC socket
(32) (Figs 4 and 6). The back housing is additionally provided with one or more key hole
apertures (34) to facilitate mounting, ventilation conduits (36) and cable stowage arms (38). It
also comprises a space (40) for a heat sink (not shown) and fluorescent high frequency
electronic ballast (42).
[0042]      Behind each light (22) there is provided a reflector (44) which is held in place by
stops (46) which enable the reflectors to be sprung mounted thereby facilitating ease of
removal for cleaning (Fig 2). An insect capturing means (100), in the form of e.g. a castellated
adhesive paper (Fig 11) can be easily fitted and/ or removed by swinging open the frame (14)
and cover (16) of the closed trap (Fig 1) by placing ones fingers under a flange (48) which
extends from the perimeter frame member (14c) opposite the hinged frame member (14a) to
an open position as shown in Fig 3. An adhesive paper (100) can then be fitted to the inner
face (50) of the back housing (12) over ridges (52) by pushing it over shaped retaining pegs
(54) and moving it in a downwardly direction such that the paper is held in place by the pegs
(54). To remove the paper the paper is lifted to align the castellation with the pegs before
pulling it over the pegs.
[0043]      The cover (16) is made of a translucent material and has an innermost surface which
is shaped or roughened to maximise the transmission of UV light as set out in EP1457111.
The openings (18) which allow insects in are louvered and are angled to prevent the lights (22)
being visible when viewed substantially perpendicularly to the normal plane of the back
housing (12). The general principle of maintaining a pleasant appearance of trap is set out in
EP0947134 but the use of louvers is a further improvement in this regard. In particular, the
louver openings (18) are paired about a centre axis (x-x) to provide a downward and upward
inflexion respectively of between 30 and 600.
[0044]      According to one embodiment of the invention, an insect trap is provided and most
clearly illustrated with reference to Figs 7-9. It relates to a trap which need not comprise a
frame (14) swing mounted to the back housing (12) as per Figure 1. It addresses the issue of

                                                  -7
trap serviceability and simplifies the seal mechanism around a trap comprising a plurality of
lights (22) and paired electrical fittings (24a; 24b) making the trap well suited to jet washing (to
IP65 requirements). Rather than seeking to place a sealed fitting around each contact point,
instead shields (60) are fitted around a plurality of lights (22) and a plurality of electrical fittings
(24a or 24b) to sealable protect a plurality of contacts simultaneously against water ingress. In
this manner two single shields (60) can be removed to access a plurality of lights. In addition to
speeding up the process of changing the lights the provision of two manually operable screw
fittings (62), which face outwardly and are readily accessible to service personnel, simplifies
the change. Thus, each shield (60) comprises a shaped housing (64) comprising a plurality of
generally arcuately shaped recesses (66) which are designed to sealingly sit over silicon
sealing members or gaskets (68) (Fig 9) which are fitted about the lights (22) such that when
the shields are secured in place over the sealing members (68) the connections are made
water tight.
[0045]      The traps are designed such that two traps can be connected via a connector (80)
(Fig 10) which slots into apertures (82) in the rear face (30) of the back housing (12). The
connector (80) comprises a plurality of apertures (84) running there through allowing cables
(86) to be used to suspend the traps.
[0046]      Referring to Fig 11, the insect capture means (100) is designed to facilitate
identification of and/or counting of captured insects and record keeping. It comprises at least
two insect capture surfaces (102; 104), a first surface of which (102) is one colour or shade,
preferably black or a dark colour, and a second surface (104) of which is designed to facilitate
ease of counting and or identification of captured insects and which is most preferably white or
a light shade, as most insects are dark.
[0047]      Preferably, the second surface (104) is easily detached or otherwise separated from
the first surface (102) for record keeping, there being a line of perforations (106) or other
means facilitating folding and separation, between the first (102) and second (104) surface.
[0048]      The second surface includes a non-glued area (108) outside of grid lines (110) for
insertion of data, such as date of use information. The grid lines are of a regular size, e.g.
2.5mm 2 to facilitate data capture, such as, number of insects per given area.
[0049]      The second surface (104) can be at any position but it is preferred to position it
within the trap at a position which reflects either average or maximum capture. Maximum

                                                  -8
capture is likely to occur at the bottom of the trap and accordingly, in the embodiment
illustrated, the second surface is the surface which folds to catch falling insects.
