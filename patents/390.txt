                                             ABSTRACT
       The present invention provides abuse deterrent mucoadhesive devices for delivery
of buprenorphine. Each device comprises a mucoadhesive layer and a backing layer, and
the pH in each layer is selected, such that absorption of buprenorphine is maximized.

                                       BUPRENORPHINE
RELATED APPLICATIONS
         This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2012296346, the entire
contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND
         Buprenorphine is a partial p-opiate receptor agonist, an ORLI/nociceptin receptor
agonist with high affinity, and slow association and dissociation from the receptors, and a
K-opiate receptor antagonist. Transmucosal bioavailability of buprenorphine is greater
than its oral bioavailability, and, as a result, buprenorphine has been initially developed
and marketed as a sublingual dosage form. Buprenorphine has been generally available as
Temgesic* 0.2 mg sublingual tablets and as Buprenex* in a 0.3 mg/ml parenteral
formulation, both indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain.
         Because there is some risk of abuse with buprenorphine, particularly in the doses
used for opioid dependence, a combination product with naloxone, an opioid antagonist,
has been developed. The addition of naloxone to buprenorphine decreases the parenteral
abuse potential of buprenorphine in opioid dependent subjects, as injected naloxone
precipitates withdrawal by displacing the non-buprenorphine opioid from the receptor sites
and blocking those sites from buprenorphine occupancy. Human laboratory studies have
been conducted to test different dosage ratios of buprenorphine and naloxone (Fudala P.J.
et al., Effects of buprenorphine and naloxone in morphine-stabilized opioid addicts, (1998)
Drug Alcohol Depend., 50(1):1-8; Mendelson J. et al., Buprenorphine and naloxone
combinations: the effects of three dose ratios in morphine-stabilized, opiate-dependent
volunteers, (1999) Psychopharmacology141:37-46) and have led to the conclusion that a
formulation comprising buprenorphine and naloxone at the dose ratio of w/w 2:1 or 4:1
should be optimal for providing deterrence for opiate abusers. Suboxone* a sublingual pill

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that bioavailability
of an opioid agonist, e.g., buprenorphine, disposed in the mucoadhesive layer of a two
layered, abuse-resistant transmucosal drug delivery device is not only affected by the pH
of the mucoadhesive layer, but is also affected by the pH of the backing layer that resides
on the lingual side of the bi-layer film. This layer may or may not contain an opioid

                                              -3
antagonist, however in the preferred embodiment of the composition of the backing layer,
it does include an opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Accordingly, both the pH of the
mucoadhesive layer and the pH of the backing layer may be chosen such that the
absorption of buprenorphine from the mucoadhesive layer is similar or higher than
absorption from the mucoadhesive layer of a device with an unbuffered backing layer,
while the absorption of naloxone, if present in the backing layer, is impeded.
         The present invention is also based, at least in part, on the surprising discovery, that
the mucoadhesive devices with buffered backing layer may comprise smaller doses of
naloxone, while still providing abuse deterrence. The dose of naloxone is lowered, such
that the w/w buprenorphine to naloxone ratio is higher than the ratio of 4:1, accepted in the
art as being effective for providing abuse deterrence. In some embodiments, the w/w
buprenorphine to naloxone ratio present in the mucoadhesive device of the invention is
between 4:1 and 10:1. In a specific embodiment, the w/w buprenorphine to naloxone ratio
is 6:1. Such a device is advantageous because it can provide effective abuse deterrence at
a lower naloxone dose.
         This invention does not purport the need for naloxone in the backing layer. In
some embodiments, the amount of naloxone required to precipitate withdrawal is as low as
0.1 mg when abused by injection. In some embodiments, the maximum ratio of
buprenorphine dose to naloxone is 10:1 and can be as low at 1:1. In some embodiments,
the ratio of buprenorphine dose to naloxone is 10:1 to 4:1. In a specific embodiment, the
ratio is 6:1.
         In some embodiments, the present invention provides an abuse deterrent
         mucoadhesive device for use in managing pain or opioid dependence, the device
         comprising:
                a mucoadhesive layer comprising buprenorphine buffered to a pH of
         between about 4.0 and about 6.0; and

Definitions
        The following definitions are provided as guidance as to the meaning of certain
terms used herein.
        As used herein, the articles "a" and "an" mean "one or more" or "at least one,"
unless otherwise indicated. That is, reference to any element of the present invention by
the indefinite article "a" or "an" does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the
element is present.

                                                 -8
         As used herein, the term "absorption" refers to the process of a substance, such as a
drug, entering the bloodstream. Absorption can be measured by pharmacokinetic
parameters, such as AUCif and       Cmax.
         As used herein, the term "acute pain" refers to pain characterized by a short
duration, e.g., three to six months. Acute pain is typically associated with tissue damage,
and manifests in ways that can be easily described and observed. It can, for example,
cause sweating or increased heart rate. Acute pain can also increase over time, and/or
occur intermittently.
         As used herein, the term "bioavailability" is as defined in 21 CFR Section 320.1
and refers to the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed
from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action. The term "bioavailable,"
"absolute bioavailability" or "total bioavailability" refers to the total bioavailability
including amounts that are transmitted via the mucosal membrane (i.e., transmucosally)
and through the GI tract. The term "absolute bioavailability" refers to a fraction of a drug
absorbed through non-intravenous administration (i.e., transmucosal, oral, rectal,
transdermal, subcutaneous, or sublingual administration) compared with the bioavailability
of the same drug following intravenous administration. The comparison is dose
normalized, i.e., accounts for different doses consequently, the amount absorbed is
corrected by dividing the corresponding dose administered. In some embodiments, the
mucoadhesive devices of the present invention provide absolute bioavailability of the
opioid agonist buprenorphine that is equal to or greater than 40%, e.g., 40%, 41%, 42%,
43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%,

         As used herein, the term "bioequivalence" or "bioequivalent" is as defined in 21
CFR Section 320.1, and means the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent
of absorption of an active ingredient or active moiety in one pharmaceutical product and

                                                -9
another. For bioequivalence, the pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC for
bioequivalent actives fall within the 80%-125% range of each other. In some
embodiments, the devices of the present invention may be bioequivalent to Suboxone@
sublingual tablet. Pharmacokinetic parameters, e.g., Cmax and AUCisf, for Suboxone@
sublingual tablets comprising 2.0/0.5 mg and 8.0/2.0 mg of buprenorphine/naloxone is
contained in the product label for Suboxone@, which is incorporated herein by reference in
its entirety.
         As used herein, the term "chronic pain" refers to pain which persists beyond the
usual recovery period for an injury or illness. Chronic pain can be constant or intermittent.
Common causes of chronic pain include, but are not limited to, arthritis, cancer, Reflex
Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome (RSDS), repetitive stress injuries, shingles, headaches,
fibromyalgia, and diabetic neuropathy, lower back pain, neck and shoulder pain, moderate
to severe osteoarthritis, and patients with severe migraine.
         As used herein, unless indicated otherwise, the term "buprenorphine", includes any
pharmaceutically acceptable form of buprenorphine, including, but not limited to, salts,
esters, and prodrugs thereof. In one embodiment, the term "buprenorphine" refers to
buprenorphine hydrochloride. As used herein, the term "buprenorphine derivative" refers
to compounds having similar structure and function to buprenorphine. In some
embodiments, buprenorphine derivatives include those of the following formula:
                  R3
                                 CH3
                                   R4
ROO                       OCH 3
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof, wherein
/
              is a double or single bond; R 3 is selected from a -C 1 _4 alkyl group or a
cycloalkyl-substituted-C 1 _4 alkyl group; R4 is selected from a -Ci_4 alkyl; R5 is -OH, or

                                            -  10
taken together, R 4 and R5 form a =0 group; and R 6 is selected from -H or a -C1 4 alkyl
group.
         Buprenorphine derivatives include, but are not limited to, etorphine and
diprenorphine. General buprenorphine derivatives are described in WO 2008/011194,
which is hereby incorporated by reference.
        As used herein, unless indicated otherwise, the term "naloxone" includes any
pharmaceutically acceptable form of naloxone, including, but not limited to, salts, esters,
and prodrugs thereof. In one embodiment, the term "naloxone" refers to naloxone
hydrochloride. In some embodiments, naloxone is represented by the following chemical
structure:
  HO
     Q           OH
                       N
        As used herein, the term "mucoadhesive layer"~ or "polymeric diffusion
environment" refers to an environment capable of allowing flux of a medic ament to a
mucosal surface upon creation of a gradient by adhesion of the polymeric diffusion
environment to a mucosal surface. The flux of a transported medicament is proportionally
related to the diffusivity of the environment which can be manipulated by, e.g., adjusting
the pH, taking into account the ionic nature of the medicament and/or the ionic nature of
the polymer or polymers included in the environment.
        As used herein, the term "backing layer" or "non-adhesive polymeric environment"
refers to an environment in the form of, e.g., a layer or coating or barrier layer, capable of
slowing, reducing or stopping flux of a medicament in its direction and does not adhere to

                                             - 11
surfaces in the oral cavity. In some embodiments, the pH of the backing layer is adjusted,
such as it stops flux of a medicament contained therein and in the mucoadhesive layer,
except in the direction of the mucosa. In some embodiments, the non-adhesive polymeric
environment significantly slows flux of a medicament, e.g., enough so that little or no
medicament is washed away by saliva. In some embodiments, the non-adhesive polymeric
environment slows or stops flux of a medicament, while allowing hydration of the
polymeric diffusion environment e.g., by saliva.
        As used herein, the term "unidirectional gradient" refers to a gradient which allows
for the flux of a medicament (e.g., buprenorphine) through the device, e.g., through a
polymeric diffusion environment, in substantially one direction, e.g., to the mucosa of a
subject. For example, the polymeric diffusion environment may be a mucoadhesive
polymeric diffusion environment in the form of a layer or film disposed adjacent to a
backing layer or film. Upon mucosal administration, a gradient is created between the
mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment and the mucosa, and the medicament
flows from the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment, substantially in one
direction towards the mucosa. In some embodiments, some flux of the medicament is not
entirely unidirectional across the gradient; however, there is typically not free flux of the
medicament in all directions.
        As used herein, "treating" or "treatment" of a subject includes the administration of
a drug to a subject with the purpose of preventing, curing, healing, alleviating, relieving,
altering, remedying, ameliorating, improving, stabilizing or affecting a disease or disorder,
or a symptom of a disease or disorder (e.g., to alleviate pain).
         The term "subject" refers to living organisms such as humans, dogs, cats, and other
mammals. Administration of the medicaments included in the devices of the present
invention can be carried out at dosages and for periods of time effective for treatment of a
subject. In some embodiments, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, the
pharmacokinetic profiles of the devices of the present invention are similar for male and
female subjects.

                                              - 12
        An "effective amount" of a drug necessary to achieve a therapeutic effect may vary
according to factors such as the age, sex, and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens can
be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided
doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by
the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.
         The term "transmucosal," as used herein, refers to any route of administration via a
mucosal membrane. Examples include, but are not limited to, buccal, sublingual, nasal,
vaginal, and rectal. In one embodiment, the administration is buccal. In one embodiment,
the administration is sublingual. As used herein, the term "direct transmucosal" refers to
mucosal administration via the oral mucosa, e.g., buccal and/or sublingual.
         As used herein, the term "water erodable" or "at least partially water erodable"
refers to a substance that exhibits a water erodability ranging from negligible to completely
water erodable. The substance may readily dissolve in water or may only partially dissolve
in water with difficulty over a long period of time. Furthermore, the substance may exhibit
a differing erodability in body fluids compared with water because of the more complex
nature of body fluids. For example, a substance that is negligibly erodable in water may
show an erodability in body fluids that is slight to moderate. However, in other instances,
the erodability in water and body fluid may be approximately the same.
         The term "impeded" when used to describe the absorption or the delivery of the
opioid antagonist from the abuse-resistant device refers to the absorption and/or delivery of
said opioid antagonist that is insufficient to inhibit the effects of the opioid agonist
comprised in the same device.
         As used herein, "addiction therapy" as related to a subject includes the
administration of a drug to a subject with the purpose of reducing the cravings for the
addictive substance.

                                              - 13
         As used herein, the term "abusive" or "abusive manner" refers to uses of the
devices beyond transmucosal administration such as by injecting or snorting.
         As used herein, the term "disposed" refers to the uniform or non-uniform
distribution of an element within another.
Maintenance Treatment of Opioid Dependence
         Certain aspects of the present invention include methods for providing maintenance
treatment for a subject addicted to opioids. Presently, buprenorphine maintenance is one
of the most promising courses of action for addicted subjects in terms of long-term
abstinence.
Pain Management
         Certain aspects of the present invention include methods for providing pain
management and/or relief to a subject in need thereof. The pain can be any pain known in
the art, caused by any disease, disorder, condition and/or circumstance and can be chronic
pain or acute pain.
Transmucosal Mucoadhesive Pharmaceutical Delivery Device
         In certain aspects of the present invention, abuse-resistant transmucosal delivery
devices are provided. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention is directed to
abuse-resistant mucoadhesive delivery devices suitable for administration of an effective
amount of an opioid drug to a subject, for the management of pain and/or opioid
dependence. The device is capable of delivering the opioid agonist by means of a
unidirectional gradient (i.e. flux that flows toward the mucosa) that is created upon

i. Mucoadhesive laver
         In some embodiments, the mucoadhesive layer is a bioerodable or water-erodable
mucoadhesive layer. In some embodiments, the devices of the present invention include a
bioerodable mucoadhesive layer which comprises a mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion
environment. The device adheres to a mucosal surface of the subject within about 5
seconds following application.
         In some embodiments, the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment
comprises an opioid agonist. In some embodiments, the opioid agonist is buprenorphine.
In some embodiments related to the treatment of opioid dependence, the dose of
buprenorphine that can be incorporated into the device of the present invention depends on
the desired treatment dosage to be administered and can range from about 10 pIg to about
20 mg of buprenorphine. In other embodiments related to the treatment of pain, the dose
of buprenorphine can range from about 60 pg to about 6 mg. In some embodiments, the
low dose of buprenorphine comprised in the mucoadhesive device of the invention is
between about 0.075 and 12 mg of buprenorphine, e.g., 0.075 mg, 0.080 mg, 0.085 mg,
0.090 mg, 0.095 mg, 0.10 mg, 0.15 mg, 0.20 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.30 mg, 0.35 mg, 0.40 mg,
0.45 mg, 0.50 mg, 0.44 mg, 0.60 mg, 0.65 mg, 0.70 mg, 0.75 mg, 0.80 mg, 0.85 mg, 0.90
mg, 0.95 mg, 1.00 mg, 1.5 mg, 1.75 mg, 2.0 mg, 2.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 3.5 mg, 4.0 mg, 4.5 mg,
5.0 mg, 5.25 mg, 5.5 mg, 6.0 mg, 6.5 mg, 7.0 mg, 7.5 mg, 8.0 mg, 8.5 mg, 9.0 mg, 9.5 mg,
10.0 mg, 10.5 mg, 11.0 mg, 11.5 mg or 12.0 mg or buprenorphine. In one embodiment,
the dose is 0.875 mg of buprenorphine. In another embodiment, the dose is 1.75 mg of
buprenorphine. In another embodiment, the dose is 3.5 mg of buprenorphine. In yet
another embodiment, the dose is 5.25 mg of buprenorphine.

                                            - 15
        In some embodiments, the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment can
include the drug, at least one pharmacologically acceptable polymer capable of
bioadhesion (the "bioadhesive polymer"), and can optionally include at least one film
forming bioerodable or water-erodable polymer (the "film-forming polymer").
Alternatively, the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment can be formed of a
single polymer that acts as both the bioadhesive polymer and the first film-forming
polymer. Additionally or alternatively, the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion
environment can include other film-forming water-erodable polymers and/or water
erodable plasticizers, such as glycerin and/or polyethylene glycol (PEG).
        In some embodiments, the bioadhesive polymer of the mucoadhesive polymeric
diffusion environment can include any water erodable substituted cellulosic polymer or
substituted olefinic polymer wherein the substituents may be ionic or hydrogen bonding,
such as carboxylic acid groups, hydroxyl alkyl groups, amine groups and amide groups.
For hydroxyl containing cellulosic polymers, a combination of alkyl and hydroxyalkyl
groups will be preferred for provision of the bioadhesive character and the ratio of these
two groups will have an effect upon water swellability and dispersability. Examples
include polyacrylic acid (PAA), which can optionally be partially cross-linked, sodium
carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC), moderately to highly substituted hydroxypropylmethyl
cellulose (HPMC), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP3 which can optionally be partially cross
linked), moderately to highly substituted hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose (HEMC) or
combinations thereof. In one embodiment, HEMC can be used as the bioadhesive polymer
and the first film forming polymer as described above for a mucoadhesive polymeric
diffusion environment formed of one polymer. These bioadhesive polymers are preferred
because they have good and instantaneous mucoadhesive properties in a dry, system state.
        In some embodiments, the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment, e.g., a
bioerodable mucoadhesive layer, is generally comprised of water-erodable polymers which
include, but are not limited to, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose
(HPC), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose (HEMC),
polyacrylic acid (PAA) which may or may not be partially cross-linked, sodium

                                            - 16
carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), or combinations
thereof. Other mucoadhesive water-erodable polymers may also be used in the present
invention. The term "polyacrylic acid" includes both uncross-linked and partially cross
linked forms, e.g., polycarbophil.
         Similar film-forming water-erodable polymers can also be used. The film-forming
water-erodable polymers can optionally be cross-linked and/or plasticized in order to alter
its dissolution kinetics.
         In some embodiments, the properties of the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion
environment are influenced by its pH. In some embodiments, e.g., when mucoadhesive
polymeric diffusion environment comprises buprenorphine, its pH is between about 4.0
and about 7.5. In one embodiment, the pH is between 4.0 and 6.0, more specifically,
between 4.5 and 5.5, and even more specifically, between 4.75 and 5.25. In a specific
embodiment, the pH is 4.75. It is to be understood that all values and ranges between these
values and ranges are meant to be encompassed by the present invention.
         The pH of the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment can be adjusted
and/or maintained by methods including, but not limited to, the use of buffering agents, or
by adjusting the composition of the device of the present invention.
Buffering agents suitable for use with the present invention include, for example,
phosphates, such as sodium phosphate; phosphates monobasic, such as sodium dihydrogen
phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate; phosphates dibasic, such as disodium
hydrogen phosphate and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate; phosphates tribasic, such as
trisodium phosphate; citrates, such as sodium citrate (anhydrous or dehydrate) and triethyl
citrate; bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate; acetates, such
as sodium acetate, may be used. In one embodiment, a single buffering agent, e.g., a
dibasic buffering agent is used. In another embodiment, a combination of buffering agents
is employed, e.g., a combination of a tri-basic buffering agent and a monobasic buffering
agent. In some embodiments, the amount of buffering agent is present in a composition

                                            - 17
used to make the mucoadhesive layer is about 1 to 20% of the amount of the agonist drug,
e.g., buprenorphine.
ii. Backing laver
         The device further comprises at least one additional non-adhesive polymeric
environment, e.g., a backing layer. This layer is disposed adjacent to the mucoadhesive
polymeric diffusion environment, e.g., a backing layer, functions to facilitate the delivery
of the opioid agonist, such as buprenorphine, to the mucosa. This additional layer may
comprise the same or a different combination of polymers as the mucoadhesive polymeric
diffusion environment or the non-adhesive polymeric diffusion environment.
                In some embodiments, the backing layer includes an additional
medicament, such as an opioid antagonist, to render the device of the invention abuse
resistant. In some embodiments, the opioid antagonist is naloxone. The dose of naloxone
that can be incorporated into the device of the present invention depends on the desired
treatment dosage to be administered and can range from about 100 pLg to 5 mg of naloxone
for the treatment of dependence, and from 60 ptg to 1.5 mg naloxone for the pain
indication. In some embodiments, the dose of naloxone is between about 0.0125 mg to
about 2.0 mg of naloxone, e.g., 0.0125 mg, 0.0130 mg, 0.0135 mg, 0.0140 mg, 0.0145 mg,
0.0150 mg, 0.0155 mg, 0.0160 mg, 0.0165 mg, 0.0170 mg, 0.0175 mg, 0.0180 mg, 0.0185
mg, 0.0190 mg, 0.0195 mg, 0.02 mg, 0.03 mg, 0.04 mg, 0.05 mg, 0.06 mg, 0.07 mg, 0.08
mg, 0.09 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.145 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.29 mg, 0.3 mg, 0.4 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.58 mg, 0.6
mg, 0.7 mg, 0.8 mg, 0.87 mg, 0.9 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.1 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.3 mg, 1.4 mg, 1.5 mg, 1.6
mg, 1.7 mg, 1.8 mg, 1.9 mg or 2.0 mg of naloxone. In one embodiment, the dose is 0.145
mg of naloxone. In another embodiment, the dose is 290 ptg of naloxone. In another
embodiment, the dose is 580 pg of naloxone. In yet another embodiment, the dose is 870
pig of naloxone. In some embodiments, the amount of buprenorphine and the amount of
naloxone disposed in the device are present in a ratio chosen such that the effect of
buprenorphine is negated by naloxone if the mixture is injected or snorted. In such
embodiment, buprenorphine and naloxone disposed in the device are present in a w/w ratio

                                             - 18
that ranges between 1:4 and 1:10. In a preferred embodiment, the w/w ratio of
buprenorphine to naloxone is 1:4 to 1:6, wherein 1:6 is the most preferred embodiment.
         In some embodiments, the backing layer (i.e., the non-adhesive polymeric
embodiment) functions as a barrier to facilitate a unidirectional flux of the medicament,
e.g., buprenorphine, disposed in the mucoadhesive layer. Upon application to a mucosal
surface, a diffusional gradient of a medicament is created towards the mucosa. In another
embodiment the backing layer, can serve an erodible polymer that facilitate absorption of
buprenorphine in the orophyrangeal tissue. In some embodiments, prevents diffusion away
from the mucosal surface. In such instances, a majority of the medicament, i.e., at least
50% flows towards the mucosa. In other embodiments, as depicted in Fig. 1, the non
adhesive polymeric environment may circumscribe the boundaries of the mucoadhesive
polymeric diffusion environment thereby ensuring that medicament flows toward the
mucosa.
         The backing layer (e.g., a water-erodable non-adhesive backing layer) can further
include at least one water erodable, film-forming polymer. This layer may optinally
include a drug. The polymer or polymers can include polyethers and polyalcohols as well
as hydrogen bonding cellulosic polymers having either hydroxyalkyl group substitution or
hydroxyalkyl group and alkyl group substitution preferably with a moderate to high ratio
of hydroxyalkyl to alkyl group. Examples include, but are not limited to, hydroxyethyl
cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose
(HPMC), hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose (HEMC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene
glycol (PEG), polyethylene oxide (PEO), ethylene oxide-propylene oxide co polymers,
ethylene oxide-propylene oxide co-polymers, and combinations thereof. The water
erodable non-adhesive backing layer component can optionally be cross-linked.
         In certain embodiments, the non-adhesive backing layer is free of cross-linked
polymers. In a preferred embodiment of the device, the non-adhesive backing layer is free
of polyacrylic acid. While not wishing to be bound by any specific theory, it is estimated
that the residence time is reduced by the absence of said polyacrylic acid. For example, in
certain embodiments, the residence time is between 15 and 30 minutes. In a preferred

                                              - 19
embodiment, the water erodable non-adhesive backing layer includes hydroxyethyl
cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose.
         The devices of the present invention can include ingredients that are employed to,
at least in part, provide a desired residence time. In some embodiments, this is a result of
the selection of the appropriate backing layer formulation, providing a slower rate of
erosion of the backing layer. Thus, the non-adhesive backing layer is further modified to
render controlled erodability which can be accomplished by coating the backing layer film
with a more hydrophobic polymer selected from a group of FDA approved EudragitTM
polymers, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, and hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose
phthalate, that are approved for use in other pharmaceutical dosage forms. Other
hydrophobic polymers may be used, alone or in combination with other hydrophobic or
hydrophilic polymers, provided that the layer derived from these polymers or combination
of polymers erodes in a moist environment. Dissolution characteristics may be adjusted to
modify the residence time and the release profile of a drug when included in the backing
layer.
         In some embodiments, any of the layers in the devices of the present invention may
also contain a plasticizing agent, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, or glycerin
in a small amount, 0 to 15% by weight, in order to improve the "flexibility" of this layer in
the mouth and to adjust the erosion rate of the device. In addition, humectants such as
hyaluronic acid, glycolic acid, and other alpha hydroxyl acids can also be added to
improve the "softness" and "feel" of the device. Finally, colors and opacifiers may be
added to help distinguish the resulting non-adhesive backing layer from the mucoadhesive
polymeric diffusion environment. Some opacifers include titanium dioxide, zinc oxide,
zirconium silicate, etc.
         The device can also optionally include a pharmaceutically acceptable dissolution
rate-modifying agent, a pharmaceutically acceptable disintegration aid (e.g., polyethylene
glycol, dextran, polycarbophil, carboxymethyl cellulose, or poloxamers), a
pharmaceutically acceptable plasticizer, a pharmaceutically acceptable coloring agent (e.g.,
FD&C Blue #1), a pharmaceutically acceptable opacifier (e.g., titanium dioxide),

                                              - 20
pharmaceutically acceptable anti-oxidant (e.g., tocopherol acetate), a pharmaceutically
acceptable system forming enhancer (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl pyrrolidone), a
pharmaceutically acceptable preservative, flavorants (e.g., saccharin and peppermint),
neutralizing agents (e.g., sodium hydroxide), buffering agents (e.g., monobasic, or tribasic
sodium phosphate), or combinations thereof. Preferably, these components are
individually present at no more than about 1% of the final weight of the device, but the
amount may vary depending on the other components of the device.
          In some embodiments, the non-adhesive polymeric diffusion environment, e.g., the
backing layer, is a buffered environment. In some embodiments the pH of the backing
layer is between 4.0 and 6.0, more specifically, between 4.2 and 4.7, and even more
specifically, between 4.2 and 4.4. In one embodiment, the pH of the backing layer is 4.25.
It is to be understood that all values and ranges between these values and ranges are meant
to be encompassed by the present invention.
          The pH of the backing layer can be adjusted and/or maintained by methods
including, but not limited to, the use of buffering agents, or by adjusting the composition
of the device of the present invention.          In some embodiments, the properties of the
polymeric diffusion environment are influenced by its buffering capacity. In some
embodiments, buffering agents are included in the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion
environment. Buffering agents suitable for use with the present invention include, for
example, phosphates, such as sodium phosphate; phosphates monobasic, such as sodium
dihydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate; phosphates dibasic, such as
disodium hydrogen phosphate and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate; phosphates tribasic,
such as trisodium phosphate; citrates, such as sodium citrate (anhydrous or dehydrate) and
triethyl citrate; bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate;
acetates, such as sodium acetate, may be used. In one embodiment, a single buffering
agent, e.g., a dibasic buffering agent is used. In another embodiment, a combination of
buffering agents is employed, e.g., a combination of a tri-basic buffering agent and a
monobasic buffering agent. In some embodiments, the backing layer comprises the opioid
antagonist. In another embodiment, the backing layer comprises an opioid antagonist that

                                              - 21
is present as a microencapsulated particle with polymers. These polymers include, but are
not limited to alginates, polyethylene oxide, poly ethylene glycols, polylactide,
polyglycolide, lactide-glycolide copolymers, poly-epsilon-caprolactone, polyorthoesters,
polyanhydrides and derivatives, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,
hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose,
polyacrylic acid, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, poly vinyl acetate, poly vinyl
alcohols, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, ethylene oxide-propylene oxide co
polymers, collagen and derivatives, gelatin, albumin, polyaminoacids and derivatives,

thereof.

         This study was designed to compare the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of
buprenorphine and naxolone from formulations 3 and 4 with Suboxone@ sublingual
 tablets. This was a single dose, 2-period, crossover design with 24 subjects randomized to
 one of two, 12-subject groups. Each group received the device of the invention and
 Suboxone@ tablets in random sequence, each separated by at least 5 days. Group 1
 subjects received a single low dose Suboxone@ tablet (containing 2.0 mg of buprenorphine
 and 0.5 mg of naloxone) and a single dose of formulation 3. Group 2 subjects received a
 single high dose Suboxone@ tablet (containing 8.0 mg of buprenorphine and 2.0 mg of
 naloxone) and a single dose of formulation 4. Naltrexone was co-administered
 approximately 12 hours and 30 minutes prior to and approximately 12 and 24 hours after
 the single study drug doses. Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic analyses were
 collected pre-dose and 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 210, 240, 270,

Bioavailability
         The results indicate that, unexpectedly, the absorption of buprenorphine from
Formulations 3 and 4 are increased, as compared to control. This increase in
buprenorphine absorption is particularly surprising in view of the results of Example 2 and
is caused by the change of pH of the backing layer from 2.8 in Formulations 1 and 2 to
4.25 in Formulations 3 and 4.
         The results also indicate that Cmax values for buprenorphine from Formulations 3
and 4 are comparable to values from the control Suboxone@ tablets and that the AUCiaf
values for buprenorphine from the devices of the invention are slightly less than the values
from the corresponding Suboxone@ tablets. Further, the Cmax and AUCinf values for free
(unconjugated) naloxone are greater than the values from the corresponding Suboxone@
tablets.
Example 4. Absorption profiles for Formulations 5, 6 and 7.
         This study was designed to assess the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for
buprenorphine and naloxone exposure following administration of Formulations 5, 6 and 7
comprising buprenorphine and naloxone present at the w/w ratio of 6:1 of buprenorphine
to naloxone and with the backing layer formulated at pH of 4.25. This study was also
designed to demonstrate the linearity of buprenorphine exposure across the range of doses.
In addition, pharmacokinetic profiles following administration of four devices prepared
according to formulation 5 (4 x 0.875/0.15 mg buprenorphine/naloxone) was compared
with those from a single device prepared according to formulation 6 that contained an
equivalent dose of actives (3.5/0.6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone).
         This was an open label, single dose, 4-period crossover study in 20 healthy
subjects. Each subject received 4 doses of buprenorphine in the devices of the invention in
a random sequence, each dose separated by at least 7 days. The doses administered were

 0.875/0.15 mg, 3.5/0.6 mg, 5.25/0.9 mg and 4 x 0.875/0.15 mg buprenorphine/naloxone in
 the devices prepared according to Formulations 5, 6, 7 and 5, respectively. Naltrexone was
 co-administered approximately 12 hours and 30 minutes prior to and approximately 12 and
 24 hours after the single study drug doses. Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic
 analyses were collected pre-dose and 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180,
 210, 240, 270, 300, 330 and 360 minutes post-dose and at 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours post

Bioavailability
        The results of the study indicate that changing the w/w ratio of buprenorphine to
naloxone from 4:1 to 6:1 results in decreased naloxone exposure that I s more in line with
the exposure needed to precipitate withdrawal if abused but not so much as to precipitate
the withdrawal if used as indicated. The results also indicate that Cmax and AUCinf of
buprenorphine from formulations 5, 6 and 7 is dose proportional. Dose proportionality of
buprenorphine Cmax and AUCif are also illustrated by the graphs shown in Figures 2 and 3,
respectively.
Example 5. Naloxone Withdrawal Study
        The transmucosal devices of the invention that are prepared according to
Formulations 1, 3 and 5 comprise relatively small doses of buprenorphine and naloxone
(0.75 mg/0.19 mg and 0.875/0.15 mg buprenorphine/naloxone, as compared to 2 mg/0.5
mg buprenorphine/naloxone contained in the equivalent Suboxone@ tablet). While the
lower dose of the naloxone may be beneficial for the patient using the product correctly, it
may not produce the expected aversive reaction experienced by those who are dependent
on full-agonist opioids. Accordingly, the objective of the study was to determine the

                                            -31
minimum effective dose of naloxone that will produce a withdrawal response when
administered with a 0.75 mg dose of buprenorphine in opioid dependent subjects. The
secondary objective of the study was to determine whether administration of a 0.75 mg
dose of buprenorphine without naloxone will produce a withdrawal response in opioid
dependent subjects.
Study Population
     The study was designed to include a total of 12 adult subjects that completed the 4
period crossover. Subjects were eligible for inclusion in the study if all the following
criteria applied:
     subjects experienced chronic moderate to severe non-cancer pain that has been
treated > 100 mg morphine equivalents per day for at least 3 months prior to the study;
     subjects displayed signs and symptoms of withdrawal (i.e., COWS score >5) following
naloxone administration during the Naloxone Challenge.
Description of Study Medication
         During the inpatient Treatment Visit subjects received a single, 3 mL IV bolus dose
of each of the following treatments separated by at least 72 hours:
         a)      Buprenorphine 0.75 mg (B)
         b)      Buprenorphine 0.75 mg + naloxone 0.1 mg (BN1)
         c)      Buprenorphine 0.75 mg + naloxone 0.2 mg (BN2)
         d)      Placebo (5% dextrose) (P)

                                              - 32
Study procedures
         Eligible subject exhibited signs of withdrawal, e.g., had a positive response (COWS
> 5) to the Naloxone Withdrawal Test, following administration of up to eight 0.05 mg IV
doses of naloxone.
Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale
         The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) was used to evaluate symptoms of
opioid withdrawal. The scale contains 11 items to rate signs and symptoms of opioid
withdrawal including pulse rate, gastrointestinal upset, sweating, tremor, restlessness,
yawning, pupil size, anxiety or irritability, bone or joint aches, gooseflesh skin, runny nose,
tearing. Each symptom is rated on a unique scale. Total scores for the scale range from 0
to 48 with scores of 5-12 indicating mild withdrawal; scores of 13-24 indicating moderate
withdrawal; scores of 25-36 indicating moderately severe withdrawal; and scores >36
indicating severe withdrawal.
OpioidAgonist Scale
         Subjects were asked to evaluate the following items: nodding, heavy or sluggish
feeling, dry mouth, carefree, good mood, energetic, turning of stomach, skin itchy, relaxed,
coasting, soapbox, pleasant sick, drive, drunken, friendly, and nervous using a 5-point
Likert scale (0=not at all, 1=a little, 2=moderately, 3=quite a bit, and 4=extremely).
Statistical Analysis
         Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results from the PD analyses at
each timepoint for each treatment group, without formal statistical testing. A mixed effect
model was fitted to the data for the change from baseline in total score where the model
included factors for: the overall mean change; fixed effects due to sequence; treatment,
time and period; and a random effect for subject nested within sequence.       The least
squares mean changes and standard errors were obtained and used to construct 95% CI for

                                             - 33
differences between treatments in a pair-wise fashion. Subject data collected after rescue
time (i.e., time at which the subjects reaches COWS total score of 13 or more) were
excluded to minimize the confounding effect of rescue on the PD analyses.
         For COWS total score only, Time-to-Total score of>13 was calculated as time
(hours) from first dose until the subject reports a total score of >13. Subjects who did not
reach a total score of 13 or more were censored at 24 hours. This endpoint was
summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method and 95% CI presented for median for each
treatment arm.
Results
COWS Total-Score, and Rescue Results
         The number of subjects with COWS total score of at least 7 in the first hour post
dose is shown on the left side of FIGURE 4. Eight subjects on buprenorphine alone had a
COWS value of at least 7 compared with 9 in the buprenorphine plus naloxone 0.1 mg
group, 12 subjects in the buprenorphine plus naloxone 0.2 mg group, and two on placebo.
Similarly, COWS > 13 were recorded for 6 buprenorphine subjects, 9 buprenorphine and
naloxone 0.1 mg subjects, 10 buprenorphine and naloxone 0.2 mg, and 2 placebo patients.
Two of the 15 subjects experienced withdrawal on each of the study treatments, including
placebo.
         In the buprenorphine alone group, 7(47%) of the 15 subjects experienced moderate
withdrawal with COWS score of at least 13, and all 7 were rescued. In the 8 subjects that
did not receive rescue, the median COWS at 1 hour post dose was 1.
         In the buprenorphine plus 0.1 mg of naloxone group, 9 subjects (60%) had COWS
>13 and all 9, plus an additional subject that was rescued. In the 5 subjects that did not
receive rescue, the median COWS at one hour post dose was 0.

         In the buprenorphine plus 0.2 mg of naloxone group, 11 subjects (73%) had COWS
 scores of at least 13 and each of these received rescue. In the 4 subjects that were not
 rescued, the median COWS at one hour post dose was 3.

         The results of this double-blind, placebo controlled study in opioid dependent
 subjects indicate that intravenous buprenorphine doses of 0.75 mg have little abuse
 potential, and that the addition of naloxone increases both the incidence of withdrawal as
 well as negative drug evaluations. Thus, naloxone at doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mg, provide an
 abuse deterrent effect to a 0.75 mg dose of buprenorphine when administered
 intravenously to opioid dependent subjects.
