                  FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH
            LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF
                                           TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      Aspects described herein relate to food and beverage compositions infused with
lipophilic active agents and methods of use for the treatment of a variety of disorders. More
particularly, aspects described herein relate to food and beverage compositions infused with
lipophilic active agents such as cannabinoids, nicotine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs),
and vitamins, that provide enhanced bioavailability of the lipophilic active agents in a subject, and
that mask unpleasant tastes of lipophilic active agents.
                                             BACKGROUND
[0002]      Many therapeutic agents are highly lipophilic, meaning that they are soluble in lipids and
some organic solvents while being substantially insoluble or only sparsely soluble in water. The poor
water-solubility of these lipophilic agents often results in major difficulties in formulation. When
administered in the form of an oil solution or some kind of water and/or oil suspension or emulsion,
lipophilic compounds usually show poor bioavailability.
[0003]      Various approaches to overcoming this limitation are known in the prior art. One such
approach consists of dissolving a lipophilic compound in a water-miscible organic solvent such as
ethanol or propylene glycol.      However, when the resulting solution is admixed with blood or
gastrointestinal fluids, the lipophilic compound usually precipitates as a solid or liquid emulsion,
which results in a low bioavailability.     Furthermore, for many lipophilic compounds no water
miscible organic solvents exist.
[0004]      Another approach involves physico-chemical solubilization techniques such as micellar
solubilization by means of surface-active agents (i.e., the use of surfactant micelles to solubilize and
transport the therapeutic agent). In aqueous solution, micelles can incorporate lipophilic therapeutic
agents in the hydrocarbon core of the micelle, or can entangle the agents at various positions within
the micelle walls. Although micellar formulations can solubilize a variety of lipophilic therapeutic
agents, the loading capacity of conventional micelle formulations is limited by the solubility of the
                                                   -1-

      WO 2015/191728                                                           PCT/US2015/035128
therapeutic agent in the micelle surfactant. For many lipophilic therapeutic agents, such solubility is
too low to offer formulations that can deliver therapeutically effective doses.
[0005]      Another method consists of preparing a derivative or an analog of the lipophilic compound
having a better solubility in water than the original compound. For example, this derivative may be a
water-soluble salt of the compound that usually retains the original biological activity. However, this
approach is applicable only to compounds having acidic or basic properties. If more substantial
modifications are introduced into the original compound to improve its solubility, a decrease or even
a complete loss of the original bioactivity of the compound is frequently observed.
[0006]      Another approach consists of preparing a water-soluble pro-drug capable of liberating the
original bioactive compound under physiological conditions.            Such pro-drugs usually improve
bioavailability of the compound and can ensure a targeted delivery of the compound or its sustained
release over a period of time. However, the use of pro-drugs is not universally applicable since they
usually require the presence of certain functional groups in the original compound. In addition,
synthetic methods of improving solubility of a compound by chemical modifications are relatively
complicated and expensive.
[0007]      Other methods involve the formation of complexes by the addition of chelating agents
such as citric acid, tartaric acid, amino acids, thioglycolic acid, and edetate disodium. Still other
methods use buffering agents such as acetate, citrate, glutamate, and phosphate salts. However,
buffers and chelating agents have been implicated in imparting high levels of aluminum in products,
leading to adverse side effects. Furthermore, certain chelating agents such as EDTA have been
implicated in adverse events such nephrotoxicity and renal tubular necrosis.
[0008]      Therefore, there is a need for improved compositions and methods for the administration
of lipophilic active agents to treat a variety of disorders in subjects in need thereof.

                                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0028]       The present invention is directed to lipophilic active agent infused food and beverage
compositions that provide enhanced bioavailability in a subject, particularly wherein the unpleasant
taste of the lipophilic active agent is masked. Processes for making the food and beverage
compositions are also provided, as well as methods for treating conditions comprising administering
any of the compositions disclosed herein to a subject in need thereof.
[0029]       Bioavailability refers to the extent and rate at which the active moiety (drug or
metabolite) enters systemic circulation, thereby accessing the site of action. Bioavailability for a
given formulation provides an estimate of the relative fraction of the orally administered dose that is
absorbed into the systemic circulation. Low bioavailability is most common with oral dosage forms
of poorly water-soluble, slowly absorbed drugs. Insufficient time for absorption in the
gastrointestinal tract is a common cause of low bioavailability. If the drug does not dissolve readily
                                                    -6-

      WO 2015/191728                                                          PCT/US2015/035128
or cannot penetrate the epithelial membrane (e.g., if it is highly ionized and polar), time at the
absorption site may be insufficient. Orally administered drugs must pass through the intestinal wall
and then the portal circulation to the liver, both of which are common sites of first-pass metabolism
(metabolism that occurs before a drug reaches systemic circulation). Thus, many drugs may be
metabolized before adequate plasma concentrations are reached.
[0030]       Bioavailability is usually assessed by determining the area under the plasma
concentration-time curve (AUC). AUC is directly proportional to the total amount of unchanged
drug that reaches systemic circulation. Plasma drug concentration increases with extent of
absorption; the maximum (peak) plasma concentration is reached when drug elimination rate equals
absorption rate. Peak time is the most widely used general index of absorption rate; the slower the
absorption, the later the peak time.
[0031]       The bioavailability of some drugs is increased when co-administered with food,
particularly agents such as cannabinoids that are Class II drugs under the Biopharmaceutical Drug
Classification System (Kelepu et al. (2013) Acta PharmaceuticaSinica B 3:361-372; Amidon et al.
(1995) Pharm. Res. 12:413-420; Charman et al. (1997) J. Pharm. Sci. 86:269-282; Winstanley et al.
(1989) Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 28:621-628). It is the lipid component of the food that plays a key
role in the absorption of lipophilic drugs and that leads to enhanced oral bioavailability (Hunt & Knox
(1968) J. Physiol. 194:327-336; Kelepu et al. (2013) Acta PharmaceuticaSinica B 3:361-372). This
has been attributed to the ability of a high fat meal to stimulate biliary and pancreatic secretions, to
decrease metabolism and efflux activity, to increase intestinal wall permeability, and to a prolongation
of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) residence time and transport via the lymphatic system (Wagnera et al.
(2001) Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 50:S13-31; Kelepu et al. (2013) Acta PharmaceuticaSinica B 3:361
372). High fat meals also elevate triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that associate with drug molecules
and enhance intestinal lymphatic transport, which leads to changes in drug disposition and changes
the kinetics of the pharmacological actions of poorly soluble drugs (Gershkovich et al. (2007) Eur. J.
Pharm.Sci. 32:24-32; Kelepu et al. (2013) Acta PharmaceuticaSinica B 3:361-372). However, co
administration of food with lipophilic drugs requires close control and/or monitoring of food intake
when dosing such drugs, and can also be subject to problems with patient compliance (Kelepu et al.
(2013) Acta PharmaceuticaSinica B 3:361-372).
                                                   -7-

     WO 2015/191728                                                            PCT/US2015/035128
[0032]      The present invention relates, in part, to lipophilic active agent infused food and
beverage compositions that provide enhanced lipophilic active agent bioavailability in a subject. It
was surprisingly found that the lipid content and colloidal properties of the lipophilic active agent
infused food and beverage compositions increased the bioavailability of the lipophilic active agents
in subjects as compared to typical oral ingestion of the lipophilic active agents. The lipophilic
active agent infused food and beverage compositions also allow for enhanced oral bioavailability
associated with the co-administration of lipophilic drugs and lipid containing foods without the
dosing and compliance problems associated with administration of the lipophilic active agent in a
separate formulation from the foods and beverages. In addition, lipophilic active agents are
surprisingly more effectively transported through the intestinal mucosa when combined with foods
and beverages that also contain antioxidants such as black tea, thereby producing a synergistic
effect on lipophilic active agent absorption and bioavailability.
[0033]      The present invention also relates, in part, to lipophilic active agent infused food and
beverage compositions comprising one or more lipophilic active agent taste masking agents. Many
lipophilic active agents have unpalatable taste profiles, which could hinder the use of orally ingested
lipophilic active agents as therapeutic treatments. In particular, it was surprisingly found that dry
milk used within the processes for making the lipophilic active agent infused food and beverage
compositions of the invention acted as both a bioavailability enhancing agent as well as a lipophilic
active agent taste masking agent.

[0035]       In another aspect, a lipophilic active agent infused beverage product is provided that is
obtainable by the steps of: (i) providing lipophilic active agent infused tea leaves, coffee beans, or
cocoa powder as described herein; and (ii) steeping the lipophilic active agent infused tea leaves,
coffee beans, or cocoa powder in a liquid; thereby producing the lipophilic active agent infused
beverage product.
[0036]       In other aspects, the bioavailability enhancing agent within the compositions and
methods of the present invention, the lipophilic active agent is an edible oil or fat, a protective
colloid, or both a protective colloid and an edible oil or fat. In another aspect, the bioavailability
enhancing agent is also a lipophilic active agent taste masking agent. In another particular aspect,
where the bioavailability enhancing agent is both a protective colloid, an edible oil or fat, and a
lipophilic active agent taste masking agent, the bioavailability enhancing agent is nonfat dry milk.
In a further aspect, the bioavailability enhancing agent is substantially free of omega-6 fatty acids.
In other aspects, the bioavailability of the lipophilic active agent in a subject is at least about 1.5
times, 2 times, 5 times, or 10 times greater than the bioavailability of the lipophilic active agent in
the subject in the absence of the bioavailability enhancing agent. In a further aspect, the
bioavailability of the lipophilic active agent in a subject is greater than 20%.
[0037]       An edible oil is defined herein as an oil that is capable of undergoing de-esterification or
hydrolysis in the presence of pancreatic lipase in vivo under normal physiological conditions.
Specifically, digestible oils may be complete glycerol triesters of medium chain (C 7-C 3 ) or long
chain (C 14 -C 22) fatty acids with low molecular weight (up to C6 ) mono-, di- or polyhydric alcohols.
Some examples of digestible oils for use in this invention thus include: vegetable, nut, or seed oils
(such as coconut oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, safflower seed oil, corn oil, olive oil, castor oil,
cottonseed oil, arachis oil, sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil, evening primrose
                                                    -9-

      WO 2015/191728                                                             PCT/US2015/035128
oil, grape seed oil, wheat germ oil, sesame oil, avocado oil, almond, borage, peppermint and apricot
kernel oils) and animal oils (such as fish liver oil, shark oil and mink oil).
[0038]       Examples of protective colloids include polypeptides (such as gelatin, casein, and
caseinate), polysaccharides (such as starch, dextrin, dextran, pectin, and gum arabic), as well as
whole milk, skimmed milk, milk powder or mixtures of these. However, it is also possible to use
polyvinyl alcohol, vinyl polymers, for example polyvinylpyrrolidone, (meth)acrylic acid polymers
and copolymers, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and alginates.

Encyclopedia of Food and Nutrition, Vol. 9, Pergamon Press 1970, pages 128-13 1.
[0039]       Oral administration constitutes the preferred route of administration for a majority of
drugs, howeverr, drugs that have an undesirable or bitter taste leads to lack of patient compliance in
the case of orally administered dosage forms. In such cases, taste masking is an essential tool to
improve patient compliance. Because lipophilic active agents (e.g., cannabinoids such as
cannabidiol) have an undesirable taste profile, in order to improve compliance, the presently
disclosed compositions also comprise one or more lipophilic active agent taste masking agents.
Examples of lipophilic active agent taste-masking agents include dry milk as described above, as
well as menthol, sweeteners, sodium bicarbonate, ion-exchange resins, cyclodextrin inclusion
compounds, adsorbates, and the like.
[0040]       In a further aspect, the bioavailability enhancing agent is substantially free of omega-6
fatty acids.
[0041]       In other aspects, the bioavailability of the lipophilic active agent in a subject is at least
about 1.5 times, 2 times, 2.5 times, 3 times, 3.5 times, 4 times, 4.5 times, 5 times, 5.5 times, 6 times,
6.5 times, 7 times, 7.5 times, 8 times, 8.5 times, 9 times, 9.5 times, or 10 times greater than the

[0043]       Assays and methods for measuring lipophilic active agent bioavailability are well known

[0044]       In a further aspect, the lipophilic active agent infused food product of the present
invention is lyophilized. Lyophilization, also known as freeze-drying, is a process whereby water is
sublimed from a composition after it is frozen. The frozen solution is then typically subjected to a
primary drying step in which the temperature is gradually raised under vacuum in a drying chamber
to remove most of the water, and then to a secondary drying step typically at a higher temperature
than employed in the primary drying step to remove the residual moisture in the lyophilized
composition. The lyophilized composition is then appropriately sealed and stored for later use.
Tang et al. (2004) PharmaceuticalResearch 21:191-200 describes the scientific principles
pertaining to freeze drying and guidelines for designing suitable freeze drying processes. Further
description of freeze drying is found in Remington (2006) The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,
21" edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, pp. 828-831.

agent. Suitable flavoring agents include, but are not limited to, vanilla, vanillin, ethyl vanillin,
orange oil, peppermint oil, strawberry, raspberry, and mixtures thereof.
[0046]       The active agents of the present invention are effective over a wide dosage range. For
example, in treating adult humans, compositions and methods of the present invention comprise
dosages of lipophilic active agents from 0.01 mg to 1,000 mg, from 0.5 mg to 500 mg, from 1 mg to

Cannabinoids
[0047]       Cannabis sativa L. is one of the most widely used plants for both recreational and
medicinal purposes. Over 500 natural constituents have been isolated and identified from C. sativa
covering several chemical classes (Ahmed et al. (2008) J. Nat. Prod.71:536-542; Ahmed et al.
(2008) Tetrahedron Lett. 49:6050-6053; ElSohly & Slade (2005) Life Sci. 78:539-548; Radwan et
al. (2009) J. Nat. Prod.72:906-911; Radwan et al. (2008) PlantaMedica. 74:267-272; Radwan et
al. (2008) J. Nat. Prod.69:2627-2633; Ross et al. (1995) Zagazig J. Pharm.Sci. 4:1-10; Turner et
al. (1980) J. Nat. Prod.43:169-170). Cannabinoids belong to the chemical class of
terpenophenolics, of which at least 85 have been uniquely identified in cannabis (Borgelt et al.
(2013) Pharmacotherapy33:195-209).
[0048]       Cannabinoids are ligands to cannabinoid receptors (CBI, CB 2 ) found in the human body
(Pertwee (1997) Pharmacol.Ther. 74:129-180). The cannabinoids are usually divided into the
following groups: classical cannabinoids; non-classical cannabinoids; aminoalkylindole-derivatives;
and eicosanoids (Pertwee (1997) Pharmacol.Ther. 74:129-180). Classical cannabinoids are those
that have been isolated from C. sativa L. or their synthetic analogs. Non-classical cannabinoids are
bi- or tri-cyclic analogs of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (without the pyran ring). Aminoalkylindoles
and eicosanoids are substantially different in structure compared to classical and non-classical
cannabinoids. The most common natural plant cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids) are cannabidiol
(CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), and cannabinol (CBN). The most
psychoactive cannabinoid is A9-THC.
[0049]       In recent years, marijuana and its components have been reported in scientific literature
to counter the symptoms of a broad range of conditions including but not limited to multiple
sclerosis and other forms of muscular spasm; movement disorders; pain, including migraine
headache; glaucoma; asthma; inflammation; insomnia; and high blood pressure. There may also be
utility for cannabinoids as anxiolytics, anti-convulsives, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti
cancer agents, as well as appetite stimulants. Pharmacological and toxicological studies of
cannabinoids have largely been focused on a synthetic analog of A9-THC (commercially available
                                                  - 12 -

under the generic name Dronabinol). In 1985, Dronabinol was approved by the FDA for the
treatment of chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting, and later for AIDS-associated wasting
and anorexia.
[0050]      Therapeutic use of cannabinoids has been hampered by the psychoactive properties of
some compounds (e.g., Dronabinol) as well as their low bioavailability when administered orally.
Bioavailability refers to the extent and rate at which the active moiety (drug or metabolite) enters
systemic circulation, thereby accessing the site of action. The low bioavailability of orally ingested
cannabinoids (from about 6% to 20%; Adams & Martin (1996) Addiction 91: 1585-614; Agurell et
al. (1986) Pharmacol.Rev. 38: 21-43; Grotenhermen (2003) Clin. Pharmacokinet.42: 327-60) has
been attributed to their poor dissolution properties and extensive first pass metabolism.
[0051]      Cannabinoids are a heteromorphic group of chemicals which directly or indirectly
activate the body's cannabinoid receptors. There are three main types of cannabinoids: herbal
cannabinoids that occur uniquely in the cannabis plant, synthetic cannabinoids that are
manufactured, and endogenous cannabinoids that are produced in vivo. Herbal cannabinoids are
nearly insoluble in water but soluble in lipids, alcohol, and non-polar organic solvents. These
natural cannabinoids are concentrated in a viscous resin that is produced in glandular structures
known as trichomes. In addition to cannabinoids, the resin is rich in terpenes, which are largely
responsible for the odor of the cannabis plant.
[0052]      The identification of A9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as a major psychoactive drug and
its chemical synthesis in 1964 opened a new era of synthetic cannabinoids as pharmacological
agents. Cannabinoid research has increased tremendously in recent years since the discovery of
cannabinoid receptors and the endogenous ligands for these receptors. The receptors include CB1,
predominantly expressed in the brain, and CB2, primarily found on the cells of the immune system.
Cannabinoid receptors belong to a superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. They are single
polypeptides with seven transmembrane a-helices, and have an extracellular, glycosylated N
terminus and intracellular C-terminus. Both CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors are linked to
G1/0-proteins. In addition to these receptors, endogenous ligands for these receptors capable of
mimicking the pharmacological actions of THC have also been discovered. Such ligands were
designated endocannabinoids and included anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG).
Anandamide is produced in the brain and peripheral immune tissues such as the spleen.

[0053]      Unlike THC, which exerts its action by binding to CB 1 and CB2, cannabidiol does not
bind to these receptors and hence has no psychotropic activity. Instead, cannabidiol indirectly
stimulates endogenous cannabinoid signaling by suppressing the enzyme that breaks down
anandamide (fatty acid amide hydroxylase, "FAAH"). Cannabidiol also stimulates the release of 2
AG. Cannabidiol has been reported to have immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties,
to exhibit anticonvulsive, anti-anxiety, and antipsychotic activity, and to function as an efficient
neuroprotective antioxidant.
[0054]      Cannabinoids in cannabis are often inhaled via smoking, but may also be ingested.
Smoked or inhaled cannabinoids have reported bioavailabilities ranging from 2-56%, with an
average of about 30% (Huestis (2007) Chem. Biodivers. 4:1770-1804; McGilveray (2005) Pain
Res. Manag. 10 Suppl. A: 15A - 22A). This variability is mainly due to differences in smoking
dynamics. Cannabinoids that are absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth
(buccomucosal application) have bioavailabilities of around 13% (Karschner et al. (2011) Clin.
Chem. 57:66-75). By contrast, when cannabinoids are ingested, bioavailability is typically reduced
to about 6% (Karschner et al. (2011) Clin. Chem. 57:66-75).
[0055]      Accordingly, in other aspects, within the compositions and methods of the present
invention, the lipophilic active agent is a cannabinoid.

Nicotine
[0064]      More than 99% of all nicotine that is consumed worldwide is delivered through smoking
cigarettes. Approximately 6,000,000 deaths per year, worldwide, are attributed primarily to the
delivery of nicotine through the act of smoking according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, which also estimates that over $170 billion per year is spent just in the U.S. on direct

medical care costs for adult smokers. In any twelve month period, 69% of U.S. adult smokers want
to quit smoking and 43% of U.S. adult smokers have attempted to quit.
[0065]      Worldwide, retail cigarette sales were worth $722 billion in 2013, with over 5.7 trillion
cigarettes sold to more than 1 billion smokers.
[0066]      The delivery of nicotine to satisfy current demand via the compositions and methods of
the present invention (i.e., in common food groups), will alleviate the consumer demand for
cigarettes. Since most of the adverse health outcomes of nicotine consumption are associated with
the delivery method and only to a lesser degree to the actual ingestion of nicotine, a vast positive
community health outcome can be achieved through the reduction in smoking cigarettes.
[0067]      Accordingly, in other aspects, within the compositions and methods of the present
invention, the lipophilic active agent is nicotine.
Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
[0068]      NSAIDs are the second-largest category of pain management treatment options in the
world. The global pain management market was estimated at $22 billion in 2011, with $5.4 billion
of this market being served by NSAID's. The U.S. makes up over one-half of the global market.
The opioids market (such as morphine) form the largest single pain management sector but are
known to be associated with serious dependence and tolerance issues.
[0069]      Although NSAIDs are generally a safe and effective treatment method for pain, they
have been associated with a number of gastrointestinal problems including dyspepsia and gastric
bleeding.
[0070]      Delivery of NSAIDs through the compositions and methods of the present invention will
provide the beneficial properties of pain relief with lessened negative gastrointestinal effects, and
also deliver lower dosages of active ingredients with similar pain management outcomes as current
pill forms at higher dosages.
[0071]      Accordingly, in other aspects, within the compositions and methods of the present
invention, the lipophilic active agent is an NSAID, particularly wherein the NSAID is selected from
the group consisting of acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprophen, acetaminophen, diclofenac, indomethacin,
and piroxicam.

Vitamins
[0072]      The global vitamin and supplement market is worth $68 billion according to
Euromonitor. The category is both broad and deep, comprised of many popular and some lesser
known substances. Vitamins in general are thought to be an $8.5 billion annual market in the U.S.
The U.S. is the largest single national market in the world, and China and Japan are the    2 nd and  rd
largest vitamin markets.
[0073]      Vitamin E is fat soluble and can be incorporated into cell membranes which can protect
them from oxidative damage. Global consumption of natural source vitamin E was 10,900 metric
tons in 2013 worth $611.9 million.
[0074]      Delivery of fat soluble vitamins through the compositions and methods of the present
invention will result in less waste and lower dosages required than current pill forms. In addition,
ingestion of pills is an unpleasant experience for many people so vitamin delivery through common
food groups will vastly expand demand and use.
[0075]      Accordingly, in other aspects, within the compositions and methods of the present
invention, the lipophilic active agent is a vitamin, particularly wherein the vitamin is vitamin E.

[0086]        As used herein, the term "subject" treated by the presently disclosed methods in their
many aspects is desirably a human subject, although it is to be understood that the methods
described herein are effective with respect to all vertebrate species, which are intended to be
included in the term "subject." Accordingly, a "subject" can include a human subject for medical
purposes, such as for the diagnosis or treatment of an existing disease, disorder, condition or the
prophylactic diagnosis or treatment for preventing the onset of a disease, disorder, or condition or
an animal subject for medical, veterinary purposes, or developmental purposes. Suitable animal
subjects include mammals including, but not limited to, primates, e.g., humans, monkeys, apes,
gibbons, chimpanzees, orangutans, macaques and the like; bovines, e.g., cattle, oxen, and the like;
ovines, e.g., sheep and the like; caprines, e.g., goats and the like; porcines, e.g., pigs, hogs, and the
like; equines, e.g., horses, donkeys, zebras, and the like; felines, including wild and domestic cats;
canines, including dogs; lagomorphs, including rabbits, hares, and the like; and rodents, including
mice, rats, guinea pigs, and the like. An animal may be a transgenic animal. In some aspects, the
subject is a human including, but not limited to, fetal, neonatal, infant, juvenile, and adult subjects.
Further, a "subject" can include a patient afflicted with or suspected of being afflicted with a
disease, disorder, or condition. Thus, the terms "subject" and "patient" are used interchangeably
herein. Subjects also include animal disease models (e.g., rats or mice used in experiments,
and the like).
[0087]        The term "effective amount," as in "a therapeutically effective amount," of a therapeutic
agent refers to the amount of the agent necessary to elicit the desired biological response. As will be
appreciated by those of ordinary skill in this art, the effective amount of an agent may vary
depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the agent to be delivered, the
composition of the pharmaceutical composition, the target tissue or cell, and the like. More
particularly, the term "effective amount" refers to an amount sufficient to produce the desired
effect, e.g., to reduce or ameliorate the severity, duration, progression, or onset of a disease,
disorder, or condition, or one or more symptoms thereof; prevent the advancement of a disease,
disorder, or condition, cause the regression of a disease, disorder, or condition; prevent the
recurrence, development, onset or progression of a symptom associated with a disease, disorder, or
condition, or enhance or improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect(s) of another therapy.

[0088]      Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the presently disclosed compositions
can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient that is effective to achieve the
desired therapeutic response for a particular subject, composition, route of administration, and
disease, disorder, or condition without being toxic to the subject. The selected dosage level will
depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the particular composition employed, the
route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular
composition being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, and/or materials used in
combination with the particular composition employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general
health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the
medical arts.
[0089]      A physician having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the
effective amount of the presently disclosed composition required. Accordingly, the dosage range
for administration may be adjusted by the physician as necessary, as described more fully elsewhere
herein.
