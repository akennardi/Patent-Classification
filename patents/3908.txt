                                                           FIELD OF THE INVENTION
                   This application relates generally to compounds and pharmaceutical compositions
   which selectively modulate toll-like receptors (such as TLR7) and methods of using such
   compounds in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections.

                                                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
                  The innate immune system provides the body with a first line defense against invading
   pathogens.                  In an innate immune response, an invading pathogen is recognized by a
   germline-encoded receptor, the activation of which initiates a signaling cascade that leads to
15 the induction of cytokine expression. Innate immune system receptors have broad specificity,
   recognizing molecular structures that are highly conserved among different pathogens. One
   family of these receptors is known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), due to their homology with
   receptors that were first identified and named in Drosophila, and are present in cells such as
   macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells.
20                There are at least ten different TLRs in mammals.                     Ligands and corresponding
   signaling cascades have been identified for some of these receptors. For example, TLR2 is
   activated by the lipoprotein of bacteria (e.g., E. coli.), TLR3 is activated by double-stranded
   RNA, TLR4 is activated by lipopolysaccharide (i.e., LPS or endotoxin) of Gram-negative
   bacteria (e.g., Salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7), TLR5 is activated by flagellin of motile
25 bacteria (e.g., Listeria), TLR7 recognizes and responds to imiquimod and TLR9 is activated
   by unmethylated CpG sequences of pathogen DNA. The stimulation of each of these
   receptors leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-KB, and other signaling molecules
   that are involved in regulating the expression of cytokine genes, including those encoding
   tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-4 interleukin-1                       (IL-1), and certain chemokines. Agonists
30 of TLR7 are immunostimulants and induce the production of endogenous interferon-a in vivo.
                  There are a number of diseases, disorders, and conditions linked to TLRs such that
   therapies using a TLR agonist are believed promising, including but not limited to melanoma,
   non-small cell lung carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, renal cell
                                                                      1

             U.S. Pat. No. 8,507,507 discloses TLR7 agonist compounds, including 4-amino-6

    imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-2(3H)-one. U.S. Pat. No. 7,968,544 teaches TLR7 agonist
10  compounds, including 6-amino-2-butoxy-9-(3-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)benzyl)-9H-purin-8-ol.
             Around the world more than thirty million people are infected by the HIV virus.
    Numerous drugs and combination therapies have been developed for the treatment of
    HIV infections in humans. While combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) and highly
    active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) have been able to reduce HIV viral activation,
15  often below 50 copies of HIV RNAlml of plasma, no therapy has provided elimination of
    HIV infected cells which are not actively replicating HIV, commonly referred to as a
    patient's latent reservoir of HIV. Strategies have been sought for "kick and kill" methods
    of treating HIV in which the cells of the latent reservoir are to "kick" the HIV-infected cells
    into inducing transcription of the quiescent, replication-competent HIV proviruses,
20  creating a state of transient viremia and making the activated cells susceptible to the "kill"
    from antiretroviral therapies. "Kick" programs have tested various agents, including
    histone deacetylase inhibitors, disulfiram, PD-1 antibodies, and HIV vaccines, as noted in
    Prospects for Treatment of Latent HIV, Barton et al., Clin. Pharm. & Therap., Vol. 93,

    therapy, Cillo et al., PNAS, May 13 2014, Vol. 111, No. 19, pp. 7078-7083.
             There remains a need for new agents and therapies capable of assisting in the
30  activation of the latent HIV-infected cells to enhance the activity of antiretroviral therapies
    and immune responses.

    the blood of an HIV infected human after HIV infection or following treatment with
    antiretroviral therapy, such as with cART or HAART treatment regimens. can be
    calculated by estimating the amount of virus in an involved body fluid. For example, it can
    be given in HIV RNA copies per millilitre of blood or blood plasma. An "undetectable" HIV
10  viral load comprises a condition in which HIV RNA copies cannot be detected by standard
    viral load tests. An undetectable HIV viral load as used herein refers to a viral load of
    fewer than 50 HIV RNA copies per millilitre of blood or blood plasma. The term "viremia"
    refers to the measurable presence of virus or viral particles in circulation in a virally
    infected human. The term "transient viremia" refers to a brief, transitory, or temporary
15  increase in the measurable presence of virus or viral particles in circulation in a virally
    infected human. Examples of transient HIV viremia include a period in which the HIV-1
    RNA level in the blood or plasma of an HIV infected human which has been maintained
    for a period of time at a concentration of less than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL briefly,
    transitorily, or temporarily rises to a concentration of greater than 50 copies/mL, such as
20  from 50 to 2,000 copies/mL, or a period in which the HIV-1 RNA level in the blood or
    plasma of an HIV infected human which has been maintained for a period of time at a
    concentration of less than 40 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL briefly, transitorily, or
    temporarily rises to a concentration of greater than 40 copies/mL, such as from 40 to
    2,000 copies/mL. Transient, transitory, or temporary viremia may constitute a
25  concentration of greater than 50 copies/mL after repeated testing of an "undetectable"
     HIV viral load of below 50 copies/mL for a designated period, such as one month, three
    months, six months, nine months, or one year. It may also constitute a concentration of
    greater than 50 copies/mL after repeated testing of an "undetectable" HIV viral load of
    below 50 copies/mL following a specified number or series of tested concentrations of
30  less than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL, as determined by a health care provider. In
    separate embodiments the number of consecutive tested concentrations of less than 50

             The terms "virologic suppression" and "virologically suppressed" refer to a
    response to treatment in which the measurable level of viremia in a virally infected human
    is maintained at or below a desired level for a specified human or antiviral treatment or
    regimen. An example of HIV virologic suppression in an HIV-infected human may be the
 5  maintenance in the human of a measurable HIV viral load of less than 200 copies of HIV
    1 RNA per mL of blood or plasma. Other examples of virologic suppression would be the
    maintenance in the human of a viral load of less than 100 copies/mL, less than 50

    Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce the level of HIV in the blood to an undetectable
    level, while latent reservoirs of HIV continue to survive. When a latently infected cell is
15  reactivated, the cell begins to produce HIV (HIV replication).
             The term "regimen" refers to a systematic schedule of administering
    pharmaceutically effective agents to a patient in need thereof, such as a human in need
    thereof, to reach a therapeutic objective.
    The terms "modulation", "modulating" and "modulator" refer to the actions of an agent to
20  agonize (activate or enhance) or antagonize (inhibit or diminish) the function of a
    biological target. Agonists or enhancers include those modulators which increase the
    activity of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, or TLR9 receptors. Within each method, combination, kit,
    use, composition, and regimen described herein utilizing or containing a TLR7 modulator
    or TLR7 modulating compound there is a separate embodiment in which the TLR7
25  modulator or TLR7 modulating compound is an agonist of TLR7. TLR7 agonism may be
    determined by the PBMC assay protocol in U.S. Pat. No. 8,367,670, the contents of
    which are incorporated herein by reference, as well as in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 16,
    4559 (2006). Specifically, cryo-preserved PBMCs are thawed and seeded 96 well plates
    with 750,000 cells/well in 190 fJ.Liwell cell media. The PBMCs are then incubated for 1
30  hour at 370 C. at 5% C02. Then, the compounds to be tested are added in 10 f.LL cell 55
    media at 8 point, half-log dilution titration. The plates are incubated at 37' C. and 5% C02
    for 24 hours and then spinned at 1200 rpm for 10 min, which is followed by collection of
    the supernatant and storing it at -80' C. Cytokine secretion is assayed with Luminex and
    Upstate multi-plex kits, using a Luminex analysis instrument. The IFN-a MEC value for a

             The term "prodrug" as used herein refers to any compound that when administered
    to a biological system generates the drug substance, i.e., active ingredient, as a result of
    spontaneous chemical reaction(s), enzyme catalyzed chemical reaction(s), photolysis,
    and/or metabolic chemical reaction(s). A prodrug is thus a covalently modified analog or
15  latent form of a therapeutically active compound.
             One skilled in the art will recognize that substituents and other moieties of the
    compounds of the formulas herein should be selected in order to provide a compound which

    polymorphism means the ability of a crystalline compound to exist in different crystal
    structures. Polymorphism generally can occur as a response to changes in temperature,
    pressure, or both. Polymorphism can also result from variations in the crystallization
    process. Polymorphs can be distinguished by various physical characteristics known in the
 5  art such as x-ray diffraction patterns, solubility, and melting point. The crystalline
    polymorphism may result from differences in crystal packing (packing polymorphism) or
    differences in packing between different conformers of the same molecule
    (conformational polymorphism). As used herein, crystalline pseudopolymorphism means
    the ability of a hydrate or solvate of a compound to exist in different crystal structures.
10  The pseudopolymorphs of the instant invention may exist due to differences in crystal
    packing (packing pseudopolymorphism) or due to differences in packing between
    different conformers of the same molecule (conformational pseudopolymorphism). The
    instant invention comprises all polymorphs and pseudopolymorphs of the compounds of
    Formula 1-11 and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
15          A compound of the formulas herein and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts may
    also exist as an amorphous solid. As used herein, an amorphous solid is a solid in which
    there is no long-range order of the positions of the atoms in the solid. This definition
    applies as well when the crystal size is two nanometers or less. Additives, including
    solvents, may be used to create the amorphous forms of the instant invention. The
20  instant invention comprises use of all amorphous forms of the compounds described
    herein and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
            Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more chiral centers, or
    may otherwise be capable of existing as multiple stereoisomers. The scope of the present
    invention includes mixtures of stereoisomers as well as purified enantiomers or
25  enantiomerically/diastereomerically enriched mixtures. Also included within the scope of
    the invention are the individual isomers of the compounds represented by the formulae of
    the present invention, as well as any wholly or partially equilibrated mixtures thereof. The
    present invention also includes the individual isomers of the compounds represented by
    the formulas above as mixtures with isomers thereof in which one or more chiral centers
30  are inverted.
            The term "chiral" refers to molecules which have the property of non
    superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term "achiral" refers to molecules
    which are superimposable on their mirror image partner. The term "stereoisomers" refers
    to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the
35  arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. "Diastereomer" refers to a stereoisomer
    with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one
    another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g., melting points, boiling
                                                    44

    points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate
    under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.
    "Enantiomers" refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable
    mirror images of one another.
 5           Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P.
    Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book
    Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds
    (1994) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically
    active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In
10  describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to
    denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d
    and I or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light
    by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound
    prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these
15  stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific
    stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is
    often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a
    racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no
    stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms "racemic
20  mixture" and "racemate" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species,

             The present invention includes a salt or solvate of the compounds herein
    described, including combinations thereof such as a solvate of a salt. The compounds of
    the present invention may exist in solvated, for example hydrated, as well as unsolvated
25  forms, and the present invention encompasses all such forms.
             Typically, but not absolutely, the salts of the present invention are
    pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Salts encompassed within the term
    "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to non-toxic salts of the compounds of this
    invention.
30           Examples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include inorganic acid
    addition salts such as chloride, bromide, sulfate, phosphate, and nitrate; organic acid
    addition salts such as acetate, galactarate, propionate, succinate, lactate, glycolate,
    malate, tartrate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and
    ascorbate; salts with acidic amino acid such as aspartate and glutamate; alkali metal salts
35  such as sodium salt and potassium salt; alkaline earth metal salts such as magnesium
    salt and calcium salt; ammonium salt; organic basic salts such as trimethylamine salt,

    dibenzylethylenediamine salt; and salts with basic amino acid such as lysine salt and
    arginine salt. The salts may be in some cases hydrates or ethanol solvates.
             Any formula or structure given herein, including the compounds of Formula 11and
    the specific examples of compounds herein, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts
 5  thereof, is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled
    forms of the compounds, or salts thereof. Isotopically labeled compounds or salts thereof
    have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are
    replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of
    isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the disclosure include isotopes of
10  hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as, but not
                                                              1 5   18
    limited to 2 H (deuterium, D), 3 H (tritium), 11C, 13C,  C,  N,   F, 31P, 32P, 35, 360 I and
    1251. Various isotopically labeled compounds or salts thereof of the present disclosure, for
    example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3 H, 13C and 14C are incorporated.
    Such isotopically labeled compounds or salts thereof may be useful in metabolic studies,
15  reaction kinetic studies, detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission
    tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including
    drug or substrate tissue distribution assays or in radioactive treatment of subjects (e.g.
    humans).
             The disclosure also includes the compound of formula I and pharmaceutically
20  acceptable salts thereof, in which from 1 to n hydrogens attached to a carbon atom is/are
    replaced by deuterium, in which n is the number of hydrogens in the molecule. Such
    compounds may exhibit increased resistance to metabolism and are thus useful for
    increasing the half-life of the compounds herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts
    thereof when administered to a mammal. See, for example, Foster, "Deuterium Isotope
25  Effects in Studies of Drug Metabolism", Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 5(12):524-527
    (1984). Such compounds are synthesized by means well known in the art, for example
    by employing starting materials in which one or more hydrogens have been replaced by
    deuterium.
             Deuterium labeled or substituted therapeutic compounds of the disclosure may
30  have improved DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) properties, relating to
    distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). Substitution with heavier isotopes such
    as deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic
    stability, for example increased in vivo half-life, reduced dosage requirements and/or an
                                               18
    improvement in therapeutic index. An          F labeled compound may be useful for PET or
35  SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this disclosure and prodrugs thereof

   WO 2016/007765                                                              PCT/US2015/039776
    can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in
    the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available
    isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. It is understood that
    deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent in the compounds disclosed herein
 5  and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
            The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be
    defined by an isotopic enrichment factor. In the compounds of this disclosure any atom
    not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable
    isotope of that atom. Unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically
10  as "H" or "hydrogen", the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural
    abundance isotopic composition. Accordingly, in the compounds or salts thereof of this
    disclosure any atom specifically designated as a deuterium (D) is meant to represent
    deuterium.
15  Metabolites of the Compounds of the Invention
            Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of
    the compounds described herein. Such products may result for example from the
    oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification and the like of the administered
    compound, primarily due to enzymatic processes. Accordingly, the invention includes
20  compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention
    with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof. Such
    products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g., C14 or H3) compound of
    the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about
    0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing
25  sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and
    isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These
    products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of
    antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite
    structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS or NMR analysis. In
30  general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug
    metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so
    long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for
    therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention even if they possess no anti
    infective activity of their own.

   WO 2016/007765                                                               PCT/US2015/039776
             The definitions and substituents for various generic and subgeneric groups of the
    present compounds are described and illustrated herein. It should be understood by one
    skilled in the art that any combination of the definitions and substituents described above
    should not result in an inoperable species or compound. "Inoperable species or
 5  compounds" means compound structures that violates relevant scientific principles (such
    as, for example, a carbon atom connecting to more than four covalent bonds) or
    compounds too unstable to permit isolation and formulation into pharmaceutically
    acceptable dosage forms.
10  Pharmaceutical Formulations
             The compounds of this invention are formulated with conventional carriers and
    excipients, which will be selected in accord with ordinary practice. Tablets will contain
    excipients, glidants, fillers, binders and the like. Aqueous formulations are prepared in
    sterile form, and when intended for delivery by other than oral administration generally will
15  be isotonic. All formulations will optionally contain excipients such as those set forth in
    the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (1986), herein incorporated by reference in
    its entirety. Excipients include ascorbic acid and other antioxidants, chelating agents
    such as EDTA, carbohydrates such as dextrin, hydroxyalkylcellulose,
    hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose, stearic acid and the like. The pH of the formulations ranges
20  from about 3 to about 11, but is ordinarily about 7 to 10.
             While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it may be
    preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations of the
    invention, both for veterinary and for human use, comprise at least one active ingredient,
    together with one or more acceptable carriers and optionally other therapeutic
25  ingredients. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the
    other ingredients of the formulation and physiologically innocuous to the recipient thereof.
             The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes.
    The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be
    prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and
30  formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack
    Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Such
    methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier
    which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are
    prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with
35  liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the
    product.
                                                     48

   WO 2016/007765                                                              PCT/US2015/039776
             Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be
    presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a
    predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or
    a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion
 5  or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be administered as a
    bolus, electuary or paste.
            Pharmaceutical formulations according to the present invention comprise one or
    more compounds of the invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable
    carriers or excipients and optionally other therapeutic agents. Pharmaceutical
10  formulations containing the active ingredient may be in any form suitable for the intended
    method of administration. When used for oral use for example, tablets, troches,
    lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard
    or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared. Compositions intended for oral use
    may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of
15  pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents
    including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in
    order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in
    admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for
    manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, for example, inert
20  diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, lactose monohydrate,
    croscarmellose sodium, povidone, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and
    disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as
    cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such
    as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated
25  by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption
    in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period.
    For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate
    alone or with a wax may be employed.
            The effective dose of an active ingredient depends at least on the nature of the
30  condition being treated, toxicity, whether the compound is being used prophylactically
    (lower doses) or against an active disease or condition, the method of delivery, and the
    pharmaceutical formulation, and will be determined by the clinician using conventional
    dose escalation studies. The effective dose can be expected to be from about 0.0001 to
    about 10 mg/kg body weight per day, typically from about 0.001 to about 1 mg/kg body
35  weight per day, more typically from about 0.01 to about 1 mg/kg body weight per day,
    even more typically from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day. For
    example, the daily candidate dose for an adult human of approximately 70 kg body weight
                                                   49

    will range from about 0.05 mg to about 100 mg, or between about 0.1 mg and about 25
    mg, or between about 0.4 mg and about 6 mg, and may take the form of single or multiple
    doses.
             In yet another embodiment, the present application discloses pharmaceutical
 5  compositions comprising a compound of Formula I or II or a pharmaceutically acceptable
    salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.
    Routes of Administration
            One or more compounds of the invention (herein referred to as the active
10  ingredients) are administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated.
    Suitable routes include oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual),
    vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal,
    intrathecal and epidural), and the like. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may
    vary with for example the condition of the recipient. An advantage of the compounds of
15  this invention is that they are orally bioavailable and can be dosed orally.
    Combination Therapy
             In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are used in
    combination with an additional active therapeutic ingredient or agent.
20           In one embodiment, combinations of one or more of the TLR7 modulating
    compounds described herein and additional active agents may be selected to treat
    patients with an HIV viral infection.
            Combinations of the compounds are typically selected based on the condition to
    be treated, cross-reactivities of ingredients and pharmaco-properties of the combination.
25  For example, when treating an infection (e.g., HIV), the compositions of the invention are
    combined with other active agents (such as those described herein).
            Suitable active agents or ingredients which can be combined with the TLR7
    modulating compounds described herein, or a salt thereof, can include one or more
    compounds selected from the group consisting of TLR7 agonists selected from the group
30  consisting of ANA-975, SM-360320, and mixtures thereof.
             In addition, the compounds of the invention may be employed in combination with
    other therapeutic agents for the treatment or prophylaxis of AIDS and/or one or more
    other diseases present in a human subject suffering from AIDS (e.g., bacterial and/or
    fungal infections, other viral infections such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or cancers such
35  as Kaposi's sarcoma). The additional therapeutic agent(s) may be coformulated with one
    or more salts of the invention (e.g., coformulated in a tablet).

            In yet another embodiment, the present application discloses pharmaceutical
    compositions comprising a TLR7 modulating compound described herein, or a
15  pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with at least one additional
    active agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In yet another
    embodiment, the present application provides a combination pharmaceutical agent with
    two or more therapeutic agents in a unitary dosage form. Thus, it is also possible to
    combine any compound of the invention with one or more other active agents in a unitary
20  dosage form.
            The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential
    regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two
    or more administrations.
            Co-administration of a compound of the invention with one or more other active
25  agents generally refers to simultaneous or sequential administration of a compound of the
    invention and one or more other active agents, such that therapeutically effective
    amounts of the compound of the invention and one or more other active agents are both
    present in the body of the patient.
            Co-administration includes administration of unit dosages of the compounds of the
30  invention before or after administration of unit dosages of one or more other active
    agents, for example, administration of the compounds of the invention within seconds,
    minutes, or hours of the administration of one or more other active agents. For example,
    a unit dose of a compound of the invention can be administered first, followed within
    seconds or minutes by administration of a unit dose of one or more other active agents.
35  Alternatively, a unit dose of one or more other active agents can be administered first,
    followed by administration of a unit dose of a compound of the invention within seconds
    or minutes. In some cases, it may be desirable to administer a unit dose of a compound

    of the invention first, followed, after a period of hours (e.g., 1-12 hours), by administration
    of a unit dose of one or more other active agents. In other cases, it may be desirable to
    administer a unit dose of one or more other active agents first, followed, after a period of
    hours (e.g., 1-12 hours), by administration of a unit dose of a compound of the invention.
 5           The combination therapy may provide "synergy" and "synergistic effect", i.e. the
    effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the
    effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be
    attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered
    simultaneously in a combined formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as
10  separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation
    therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or
    delivered sequentially, e.g., in separate tablets, pills or capsules, or by different injections
    in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each
    active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination
15  therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.
    Methods of Treatment
             As used herein, an "agonist" is a substance that stimulates its binding partner,
    typically a receptor. Stimulation is defined in the context of the particular assay, or may
20  be apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a comparison to a factor
    or substance that is accepted as an "agonist" or an "antagonist" of the particular binding
    partner under substantially similar circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the
    art. Stimulation may be defined with respect to an increase in a particular effect or
    function that is induced by interaction of the agonist or partial agonist with a binding
25  partner and can include allosteric effects.
             As used herein, an "antagonist" is a substance that inhibits its binding partner,
    typically a receptor. Inhibition is defined in the context of the particular assay, or may be
    apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a comparison to a factor or
    substance that is accepted as an "agonist" or an "antagonist" of the particular binding
30  partner under substantially similar circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the
    art. Inhibition may be defined with respect to a decrease in a particular effect or function
    that is induced by interaction of the antagonist with a binding partner, and can include
    allosteric effects.
             As used herein, a "partial agonist" or a "partial antagonist" is a substance that
35  provides a level of stimulation or inhibition, respectively, to its binding partner that is not
    fully or completely agonistic or antagonistic, respectively. It will be recognized that
    stimulation, and hence, inhibition is defined intrinsically for any substance or category of
                                                    57

   WO 2016/007765                                                              PCT/US2015/039776
    substances to be defined as agonists, antagonists, or partial agonists.
            As used herein, "intrinsic activity" or "efficacy" relates to some measure of
    biological effectiveness of the binding partner complex. With regard to receptor
    pharmacology, the context in which intrinsic activity or efficacy should be defined will
 5  depend on the context of the binding partner (e.g., receptor/ligand) complex and the
    consideration of an activity relevant to a particular biological outcome. For example, in
    some circumstances, intrinsic activity may vary depending on the particular second
    messenger system involved. Where such contextually specific evaluations are relevant,
    and how they might be relevant in the context of the present invention, will be apparent to
10  one of ordinary skill in the art.
            As used herein, modulation of a receptor includes agonism, partial agonism,
    antagonism, partial antagonism, or inverse agonism of a receptor. A TLR7 modulating
    compound may also be referred to as a TLR7 modulating agent, a TLR7 modulator, a
    compound which modulates TLR7 activity, or the like.
15          As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, when treating a viral infection
    such as HIV, such treatment may be characterized in a variety of ways and measured by
    a variety of endpoints. The scope of the present invention is intended to encompass all
    such characterizations.
            In one embodiment, the method can be used to induce an immune response
20  against multiple epitopes of a viral infection in a human. Induction of an immune
    response against viral infection can be assessed using any technique that is known by
    those of skill in the art for determining whether an immune response has occurred.
    Suitable methods of detecting an immune response for the present invention include,
    among others, detecting a decrease in viral load or antigen in a subject's serum, detection
25  of IFN-gamma-secreting antigen specific T cells, and detection of elevated levels of one
    or more liver enzymes, such as alanine transferase (ALT) and aspartate transferase
    (AST). In one embodiment, the detection of IFN-gamma-secreting antigen specific T cells
    is accomplished using an ELISPOT assay or FACS analysis. Another embodiment
    includes reducing the viral load associated with HIV infection, including a reduction as
30  measured by PCR testing.
            A TLR7 modulating compound as described herein can be administered by any
    useful route and means, such as by oral or parenteral (e.g., intravenous) administration.
    Therapeutically effective amounts of a TLR7 modulating compound as described herein
    are from about 0.00001 mg/kg body weight per day to about 10 mg/kg body weight per

    day, or such as from about 30 pg to about 300 pg per day.
             The frequency of dosage of a TLR7 modulating compound as described herein
 5  will be determined by the needs of the individual patient and can be, for example, once
    per day or twice, or more times, per day. Administration of a TLR7 modulating compound
    as described herein continues for as long as necessary to treat the HIV infection. For
    example, a TLR7 modulating compound as described herein can be administered to a
    human being infected with HIV for a period of from 20 days to 180 days or, for example,
10  for a period of from 20 days to 90 days or, for example, for a period of from 30 days to 60
    days.
             Administration can be intermittent, with a period of one or more days during which
    a patient receives a daily dose of a TLR7 modulating compound as described herein,
    followed by a period of several or more days during which a patient does not receive a
15  daily dose of a TLR7 modulating compound as described herein. For example, a patient
    can receive a dose of a TLR7 modulating compound as described herein every other day,
    or three times per week, once per week (every 7 days), once every other week (every 14
    days), once per month, or once every other month. Again by way of example, a patient
    can receive a dose of a TLR7 modulating compound as described herein each day for a
20  period of from 1 to 14 days, followed by a period of 7 to 30 days during which the patient
    does not receive a dose of a TLR7 modulating compound as described herein, followed
    by a subsequent period (e.g., from 1 to 14 days) during which the patient again receives a
    daily dose of a TLR7 modulating compound as described herein. For other examples, in
    separate embodiments, a patient can receive an initial single dose of a TLR7 modulating
25  compound as described herein, followed by sequential doses every other day, or three
    times per week, once per week (every 7 days), once every other week (every 14 days),
    once per month, or once every other month. Alternating periods of administration of a
    TLR7 modulating compound as described herein, followed by non-administration of a
    TLR7 modulating compound as described herein, can be repeated as clinically required
30  to treat the patient.
             Each of the TLR7 modulating compounds of Formula II represented below by
    Examples 1 through 118, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be
    prepared by methods disclosed in WO 2010/077613 Al (Desai et al.), which is
    incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and by other methods known in the art.

    herein comprises a separate embodiment for the method in question. For instance, the
    use of combination 1A-a with the first method described for treating an HIV infection,
    above provides a method of treating an HIV infection in a human comprising:
         a) administering to a human in need thereof from 100 mg to 200 mg elvitegravir, 100
 5           mg to 200 mg cobicistat, and from 250 mg to 350 mg TDF to lower the level of
              HIV detected in the human's blood or plasma from a first level to a second level,
             the second level comprising a lower concentration of HIV in the human's blood or
             plasma than the concentration of HIV in the human's blood or plasma in the first
             level; and
10       b) administering to the human from 0.1 mg to 15.0 mg of a compound of Formula 11,
             or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
    For each of these separate methods there are further embodiments directed to the
    sequence of administering each agent.
              In one embodiment within each method the TLR7 modulating compound (TLR7
15  modulating agent) and the antiviral agent or agents may be administered to the human
    together, such as each being administered in the same day. Pharmaceutically effective
    amounts of each agent can be administered on a specified regimen, such once daily,
    twice daily, once weekly, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once per
    month, once every two months, etc. In another embodiment within each method the
20  initial doses of the TLR7 modulating compound and the antiviral agent or agents may be
    administered to the human together, with subsequent administrations being at staggered
    time points. For instance, following an initial dose of each agent, the TLR7 compound
    could be administered to the human every day or in 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11, 12
    , 13-, 14-, or 15-day intervals, wherein the HIV antibody is administered once per week,
25  twice per month, monthly, etc., as can each of the individual antiviral agents.
              In another embodiment within each method the TLR7 modulating compound may
    be administered in an initial administration, with the antiviral agent or agents being
    administered to the human in a subsequent administration, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
    10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 days following administration of the TLR7 modulating compound.
30  In another embodiment within each method the antiviral agents may be administered in
    an initial administration, with the TLR7 modulating compound being administered to the
    human in a subsequent administration, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
    or 15 days following administration of the TLR7 modulating compound. In another
    embodiment within each method administration of the TLR7 modulating compound may
35  be added to an existing antiviral agent regimen.
    The TLR7 modulating agent may being administered to the human daily with the antiviral

    agents or, in conjunction with daily antiviral agent administrations, the subsequent
    administration of TLR7 modulating agent may follow a staggered regimen, such as every
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 days. In addition, administration of an
    antiviral agent or agents to a human infected with HIV may be added in a regimen
 5  following administration of the TLR7 modulating agent. For instance, the TLR7
    modulating agent (compound) may be administered in a single dose, in a series of once
    or twice daily doses, or in a series of doses staggered across a period of time, followed
    by administration to the human of a regimen of an antiviral agent or agents.

    EXAMPLES
    Example 201. Formulation of Example 4
15
    A sterile formulation of Example 4 suitable for oral dosing was prepared. Initially, a
    vehicle solution was prepared by dissolving propyl gallate in 0.001 N HCI (pH 3.0) to
    obtain a final concentration of propyl gallate of 0.005% (w/v). Three solution formulations
    the compound of Example 4 were prepared by dissolving a sufficient amount of the
20  compound of Example 4 in the 0.005% propyl gallate vehicle solution, to arrive at final
    concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL, 0.2 mg/mL, and 0.3 mg/mL Compound 4. These
    compositions were frozen at -200C until time of use.
    Example 202. cART Formulation
25  A cART formulation containing 20mg/mL tenofovir (TFV, GMP grade), 50mg/mL
    emtricitabine (FTC, GMP grade), and 2.5mg/mL dolutegravir (DTG, 95% purity) was
    prepared in a solvent containing a final concentration of 25% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400
    (PEG-400, Spectrum Chemical New Brunswick, NJ), 15% (w/v) Captisol (Ligand
    Pharmaceuticals, LA Jolla, CA) and 0.075N sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Spectrum
30  Chemical, New Brunswick, NJ) in water. This formulation was prepared by mixing DTG
    stock solution (10 mg/mL of DTG in PEG-400), TFV and FTC stock solution (80 mg/mL of
    TFV and 200 mg/mL of FTC in 0.3 N NaOH), and 30% (w/w) captosil solution at a 1:1:2
    (v:v:v) ratio. The final solution was clear with a pH -6. It was sterile filtered, then
    aliquoted into sterile glass and frozen at -20'C until used.

    Example 203. TLR7 Modulating Compound in SIV* Viremic Rhesus at Chronic Set
    Point
    Five chronically infected, SIV* rhesus macaques were either treated with the compound
 5  of Example 4 (n=3 animals) or with dosing vehicle (placebo, n=2 animals) in a multiple
    dose, dose escalation, placebo controlled study. The macaques were infected with simian
    immunodeficiency virus for sufficient period of time to establish a chronic set point (i.e., a
    state of persistent viremia, i.e., post-peak viremia where host immunological control of
    virus replication is established, although this does not lead to complete viral suppression)
10  prior to dosing with the compound of Example 4. The animals were not administered
    combination antiretroviral therapy during any part of the study.
    The animals were dosed once weekly by oral gavage (via nasogastric tube) with either
    the compound of Example 4 or placebo. Three animals were administered the compound
    of Example 4, prepared as described in Example 201. The first week, 1 mL/kg of the
15  0.1 mg/mL formulation was administered, corresponding to a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. The
    second week, 1 mL/kg of the 0.2 mg/mL formulation was administered, corresponding to
    a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. On weeks three through five, 1 mL/kg of the 0.3 mg/mL formulation
    was administered, corresponding to a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Each week, two animals
    (placebo group) were administered the dosing vehicle as described in Example 201 at
20  1mL/kg.
    Each formulation of Example 201 or dosing vehicle only (placebo) was used fresh and
    thawed to room temperature prior to dosing. Plasma viral loads (expressed as SIV RNA
    copies per mL of plasma) were determined by quantitative RT-PCR of the SIV RNA
    measuring the gag gene transcripts at various times throughout the study for animals
25  administered the compound of Example 4 and the placebo animals. The data are shown
    in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 depicts the absolute viral load for each animal for each study
    day. Figure 2 depicts the change in viral load from baseline (day 0) for each study day. In
    Figures 1 and 2, the dark black data points correspond to data from animals dosed with
    the compound of Example 4 while the shaded gray data points correspond to data from
30  animals dosed with the placebo.
    In Fig. 1 and 2, dosing days are shown by the arrows on the horizontal x-axis relative to
    start of administration of the compound of Example 4.
    As shown in Fig. 2, three of the three animals administered the compound of Example 4,
    experienced a decrease in viral load ranging from approximately 0.4 to 1.8 log10
35  immediately following the first dose. This amount of decrease in plasma viral load was not
    observed in animals administered the placebo. The animal that initiated the study with the
                                                  260

    highest viral load exhibited a decrease in viral load following dosing (Fig. 2). However.
    this animal was removed from the study prior to being administered the fourth and fifth
    dose due to SIV-related symptoms.
    The animal that initiated the study with the lowest viral load (lowest chronic set point)
 5  maintained a plasma viral load that was undetectable (<50 RNA copies/mL) for at least
    100 days following the last dose of the compound of Example 4 as shown in Fig. 1. In a
    second animal dosed with the compound of Example 4 there was also a sustained
    decrease in viral load set point by approximately 1 log order compared to pre-dose (logi 0
    RNA copies) that was maintained at least 100 days following the last dose (Fig. 2).
10  Together, the data shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 demonstrate there was a decrease in
    plasma viral load after the first dose of study compound, followed by cyclic viral increases
    with subsequent doses, and sustained maintenance of a new and lower chronic viral set
    point as compared to pre-administration of the compound of Example 4.
15  Example 204. TLR7 Modulating Compound in cART Treated SIV* Viremic Rhesus
    with Undetectable Plasma Viremia
    A group of 10 Indian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were treated with the compound
    of Example 4 or dosing vehicle of Example 201 (placebo group) in a multiple dose, dose
20  escalation study. The macaques were infected with simian immunodeficiency virus
    (SlVmac251) by repeat low-dose rectal mucosal challenge. Beginning on day 65 post
    infection, after establishment of peak viremia and an early viral chronic set point, the
    animals were treated with a the cART by sub-cutaneous injection at 1 mL/kg, the
    administration of which was for approximately one year. During the time of cART
25  administration plasma viral loads decreased to undetectable levels (SIV gag RNA < 50
    copies/mL) by Day 168 post-infection, and were maintained for approximately 5 months
    prior to administration of the compound of Example 4 by use of daily cART. In addition,
    animals were maintained on the same cART regimen when dosed with the compound of
    Example 4.The amount of antiretrovirals administered to each animal, on a daily basis, in
30  the cART formulation were 20 mg/kg tenofovir, 50 mg/kg emtricitibine (FTC), and 2.5
    mg/kg dolutegravir. The animals were administered cART daily from approximately day
    65 post-infection, through viral suppression and administration of the compound of
    Example 4 until approximately two weeks post-last dose of the compound from Example
    4 at which time cART was stopped to monitor plasma viral load rebound kinetics.
35           Beginning on Day 317 post-infection, the animals were dosed once every other
    week with either the compound of Example 4 or dosing vehicle of Example 201 (placebo

    formulation was dosed, corresponding to a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. On weeks five through
 5  thirteen, 1 mL/kg of the 0.3 mg/mL formulation was dosed, corresponding to a dose of
    0.3 mg/kg (seven doses in total). The other six animals were controls, of which three were
    given seven doses of saline by oral gavage once every two weeks; the other three
    animals were left untreated. Approximately two weeks following the last dose of the
    compound of Example 4, cART was stopped in the three saline-dosed placebo animals
10  and the four animals who had received the compound of Example 4. Approximately one
    month later, cART was stopped in the three untreated control animals. Following cART
    cessation viral loads were monitored for a period of six months.
    Each formulation of the compound of Example 4 or dosing vehicle of Example 201 was
    thawed at room temperature prior to dosing. Animals were dosed by oral gavage via
15  nasogastric tube.
    Plasma viral loads (expressed as SIV RNA copies per mL of plasma) were determined by
    quantitative RT-PCR of the SIV RNA measuring the gag gene transcripts at various times
    throughout the study. Viral loads for animals administered the compound of Example 4
    and placebo group are shown in Table 1 and in Fig. 3. Viral loads for each animal for
20  each study day relative to time of administration of the first dose of the compound of
    Example 4 are depicted in Fig. 3; dosing days are shown by the arrows on the horizontal
    x-axis.
    As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3, detectable plasma virus was observed in the animals
    administered the compound of Example 4 approximately 24-72 hours after each of the
25  last three doses of study drug (at 0.3 mg/kg). In each case, the virus levels returned to
    baseline (< 50 copies per mL) prior to administration of the following dose. Virus levels
    remained undetectable for a total of 13 days after the last dose of the compound of
    Example 4. While the data are not shown in Fig. 3, in the three saline-dosed placebo
    animals and untreated control animals there was no detectable change in plasma virus
30  expression during the dosing period and the animals maintained SIV RNA < 50
    copies/mL.

    The data from this portion of the dose-escalation study demonstrates that the compound
    of Example 4 reproducibly induced transient plasma viremia in the presence of cART
 5  followed by a return to full plasma SIV RNA suppression. The transient increases in
    detectable plasma virus occurred after 4 to 5 doses of the compound of Example 4
    administered orally once every 14 days.
    After two weeks following the last dose of study drug, cART therapy was also stopped in
    all dosed (placebo dosed included) animals. In the untreated control group of animals,
10  cART was stopped 30 days later. Table 2 denotes the average viral load chronic set point
    from day 42-81 following cessation of cART for each of the animals in the study. As
    shown in Table 2, all animals experienced plasma viral rebound within 7 to 14 days after
    cART cessation. However, when comparing the pre-cART plasma SIV RNA chronic set
    point to the post-cART cessation chronic set point within the animals administered the
15  compound of Example 4 this was approximately -0.5 logo lower (mean change for all
    animals treated with the compound of Example 4) than the change observed in those
    animals in the placebo group (mean change for all animals administered dosing vehicle of
    Example 201).

    Example 205. Proviral SIV DNA Measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear
    cells (PBMCs), Lymph Node, and Colon
 5  A whole blood sample, an inguinal lymph node sample, and a colon pinch biopsy sample
    were taken from the animals dosed with the compound of Example 4 and from the
    animals dosed with the vehicle of Example 201 (placebo group) in the study described in
    Example 204. These samples were taken prior to initiation of dosing and two weeks after
    the last dose; all samples were taken while animals were on cART. Total DNA was
10  isolated from each sample using commercially available blood and tissue DNA extraction
    kits. Proviral SIV DNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using probe
    primer sets specific to the SIV gag gene and normalization for cellular input by measuring
    the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene levels. In comparing
    proviral SIV DNA amounts in the pre- and post- treatment PBMC, inguinal lymph node,
15  and colon samples within each animal, there was a clear decrease in proviral DNA
    content for three of four animals treated with the compound of Example 4 across all
    tissues. In one of the compound treated animals (166-08), there was only a noted
    decrease in the proviral DNA content in the PBMCs, a minor increase in lymph node, and
    a minor decrease in the colon. In the vehicle-dosed placebo control animals, however,
20  there were slight to moderate increases in two of three animals in proviral SIV DNA in the
    PBMC and colon samples, and relatively stable levels in lymph node samples.

 5  Example 206. Peripheral Lymphocyte Activation
    During the course of treatment with the compound of Example 4 as described in Example
    204, peripheral lymphocyte activation was monitored in the groups dosed with the
    compound of Example 4 or the dosing vehicle of Example 201 (placebo), by measuring
    the expression of the early activation marker CD69 on various lymphocyte subsets by
10  flow cytometry methodology. This methodology was used to quantify the percentage of
    immune cell subsets expressing the early activation marker. Standard data acquisition
    techniques were employed on a flow cytometer and by the use of antibodies conjugated
    to fluorescent molecules where the antibodies recognize rhesus macaque cell surface
    proteins on various immune cell subsets. In animals dosed with the compound of
15  Example 4, whole blood samples were collected for each dose at various time points both
    at pre- and post-administration of compound. Total PBMCs were stained in the whole
    blood samples using antibodies that were chosen to be reactive to rhesus CD3, CD4,
    CD8, NKG2A, CD16 and CD56, each conjugated to different fluorescent probes to
    delineate CD3+CD4+CD8- lymphocytes, CD3+CD4-CD8+ lymphocytes and CD3-CD8+
20  NKG2A+CD16+ CD56+ NK cells. The flow cytometry data presented herein are from
    animals treated with the compound of Example 4.

    Peripheral CD4 lymphocytes (CD3+CD4+CD8-) demonstrated transient activation in
    response to the compound of Example 4 dosing based on expression of the early
    activation marker CD69. The percent change from pre-dose levels in cells expressing
    CD69 increased at 24 to 72 hours post-dose and returned back to near pre-dose levels
 5  one week after dosing. The percent change in of peripheral activated CD4 lymphocytes
    also increased in magnitude based on dose of the compound of Example 4). At the dose
    of 0.1 mg/kg Example 4, the mean maximum percent change in CD69 expression at any
    time point on CD4 lymphocytes was 1.1% (pre-dose range 0.5-1.7%), at a dose of 0.2
    mg/kg the mean maximum percent change was 1.5% (pre-dose range 0.5-2%), and at
10  the first dose of 0.3 mg/kg the mean maximum percent change was 2.3% (pre-dose
    range 0.6-2.5%). However, all subsequent doses did not achieve similar levels of
    peripheral CD4 lymphocyte activation; mean maximum percent change in CD69
    expression was 1.7%.
    Peripheral CD8 lymphocytes (CD3+CD8+CD4-) also demonstrated transient activation in
15  response to dosing with the compound of Example 4, based on the expression of CD69.
    The percent changes from pre-dose levels in CD8 lymphocytes expressing CD69
    increased at 24 to 72 hours post-dose and returned back to near pre-dose levels one
    week after dosing. The percent change in peripheral activated CD8 lymphocytes also
    increased in magnitude based on dose of the compound of Example 4. At the dose of 0.1
20  mg/kg the mean maximum percent change in CD69 expression at any time point on CD8
    lymphocytes was 7.8% (pre-dose range 3.3-12.6%), at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg the mean
    maximum percent change was 9.5% (pre-dose range 3.0-15.7%), and at the first dose of
    0.3 mg/kg the mean maximum percent change was 17.3% (pre-dose range 5.0-14.4%).
    However, all subsequent 0.3 mg/kg doses did not achieve similar levels of peripheral CD8
25  lymphocyte activation; mean maximum percent change in CD69 expression was 15.5%.
             Total peripheral NK cells (CD3-CD8+ NKG2A+CD16+CD56+, which included
    CD16 low/high and CD56 low/high) also demonstrated transient activation in response to
    dosing with the compound of Example 4, based on the expression of CD69. The percent
    changes from pre-dose levels in NK cells expressing CD69 increased by 24 to 72 hours
30  post-dose and generally returned back to or slightly below pre-dose levels one week after
    dosing. The percent change in peripheral activated NK cells only slightly increased in
    magnitude based on dose of the compound of Example 4. At the dose of 0.1 mg/kg the
    mean maximum percent change in CD69 expression at any time point on NK cells was
    6.5% (pre-dose range 89-95%), at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg the mean maximum percent
35  change was 9.5% (pre-dose range 83-95%), at the first dose of 0.3 mg/kg the mean
    maximum expression was 8.3% (pre-dose range 84-95%), and at the second dose of
    0.3 mg/kg the mean maximum expression was 8.7% (pre-dose range 82-97%). All

 5  The compound of Example 4 is able to induce transient expression of plasma SIV in the
    rhesus macaque model of HIV-1 infection. The compound of Example 4 reduced the
    amount of proviral SIV DNA content in PBMCs, inguinal lymph node, and colon tissue
    which are markers for reduction of the viral reservoir. Further, administration with the
    compound of Example 4 produced an immunological response that was measureable in
10  the absence of cART, as demonstrated by the lower plasma virus chronic set point (post
    cART cessation) after the administration of the compound.
    In Vitro Testing
    The in vitro testing of the compounds disclosed herein are designed to show similar
15  activation of immune cells in total PBMC cultures from virally suppressed HIV-1 infected
    donors. Both molecules can also induce HIV-1 replication in cultures of resting PBMCs
    obtained from virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients. In addition, both
    molecules show direct antiviral affects in cultures of activated PBMCs exogenously
    infected with HIV-1.
20  Example 207. In Vitro Lymphocyte Subset Activation in PBMC Cultures from
    Healthy and HIV-1 Infected Donors
    Total PBMC cultures were derived from Ficoll-purified buffy coats obtained from healthy
    human donors or leukapheresis samples obtained from HIV-1 infected donors (HIV-1
25  infected donors were patients on cART and virally suppressed HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL
    for    1 year). Total PBMC cultures were treated with various concentrations of the
    identified TLR7 modulating compounds (Compounds of Example 4 and Example 49) for
    24 hours. At the end of the incubation period, total PBMC were harvested and stained
    with antibodies conjugated to specific fluorophores to delineate human CD4 lymphocytes
30  (CD3+CD4+CD8-) or CD8 lymphocytes (CD3+CD8+CD4-) and co-expressing the early
    activation marker CD69. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and data collected on an
    LSR FortessaX20 instrument (BD Biosciences).
    The tested TLR7 modulating compounds were able to induce lymphocyte activation in
    vitro, specifically to cause activation of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. The maximum
35  percentage of cells activated was similar for both compounds within each donor.

    Example 208. Induced HIV-1 Expression in PBMC Cultures from HIV-1 Infected
10  Donors on cART Treated with TLR7 Modulating Compounds
    To assess the ability to activate HIV-1 expression in total PBMC cultures, Ficoll-purified
    leukapheresis samples obtained from HIV-1 infected donors (HIV-1 infected donors were
    patients on cART and virally suppressed HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL for        1 year) were
    tested. Isolated PBMCs were treated with various concentrations (0.1, 1, and 10 pM) of
15  the TLR7 modulating compounds (compounds of Example 4 and Example 49) or dimethyl
    sulfoxide (DMSO) treated (vehicle control) for 4 to 5 days. The cultures were maintained
                                                268

   WO 2016/007765                                                               PCT/US2015/039776
    in the presence of antivirals (elvitegravir and efavirenz at 100 nM each) to prevent viral
    spread and amplification in order to measure initial virus production (latency reversal)
    created by the TLR7 modulating compounds. At the end of the incubation period cell-free
    culture supernatants were harvested and HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified by the
 5  COBAS* AmpliPrep/COBAS* TaqMan HIV-1 Test, v2.0 (Roche).
    In the absence of any other activation stimuli, treatment with the TLR7 modulating
    compounds induced the HIV-1 expression in PBMC cultures from all donors tested
    (Table 6). Two-fold or higher activation over the DMSO control was observed in cultures
    from 4 of 6, 3 of 6, and 1 of 4 patients following the treatment with the compound of
10  Example 49 at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 pM, respectively. A similar frequency of
    response was observed following treatment with the compound of Example 4. Two-fold or
    higher induction of HIV-1 expression was observed in 6 out of 6 donors with at least one
    TLR-7 agonist (n=2 donors) or both agonists (n=4 donors). Without wishing to be bound
    by a particular theory it is thought that the lack of consistent dose responsive viral
15  expression to either agonist within the concentration ranges tested across the tested
    donors may result from a combined net effect induced by the dual capability of the TLR7
    modulating compounds to induce virus expression and exert an antiviral effect. While the
    antiviral effect of the TLR7 modulating compounds was not directly measured in Example
    208, other data presented from Example 207 and Example 209 demonstrate these
20  potential antiviral activities. Both of these biological activities may manifest at different
    compound concentrations in a donor-dependent manner, resulting in the variation in
    TLR7 modulating compound concentrations at which HIV-1 activation can occur. Overall,
    these data demonstrate the in vitro induction of HIV-1 expression by the TLR7 modulating
    agents.

    Antiretroviral activity was assessed by testing the TLR7 modulating compounds
    (Compounds of Example 4 and Example 49) in total human PBMC cultures that were first
    treated with mitogen (phytohemogglutinin A) for two days prior to infection with HIV-1 BaL

    measuring production of HIV-1 Gag p24 by commercially available ELISA kits. The TLR7
 5  modulating compounds showed potent and concentration-dependent antiretroviral activity
    in each of the eight donor cultures tested, with a mean EC 50 of 170 nM and 33 nM,

    PBMCs from 5 HIV-infected donors (Donor IDs 178-180 and 182-183) on suppressive
    cART were isolated, as described previously, and stained with carboxyfluorescein
    succinimiyl ester (CFSE). PBMC cultures were treated with DMSO or the compound of
10  Example 49 (GS-9620) at 0.1 or 1 uM. Cultures were incubated at 37'C for 2 days and
    treated with 500 ng/ml 15-mer peptide pools derived from overlapping HIV gag, pol, nef,
    and env consensus peptides (JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH). Cells were incubated at
    37'C for 8 days. Cultures were split into duplicate sets and stained in dulbecco's
    phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (Life
15  Technologies). The immune recall response was performed as follows. One culture set
    was treated with the same HIV peptide pools and the other set was treated with 500
    ng/ml CMV/EBV/Flu/Tetanus (CEFT) peptides (JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH). After
    one hour at 37'C, cultures were treated with 0.7 pl GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) containing
    monensin and 1 pl GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) containing brefeldin A. Cultures were
20  incubated for 3 additional hours at 37'C and stained for 15 minutes with anti-CD4-v450,
    anti-CD3-AlexaFlour 700, and anti CD8-APC-H7 (BD Biosciences). Cultures were fixed
    with IC Fixation Buffer (eBioscience) and permeabilized with Permeabilization Buffer
    (eBioscience). Anti-IFN-gamma-APC and anti-TNFalpha-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD Biosciences)
    were used to stain intracellular cytokine production. FACS was performed on a LSR
25  Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and data analysis was done with FlowJo software (TreeStar).
    Response to CEFT peptides were subtracted from the response seen with HIV peptides.
    Data was plotted and statistical analysis was done with GraphPad Prism software
    (GraphPad). Treatment with Example 49 at 0.1 uM increased the mean level of
    polyfunctional proliferating CD8 T cells (CFSE low, IFNg+, TNFa+) by 9.0-fold compared
30  to treatment with DMSO (p<0.05; Student's unpaired, two-tailed t-test). Treatment with

    PBMCs from 2 healthy donors (AllCells: Donor IDs A4593, A4596, A4606) were isolated,
    as described previously. PBMCs were treated with DMSO or with the compound of
25  Example 49 (GS-9620) at 0.1 uM or 1 uM in replicate culture sets of 8 for 5 days. In
    parallel, total CD4 T cells were isolated from each donors' PBMCs using the EasySep
    Human CD4+ T cell Enrichment Kit (Stemcell Technologies). CD4 T cells were infected in
    bulk with the HIV-1 clinical isolate HT593 (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) using 50-100 ng
    p24/million CD4 T cells by spinfecting at 1200   xg for 2 hours. HIV-infected CD4 T cells
30  were incubated for 5 days at 37'C in RPMI plus 10% FBS with 30 U/mL IL-2 (Invitrogen).
    After 5 days in culture, HIV-infected CD4 T cells were washed, counted, and added to
    PBMCs from the autologous donor at a ratio of 20 PBMCs to 1 CD4 T cell (20:1). To each
    co-culture replicate, HIV antibody PGT121 (Gilead Sciences, Inc.) was added at
    concentrations from 6.7e-5 nM to 6.7e2 nM. Co-cultures were incubated with or without
35  HIV antibody for 1 day at 37'C.

   Co-cultures were collected and stained with live/dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain
   (Invitrogen) and PE-Cy7-labeled antibody to CD4 (BD Biosciences). Cells were fixed and
   permeabilized, as described previously, and stained with PE labeled antibody to HIV Gag
   protein p24 (Beckman Coulter). FACS was performed on a LSR Fortessa (BD
 5 Biosciences) and data analysis was done with FlowJo software (TreeStar). Data was
   plotted and statistical analysis was done with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad).
   Killing of HIV-infected CD4 T cells was calculated as a reduction of CD4+ p24+ T cells at
   each PGT1 21 concentration relative to cultures without PGT1 21. For the DMSO-treated
   cultures combined with PGT121, maximal killing was 30% or 40%, and the area under the
10 curve (AUC), an integrative measure of killing potency and maximal killing, was 99 or 108
   respectively. Relative to DMSO controls, treatment with Example 49 (GS-9620) at 0.1 uM
   increased the maximal killing by 30% or 38% and increased the AUC by 32% or 52%
   respectively. Relative to DMSO controls, treatment with Example 49 (GS-9620) at 1 uM
   increased the maximal killing by 50% or 48% and increased the AUC by 52% or 73%
15 respectively, as depicted in Figure 14.

         a) administering to a human in need thereof a pharmaceutically effective amount
            of a combination antiretroviral therapy regimen sufficient to lower the level of
            HIV detected in the human's blood or plasma from a first level to a second
            level, the second level comprising a lower concentration of HIV in the human's
            blood or plasma than the concentration of HIV in the human's blood or plasma
            in the first level; and
         b) administering to the human a pharmaceutically effective amount of a TLR7
            modulating compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
 3.      The method of Claim 2 wherein the first level of HIV in the human's plasma is
 below 50 copies of HIV RNA/ml.
