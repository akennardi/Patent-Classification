   BACKGROUND OF                THE INVENTION
   1. Field of the Invention
 5        The present           invention          relates       to  a natural            ingredient
   production           system,           and more particularly                    to     a    nutrient
   and function              improvement               (NUFIT) system.
   2. Description of the Related Art
          To prepare various                    types of products from plant raw
10 materials,           in the prior art,                    an external force manner
   such as grinding                 or mashing is             used to      prepare           the     plant
   raw materials             into      powdered nutrients.                  In   a conventional
   process       of producing             powderednutrients,                 an external             force
   is     applied at            the      same     time       on   the    produced              powdered
15 nutrients.          As aresult,            the    powdered nutrients                  are     pressed
   by    the    external            force to          form lumps,            and     consequently
   the      obtained product                  contains          power      particles               having
   relativelylargeparticle                         sizes. Inotherwords, nutrients
   obtained         in   the     prior      art     have different             particle            sizes,
20 and therefore                consumers may have negative                             impressions
   as    to    unstable           quality         or unsafe products,                     leading to
   reduced buying                 interest.
         Moreover,          in    a process        of preparing          powdered nutrients
   in    the   prior       art,       the    ambient temperature                    is    often         high
25 and the        humidity            is    not     controlled. During production
   of powdered nutrients                     under fluctuating                 temperature                and
   humidity conditions,                      not only the           original            nutritional

                                             2
   value of nutrients          isdamaged, but also the original         flavor
   of the nutrients          is   damaged or changed.      As a result,      the
   produced nutrients             have undesirable smell or taste            and
   cannot be accepted by consumers.
 5       Therefore,      currently      it  becomes a target    of suppliers
   to develop a system that            can improve the nutritional        value
   of nutrients      and can enhance the flavor of the nutrients.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         A main objective of the present invention is              to provide
10 a NUFIT system which can maintain the nutritional                      value

   the enzymes          (92)    enter the channel             (60),    the reaction
10 portion        (50) reciprocates           in the chamber             (21)    to keep
   changing a distance between the reaction portion                                    (50)
   and an inner wall of the channel                   (60),      so that     nutrients
   in   the raw material substance                 (91)    and the enzymes             (92)
   are crushed into powders having suitable                         sizes under the
15 effect       of an external force.            Moreover,        the enzymes          (92)
   are activatedby          the externalforce.            Finally, the powdered
   raw material substance              (91)     and the enzymes            (92)    may be
   removed by using the output portion                          (40) .    During use,
   the temperature and humidity in                    the chamber          (21)     can be
20 monitored and adjusted by using the control portion (80)
   to maintain stable           environmental factors,              so as to prevent
   the activity of the raw material substance or enzymes
   from being damaged.
         As can be seen according to the foregoing description,
25 the NUFIT system disclosed in                  the present invention has
   the following advantages:
         First,     a reaction      portion can be used to provide                       an

                                                 6
   external f orce, so that             not only nutrients       in a rawmaterial
   substance and enzymes can be made into                  a powdered substance,
   but also enzymes can be activated,                    thereby achieving the
   effect of      improving the              nutritional      value and enzyme
 5 activity.
         Second, anti-nutritional                 ingredients or toxins in the
   raw material substance can be eliminated. Not only the
   nutritional value of a produced powdered substance is
   effectively improved, but                    also ingredients that            cause
10 undesirable flavor or taste                    can be eliminated,         thereby
   achieving the effect of enhancing taste.
         Third,    the     reaction          temperature       and     humidity     is
   precisely     controlled,            so that    a powdered substance having
   stable quality can be produced.
15       The foregoing          is  merely detailed         description        of the
   present      invention           with      reference      to    the   preferred
   embodiments.        Any simple modification or variation                       made
   in   an aspect      such as the configuration                 of a regulation
   portion      and     a    nutrient           conversion      portion      to    the
20 embodiments in         the specification             by a person skilled         in
   the art   without departing from the spirit                      of the present
   invention shall          all    fall     within the patent scope of this
