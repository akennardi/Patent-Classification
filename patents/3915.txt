   Example embodiments relate to methods of treating a cancer in a patient in need
   thereof. The methods comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount
 5 of a compound represented by Formula I (i.e. compound 3039-0164):
                                                 OH

                      Formula I.
   Example embodiments relate to methods of treating cancer in a patient in need
10 thereof. The methods comprise diagnosing the patient having a cancer with
   overexpressed      protein  arginine  methyltransferases; and  administering  a
   therapeutically effective amount of a compound represented by Formula I to the
   patient to treat the cancer.
15 Example embodiments relate to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a
   compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The compound is
   represented by I.
   In one example embodiment, the cancer is lymphomas, breast cancer, lung
20 cancer, colorectal cancer or glioblastoma. In a further embodiment for example,
   the lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In yet another example
   embodiment, the lung cancer is lung adenocarcinoma.
                                            5

   In one example embodiment, the cancer has overexpressed protein arginine
   methyltransferases (PRMTs). In a further embodiment for example, the protein
   arginine methyltransferase is protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). In
   yet another example embodiment, Formula I inhibits PRMT5.
 5
   PRMTs are a class of enzymes that transfer a methyl group from the cofactor S
   adenosylmethionine (SAM) onto arginine omega nitrogen of substrate protein
   especially for histone. Based on product specificity, PRMTs can be divided into
   three subclasses: type I, II and          III, which asymmetrically dimethylate,
10 symmetrically dimethylate, and monomethylate their substrates, respectively.
   PRMT5 as a type II PRMT, catalyzes the symmetrical dimethylation of arginine
   residues of histone, and plays multiple roles in cellular processes including
   differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and ribosome biogenesis. For instance,
   PRMT5-driven methylation of arginine residues leads to symmetric dimethylation
15 of histone H3 (H3R8me2s), which in turn alters chromatin structure to promote
   transcriptional repression.
   Example 1
20 Material and Methods
   1. Cell culture and cell viability assays
   Cell lines A549 and H460 were purchased from ATCC and cultivated in RPMI
   1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, Big Cabin, Oklahoma, ME,
25 USA), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution and maintained at 370 C in a C02
   incubator with 5% C02. Compound 3039-0164 was dissolved in DMSO and
   stored at -40 OC. Cells were seeded on a 96-well microplate with 3,000 cells/well,
   cultured overnight for cell adhesion, and treated with DMSO or various
   concentrations of compound 3039-0164 for 72 hours. Then, each well was
30 added with 10 plL MTT (5 mg/mL) and incubated for 4 hours at 30 C, followed by
   adding 100 pL acidic isopropanol (10% SDS and 0.01 mol/L HCI). Finally, an
                                             6

   absorbance at 570 nm was measured by a microplate reader (Tecan, Morrisville,
   NC, USA). Cell viability was calculated relative to untreated controls, with results
   based on at least three independent experiments.
 5 2. In vitro enzymatic assays
   PRMT5 enzymatic assay was carried out by Shanghai ChemPartner Co. (998
   Halei Road, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, 201203, China). To measure IC5o
   values, 10 concentrations of compound 3039-0164 were tested. PRMT5 was
   purchased from BPS bioscience (Cat. No. 51045), and SAM/SAH were
10 purchased from Sigma. Inc (Cat. No. A7007-100MG and No. A9384-25MG).
   Compound 3039-0164 was prepared as 10 mM stock in DMSO and diluted to
   final concentration in DMSO. PRMT5 and substrates were incubated with
   indicated concentrations of compounds in a 384-well plate for 60 minutes at
   room temperature. Then, acceptor and donor solutions were added to label the
15 residual substrates of PRMT5. The labeling process lasted for 60 minutes at
   room temperature, followed by reading endpoint with EnSpire Plate Reader with
   Alpha mode (PerkinElmer).
   3. Western blot analysis
20 Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer containing
   protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 minutes
   (at 12,000 g, 4  oC), and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations
   were determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia, PA, USA).
   Equal amounts of protein (50 pg) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and
25 transferred to a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane at 300 mA and 40 C for 1 h. The
   membrane was incubated with primary antibody (1:1000), and then with a
   fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10000). GAPDH was used as
   the loading control and for normalization. The signal of membranes was scanned
   with LI-COR Odessy scanner (Befast, ME, USA).

   4. Molecular docking
                                            7

   Molecular docking calculation is performed to study the interaction between
   Formula I and PRMT5. A crystal structure of PRMT5 complexed with SAM and
   EPZ015666 (PDB ID:4x61) was used for modeling a binding mode between
   Formula I and PRMT5. After the preparation for this complex with Prep Wiz in
 5 Maestro (version 10.2, Schrodinger), a grid file was generated based on the
   position of EPZ015666 in Grid Generation wizard for docking. Formula I was
   then preprocessed by LigPrep under OPLS-2005 force field, and the low-energy
   three dimensional conformers were created. Finally, Glide with the standard
   precision (SP) scoring mode was used to dock Formula I into PRMT5 binding
10 pocket. The pose with the lowest docking score was chosen for further binding
   mode analysis.
   5. Statistical analysis
   Descriptive    analytical data were    presented as means        ± SEM. Multiple
15 comparisons were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using
   Graph Prim 5.0. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Example 2
20 1. Compound 3039-0164 inhibits cell proliferation of NSCLC cells
   Two human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, A549 and H460, were
   treated with an increasing concentration (0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 pM) of
   compound 3039-0164 for 72 hours, and then cell viability was determined by
   MTT assay. As shown in Figure 2a and Figure 2b, the cell viability of A549 and
25 H460 were both decreased by compound 3039-0164 in a dose-dependent
   manner. Table 1 shows that the inhibition concentration (IC50) values of
   compound 3039-0164 on cell lines A459 and H460 are 7.79 ± 1.80 and 8.64 ±
   1.46 pM,      respectively. It suggested that compound 3039-0164 exhibited
   significantly cytotoxic effect on NSCLC A549 and H460 cells.

   2. Compound 3039-0164 inhibits the methyltransferase activity of PRMT5
   To investigate the influence of compound 3039-0164 on enzymatic activity and
   its "on-target" effect, AlphaLISA assay was carried out. The result showed that
 5 compound 3039-0164 inhibited PRMT5 enzyme activity in a dose-dependent
   manner as shown in Figure 3, and IC5o value thereof was 63.2 ± 4.5 pM,
   indicating   that it possessed the directly inhibitory function for     PRMT5
   methyltransferase.
10 3. Compound 3039-0164 decreases the symmetric dimethylation level of histone
   3 (H3R8me2s).
   PRMT5-driven methylation of arginine residues lead to H3R8me2s. H3R8me2s
   expression in A549 cells was measured with or without compound 3039-0164
   respectively by western blot analysis. After the treatment of compound 3039
15 0164 for 24 h, H3R8me2s expression was significantly decreased, as shown in
   Figure 4, indirectly reflecting that compound 3039-0164 inhibits PRMT5
   methyltransferase activity.
   4.   Compound      3039-0164    down-regulates   oncogene  FGFR3     and elF4E
20 expression.
   FGFR3 and elF4E play key roles in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. PRMT5
   exerts its function by regulating the expression of target genes, including
   oncogene FGFR3 and elF4E. To evaluate the effect of compound 3039-0164 on
   FGFR3 /elF4E, protein expression levels of two target genes in A549 cells with
25 or without compound 3039-0164 treatment were monitored respectively. Figure 5
   showed that FGFR3 and elF4E expression levels were significantly decreased in
   A549 cells after being treated with 10 pM compound 3039-0164 for 24 hours,
                                            9

   indicating that compound 3039-0164 down-regulates           FGFR3 and elF4E
   expression by inhibiting PRMT5.
   5. Compound 3039-0164 suppresses the activation of AKT, ERK and motor.
 5 FGFR3 is one of the receptors that promote cell survival by stimulating
   P13K/AKT/mTOR signaling, and can activate AKT and ERK in human cancers.
   The effect of compound 3039-0164 on the activation of AKT, ERK and mTOR in
   A549 cell was measured by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6,
   compound 3039-0164 significantly decreased the levels of phosphorylated AKT,
10 ERK and mTOR in A549 cell. The results implied that compound 3039-0164
   suppressed the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK signaling in NSCLC cell.
   6. Binding mode of compound 3039-0164 inhibitor and PRMT5 protein
   A crystal structure 101 of PRMT5 complexed with SAM and EPZ015666 (PDB
15 ID:4x61) was used for modeling a binding mode between Formula I and PRMT5.
   The result from molecular docking calculation showed that compound 3039-0164
   binds to PRMT5 with a low glide score of -9.26 kcal/mol. When interacting with
   PRMT5, compound 3039-0164 buried in a hydrophobic pocket composed of
   Tyr307, Phe327, Lys333, Glu435 and Phe580, as shown in the conformation
20 102 of Figure 1b. Comparing the conformation 102 of compound 3039-0164 with
   the conformation 103 of the co-crystalized EPZ015666 (shown in Figure 1c), it
   was found that compound          3039-0164     adopted similar conformation to
   EZP015666 in the complex. Apart from the hydrogen bond with residue Phe580
   as observed in EPZ015666-PRMT5 complex, compound 3039-0164 also formed
25 three additional hydrogen bonds with Tyr307, Lys333 and Glu435. Additional
   hydrogen bonds indicates a stronger affinity to PRMT5 and thus a more potent
   inhibitor.
