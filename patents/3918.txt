    FORMULATIONS FOR STABILIZING MOISTURE IN MUSCLE FOODS
                                RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]      This application claims the benefit of, and priority to, U.S. Provisional
    Application No. 61/867,862, filed August 20, 2013, which is incorporated herein by
    reference in its entirety.
                                      BACKGROUND
[0002]      Juiciness and tenderness are quality attributes of muscle foods that are highly
    discriminated by consumers in judging a quality muscle food product. These attributes
    are very highly dependent on the amount of water in the muscle at the time the food is
    consumed. All processing steps in the conversion of a live animal muscle into an edible
    product create a stress factor which results in the loss of moisture from the muscle in the
    form of "drip" in frozen and thawed products, "purge" in raw meats stored under
    refrigeration, and in cooking loss when the raw muscle is heated prior to serving. In the
    case of "ready to eat" meats, moisture loss is particularly egregious since there will be no
    further chance of introducing additional moisture such as simmering in a sauce or
    addition of gravy prior to serving.
[0003]      Improved methods for minimizing moisture loss in muscle food products are
    needed.
                                        SUMMARY
                                              1

[0004]      The present invention is related to formulations for stabilizing moisture in muscle
    foods, such as meat, poultry and seafood, and methods for making the same. The
    formulations have a predetermined pH and/or ionic strength, and can function to
    solubilize muscle proteins. In preferred embodiments, formulations according to the
    present invention are phosphate-free and/or contain all natural ingredients.
[0005]      In one aspect, the invention provides a phosphate-free composition for stabilizing
    moisture in muscle foods, prepared from lemon juice and vinegar, comprising acetate salt
    and citrate salt in an aqueous solution having a pH greater than 7.5 and an ionic strength
    greater than 0.2.
[0006]      In some embodiments, the composition comprises sodium acetate, potassium
    acetate, sodium citrate, and potassium citrate.
[0007]      In some embodiments, the composition comprises 5 parts of an equal mix of
    sodium acetate and potassium acetate to 1 part of an equal mix of sodium citrate and
    potassium citrate.
[0008]      In some embodiments, the composition comprises 10 parts of an equal mix of
    sodium acetate and potassium acetate to 1 part of an equal mix of sodium citrate and
    potassium citrate.
[0009]      In some embodiments, the acetate salt comprises 300 grain vinegar neutralized
    with a neutralizing agent comprising sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate.
[0010]      In some embodiments, the citrate salt comprises 400 gpl lemon concentrate
    neutralized with a neutralizing agent comprising sodium bicarbonate and potassium
    bicarbonate.
[0011]      In some embodiments, the composition has an ionic strength of 0.2 to 0.5.
                                              2

[0012]      In some embodiments, the composition has a pH of 8.5 to 9.8.
[0013]      In some embodiments, the composition has a pH of 9.0 ± 0.3.
[0014]      Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described further
    below. This summary section is meant merely to illustrate certain features of
    embodiments of the invention, and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention in any
    way. The failure to discuss a specific feature or embodiment of the invention, or the
    inclusion of one or more features in this summary section, should not be construed to
    limit the invention.
                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0015]      Moisture is lost from muscle foods primarily because of protein denaturation. The
    helical structure of a protein molecule permits the entrapment of water in the helical
    protein structure and the twists and turns in the helix further create additional spaces
    within the molecule to hold water. However, denaturation of proteins is a process where
    the helical primary structure unfolds, thereby eliminating the spaces in the native protein
    structure, and hydrophobic bonds are formed between adjacent protein molecules to
    cause them to attach to each other, further eliminating space for water molecules and
    "squeezing" water out of the molecule. Thus, moisture stabilizing agents can be used to
    act as "stents" separating adjacent molecules from each other and minimize the squeezing
    effect as the protein molecule aggregation process is minimized.
[0016]      Over the last 50 years, food processors have found the usefulness of phosphates in
    ajuvenating the texture of protein foods. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists
    several phosphate additives including sodium acid pyrophosphate, tetrasodium
                                              3

   pyrophosphate, and sodium tripolyphosphate as GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe) in
    Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 121, paragraph 121.101 (D). The U.S.
    Department of Agriculture (USDA), in addition, has allowed several phosphate types to
    decrease the amount of cooked out juices in various cooked meat products in Code of
    Federal Regulations Title 9 Paragraph 318.7(4). Phosphates are also used widely in fish
    and shellfish. Some advantages of treating fish and shellfish with phosphates include
    improvements in color, texture and taste.
[0017]      In spite of the allowance by the U.S. regulatory agencies of the use of phosphates
    in muscle foods, there has been a growing trend of consumers rejecting products that
    declare phosphates on the label. Some adverse physiological effects have been reported
    in animal studies (e.g., R. H. Ellinger's book Phosphates as FoodIngredients, CRC Press
    1971, which described kidney damage and calcification of soft tissues as adverse effects
    of excess phosphates in the diet of laboratory animals). Although no such effects have
    been reported in humans, there are consumers who are concerned and/or who are very
    sensitive to phosphates (e.g., in whom contact of a phosphate muscle food with the
    tongue can elicit an astringent response and a dryness in the mouth and throat which
    persists long after the food is swallowed).
[0018]      Because of these potentially adverse responses by consumers on examining food
    labels and in consumption of phosphate treated food, food processors have been looking
    for an alternative to phosphates as a means of stabilizing moisture in food. A recent
    action by the European Union banning the importation into the European Union of
   phosphate-treated scallops and shrimp is another motivation for the industry to look for
    alternatives to the use of phosphates in stabilizing moisture in muscle foods.
                                               4

[0019]     Several phosphate replacers have been advertised in the trade magazines. For
   meats and poultry, existing formulations have involved the use of starches and
   hydrocolloids as a component of marinades injected into the whole muscle. The mode of
   action of this type of formulation is a retention of fluids by the starch or hydrocolloid in
   the muscle, and there is no effect on the protein itself. These effects are in contrast to the
   action of phosphates, which promote salt soluble protein extraction and act as a "stent"
   preventing the aggregation of denatured muscle protein.
[0020]     Formulations that can minimize the aggregation of denatured muscle protein
   and/or enhance the solubilization of myofibrillar proteins in a manner similar to
   phosphates, but which are phosphate-free and do not have the negative features
   associated with phosphates, are needed in the art.
[0021]     Embodiments of the present invention identify that: (1) an elevated alkaline pH;
   and (2) an increase in ionic strength, are both individually and in combination, important
   factors that promote and permit relatively greater amount of myofibrillar protein
   solubilization, thereby increasing the ability of proteins to prevent muscle from exuding
   water. The solubility of proteins in an aqueous solution is a function of pH. At pH higher
   than the isoelectric point of the protein, solubility increases with an increase in pH.
   Similarly, the solubility of proteins also increases with an increase in ionic strength up to
   a point when excessive salts dehydrate the protein leading to aggregation. Thus,
   formulations according to the present invention preferably have an alkaline pH (e.g., a pH
   of about 7.5 to 11.0, preferably about 8.5 to 9.8) and include salts adequate to elevate the
   ionic strength to a range of about 0.2 to 1.0 (preferably about 0.2 to 0.5).
                                               5

[0022]      Another trend in the food industry is the increasing number of consumers who
    read food product labels and increasing awareness of these consumers of components
    having health benefits and those which might have adverse long term health effects. The
    ideal label statement must not only be truthful, but also would be perceived as healthful.
    Another trend in the industry is the use of ingredients which consumers are already
    familiar with, such as those commonly seen in household kitchens. Label statements with
    minimal declared components would be considered as "clean label" and "consumer
    friendly". Thus, formulations according to the present invention preferably support a
    "clean and consumer friendly" label statement.
[0023]      In some embodiments, plum juice concentrate may be used in addition to or in
    place of lemon in the formulations. Plums or the dried form, prunes, are distingushable
    among the fruits because of their high concentration of the sugar alcohol, sorbitol.
    Sorbitol is a hexa poly-ol, where one hydroxyl group (-OH) is attached to each of the six
    carbons in the glucose molecule. It is highly hydrophilic and binds very well with
    proteins. The acidity of plum juice is relatively low compared to that of lemon therefore
    there is no need to neutralize the acid when used in the formulations. Plum concentrates
    also contain a high concentration of soluble fibers that has a very high water holding
    capacity. The well- known mild laxative activity of prune juice can be attributed to the
    ability of the fibers to retain water and when combined with the hydrophilic nature of the
    alcohol sugar, it is very effective in loosening the bolus for easy transport through the gut
    in the lower large intestines of the human body. Plum juice also has some protein which
    contributes to the water holding capacity. The combination of hydrophilic components
    with high affinity for proteins, other high water holding capacity components in a high
                                                6

   pH environment surrounding proteins, and high ionic strength results in an effective
    system for stabilizing moisture in muscle foods.
[0024]      Some embodiments of the invention comprise formulations that permit the use of
    only two ingredients on the label: vinegar and lemon juice. Both these components are
    very familiar to consumers. In some embodiments, in order to raise the pH to the alkaline
    range, both the vinegar and the lemon juice are neutralized with a neutralizing agent.
    Vinegar is neutralized to near neutral pH (e.g., pH 6.7-7.0). Adding an excess of the
    neutralizing agent to obtain a pH greater than 7.0 is not preferred, as it would result in the
    precipitation of the excess neutralizing agent on standing, leaving an impression to the
    user that the product is not homogeneous and the product composition could vary when
    different portions of a container containing the product is removed for use in a process.
    The lemon juice is also neutralized, preferably to a pH of 7.0. Since in some
    embodiments the salt in the completely neutralized lemon juice is trisodium citrate and a
    1% w/v   solution of this salt in water has a pH around 7.8, ending the neutralization
    process at a pH of 7.0 is preferred, as it would leave a small amount of the last carboxylic
    acid moiety in the citrate molecule as un-neutralized, thus avoiding having an excess of
    neutralizing agent in the neutralized lemon.
[0025]      A variety of neutralizing agents may be used. In certain embodiments, the
    neutralizing agent is a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate. The use
    of two bicarbonate salts, and in particular potassium bicarbonate, avoids the
    crystallization of sodium acetate or sodium citrate on storage. Crystallization is to be
    avoided not only because it creates the appearance of non-homogeneity, but also because
    salt crystals removed from solution no longer contribute to the ionic strength, thus
                                                7

    impairing the functionality of the product for protein solubilization. Use of potassium
    bicarbonate also reduces the sodium levels in the product making the product suitable for
    low sodium formulations desired by product developers for consumer products. The
    mixture may comprise, for example, 10-90% sodium bicarbonate with the balance (to
    100%) comprising potassium bicarbonate. In some embodiments, the neutralizing agent
    comprises equal parts sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate.
[0026]       In some embodiments, the formulation is a solution that has a pH of 7.5-9.5 and
    consists of about 5 parts neutralized vinegar to about 1 part neutralized lemon, for use on
    meat, poultry and seafood products. In other embodiments, the formulation is a solution
    that has a pH 8.5-11.0 and consists of about 10 parts neutralized vinegar to about 1 part
    neutralized lemon, for less flavor impact.
[0027]       The ionic strength of a solution is the sum of the product of the molar
    concentration of ionic species in the solution multiplied by the square of the ionic charge.
    If Ci is the molar concentration of ionic species i, and Zi is the charge of ionic species i,
    then:
                                  Ionic Strength = 0.5X(Ci*Zi 2)
[0028]       In the illustrative formulations described herein, comprising neutralized vinegar
    and neutralized lemon, each neutralized with a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and
    potassium bicarbonate, the following ionic species exist: Na", K-", (Acetate)-, and
    (Citrate)-3 .
[0029]       Both sodium and potassium acetate are derived from the acetic acid in vinegar.
    Both potassium and sodium citrate are derived from the citric acid in the lemon
    component. In some embodiments, the concentrated form of the acetic acid is 300 grain
                                                 8

   vinegar. In some embodiments, the concentrated form of the citric acid is 400 gpl lemon
    concentrate. Formulations using such concentrated forms have been determined by the
    Applicants to possess adequate ionic strength to facilitate solubilization of myofibrillar
    proteins in muscle when combined with the high pH of the solution.
[0030]      By experimentation and observations on precipitation of unsolubilized salts,
    Applicants found that adding enough water to lower the vinegar concentration from 300
    grain to 185 grain can give the storage stability needed to prevent crystallization and
    precipitation of undissolved salts.
[0031]      The amount of water preferably added to the mixture of neutralized vinegar and
    neutralized lemon can be based on the amount of vinegar used in the formulation. For
    every 100 pounds of vinegar that was neutralized and used in making the formulation, the
    amount of water can be calculated as follows:
                           Water added  =  [(100*0.3)/0.185] - 100.
[0032]      In certain exemplary embodiments, an all-natural phosphate replacer (NPR)
    according to the present invention may be prepared as follows.
[0033]      Formula:
            Vinegar, 300 grain (30% w/v or 28.8% w/w acetic acid) = 100 lbs
            Neutralizing agent Potassium Bicarbonate = 25 to 30 lbs
            Neutralizing agent Sodium Bicarbonate = 25 to 30 lbs
            Water  =  62.2 lbs
            Neutralized lemon  =  37.2 lbs
[0034]      Neutralize 100 lbs vinegar using 20.04 to 22.82 lbs potassium bicarbonate and the
    same amount of sodium bicarbonate. pH should not exceed 7.0 and neutralized solution
    should not contain any precipitate of undissolved sodium bicarbonate and potassium
    bicarbonate. There should be about 185.8 lbs of neutralized vinegar. Set aside.
                                               9

[0035]      Neutralize 31 lbs of 400 gpl lemon concentrate using 3.425 lbs each of sodium
    bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate. Filter if necessary and desired to remove any
    suspended matter. There should be 37.2 lbs of neutralized lemon concentrate. Set aside.
[0036]      Prepare pH adjuster by heating 62.2 lbs water to 90 'C and adding 5 lbs each of
    sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate. Mix until all salts have dissolved.
    Solution should be clear. Cool to room temperature.
[0037]      Mix neutralized vinegar, neutralized lemon concentrate, and pH adjuster. Measure
    pH after 2 hours of mixing. pH should be 8.7 ± 0.3.
[0038]      Differences in the structure, composition and natural pH of seafood such as
    scallops and shrimp from those of meats have been found to require a higher pH for the
    phosphate replacer to be effective for seafood. It has been determined that the pH for the
    phosphate replacer for seafood should be at least 8.5, preferably at least 9.0.
[0039]      In other exemplary embodiments, a high-pH NPR according to the present
    invention may be prepared as follows.
[0040]      Formula:
            Vinegar, 300 grain (30 % w/v or 28.8% w/w acetic acid)    =  100 lbs
            Neutralizing agent Potassium Bicarbonate = 25 to 30 lbs
            Neutralizing agent Sodium Bicarbonate = 25 to 30 lbs
            Water = 62.2 lbs
            Neutralized lemon = 18.6 lbs
[0041]      Neutralize 100 lbs vinegar using 20.04 to 22.82 lbs potassium bicarbonate and the
    same amount of sodium bicarbonate. Preferably, pH should not exceed 7.0 and
    neutralized solution should not contain any precipitate of undissolved sodium bicarbonate
    and potassium bicarbonate. There should be 185.8 lbs of neutralized vinegar. Set aside.
                                             10

[0042]     Neutralize 15.5 lbs of 400 gpl lemon concentrate using 3.425 lbs each of sodium
   bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate. Filter if necessary to remove any suspended
   matter. There should be 18.6 lbs of neutralized lemon concentrate. Set aside.
[0043]     Prepare pH adjuster by heating 62.2 lbs water to 90 'C and adding 5 lbs each of
   sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate. Mix until all salts have dissolved.
   Solution should be clear. Cool to room temperature.
[0044]     Mix neutralized vinegar, neutralized lemon concentrate and pH adjuster. Measure
   pH after 2 hours of mixing. pH should be 9.3 ± 0.3.

   tumbler, where it was mixed under vacuum (20 PSI) for 5 minutes. The seasoning and
    onions were then added in and mixed under vacuum (20 PSI) for 5 minutes. The meat
    was then divided into 6 lb portions in Cooking Bags (MQ 85 from M&Q Packaging
    Corporation), sealed, and subjected to a blast freeze.
[0052]      No difference in cook yield was found between the control product with
   phosphate and the test product with natural phosphate replacer (68% yield for both
    products).

[00551          Table 4 shows results of soaking fresh scallops in a solution that contains vinegar
buffered to a pH of 6.0 and plum juice concentrate at different levels.
[0056]          In Test 1, the soak solution contains deionized water, 2.50%plum juice
concentrate. In Test 2 the soak solution was deionized water containing 5.0 % plum juice
concentrate. In Test 3, the soak solution contained 2.5% plum concentrate and 2.5% 300 grain
vinegar buffered to a pH of 6.0 and in Test 4, the soak solution contained 5.0% plum juice
concentrate and 2.5% 300 grain vinegar buffered to pH of 6.0. In Test 5, the soak solution was
deionized water containing a mixture of citrate salts now used in the seafood industry for soaking
scallops prior to freezing.

[00571          The plum juice concentrate solution at 2.5% out-performed all the other test
solutions including Test 2 which contained 5.0% plum juice concentrate. The combined buffered
300 grain vinegar and plum juice concentrate at 2.50% each ranked second in terms of weight
gain. These results indicate that the acidity of the soak solutions due to the higher concentration

of the plum juice concentrate and the acetic acid in the buffered 300 grain vinegar could decrease
water holding by scallops.
