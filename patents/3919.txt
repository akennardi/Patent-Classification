                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   1.      Field of the Invention.
           The present invention relates to compositions for use in
20 refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat pump systems wherein the
   composition comprises a fluoroolefin and at least one other component.
   The compositions of the present invention are useful in processes for
   producing cooling or heat, as heat transfer fluids, foam blowing agents,

25 2.      Description of Related Art.
           The refrigeration industry has been working for the past few
   decades to find replacement refrigerants for the ozone depleting
   chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) being
   phased out as a result of the Montreal Protocol. The solution for most
30 refrigerant producers has been the commercialization of
   hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants. The new HFC refrigerants, HFC
   134a being the most widely used at this time, have zero ozone depletion
   potential and thus are not affected by the current regulatory phase out as
   a result of the Montreal Protocol.
35         Further environmental regulations may ultimately cause global
   phase out of certain HFC refrigerants. Currently, the automobile industry
   is facing regulations relating to global warming potential for refrigerants
                                          2

   used in mobile air-conditioning. Therefore, there is a great current need
   to identify new refrigerants with reduced global warming potential for the
   mobile air-conditioning market. Should the regulations be more broadly
   applied in the future, an even greater need will be felt for refrigerants that
 5 can be used in all areas of the refrigeration and air-conditioning industry.
            Currently proposed replacement refrigerants for HFC-134a include
   HFC-152a, pure hydrocarbons such as butane or propane, or "natural"
   refrigerants such as C02. Many of these suggested replacements are
   toxic, flammable, and/or have low energy efficiency. Therefore, new
10 alternative refrigerants are being sought.
            The present invention seeks to provide novel refrigerant
   compositions and heat transfer fluid compositions that provide unique
   characteristics to meet the demands of low or zero ozone depletion
   potential and lower global warming potential as compared to current
15 refrigerants.

               The most preferred compositions of the present invention listed in
      Table 2 are generally expected to maintain the desired properties and
      functionality when the components are present in the concentrations as
 5    listed +/- 2 weight percent. The compositions containing C02 would be
      expected to maintain the desired properties and functionality when the
      C02 was present at the listed concentration +/- 0.2 weight percent.
               The compositions of the present invention may be azeotropic or
      near-azeotropic compositions. By azeotropic composition is meant a
10    constant-boiling mixture of two or more substances that behave as a
      single substance. One way to characterize an azeotropic composition is
      that the vapor produced by partial evaporation or distillation of the liquid
      has the same composition as the liquid from which it is evaporated or
      distilled, i.e., the mixture distills/refluxes without compositional change.
15    Constant-boiling compositions are characterized as azeotropic because
      they exhibit either a maximum or minimum boiling point, as compared with
      that of the non-azeotropic mixture of the same compounds. An azeotropic
      composition will not fractionate within a refrigeration or air conditioning
      system during operation, which may reduce efficiency of the system.
20    Additionally, an azeotropic composition will not fractionate upon leakage
      from a refrigeration or air conditioning system. In the situation where one
      component of a mixture is flammable, fractionation during leakage could
      lead to a flammable composition either within the system or outside of the
      system.
25             A near-azeotropic composition (also commonly referred to as an
      "azeotrope-like composition") is a substantially constant boiling liquid
      admixture of two or more substances that behaves essentially as a single
      substance. One way to characterize a near-azeotropic composition is that
      the vapor produced by partial evaporation or distillation of the liquid has
                                                 21

      substantially the same composition as the liquid from which it was
      evaporated or distilled, that is, the admixture distills/refluxes without
      substantial composition change. Another way to characterize a near
      azeotropic composition is that the bubble point vapor pressure and the
 5    dew point vapor pressure of the composition at a particular temperature
      are substantially the same. Herein, a composition is near-azeotropic if,
      after 50 weight percent of the composition is removed, such as by
      evaporation or boiling off, the difference in vapor pressure between the
      original composition and the composition remaining after 50 weight
10    percent of the original composition has been removed is less than about
      10 percent.
              Azeotropic compositions of the present invention at a specified
      temperature are shown in Table 3.

                Certain of the compositions of the present invention are non
   azeotropic compositions. Those compositions of the present invention
   falling within the preferred ranges of Table 2, but outside of the near
 5 azeotropic ranges of Table 5 and Table 6 may be considered to be non
   azeotropic.
                A non-azeotropic composition may have certain advantages
   over azetropic or near azeotropic mixtures. A non-azeotropic composition
   is a mixture of two or more substances that behaves as a mixture rather
10 than a single substance. One way to characterize a non-azeotropic
   composition is that the vapor produced by partial evaporation or distillation
   of the liquid has a substantially different composition as the liquid from
   which it was evaporated or distilled, that is, the admixture distills/refluxes
   with substantial composition change. Another way to characterize a non
15 azeotropic composition is that the bubble point vapor pressure and the
   dew point vapor pressure of the composition at a particular temperature
                                           31

   are substantially different. Herein, a composition is non-azeotropic if, after
   50 weight percent of the composition is removed, such as by evaporation
   or boiling off, the difference in vapor pressure between the original
   composition and the composition remaining after 50 weight percent of the
 5 original composition has been removed is greater than about 10 percent.
                The compositions of the present invention may be prepared by
   any convenient method to combine the desired amounts of the individual
   components. A preferred method is to weigh the desired component
   amounts and thereafter combine the components in an appropriate vessel.
10 Agitation may be used, if desired.
                An alternative means for making compositions of the present
   invention may be a method for making a refrigerant blend composition,
   wherein said refrigerant blend composition comprises a composition as
   disclosed herein, said method comprising (i) reclaiming a volume of one or
15 more components of a refrigerant composition from at least one refrigerant
   container, (ii) removing impurities sufficiently to enable reuse of said one
   or more of the reclaimed components, (iii) and optionally, combining all or
   part of said reclaimed volume of components with at least one additional
   refrigerant composition or component.
20         A refrigerant container may be any container in which is stored a
   refrigerant blend composition that has been used in a refrigeration
   apparatus, air-conditioning apparatus or heat pump apparatus. Said
   refrigerant container may be the refrigeration apparatus, air-conditioning
   apparatus or heat pump apparatus in which the refrigerant blend was
25 used. Additionally, the refrigerant container may be a storage container
   for collecting reclaimed refrigerant blend components, including but not
   limited to pressurized gas cylinders.
           Residual refrigerant means any amount of refrigerant blend or
   refrigerant blend component that may be moved out of the refrigerant
30 container by any method known for transferring refrigerant blends or
   refrigerant blend components.
           Impurities may be any component that is in the refrigerant blend or
   refrigerant blend component due to its use in a refrigeration apparatus, air
   conditioning apparatus or heat pump apparatus. Such impurities include
35 but are not limited to refrigeration lubricants, being those described earlier
   herein, particulates including but not limited to metal, metal salt or
   elastomer particles, that may have come out of the refrigeration apparatus,
                                          32

   air-conditioning apparatus or heat pump apparatus, and any other
   contaminants that may adversely effect the performance of the refrigerant
   blend composition.
           Such impurities may be removed sufficiently to allow reuse of the
 5 refrigerant blend or refrigerant blend component without adversely
   effecting the performance or equipment within which the refrigerant blend
   or refrigerant blend component will be used.
           It may be necessary to provide additional refrigerant blend or
   refrigerant blend component to the residual refrigerant blend or refrigerant
10 blend component in order to produce a composition that meets the
   specifications required for a given product. For instance, if a refrigerant
   blend has 3 components in a particular weight percentage range, it may
   be necessary to add one or more of the components in a given amount in
   order to restore the composition to within the specification limits.
15         Compositions of the present invention have zero or low ozone
   depletion potential and low global warming potential (GWP). Additionally,
   the compositions of the present invention will have global warming
   potentials that are less than many hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants currently
   in use. One aspect of the present invention is to provide a refrigerant with
20 a global warming potential of less than 1000, less than 500, less than 150,
   less than 100, or less than 50. Another aspect of the present invention is
   to reduce the net GWP of refrigerant mixtures by adding fluoroolefins to
   said mixtures.
           The compositions of the present invention may be useful as low
25 global warming potential (GWP) replacements for currently used
   refrigerants, including but not limited to R134a (or HFC-134a, 1,1,1,2
   tetrafluoroethane), R22 (or HCFC-22, chlorodifluoromethane), R123 (or
   HFC-123, 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane), R11 (CFC-11,
   fluorotrichloromethane), R12 (CFC-12, dichlorodifluoromethane), R245fa

   dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane), R236fa (or HFC-236fa, 1,1,1,3,3,3
   hexafluoropropane), R124 (or HCFC-1 24, 2-chloro-1,1,1,2
   tetrafluoroethane), R407C (ASHRAE designation for a blend of 52 weight

35 weight percent R32 (difluoromethane), R410A (ASHRAE designation for a
   blend of 50 weight percent R125 and 50 weight percent R32), R417A,

   (ASHRAE designation for a blend of 85.1 weight percent R125, 11.5
   weight percent R134a, and 3.4 weight percent isobutane), R404A,
   (ASHRAE designation for a blend of 44 weight percent R125, 52 weight
 5 percent R143a (1,1,1-trifluoroethane), and 4.0 weight percent R134a) and
   R507A (ASHRAE designation for a blend of 50 weight percent R125 and
   50 weight percent R143a). Additionally, the compositions of the present
   invention may be useful as replacements for R12 (CFC-12,
   dichlorodifluoromethane) or R502 (ASHRAE designation for a blend of
10 51.2 weight percent CFC-1 15 (chloropentafluoroethane) and 48.8 weight
   percent HCFC-22).
           Often replacement refrigerants are most useful if capable of being
   used in the original refrigeration equipment designed for a different
   refrigerant. The compositions of the present invention may be useful as
15 replacements for the above-mentioned refrigerants in original equipment.
   Additionally, the compositions of the present invention may be useful as
   replacements for the above mentioned refrigerants in equipment designed
   to use the above-mentioned refrigerants.
           The compositions of the present invention may further comprise a
20 lubricant.
           Lubricants of the present invention comprise refrigeration
   lubricants, i.e. those lubricants suitable for use with refrigeration, air
   conditioning, or heat pump apparatus. Among these lubricants are those
   conventionally used in compression refrigeration apparatus utilizing
25 chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants. Such lubricants and their properties are
   discussed in the 1990 ASHRAE Handbook, Refrigeration Systems and
   Applications, chapter 8, titled "Lubricants in Refrigeration Systems", pages
   8.1 through 8.21. Lubricants of the present invention may comprise those
   commonly known as "mineral oils" in the field of compression refrigeration
30 lubrication. Mineral oils comprise paraffins (i.e. straight-chain and
   branched-carbon-chain, saturated hydrocarbons), naphthenes (i.e. cyclic
   paraffins) and aromatics (i.e. unsaturated, cyclic hydrocarbons containing
   one or more rings characterized by alternating double bonds). Lubricants
   of the present invention further comprise those commonly known as
35 "synthetic oils" in the field of compression refrigeration lubrication.
   Synthetic oils comprise alkylaryls (i.e. linear and branched alkyl
   alkylbenzenes), synthetic paraffins and napthenes, and poly(alphaolefins).
                                          34

   Representative conventional lubricants of the present invention are the
   commercially available BVM 100 N (paraffinic mineral oil sold by BVA
   Oils), Suniso@ 3GS and Suniso@ 5GS (naphthenic mineral oil sold by
   Crompton Co.), Sontex@ 372LT (naphthenic mineral oil sold by Pennzoil),
 5 Calumet@ RO-30 (naphthenic mineral oil sold by Calumet Lubricants),
   Zerol@ 75, Zerolo 150 and Zerol@ 500 (linear alkylbenzenes sold by
   Shrieve Chemicals) and HAB 22 (branched alkylbenzene sold by Nippon
   Oil).
           Lubricants of the present invention further comprise those that have
10 been designed for use with hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants and are
   miscible with refrigerants of the present invention under compression
   refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus' operating
   conditions. Such lubricants and their properties are discussed in
   "Synthetic Lubricants and High-Performance Fluids", R. L. Shubkin, editor,
15 Marcel Dekker, 1993. Such lubricants include, but are not limited to,
   polyol esters (POEs) such as Castrol@ 100 (Castrol, United Kingdom),
   polyalkylene glycols (PAGs) such as RL-488A from Dow (Dow Chemical,
   Midland, Michigan), and polyvinyl ethers (PVEs). These lubricants are
   readily available from various commercial sources.
20         Lubricants of the present invention are selected by considering a
   given compressor's requirements and the environment to which the
   lubricant will be exposed. Lubricants of the present invention preferably
   have a kinematic viscosity of at least about 5 cs (centistokes) at 40 0C.
           Commonly used refrigeration system additives may optionally be
25 added, as desired, to compositions of the present invention in order to
   enhance lubricity and system stability. These additives are generally
   known within the field of refrigeration compressor lubrication, and include
   anti wear agents, extreme pressure lubricants, corrosion and oxidation
   inhibitors, metal surface deactivators, free radical scavengers, foaming
30 and antifoam control agents, leak detectants and the like. In general,
   these additives are present only in small amounts relative to the overall
   lubricant composition. They are typically used at concentrations of from
   less than about 0.1 % to as much as about 3 % of each additive. These
   additives are selected on the basis of the individual system requirements.
35 Some typical examples of such additives may include, but are not limited
   to, lubrication enhancing additives, such as alkyl or aryl esters of
   phosphoric acid and of thiophosphates. Additionally, the metal dialkyl
                                          35

   dithiophosphates (e.g. zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate or ZDDP, Lubrizol
   1375) and other members of this family of chemicals may be used in
   compositions of the present invention. Other antiwear additives include
   natural product oils and assymetrical polyhydroxyl lubrication additives
 5 such as Synergol TMS (International Lubricants). Similarly, stabilizers
   such as anti oxidants, free radical scavengers, and water scavengers may
   be employed. Compounds in this category can include, but are not limited
   to, butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) and epoxides.
           The compositions of the present invention may further comprise
10 about 0.01 weight percent to about 5 weight percent of an additive such
   as, for example, a stabilizer, free radical scavenger and/or antioxidant.
   Such additives include but are not limited to, nitromethane, hindered
   phenols, hydroxylamines, thiols, phosphites, or lactones. Single additives
   or combinations may be used.
15         The compositions of the present invention may further comprise
   about 0.01 weight percent to about 5 weight percent of a water scavenger
   (drying compound). Such water scavengers may comprise ortho esters
   such as trimethyl-, triethyl-, or tripropylortho formate.
           The compositions of the present invention may further comprise a
20 tracer selected from the group consisting of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
   deuterated hydrocarbons, deuterated hydrofluorocarbons,
   perfluorocarbons, fluoroethers, brominated compounds, iodated
   compounds, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, nitrous oxide (N20) and
   combinations thereof. The tracer compounds are added to the
25 compositions in previously determined quantities to allow detection of any
   dilution, contamination or other alteration of the composition, as described
   in U. S. Patent application serial no. 11/062044, filed February 18, 2005.
           Typical tracer compounds for use in the present compositions are
   listed in Table 7.

           The compounds listed in Table 7 are available commercially (from
   chemical supply houses) or may be prepared by processes known in the
   art.
           Single tracer compounds may be used in combination with a
 5 refrigeration/heating fluid in the compositions of the present invention or
   multiple tracer compounds may be combined in any proportion to serve as
   a tracer blend. The tracer blend may contain multiple tracer compounds
   from the same class of compounds or multiple tracer compounds from
   different classes of compounds. For example, a tracer blend may contain
10 2 or more deuterated hydrofluorocarbons, or one deuterated
   hydrofluorocarbon in combination with one or more perfluorocarbons.
           Additionally, some of the compounds in Table 7 exist as multiple
   isomers, structural or optical. Single isomers or multiple isomers of the
   same compound may be used in any proportion to prepare the tracer
15 compound. Further, single or multiple isomers of a given compound may
   be combined in any proportion with any number of other compounds to
   serve as a tracer blend.
           The tracer compound or tracer blend may be present in the
   compositions at a total concentration of about 50 parts per million by
20 weight (ppm) to about 1000 ppm. Preferably, the tracer compound or
   tracer blend is present at a total concentration of about 50 ppm to about
   500 ppm and most preferably, the tracer compound or tracer blend is
   present at a total concentration of about 100 ppm to about 300 ppm.
           The compositions of the present invention may further comprise a
25 compatibilizer selected from the group consisting of polyoxyalkylene glycol
   ethers, amides, nitriles, ketones, chlorocarbons, esters, lactones, aryl
   ethers, fluoroethers and 1,1,1-trifluoroalkanes. The compatibilizer is used
   to improve solubility of hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in conventional
   refrigeration lubricants. Refrigeration lubricants are needed to lubricate
30 the compressor of a refrigeration, air-conditioning or heat pump apparatus.
   The lubricant must move throughout the apparatus with the refrigerant in
   particular it must return from the non-compressor zones to the compressor
   to continue to function as lubricant and avoid compressor failure.
           Hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants are generally not compatible with
35 convention refrigeration lubricants such as mineral oils, alkylbenzenes,
   synthetic paraffins, synthetic napthenes and poly(alpha)olefins. Many
   replacement lubricants have been proposed, however, the polyalkylene
                                          40

   glycols, polyol esters and polyvinyl ethers, suggested for use with
   hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants are expensive and absorb water readily.
   Water in a refrigeration, air-conditioning system or heat pump can lead to
   corrosion and the formation of particles that may plug the capillary tubes
 5 and other small orifices in the system, ultimately causing system failure.
   Additionally, in existing equipment, time-consuming and costly flushing
   procedures are required to change to a new lubricant. Therefore, it is
   desirable to continue to use the original lubricant if possible.
           The compatibilizers of the present invention improve solubility of the
10 hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in conventional refrigeration lubricants and
   thus improve oil return to the compressor.

          Lactone compatibilizers generally have a kinematic viscosity of less
  than about 7 centistokes at 40 0C. For instance, gamma-undecalactone
  has kinematic viscosity of 5.4 centistokes and cis-(3-hexyl-5
5 methyl)dihydrofuran-2-one has viscosity of 4.5 centistokes both at 40 0 C.
  Lactone compatibilizers may be available commercially or prepared by
  methods as described in U. S. patent application 10/910,495 filed August
  3, 2004, incorporated herein by reference.

   alkyl radicals. Representative fluoroether compatibilizers include but are
   not limited to: C8H17OCF2CF2H and C6H130CF2CF2H. It should be noted
20 that if the refrigerant is a fluoroether, then the compatibilizer may not be
   the same fluoroether.
            Fluoroether compatibilizers may further comprise ethers derived
   from fluoroolefins and polyols. The fluoroolefins may be of the type
   CF2=CXY, wherein X is hydrogen, chlorine or fluorine, and Y is chlorine,
25 fluorine, CF3 or ORf, wherein Rf is CF3, C2F5, or C3F7. Representative

                                            50

           1,1,1-Trifluoroalkane compatibilizers of the present invention
   comprise 1,1,1-trifluoroalkanes represented by the general formula CF3R 1,
   wherein R1 is selected from aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbon radicals
   having from about 5 to about 15 carbon atoms, preferably primary, linear,
 5 saturated, alkyl radicals. Representative 1,1,1-trifluoroalkane
   compatibilizers include but are not limited to: 1,1,1-trifluorohexane and
   1,1,1-trifluorododecane.
                By effective amount of compatibilizer is meant that amount of
   compatibilizer that leads to efficient solubilizing of the lubricant in the
10 composition and thus provides adequate oil return to optimize operation of
   the refrigeration, air-conditioning or heat pump apparatus.
                The compositions of the present invention will typically contain
   from about 0.1 to about 40 weight percent, preferably from about 0.2 to
   about 20 weight percent, and most preferably from about 0.3 to about 10
15 weight percent compatibilizer in the compositions of the present invention.
           The present invention further relates to a method of solubilizing a
   refrigerant or heat transfer fluid composition comprising the compositions
   of the present invention in a refrigeration lubricant selected from the group
   consisting of mineral oils, alkylbenzenes, synthetic paraffins, synthetic
20 napthenes, and poly(alpha)olefins, wherein said method comprises
   contacting said lubricant with said composition in the presence of an
   effective amount of a compatibilizer, wherein said compatibilizer is
   selected from the group consisting of polyoxyalkylene glycol ethers,
   amides, nitriles, ketones, chlorocarbons, esters, lactones, aryl ethers,
25 fluoroethers and 1,1,1-trifluoroalkanes.
           The present invention further relates to a method for improving oil
   return to the compressor in a compression refrigeration, air-conditioning or
   heat pump apparatus, said method comprising using a composition
   comprising compatibilizer in said apparatus.
30         The compositions of the present invention may further comprise an
   ultra-violet (UV) dye and optionally a solubilizing agent. The UV dye is a
   useful component for detecting leaks of the composition by permitting one
   to observe the fluorescence of the dye in the composition at a leak point or
   in the vicinity of refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus.
35 One may observe the fluoroscence of the dye under an ultra-violet light.
   Solubilizing agents may be needed due to poor solubility of such UV dyes
   in some compositions.
                                            51

           By "ultra-violet" dye is meant a UV fluorescent composition that
   absorbs light in the ultra-violet or "near" ultra-violet region of the
   electromagnetic spectrum. The fluorescence produced by the UV
   fluorescent dye under illumination by a UV light that emits radiation with
 5 wavelength anywhere from 10 nanometer to 750 nanometer may be
   detected. Therefore, if a composition containing such a UV fluorescent
   dye is leaking from a given point in a refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat
   pump apparatus, the fluorescence can be detected at the leak point. Such
   UV fluorescent dyes include but are not limited to naphthalimides,
10 perylenes, coumarins, anthracenes, phenanthracenes, xanthenes,
   thioxanthenes, naphthoxanthenes, fluoresceins, and derivatives or
   combinations thereof.
           Solubilizing agents of the present invention comprise at least one
   compound selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbons,
15 hydrocarbon ethers, polyoxyalkylene glycol ethers, amides, nitriles,
   ketones, chlorocarbons, esters, lactones, aryl ethers, fluoroethers and
   1,1,1-trifluoroalkanes. The polyoxyalkylene glycol ethers, amides, nitriles,
   ketones, chlorocarbons, esters, lactones, aryl ethers, fluoroethers and
   1,1,1-trifluoroalkanes solubilizing agents have been defined previously
20 herein as being compatibilizers for use with conventional refrigeration
   lubricants.
           Hydrocarbon solubilizing agents of the present invention comprise
   hydrocarbons including straight chained, branched chain or cyclic alkanes
   or alkenes containing 5 or fewer carbon atoms and only hydrogen with no
25 other functional groups. Representative hydrocarbon solubilizing agents
   comprise propane, propylene, cyclopropane, n-butane, isobutane, 2
   methylbutane and n-pentane. It should be noted that if the composition
   contains a hydrocarbon, then the solubilizing agent may not be the same
   hydrocarbon.
30         Hydrocarbon ether solubilizing agents of the present invention
   comprise ethers containing only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, such as
   dimethyl ether (DME).
           Solubilizing agents of the present invention may be present as a
   single compound, or may be present as a mixture of more than one
35 solubilizing agent. Mixtures of solubilizing agents may contain two
   solubilizing agents from the same class of compounds, say two lactones,
                                           52

   or two solubilizing agents from two different classes, such as a lactone
   and a polyoxyalkylene glycol ether.
            In the present compositions comprising refrigerant and UV
   fluorescent dye, or comprising heat transfer fluid and UV fluorescent dye,
 5 from about 0.001 weight percent to about 1.0 weight percent of the
   composition is UV dye, preferably from about 0.005 weight percent to
   about 0.5 weight percent, and most preferably from 0.01 weight percent to
   about 0.25 weight percent.
            Solubilizing agents such as ketones may have an objectionable
10 odor, which can be masked by addition of an odor masking agent or
   fragrance. Typical examples of odor masking agents or fragrances may
   include Evergreen, Fresh Lemon, Cherry, Cinnamon, Peppermint, Floral
   or Orange Peel all commercially available, as well as d-limonene and
   pinene. Such odor masking agents may be used at concentrations of from
15 about 0.001 % to as much as about 15% by weight based on the combined
   weight of odor masking agent and solubilizing agent.
            Solubility of these UV fluorescent dyes in the compositions of the
   present invention may be poor. Therefore, methods for introducing these
   dyes into the refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus have
20 been awkward, costly and time consuming. US patent no. RE 36,951
   describes a method, which utilizes a dye powder, solid pellet or slurry of
   dye that may be inserted into a component of the refrigeration, air
   conditioning, or heat pump apparatus. As refrigerant and lubricant are
   circulated through the apparatus, the dye is dissolved or dispersed and
25 carried throughout the apparatus. Numerous other methods for introducing
   dye into a refrigeration or air conditioning apparatus are described in the
   literature.
            Ideally, the UV fluorescent dye could be dissolved in the refrigerant
   itself thereby not requiring any specialized method for introduction to the
30 refrigeration, air conditioning apparatus, or heat pump. The present
   invention relates to compositions including UV fluorescent dye, which may
   be introduced into the system as a solution in the refrigerant. The
   inventive compositions will allow the storage and transport of dye
   containing compositions even at low temperatures while maintaining the
35 dye in solution.
            In the present compositions comprising refrigerant, UV fluorescent
   dye and solubilizing agent, or comprising heat transfer fluid and UV
                                           53

   fluorescent dye and solubilizing agent, from about 1 to about 50 weight
   percent, preferably from about 2 to about 25 weight percent, and most
   preferably from about 5 to about 15 weight percent of the combined
   composition is solubilizing agent. In the compositions of the present
 5 invention the UV fluorescent dye is present in a concentration from about
   0.001 weight percent to about 1.0 weight percent, preferably from 0.005
   weight percent to about 0.5 weight percent, and most preferably from 0.01
   weight percent to about 0.25 weight percent.
           The present invention further relates to a method of using the
10 compositions further comprising ultraviolet fluorescent dye, and optionally,
   solubilizing agent, in refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump
   apparatus. The method comprises introducing the composition into the
   refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus. This may be done
   by dissolving the UV fluorescent dye in the composition in the presence of
15 a solubilizing agent and introducing the combination into the apparatus.
   Alternatively, this may be done by combining solubilizing agent and UV
   fluorescent dye and introducing said combination into refrigeration or air
   conditioning apparatus containing refrigerant and/or heat transfer fluid.
   The resulting composition may be used in the refrigeration, air
20 conditioning, or heat pump apparatus.
           The present invention further relates to a method of using the
   compositions comprising ultraviolet fluorescent dye to detect leaks. The
   presence of the dye in the compositions allows for detection of leaking
   refrigerant in a refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump apparatus.
25 Leak detection helps to address, resolve or prevent inefficient operation of
   the apparatus or system or equipment failure. Leak detection also helps
   one contain chemicals used in the operation of the apparatus.
          The method comprises providing the composition comprising
   refrigerant, ultra-violet fluorescent dye, as described herein, and
30 optionally, a solubilizing agent as described herein, to refrigeration, air
   conditioning, or heat pump apparatus and employing a suitable means for
   detecting the UV fluorescent dye-containing refrigerant. Suitable means
   for detecting the dye include, but are not limited to, ultra-violet lamps, often
   referred to as a "black light" or "blue light". Such ultra-violet lamps are
35 commercially available from numerous sources specifically designed for
   this purpose. Once the ultra-violet fluorescent dye containing composition
   has been introduced to the refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump
                                           54

   apparatus and has been allowed to circulate throughout the system, a leak
   can be found by shining said ultra-violet lamp on the apparatus and
   observing the fluorescence of the dye in the vicinity of any leak point.
           The present invention further relates to a method for replacing a
 5 high GWP refrigerant in a refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump
   apparatus, wherein said high GWP refrigerant is selected from the group
   consisting of R134a, R22, R245fa, R114, R236fa, R124, R41OA, R407C,
   R417A, R422A, R507A, and R404A,, said method comprising providing a
   composition of the present invention to said refrigeration, air-conditioning,
10 or heat pump apparatus that uses, used or is designed to use said high
   GWP refrigerant.
           Vapor-compression refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump
   systems include an evaporator, a compressor, a condenser, and an
   expansion device. A vapor-compression cycle re-uses refrigerant in
15 multiple steps producing a cooling effect in one step and a heating effect
   in a different step. The cycle can be described simply as follows. Liquid
   refrigerant enters an evaporator through an expansion device, and the
   liquid refrigerant boils in the evaporator at a low temperature to form a gas
   and produce cooling. The low-pressure gas enters a compressor where
20 the gas is compressed to raise its pressure and temperature. The higher
   pressure (compressed) gaseous refrigerant then enters the condenser in
   which the refrigerant condenses and discharges its heat to the
   environment. The refrigerant returns to the expansion device through
   which the liquid expands from the higher-pressure level in the condenser
25 to the low-pressure level in the evaporator, thus repeating the cycle.
           As used herein, mobile refrigeration apparatus or mobile air
   conditioning apparatus refers to any refrigeration or air-conditioning
   apparatus incorporated into a transportation unit for the road, rail, sea or
   air. In addition, apparatus, which are meant to provide refrigeration or air
30 conditioning for a system independent of any moving carrier, known as
   "intermodal" systems, are included in the present invention. Such
   intermodal systems include "containers" (combined sea/land transport) as
   well as "swap bodies" (combined road and rail transport). The present
   invention is particularly useful for road transport refrigerating or air
35 conditioning apparatus, such as automobile air-conditioning apparatus or
   refrigerated road transport equipment.

           The present invention further relates to a process for producing
   cooling comprising evaporating the compositions of the present invention
   in the vicinity of a body to be cooled, and thereafter condensing said
   compositions.
 5         The present invention further relates to a process for producing
   heat comprising condensing the compositions of the present invention in
   the vicinity of a body to be heated, and thereafter evaporating said
   compositions.
           The present invention further relates to a refrigeration, air
10 conditioning, or heat pump apparatus containing a composition of the
   present invention wherein said composition at least one fluoroolefin.
           The present invention further relates to a mobile air-conditioning
   apparatus containing a composition of the present invention wherein said
   composition comprises at least one fluoroolefin.
15              The present invention further relates to a method for early
   detection of a refrigerant leak in a refrigeration, air-conditioning or heat
   pump apparatus said method comprising using a non-azeotropic
   composition in said apparatus, and monitoring for a reduction in cooling
   performance. The non-azeotropic compositions will fractionate upon
20 leakage from a refrigeration, air-conditioning or heat pump apparatus and
   the lower boiling (higher vapor pressure) component will leak out of the
   apparatus first. When this occurs, if the lower boiling component in that
   composition provides the majority of the refrigeration capacity, there will
   be a marked reduction in the capacity and thus performance of the
25 apparatus. In an automobile air-conditioning system, as an example, the
   passengers in the automobile will detect a reduction in the cooling
   capability of the system. This reduction in cooling capability can be
   interpreted to mean that refrigerant is being leaked and that the system
   requires repair.
30         The present invention further relates to a method of using the
   compositions of the present invention as a heat transfer fluid composition,
   said process comprising transporting said composition from a heat source
   to a heat sink.
           Heat transfer fluids are utilized to transfer, move or remove heat
35 from one space, location, object or body to a different space, location,
   object or body by radiation, conduction, or convection. A heat transfer
   fluid may function as a secondary coolant by providing means of transfer
                                           56

   for cooling (or heating) from a remote refrigeration (or heating) system. In
   some systems, the heat transfer fluid may remain in a constant state
   throughout the transfer process (i.e., not evaporate or condense).
   Alternatively, evaporative cooling processes may utilize heat transfer fluids
 5 as well.
           A heat source may be defined as any space, location, object or
   body from which it is desirable to transfer, move or remove heat.
   Examples of heat sources may be spaces (open or enclosed) requiring
   refrigeration or cooling, such as refrigerator or freezer cases in a
10 supermarket, building spaces requiring air-conditioning, or the passenger
   compartment of an automobile requiring air-conditioning. A heat sink may
   be defined as any space, location, object or body capable of absorbing
   heat. A vapor compression refrigeration system is one example of such a
   heat sink.
15              In another embodiment, the present invention relates to blowing
   agent compositions comprising the fluoroolefin-containing compositions as
   described herein for use in preparing foams. In other embodiments the
   invention provides foamable compositions, and preferably polyurethane
   and polyisocyanate foam compositions, and method of preparing foams.
20 In such foam embodiments, one or more of the present fluoroolefin
   containing compositions are included as a blowing agent in foamable
   compositions, which composition preferably includes one or more
   additional components capable of reacting and foaming under the proper
   conditions to form a foam or cellular structure. Any of the methods well
25 known in the art, such as those described in "Polyurethanes Chemistry
   and Technology," Volumes I and II, Saunders and Frisch, 1962, John
   Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y., which is incorporated herein by
   reference, may be used or adapted for use in accordance with the foam
   embodiments of the present invention.
30              The present invention further relates to a method of forming a
   foam comprising: (a) adding to a foamable composition a fluoroolefin
   containing composition of the present invention; and (b) reacting the
   foamable composition under conditions effective to form a foam.
               Another embodiment of the present invention relates to the use
35 of the fluoroolefin-containing compositions as described herein for use as
   propellants in sprayable compositions. Additionally, the present invention
   relates to a sprayable composition comprising the fluoroolefin-containing
                                          57

   compositions as described herein. The active ingredient to be sprayed
   together with inert ingredients, solvents and other materials may also be
   present in a sprayable composition. Preferably, the sprayable composition
   is an aerosol. Suitable active materials to be sprayed include, without
 5 limitations, cosmetic materials, such as deodorants, perfumes, hair sprays,
   cleaners, and polishing agents as well as medicinal materials such as anti
   asthma and anti-halitosis medications.
                The present invention further relates to a process for producing
   aerosol products comprising the step of adding a fluoroolefin-containing
10 composition as described herein to active ingredients in an aerosol
   container, wherein said composition functions as a propellant.
                A further aspect provides methods of suppressing a flame, said
   methods comprising contacting a flame with a fluid comprising a
   fluoroolefin-containing composition of the present disclosure. Any suitable
15 methods for contacting the flame with the present composition may be
   used. For example, a fluoroolefin-containing composition of the present
   disclosure may be sprayed, poured, and the like onto the flame, or at least
   a portion of the flame may be immersed in the flame suppression
   composition. In light of the teachings herein, those of skill in the art will be
20 readily able to adapt a variety of conventional apparatus and methods of
   flame suppression for use in the present disclosure.
                A further embodiment provides methods of extinguishing or
   suppressing a fire in a total-flood application comprising providing an
   agent comprising a fluoroolefin-containing composition of the present
25 disclosure; disposing the agent in a pressurized discharge system; and
   discharging the agent into an area to extinguish or suppress fires in that
   area. Another embodiment provides methods of inerting an area to
   prevent a fire or explosion comprising providing an agent comprising a
   fluoroolefin-containing composition of the present disclosure; disposing the
30 agent in a pressurized discharge system; and discharging the agent into
   the area to prevent a fire or explosion from occurring.
                The term "extinguishment" is usually used to denote complete
   elimination of a fire; whereas, "suppression" is often used to denote
   reduction, but not necessarily total elimination, of a fire or explosion. As
35 used herein, terms "extinguishment" and "suppression" will be used
   interchangeably. There are four general types of halocarbon fire and
   explosion protection applications. (1) In total-flood fire extinguishment
                                         58

   and/or suppression applications, the agent is discharged into a space to
   achieve a concentration sufficient to extinguish or suppress an existing
   fire. Total flooding use includes protection of enclosed, potentially
   occupied spaces such, as computer rooms as well as specialized, often
 5 unoccupied spaces such as aircraft engine nacelles and engine
   compartments in vehicles. (2) In streaming applications, the agent is
   applied directly onto a fire or into the region of a fire. This is usually
   accomplished using manually operated wheeled or portable units. A
   second method, included as a streaming application, uses a "localized"
10 system, which discharges agent toward a fire from one or more fixed
   nozzles. Localized systems may be activated either manually or
   automatically. (3) In explosion suppression, a fluoroolefin-containing
   composition of the present disclosure is discharged to suppress an
   explosion that has already been initiated. The term "suppression" is
15 normally used in this application because the explosion is usually self
   limiting. However, the use of this term does not necessarily imply that the
   explosion is not extinguished by the agent. In this application, a detector
   is usually used to detect an expanding fireball from an explosion, and the
   agent is discharged rapidly to suppress the explosion. Explosion
20 suppression is used primarily, but not solely, in defense applications. (4)
   In inertion, a fluoroolefin-containing composition of the present disclosure
   is discharged into a space to prevent an explosion or a fire from being
   initiated. Often, a system similar or identical to that used for total-flood fire
   extinguishment or suppression is used. Usually, the presence of a
25 dangerous condition (for example, dangerous concentrations of flammable
   or explosive gases) is detected, and the fluoroolefin-containing
   composition of the present disclosure is then discharged to prevent the
   explosion or fire from occurring until the condition can be remedied.
                The extinguishing method can be carried out by introducing the
30 composition into an enclosed area surrounding a fire. Any of the known
   methods of introduction can be utilized provided that appropriate quantities
   of the composition are metered into the enclosed area at appropriate
   intervals. For example, a composition can be introduced by streaming,
   e.g., using conventional portable (or fixed) fire extinguishing equipment; by
35 misting; or by flooding, e.g., by releasing (using appropriate piping, valves,
   and controls) the composition into an enclosed area surrounding a fire.
   The composition can optionally be combined with an inert propellant, e.g.,
                                           59

   nitrogen, argon, decomposition products of glycidyl azide polymers or
   carbon dioxide, to increase the rate of discharge of the composition from
   the streaming or flooding equipment utilized.
                Preferably, the extinguishing process involves introducing a
 5 fluoroolefin-containing composition of the present disclosure to a fire or
   flame in an amount sufficient to extinguish the fire or flame. One skilled in
   this field will recognize that the amount of flame suppressant needed to
   extinguish a particular fire will depend upon the nature and extent of the
   hazard. When the flame suppressant is to be introduced by flooding, cup
10 burner test data is useful in determining the amount or concentration of
   flame suppressant required to extinguish a particular type and size of fire.
                Laboratory tests useful for determining effective concentration
   ranges of fluoroolefin-containing compositions when used in conjunction
   with extinguishing or suppressing a fire in a total-flood application or fire
15 inertion are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,759,430, which is
   hereby incorporated by reference.

                    A vessel is charged with an initial composition at a
   temperature of either -25 OC or if specified, at 25 OC, and the initial vapor
   pressure of the composition is measured. The composition is allowed to
25 leak from the vessel, while the temperature is held constant, until 50
   weight percent of the initial composition is removed, at which time the
   vapor pressure of the composition remaining in the vessel is measured.

              Several compositions have even higher energy efficiency (COP)
      than HFC-134a while maintaining lower discharge pressures and
      temperatures. Capacity for the present compositions is also similar to
 5    R134a indicating these could be replacement refrigerants for R134a in
      refrigeration and air-conditioning, and in mobile air-conditioning
      applications in particular. Those compositions containing hydrocarbon may
      also improve oil solubility with conventional mineral oil and alkyl benzene

                   Several compositions have energy efficiency (COP)
       comparable top R404A and R422A. Discharge temperatures are also
       lower than R404A and R507A. Capacity for the present compositions is
 5     also similar to R404A, R507A, and R422A indicating these could be
       replacement refrigerants for in refrigeration and air-conditioning. Those
       compositions containing hydrocarbon may also improve oil solubility with
       conventional mineral oil and alkyl benzene lubricants.
