ABSTRACT
The present invention discloses a one-pot synthesis method for the preparation of
PtCu nanoparticles in aqueous solution. According to the Transmission Electronic
Microscopy (TEM) image, the observed PtCu nanoparticles have nanoflower structure
and with an average size less than 20 nm. The prepared PtCu nanoparticles with a
Pt/Cu feeding molar ratio of 3:1 show the highest oxidase-like activity. The influence
of temperature, pH value, and the concentration of TMB substrate on the oxidase
catalytic activity of PtCu nanoparticles were also studied in this patent. According to
the result, the optimum reaction temperature is 30 - 60 'C, the optimal pH value of the
reaction    buffer   is  at  3.0   and   the  optimal    concentration    of  3,3',5,5'
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is at 0.4 mM.

A PtCu oxidase mimic with nanoflower structure
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to synthesis of PtCu nanoenzyme, which has significant
in chemical, catalytical, biosensing, industrial and environmental fields.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    Enzymes not only play the crucial roles in living activities, but also have profound
    influence in environmental science and industrial fields. However, natural
    enzymes have distinct defects since they cannot stand high temperature or strong
    acid/base condition. In addition, due to their few amounts in living creatures, it is
    costly to prepare for quantitative analysis, as well as purification.
    With the development of nanoscience, researchers have found that some
    nanomaterials have enzyme-like activities. Compared to natural enzymes, these
    nanoenzymes       have   better    stability  under     extreme    conditions,     better
    biocompatibility as well as high catalytic activities. 1 Furthermore, nanoenzymes
    are cost-effective and convenient for mass production. Thus, nanoenzymes can be
    applied both in scientific fields and industrial fields. Over the past decade, several
    types of nanoenzymes have been reported. The first type is called Iron-Based
    nanoenzymes, which uses Iron (II, III) oxide, Fe 3 0    4 or Iron (III) oxide, Fe 2 0 3 to
    serve as the body of catalyst. 2 The second type is called non-Iron Metallic
    nanoenzymes, which uses non-iron metal oxides nanomaterials or multi-metal
    nanocomposites such as PtAu or AgAu to improve reaction rate. The third type is
    called non-Matallic nanoenzymes, which uses carbon-based nanomaterials or
    other non-metal nanomaterials to lower activation energy. In recent studies,
    researchers have found that bimetallic nanoenzymes have better stability and
                                               1

    higher catalytic activity compared to monometallic nanoenzymes. As reported,
    PtCo 3 , PtAg 4 and PdAg 5 hybrid nanomaterials all had high oxidase or peroxidase
    catalytic    activity  as  nanoenzymes.     However,     most   of these   bimetallic
    nanoenzymes       are  produced    by hydrothermal      synthesis   and  their water
    dispersibility was varied, which means it requires innovations to renovate current
    technique.
    PtCu nanoparticles have been widely used in electrochemical catalysis and show
    excellent performance.6-7 However, the oxidase catalytic activity of PtCu
    nanoparticles has not been well investigated. In this patent, it introduces a one-pot
    synthesis method to prepare PtCu nanoparticles in water, and the prepared PtCu
    nanoparticles show high oxidase catalytic activity.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
        The object of the present invention is to provide a simple synthesis method to
prepare PtCu nanoparticles with good water dispersibility, and to investigate the
oxidase catalytic activity of the prepared PtCu nanoparticles.
    In order to solve the above problem, the present invention discloses a one-pot
synthesis method for the preparation of PtCu nanoparticles in aqueous solution. The
preparation of PtCu nanoparticles should match the following steps:
        A) 5.0 mL ultrapure water was added into the reaction flask.
        B) Then H 2 PtCl 6 (20.0 mmol/L) and CuCl 2 (20.0 mmol/L) were added to the
             above solution. (With Pt/Cu atomic ratio of 3:1, noticed that the
             concentration of total Cu and Pt ions should be 0.2 mmol/L. The prepared
             nanoparticles were denoted as Pt 3 Cui.)
        C) The mixture was stirred in the ice-water bath for 10 minutes.
        D) The prepared NaBH 4 solution with concentration of 1 mg/mL was added
             to the above reaction flask under stirring with fixed volume and at the rate
             of 15 s/drop.
                                             2

        E) Once the addition of NaBH 4 solution was completed, the reaction was
             under the ice bath stirring for another one hour.
        F) TEM image of the obtained PtCu nanoparticles is shown in Figure1.
     The investigation of oxidase-like catalytic activity of as prepared PtCu
nanoparticles should match the following steps:
        50    tL Pt3 Cui nanoenzyme was added to 0.4 mL of pH 3.0 solution. The
        mixture was kept under the constant temperature at 30 'C for 10 minutes.
        Once done, 20 ptL TMB was added to each of the tubes and the reaction was
        still kept under the constant temperature. During this time, the color change of
        the solution was observed. After 10 minutes, the absorbance of the mixture
        was recorded at 650 nm. Repeat three samples for error reduction.
