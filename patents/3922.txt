                                      Abstract
       An assembly includes a fastener deployable in a wellbore and actuated by a
shape-memory alloy.       The shape-memory alloy releaseably interlocks multiple
components deployed in the wellbore.    The physical shape of the shape-memory
alloy can be selectively changed between a first shape and a second shape.

                 SHAPE-MEMORY ALLOY ACTUATED FASTENER
[0001]      The present disclosure was filed as a divisional application of Australian
patent application 2014399942, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein
by reference.
                                     Technical Field
[0001a]        The present disclosure relates generally to devices for fastening
components to each other.        More specifically, but not by way of limitation, this
disclosure relates to a fastener actuated by a shape-memory alloy.
                                      Background
[0002]         One or more fasteners (e.g., latches, bolts, lugs, and clamps) can
mechanically interlock two or more components of a system together. Fasteners can
be releasable. That is, some fasteners can be selectively disengaged to free the
interlocked components from one another. Typically, fasteners can be actuated (i.e.,
selectively engaged or disengaged) by hand, motor, or by applying hydraulic
pressure to the fastener. Actuating a fastener by hand, however, can be impractical
or impossible when the fastener is in a remote location, such as in a wellbore.
Actuating a fastener via a motor can be inefficient and impractical, as motors can be
large in size, expensive, prone to mechanical failures, and require significant power
for operation.   Further, actuating a fastener via hydraulic pressure can be too time
consuming and uncontrollable for some applications.            Accordingly, it can be
challenging to quickly, remotely, and selectively actuate a fastener.

                                            2a
                                  Detailed Description
[0012]        Certain aspects and features of the present disclosure are directed to a
shape-memory alloy actuated fastener. The shape-memory alloy actuated fastener
can be, or can be included in, a latch (e.g., a collet latch or C-latch), bolt, lug, clamp,

    WO 2016/003405                                                  PCT/US2014/044832
                                           3
spring, threaded connector, dog, or wire. The shape-memory alloy actuated fastener
can include a shape-memory alloy. A shape-memory alloy can include an alloy of
metals with atoms that can be arranged in two different crystal structures.        Each
crystal structure can define a physical shape for the shape-memory alloy. At colder
temperatures, the atoms can be arranged in one crystal structure, which can define
one physical shape (i.e., the low-temperature shape) for the shape-memory alloy.
When heated above a transition temperature, the atoms can rearrange to the other
crystal structure, which can define another physical shape (i.e., the high-temperature
shape) for the shape-memory alloy. In some embodiments, the shape-memory alloy
can substantially revert back to its low-temperature shape when cooled back below
the transition temperature.     By heating or cooling the shape-memory alloy, the
shape-memory alloy can change between two physical shapes.                Because the
fastener can include the shape-memory alloy, the fastener can change between two
physical shapes upon the heating or cooling of the fastener.
[0013]         The fastener can be configured for selectively interlocking or releasing
(i.e., engaging or disengaging) multiple components.          For example, in some
embodiments, the fastener's low-temperature shape can be configured to interlock
multiple components. The fastener's high-temperature shape can be configured to
release the multiple components from one another.         The fastener can interlock
multiple components when in its low-temperature shape.         When heated above a
transition temperature, the fastener can change into its high-temperature shape and
release the multiple components from one another.       In some embodiments, when
cooled back below the transition temperature, the fastener can change substantially
back into its low-temperature       shape, which can again interlock the multiple
components.      In this way, the fastener can be actuated by selectively heating or

   WO 2016/003405                                                   PCT/US2014/044832
                                         4
cooling the fastener. Further, in some embodiments, the fastener's high-temperature
shape and low-temperature shape can be reversed. That is, in some embodiments,
the fastener's high-temperature shape can be configured to interlock multiple
components, while the fastener's low-temperature shape can be configured to
release the multiple components from one another.
[0014]         In one example, the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener can be a
part of a valve deployed in a wellbore. A wellbore is a hole drilled in a subterranean
formation as part of a well system (e.g., for extracting fluid or gas from the
subterranean formation). The valve can control the flow of fluid or gas through the
wellbore.   The valve can include a shape-memory alloy actuated fastener which,
when in its low-temperature shape, can interlock multiple valve components to
effectively close the valve. When closed, the valve can prohibit fluid or gas from
flowing through the wellbore. A temperature-control device, for example a heating
blanket, can be positioned within the valve or otherwise thermally coupled to the
shape-memory       alloy actuated fastener.    A well operator can         operate the
temperature-control device, for example, by transmitting power to the temperature
control device. The temperature-control device can heat the shape-memory alloy
actuated fastener above a transition temperature, which can cause the shape
memory alloy actuated fastener to change its physical shape to its high-temperature
shape.     Upon changing to its high-temperature shape, the shape-memory alloy
actuated fastener can release the valve components to effectively open the valve.
When open, the valve can permit fluid or gas to flow through the well system.         In
some embodiments, the temperature-control device can cool the shape-memory
alloy actuated fastener back below the transition temperature, which can cause the
shape-memory alloy actuated fastener to substantially change its physical shape

   WO 2016/003405                                                      PCT/US2014/044832
                                             5
back into its low-temperature shape.        In this way, the well operator can quickly,
remotely, and selectively control the valve via the shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener.
[0015]          Although the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener was described in
the above example as part of a well-system component, a shape-memory alloy
actuated fastener can be used in a variety of other contexts to perform numerous
functions.    For example, in some embodiments, a shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener can be used with, or be a part of, an automobile, aircraft, boat, computer,
appliance, furniture piece, machine, toy, sports equipment, electrical system, or other
device.    Further, embodiments can include multiple shape-memory alloy actuated
fasteners configured in any number of ways.
[0016]          These illustrative examples are given to introduce the reader to the
general subject matter discussed here and are not intended to limit the scope of the
disclosed concepts. The following sections describe various additional features and
examples with reference to the drawings in which like numerals indicate like
elements, and directional descriptions are used to describe the illustrative aspects
but, like the illustrative aspects, should not be used to limit the present disclosure.
[0017]           FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of one embodiment of a well system
100 that can include a shape-memory alloy actuated fastener according to one
embodiment of the present disclosure.         The well system 100 includes a wellbore
102.    In some embodiments, the wellbore 102 can be cased and cemented, as
shown in FIG. 1. In other embodiments, the wellbore 102 can be uncased or the
casing may not be cemented.
[0018]          The wellbore 102 can include a tubular string 104, for example, a lower
completion assembly. The tubular string 104 can be positioned in the lower portion

    WO 2016/003405                                                   PCT/US2014/044832
                                            6
112 of the wellbore 102. Annulus 110 can be formed between the tubular string 104
and the wellbore 102.
[0019]         The wellbore 102 can also include a well-system component 108, for
example, an isolation barrier valve, packer, plug, sliding sleeve, running tool, setting
tool latching tool, shear joint, travel joint, or another type of valve (e.g., a safety
valve, flapper valve, or ball valve).         In some embodiments, the well-system
component 108 can include a shape-memory alloy actuated fastener (discussed
further with respect to FIG. 2). The well-system component 108 can also include a
temperature-control device (e.g., a heating device or cooling device) for actuating the
shape-memory alloy actuated fastener.
[0020]         The wellbore 102 can further include another tubular string 106, for
example, an upper completion assembly. The tubular string 106 can be positioned
in the upper portion 114 of the wellbore 102. Although depicted in this example as
connected to the well-system component 108, in some embodiments, the tubular
string 106 can be disconnected from the well-system component 108. Further, some
embodiments may not include the tubular string 104 or the tubular string 106, and
may include other well-system components.
[0021]         FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional side view of the well-system component 108
shown in FIG. 1 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. In some
embodiments, the well-system component 108 is, or can include, a valve, for
example, an isolation barrier valve. An isolation barrier valve can isolate the lower
portion of the wellbore from an upper portion of the wellbore, which can prevent or
minimize fluid or gas communication between the lower portion of the wellbore and
the upper portion of the wellbore.

    WO 2016/003405                                                 PCT/US2014/044832

[0022]          The well-system component 108 can include a housing 202. A tube
204 can be disposed within the housing 202 for communicating fluid or gas through
the well-system component 108.          Further, the well-system component 108 can
include a shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206, for example, the shape
memory alloy actuated fastener 206 depicted in FIG. 3.
[0023]          FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional side view of a shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener 206 in a first position according to one embodiment of the present
disclosure.    In this example, the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 is a
collet latch.
[0024]          The shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 can include a body
306.    In some embodiments, the body 306 can include a ring shape.           In other
embodiments, the body 306 can include another shape, for example a square,
triangular, rectangular, or trapezoidal shape.     In some embodiments, the body 306
can include a cavity, for example, for allowing one or more components to fit through
the body 306.
[0025]          An annular array of fingers 302 can extend from an end of the body
306. In this example, the annular array of fingers 302 extends from both ends of the
body 306. The fingers 302 can include enlarged ends 304. In some embodiments,
the enlarged ends 304 can be positioned on the ends of the fingers 302.            The
enlarged ends 304 can releaseably interlock with a component, for example, a
component of a valve in a wellbore. In some embodiments, the enlarged ends 304
can include a back-angle configuration for interlocking with a component. That is,
the enlarged ends 304 can angle backwards towards the body 306 of the shape
memory alloy actuated fastener 206. In other embodiments, the enlarged ends 304
can include other configurations for interlocking with a component, for example, a

   WO 2016/003405                                                   PCT/US2014/044832
                                            8
90-degree configuration. A 90-degree configuration can include enlarged ends 304
that extend perpendicularly (i.e., 90 degrees) from the fingers 302.
[0026]        The shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 can include a shape
memory alloy, which can include, for example, nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), copper (Cu),
aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), silicon (Si), hafnium (Hf),
palladium (Pd), or gold (Au).        In some embodiments, the shape-memory alloy
actuated fastener 206 can include, for example, Ni-Ti, Ni-Al, Cu-Al-Ni, Cu-Zn-Al, Fe
Mn-Si, Fe-Ni-Co-Ti, Ni-Ti-Hf, or Ni-Ti-Pd.
[0027]        In some embodiments, the entire shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener 206 can include a shape-memory alloy. In other embodiments, one or more
parts of the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206, for example the fingers 302
and/or the enlarged ends 304, can include the shape-memory alloy.
[0028]        In some embodiments, one or more parts of the shape-memory alloy
actuated fastener 206 that directly releasably couple with a component can include
the shape-memory alloy. For example, in some embodiments, the enlarged ends
304 of the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 can include a shape-memory
alloy, and can directly interlock with or release a component. In other embodiments,
the shape-memory alloy can cause (e.g., directly or indirectly) a part of the shape
memory alloy actuated fastener 206, which may not include the shape-memory alloy,
to releaseably couple with a component. For example, the body 306 of the shape
memory alloy actuated fastener 206 can include a shape-memory alloy. The shape
memory alloy can be configured to cause the annular array of fingers 302 and the
enlarged ends 304, which may not include a shape-memory alloy, to releaseably
couple with a component. In some embodiments, the shape-memory alloy can push,
pull, move, or otherwise interact with a part of the shape-memory alloy actuated

   WO 2016/003405                                                    PCT/US2014/044832
                                            9
fastener 206, which can cause the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 to
releaseably interlock with a component.
[0029]         Further, in some embodiments, the shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener 206 can include multiple shape-memory alloys.           For example, in some
embodiments, the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 can include multiple
shape-memory alloys with different transition temperatures. Different components of
the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 can be actuated at different times by
applying different amounts of heat to the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206.
[0030]         Returning to FIG. 2, the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 can
interlock with a receiving component 208, for example, a latch crossover. When the
shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 is interlocked with the receiving
component 208, the receiving component 208 can keep a closure component (e.g., a
ball) in the well-system component 108 in a closed position. This can close the well
system component 108, which can, for example, prevent or minimize fluid or gas
communication through the well-system component 108.
[0031]         Further, the well-system component 108 can also include a power
supply 214, for example, one or more C-sized batteries. Although the power supply
214 is depicted in this example as disposed within the well-system component 108,
in other embodiments, the power supply 214 can be positioned elsewhere, for
example, the power supply 214 can be coupled to other well-system components or
positioned aboveground.
[0032]         An operator (e.g., a well operator) can control the power supply 214. In
some embodiments, an operator can control the power supply 214 via a computing
device (not shown), which can be in communication with the power supply 214. The
computing device can include a processor interfaced with other hardware via a bus.

   WO 2016/003405                                                 PCT/US2014/044832
                                          10
A memory, which can include any suitable tangible (and non-transitory) computer
readable medium such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, or the like, can include program
components that configure operation of the computing device.         The computing
device can also include input/output interface components and additional storage.
[0033]        Further, each of the computing device and the power supply 214 can
include a communication device (not shown) for communicating with one another. In
some embodiments, the communication device can include one or more of any
components     that facilitate a network     connection.   For example,     in some
embodiments, the communication device can be wireless and can include wireless
interfaces such as IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, or radio interfaces for accessing cellular
telephone networks (e.g., transceiver/antenna for accessing a CDMA, GSM, UMTS,
or   other  mobile    communications     network).     In other  embodiments,      the
communication device can be wired and can include interfaces such as Ethernet,
USB, or IEEE 1394.
[0034]        The power supply 214 can be in communication with a temperature
control device 212, for example a heating blanket (e.g., a ceramic heating blanket).
The temperature-control device 212 can be coupled to or in thermal communication
with the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206. In some embodiments, an area
216 surrounding the temperature-control device 212 can be insulated, for example,
to prevent heat loss.    Upon receiving the power from the power supply 214, the
temperature-control device 212 can heat or cool the shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener 206.    This can cause the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 to
change its physical shape, for example, as shown in FIG. 4.
[0035]        FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional side view of the shape-memory alloy
actuated fastener shown in FIG. 3 in a second position according to one embodiment

   WO 2016/003405                                                   PCT/US2014/044832
                                            11
of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, one or more fingers in the annular
array of fingers 302 in the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 can bend
radially outward. This can increase the diameter of the annular array of fingers 302.
In other embodiments, one or more of the fingers in the annular array of fingers 302
can bend radially inward, which can decrease the diameter of the annular array of
fingers 302. Further, in some embodiments, the length or width of one or more of
the fingers in the annular array of fingers 302 can increase or decrease or size.
[0036]         Further, in some embodiments, the body 306 or the enlarged ends 304
can change physical shape, for example, to enhance the decoupling or releasing of a
component.      For example, in some embodiments, the enlarged ends 304 can
change shape from a back-angled configuration to a 90-degree configuration. Any
number of shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 parts can change physical
shape at any number of transition temperatures, and any configuration of physical
shapes may be possible.
[0037]         Returning again to FIG. 2, as noted above, upon receiving the power
from the power supply 214, the temperature-control device 212 can cause the
shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 to change shape (e.g., change to its
high-temperature shape).       As the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206
changes shape, the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 can release from the
receiving component 208, for example, as shown in FIG. 5. In some embodiments,
the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 and/or the receiving component 208
can be coated with a low friction coating, for example, to enhance the decoupling or
releasing of the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 from the receiving
component 208.

   WO 2016/003405                                                  PCT/US2014/044832
                                           12
[0038]         Upon the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 releasing the
receiving component 208, in some embodiments, the receiving component 208 can
move, for example, to a different position (e.g., to the right as viewed in each of
FIGS. 2 and 6). In some embodiments, pressure, gravity, springs, or other means
can aid in the receiving component 208 moving to the different position.       In some
embodiments, when in the different position, the receiving component 208 can keep
the closure component in the well-system component 108 in an open position. This
can allow fluid or gas communication through the well-system component 108.
Unlike with traditional well-system components (e.g., a traditional isolation barrier
valve), which can rely on slow, inefficient, and unpredictable hydraulic pressure
cycling for remote actuation, in some embodiments, an operator can remotely,
quickly, and selectively actuate a well-system component 108 via a shape-memory
alloy actuated fastener 206.
[0039]         In some embodiments, the well-system component 108 can include
additional, fewer, or different components. For example, the well-system component
108 can include any number or configuration of shape-memory alloy actuated
fasteners 206, a piston, spring (e.g., a power spring), washer, O-ring, seal, hydraulic
power assembly or component, screw, transducer, housing, or lock ring. Further, in
some embodiments, the well-system component 108 can include an indexing
mandrel 210, which is radially positioned between the housing 202 and the tube 204.
The indexing mandrel 210 can be used for actuating a well-system component 108
via hydraulic pressure cycling. In some embodiments, an operator can use multiple
actuation systems (e.g., a shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 206 and hydraulic
pressure cycling) for operating the well-system component 108.

[0040]         FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional side view of the well-system component 108
with a shape-memory alloy actuated fastener according to another embodiment of
the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the well-system component 108 of
FIG. 6 is, or can include, a valve, for example, an isolation barrier valve. The well
system component 108 of FIG. 6 can also include the housing 202, the tube 204, the
indexing mandrel 210, the temperature-control device 212, and the power supply
214, which can be configured substantially the same of FIG. 6 as described with
respect to FIG. 2.    Further, the well-system component 108 can include a shape
memory alloy actuated fastener 602, for example, the shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener shown in FIG. 7.
[0041]         FIG. 7 is a perspective view of the shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener 602 in the well-system component 108 of FIG. 6 according to one
embodiment of the present disclosure.        In this example, the shape-memory alloy
actuated fastener 602 is a C-ring.
[0042]        The shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 602 can include a body
704. In some embodiments, the body 704 can include a cylindrical shape. Disposed
within the body 704 can be a cylindrically-shaped cavity 710, such that the end of the
body 704 includes a ring shape. In other embodiments, the body 704 can include
another shape, for example a square, triangular, rectangular, or trapezoidal shape.
In some embodiments, the body 704 can include a cavity, for example, for allowing
one or more components to fit through the body 704.
[0043]        A connector 706 can extend from the end of the body 704.               The
connector 706 can join the cross-sectional end of the body 704 to a locking member
708.   In some embodiments, the locking member 708 can include a C-shape.              In

   WO 2016/003405                                                    PCT/US2014/044832
                                            14
other embodiments, the locking member 708 can include another shape, for
example, a square, ring, circle, triangle, rectangle, or trapezoid shape.
[0044]         In some embodiments, the entire shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener 602 can include a shape-memory alloy. In other embodiments, one or more
parts (i.e., components) of the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 602, for
example the body 704 or the locking member 708, can include one or more shape
memory alloys. Further, in some embodiments, the shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener 602 may not include the body 704 or the connector 706. That is, in some
embodiments, the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 602 can only include the
locking member 708.
[0045]         Returning to FIG. 6, in some embodiments, one piece of the shape
memory alloy actuated fastener 602 (e.g., the body 704) can be coupled to the well
component 606. Another piece of the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 602
(e.g., the locking member 708) can interlock with a receiving component 604. When
the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 602 is interlocked with the receiving
component 604, the receiving component 604 can keep a closure component (e.g., a
ball) in the well-system component 108 of FIG. 6 in a closed position. This can close
the well-system component 108 of FIG. 6, which can prevent or minimize fluid or gas
communication through the well-system component 108.
[0046]         The well-system component 108 of FIG. 6 can also include the
temperature-control device 212 in communication with the power supply 214, as
described with respect to FIG. 2. An operator can actuate the power supply 214,
which can transmit power to the temperature-control device 212. The temperature
control device 212 can heat or cool the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 602,
which can cause the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 602 to change into

    WO 2016/003405                                                PCT/US2014/044832
                                          15
another physical shape, for example, to its high-temperature shape.          In some
embodiments, the high-temperature shape can include a physical shape in which a
piece of the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 602 (e.g., the locking member
708) has radially expanded or increased in diameter. Upon changing its physical
shape, the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 602 can release the well
component 606 from the receiving component 604. In some embodiments, this can
cause the well component 606 to be able to move, for example, to a different
position (e.g., to the right as viewed in FIG. 6).   In some embodiments, pressure,
gravity, springs, or other means can aid in the well component 606 moving to the
different position.  In some embodiments, when in the different position, the well
component 606 can keep the closure component (not shown) in the well-system
component 108 of FIG. 6 in an open position.             This can allow fluid or gas
communication through the well-system component 108 of FIG. 6.
[0047]         Further, in some embodiments, multiple shape-memory alloy actuated
fasteners 602 can be used in sequence or in concert. For example, multiple shape
memory alloy actuated fasteners 602 with the same transition temperature, different
transition temperatures, or that interlock different combinations of components can
be used in sequence or in concert. For example, in some embodiments, the well
system component 108 of FIG. 6 can include multiple shape-memory alloy actuated
fasteners 602 actuated by different transition temperatures. Actuating the multiple
shape-memory alloy actuated fasteners 602 at different times via different transition
temperatures     can provide greater control over actuation of the well-system
component 108 of FIG. 6.
[0048]         FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a system 800 with a shape-memory
alloy actuated fastener according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.

   WO 2016/003405                                                   PCT/US2014/044832
                                           16
In some embodiments, the system 800 can include an electrical component 810.
The electrical component 810 can include, for example, a computer, cellular
telephone, resistor, capacitor, inductor, integrated circuit component, power supply,
processor, microcontroller, memory, or motor. The electrical component 810 can be
coupled to a conductor 802 (e.g., a wire or circuit board trace). The conductor 802
can include any suitable conductive material, for example, copper, tin, iron,
aluminum, gold, or silver. Another electrical component 810 can be coupled to
another conductor 804 (e.g., a wire or circuit board trace). The conductor 804 can
include any suitable conductive material, for example, copper, tin, iron, aluminum,
gold, or silver.
[0049]         In some embodiments, the conductors 802, 804 can be releasably
coupled by a shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 806.               Further, in some
embodiments, the conductors 802, 804 can be conductively coupled by the shape
memory alloy actuated fastener 806.       The shape-memory alloy actuated fastener
806 can include a shape-memory alloy that includes any conductive material, for
example, copper. In the example shown in FIG. 8, the shape-memory alloy actuated
fastener 806 includes clasps 808 for releasably coupling the conductors 802, 804.
The clasps 808 can include a shape-memory alloy.            In other embodiments, the
shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 806 may not include the clasps 808.
[0050]         In some embodiments, the system 800 can also include a temperature
control device 812. The temperature control device 812 can be in communication
with a power supply 814. In some embodiments, an operator can actuate the power
supply 814, which can transmit power to the temperature-control device 812.           In
other embodiments, a processor can actuate the power supply 814. For example, in
some embodiments, the system 800 (e.g., the electrical component 810) can include

   WO 2016/003405                                                PCT/US2014/044832
                                         17
a temperature sensor. The temperature sensor can send signals to a processor,
which can be positioned within the electrical component 810 or elsewhere.        The
processor can determine, based on the signals from the temperature sensor,
whether a temperature associated with the electrical component 810 or the system
800 has surpassed a threshold. If the threshold has been surpassed, the processor
can operate, for example via the power supply 814, the temperature-control device
812. The temperature-control device 812 can heat or cool the shape-memory alloy
actuated fastener 806, which can cause the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener
806 to change into another physical shape.       This can decouple or couple the
conductors 802, 804.
[0051]        In some embodiments, the system 800 can change temperature
independent from the temperature-control device 812, for example, as a result of
thermal energy from an electrical circuit or electrical circuit component (e.g., a
processor).   The changed temperature of the system 800 can cause the shape
memory alloy actuated fastener 806 to change into another physical shape, for
example, to its high-temperature shape.
[0052]        In some embodiments, the high-temperature shape or low-temperature
shape can include a physical shape in which a piece of the shape-memory alloy
actuated fastener 806 (e.g., the clasps 808) can move, fold, bend, or expand. For
example, the high-temperature shape can include a shape in which the clasps 808
fold more than 90 degrees, as depicted by the arrows, such that the clasps 808
release their grip on the conductor 802. Further, in some embodiments, the shape
memory alloy actuated fastener 806 can bend backwards (i.e., in the direction into
the page), releasing the conductor 802 from the conductor 804.             In some

   WO 2016/003405                                                    PCT/US2014/044832
                                             18
embodiments, this can sever the electrical connection between the conductors 802,
804, preventing electrical communication between the electrical components 810.
[0053]         In one example, the electrical component 810 coupled to the conductor
802 can include a power supply.          The electrical component 810 coupled to the
conductor 804 can include a computer. The shape-memory alloy actuated fastener
806 can electrically couple the conductors 802, 804. In some embodiments, if the
temperature     inside the    power supply or computer surpasses the transition
temperature of the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 806, the shape-memory
alloy actuated fastener 806 can change its physical shape, for example, to its high
temperature shape. This can decouple or release the conductors 802, 804 from one
another.     Decoupling     the   conductors    802,   804   can  break   the   electrical
communication between the power supply and the computer, for example, shutting
down the computer or otherwise preventing the overheating of the computer.              In
some embodiments, the system 800 can include an indicator (e.g., a LED or non
electronic indicator) to notify a user, for example, that the decoupling of the electrical
component 810 was intentional. Upon the temperature inside the computer cooling
below the transition temperature of the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 806,
the shape-memory alloy actuated fastener 806 can change its physical shape, for
example, to its low-temperature shape. This can couple or interlock the conductors
802, 804 to each other, which can reestablish electrical communication between the
power supply and the computer.
[0054]         FIG. 9 is a flow chart of an example of a process for using a shape
memory alloy actuated fastener according to one embodiment.
[0055]         In block 902, multiple components are interlocked with a fastener. The
fastener can include a shape-memory alloy.           The physical shape of the shape-

                                           19
memory alloy can be selectively changeable between a first shape and a second
shape.     In some embodiments, the shape-memory alloy can change between
physical    shapes when      heated    above  a transition  temperature.    In other
embodiments, the shape-memory alloy can change between physical shapes when
cooled below a transition temperature.
[0056]         In block 904, the temperature-control device can heat the fastener
above a transition temperature.       In some embodiments, the temperature-control
device can emit electromagnetic radiation for heating the fastener.          In other
embodiments, the temperature-control device can heat the fastener via thermal
conduction. Any number or combination of heating or cooling methods can be used
to heat or cool the fastener.
[0057]         In block 906, the fastener can change from the first shape into the
second shape. For example, in some embodiments, the fastener can change from
its low-temperature shape into its high-temperature shape.
[0058]         In block 908, the fastener can release two or more of the multiple
components from each other. In some embodiments, the fastener can release all of
the multiple components from each other. In other embodiments, the fastener can
release fewer than all of the multiple components from each other.
[0059]         In some embodiments, the temperature-control device can cool the
fastener below the transition temperature. Further, the fastener can change from the
second shape back into the first shape.
