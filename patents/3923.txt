INDICATOR POST
Cross Reference to Related Applications
[0001] The contents of Australian Provisional Patent Application No. 2015901427 and
International Patent Application No. PCT/AU2016/000137 are incorporated herein by reference
in their entirety.
Field
[0002] The present disclosure relates to an indicator post. In one form, the present disclosure
relates to a flexible indicator post suitable for indicating the position of an object or delineating
a road, lane way or the like.
Background
[0003] Indicator posts are commonly employed by road traffic authorities to visually indicate or
delineate the location of roads, paths and lanes. Furthermore, indicator posts are often utilised by
entities such as water authorities, fire protection authorities and mining companies as an asset or
utility marker post to indicate the position or location of important assets such as pipelines,
valves and drains.
[0004] Flexible indicator posts are used in those situations where a post is likely to suffer from
numerous impacts from either vehicles or other objects. The principle behind these flexible
posts is that upon impact they are able to flex and then subsequently return to a substantially
upright position. In this manner, a flexible post is able to survive an impact unlike a standard
rigid post which will either fracture or bend permanently. As such, flexible posts will tend to
have a greater lifetime when compared to standard rigid posts or semi-flexible posts resulting in
reduced maintenance costs.
[0005] One example of a flexible indicator post is a roadside post that is formed of a single
elongate sheet of spring steel. Spring steel, however, corrodes readily in the general
environment. Accordingly, any post formed of sheet spring steel will necessarily require a
coating such as powder or dip coating to prevent corrosion.

                                                   2
[0006] Unfortunately, coatings of this type will wear. In the case of indicator posts that are
driven into the ground, often the installation of a post will cause deep scratches in the powder
coating from stones and rocks and the like. Similarly, if a post has been subjected to one or
more impacts from a vehicle then this will also cause degradation in the coating. This will result
in the spring steel post corroding and then eventually requiring replacement. In one attempt to
address this problem, the spring steel post may be first galvanised. However, this results in
another manufacturing step with its attendant increases in cost of production and additional
process control issues associated with the galvanising process.
Object of Invention
[0007] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or ameliorate one or
more of the above disadvantages, or at least provide a useful alternative.

parts throughout the figures.
Description of Embodiments
[00045] Referring now to Figures 1 to 5, there is shown an indicator post 100 in accordance
with a first illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Indicator post 100 is formed as an
elongate sheet 110 of stainless steel. In this illustrative embodiment, indicator post is intended to
function as a roadside post with elongate sheet 110 formed of an austenitic stainless steel and in
particular 304 type stainless steel having a hardness in the range of 370-430 Vickers Pyramid
Number (HV).

                                                    6
[00046] Throughout the specification, the term "stainless steel" is taken to mean a steel alloy
with a minimum of 10.5% chromium content by mass.
[00047] Elongate sheet 110 has a generally arcuate shaped cross sectional profile (as best seen
in Figure 3) and includes a stamped flattened portion 120 that provides a planar area for the
attachment of retro-reflective sheet portion 150. Indicator post 100 includes a tapered end 140
coming to a point 141 which aids in the driving of the post 100 into the ground.
[00048] In the example of where indicator post 100 is to be used as a roadside post that is
installed into the ground typically on the side of the road, elongate sheet 110 is coated with a
white reflective coating in accordance with the applicable road safety standards prior to the
attachment of the retro-reflective sheet portion or decal 150. In other examples, where indicator
post 100 may be used to indicate the position or location of important assets such as pipelines,
valves and drains, elongate sheet may be coated with a suitable reflective coating of an
appropriate colour.
[00049] The lower portion of indicator post 100 further includes an upwardly extending tongue
160 formed by punching a slot in elongate sheet 110 which upon installation of the post 100 into
the ground functions to resists upward movement of the post 100. Other ground engaging means
that may be employed include a retention rod which extends horizontally through an aperture in
the post and anchoring devices which may be attached or fastened to post 100 which extend
either horizontally or upwardly and functions to resist upward movement of post 100.
[00050] Post 100 further includes a depth marker line 130 extending horizontally across the
front face of elongate sheet 110 which functions as an installation depth indicator. In another
illustrative embodiment, a second depth marker line is placed at the corresponding location on
the rear of post 100, thereby facilitating installation of post 100 to the correct depth from either
direction. Other examples of installation depth indicators include, but are not limited to, a depth
marker hole comprising a single centrally located aperture located on the post at the height
corresponding to the depth that the indicator post 100 is to be installed into the ground or a
depth marker sticker or tag that is secured to the elongate sheet 110 by mechanical means and/or
by an appropriate adhesive.

                                                  7
[00051] In this illustrative embodiment post 100 has a height of 1400 mm, a width of 104 mm
and a thickness of 1.2 mm. However, depending on the intended location and requirements, post
100 may range in height, thickness, width and arcuate radius of curvature as required.
[00052] Some illustrative height ranges include, but are not limited to, less than 400 mm, 400
mm to 600 mm, 600 mm to 800 mm, 800 mm to 1000 mm, 1000 mm to 1200 mm, 1200 mm to
1400 mm, 1400 mm to 1600 mm, 1600 mm to 1800 mm, 1800 mm to 2000 mm and greater than
2000 mm.
[00053] Some illustrative thickness ranges include, but are not limited to, 0.8 mm to 1.0 mm,
1.0 mm to 1.1 mm, 1.1 mm to 1.2 mm, 1.2 mm to 1.4 mm, 1.4 mm to 1.6 mm, 1.6 mm to
1.8 mm, 1.8 mm to 2.0 mm, 2.0 mm to 2.2 mm, 2.2 mm to 2.4 mm, 2.4 mm to 2.6 mm and
greater than 2.6 mm.
[00054] Some illustrative width ranges include, but are not limited to, less than 40 mm, 40 mm
to 60 mm, 60 mm to 80 mm, 80 mm to 100 mm, 100 mm to 120 mm, 120 mm to 140 mm and
greater than 140 mm.
[00055] Some illustrative radii of curvature include, but are not limited to, less than 100 mm,
100 mm to 120 mm, 120 mm to 140 mm, 140 mm to 160 mm, 160 mm to 180 mm, 180 mm to
200 mm, 200 mm to 220 mm, 220 mm to 240 mm and greater than 240 mm degrees.
[00056] While in this illustrative embodiment, where indicator post 100 is designed to function
as a roadside post, a full hardness 304 type stainless steel has been employed, in other
applications other types of stainless steels may be appropriate for the conditions. In one non
limiting example, where bending forces are expected to be less, such as in the case of an
indicator post which is not likely to be impacted or driven over by vehicles, a lower hardness
stainless steel may be employed such as 304 stainless steel having a hardness in the range of
310-370 HV.
[00057] In yet other examples where indicator post 100 is used to delineate a pathway or and is
only expected to suffer low impact forces from pedestrians, then a 304 stainless steel having a
hardness below 310 HV may be employed. In other examples, where the expected corrosion
environment is not expected to be harsh, a 301 type stainless steel may provide adequate

                                                    8
corrosion resistance, noting that 301 type stainless steel is available in a range of hardness
similar to that of 304 type stainless steel.
[00058] In other embodiments, other types of stainless steel are suitable depending on the
expected physical and environmental conditions that the post must withstand. In one example, a
martensitic type stainless steel such as 410 or 416 type stainless steel may be utilised in those
circumstances where the relevant bending forces are expected to be less and/or the
environmental conditions are not expected to be as harsh. In another example, a martensitic
precipitation hardening stainless steel such as 630 type stainless steel may be employed. In yet
another example, a semi-austenitic precipitation hardening stainless steel such as 631 type
stainless steel may employed. In a further example, a super duplex grade stainless steel such as
2507 type stainless steel may be utilised.
[00059] Referring now to Figure 6, there is shown indicator post 100 in operation. Indicator post
100 is installed in the ground 800 to the level of depth line marker 130. This installation may be
accomplished in a number of different ways. In a first method of installing indicator post 100, a
hole of larger size than the post may be dug or drilled to the suitable depth, post 100 is then
deposited in the hole and the hole then refilled. In a second method of installing indicator post
100, a small pilot or lead hole is drilled into the ground 800 and post 100 may then be driven
into the ground 800 either manually or by use of suitable pneumatic driving equipment. In a
third method of installing indicator post 100, the post may be driven into the ground 800 either
manually or by pneumatic means without the use of a pilot hole.
[00060] In both the second and third methods of installation, the presence of tapered end 140
facilitates the installation of indicator post 100. In a fourth method of installing indicator post
100, a section of the ground 800 may be excavated and filled with a settable material such as
concrete. Before the settable material sets, indicator post is deposited into the settable material
in the upright position. As shown in Figure 6, indicator post 100 when subject to a bending force
such as an impact will resiliently bend and recover to revert upright after application of the
bending force. In those circumstances where indicator post 100 may subject to a tight right angle
bend, such as where the bending force is as a result of direct wheel over by a vehicle, then a
recess may be formed in the ground immediately adjacent to the post to increase the bend radius
at ground level.

                                                  9
 [00061] Referring now to Figures 7 to 11, there is shown an indicator post 200 in accordance
with a second illustrative embodiment of the present invention. As with the first embodiment,
indicator post 200 is for use as a roadside post and includes an elongate sheet 110 of stainless
steel material which in this illustrative embodiment is formed from 301 type stainless having a
hardness in the range of 310-370 HV.
 [00062] Indicator post 200 also includes a driveable base portion 210 including a base
attachment plate 241 welded to a star picket section 230 having a tapered end 240 and coming to
a point 242. Star picket section 230 functions as a rigid insertion portion which is driven into the
ground. In other embodiments, drivable base portion 210 may include a sharpened stake or a
piece of a suitable rigid material having a channel or box section that may or may not include a
tapered end.
 [00063] Base attachment plate 241 is attached to the bottom end of elongate sheet 110 by a
series of rivets 220 but equally, driveable base portion 210 may be attached to elongate sheet
 110 by other suitable attachments means such as by the use of an adhesive or other mechanical
attachment means.
 [00064] Referring now to Figure 12, there is shown an indicator post 200 in operation. In this
illustrative embodiment, indicator post 200 is installed in the ground to the level of the top edge
of attachment plate 241 which forms an installation depth indicator. As with indicator post 100
of the first illustrative embodiment, indicator post 200 may be installed in a number of different
ways. However, the presence of driveable base portion 210 ensures that post 200 is more
suitable to be directly driven into the ground 800. In one illustrative mode of installation, a
jackhammer is employed to drive driveable base portion 210 by locating the end of a
complementary tool inserted into the jackhammer into the notch 231 located at the top of star
picket section 230. In this method of installation, the jackhammer is aligned substantially
parallel and against the indicator post 200 as an installer drives star picket section 230 into the
ground 800. Depending on the type of jackhammer, the indicator post 200 may be inserted
through the handle of the jackhammer which will function to align and retain post 200 to the
jackhammer to facilitate the installation process.
 [00065] Referring now to Figure 13, there is shown a number of different indicator post cross
sectional profiles that are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. Cross

                                                   10
sectional profiles 510, 520 and 530 show reducing radii curvature which in turn results in a
stiffer post for a given thickness. When an indicator post having an arcuate cross section is
subject to a bending force, the post will substantially flatten at the bending point and then
resiliently return to its original profile on removal of the bending force. Cross sectional profiles
540 and 550 have a sectional profile consisting of a series of flat segments 541, 551 that
together form an arcuate ribbed profile. For a given radius of curvature, reducing the number of
flat segments will increase the stiffness of the indicator post but may form crease points where
the post may plastically deform should a substantial bending force be applied.
[00066] The elongate sheet 110 of stainless steel is in one embodiment formed from slit coils of
the required grade of stainless steel having the appropriate thickness and width. The stainless
steel material is then de-coiled and formed in a 250 tonne press to provide an elongate sheet
having the required arcuate sectional profile and shape. In subsequent steps, a barb may be
formed at one end of the sheet if required and the elongate sheet may then be powder coated for
visibility purposes and to meet the relevant standards. Finally, in the case of a roadside post a
retro-reflective decal is applied.
[00067] As would be appreciated, the use of stainless steel provides a resiliently bendable
indicator post having inherent corrosion resistant capability as compared to roadside posts
formed of sheet spring steel which must rely on coating or galvanising post treatments for their
corrosion resistance. As a result, indicator posts in accordance with the above described
embodiments will have greater wearability and are less likely to fail because of a corrosion
induced defect.
[00068] Additionally, stainless steel may be used for indicator posts that are not required to be
resiliently bendable but still have enhanced corrosion resistant capabilities over standard metal
posts formed of mild steel or the like.
[00069] Referring now to Figure 14, in one example, a stainless steel indicator post may have a
sectional profile adapted to increase the rigidity of the post such as a C-section 650, angle 630,
box 610, top hat 620, oval 660, trigonal 670 or channel 640 profile. In the case of the top hat
620 and channel 640 profiles the angle 0 between the side walls 621, 641 and the respective
front wall of the post may be varied from 900 to an angle greater than 90' to reduce the
structural rigidity of the post as required.

                                                    11
[00070] In other examples, as well as, or in addition to changing the sectional profile, the
rigidity of the post may be enhanced by increasing the thickness of the elongate sheet of
stainless steel as required. In this manner, the same stainless steel materials that are employed
for resiliently bendable posts may also be formed into rigid or alternatively semi-flexible posts
that are capable of being manually restraightened after being bent following an impact with a
vehicle.
[00071] In one non-limiting example, a semi-flexible indicator post may comprise an elongate
sheet of stainless steel having a thickness of about 1.2 mm and having a C-section profile or a
top hat profile. In the case of a top hat profile, the angle between the side walls and the front
wall may be about 1350. In another example, the angle between the side walls and the front wall
may be about 1200. In yet another example, the angle between the side walls and the front wall
may be about 1500. In the case of rigid indicator post, an example of a non-limiting embodiment
is an indicator post comprised of an elongate sheet of stainless steel having a thickness of about
1.8 mm and having a channel or box profile.
[00072] Throughout the specification and the claims that follow, unless the context requires
otherwise, the words "comprise" and "include" and variations such as "comprising" and
"including" will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers, but
not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.
[00073] The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement of any form of suggestion that such prior art forms part of the common
general knowledge.
