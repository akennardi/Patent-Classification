                                          ABSTRACT
        The invention provides a method of sustained delivery of a lactam, imide, amide,
sulfonamide, carbamate or urea containing parent drug by administering to a patient an
effective amount of a prodrug compound of the invention wherein upon administration to the
patient, release of the parent drug from the prodrug is sustained release. Prodrug compounds
suitable for use in the methods of the invention are labile conjugates of parent drugs that are
derivatized through carbonyl linked prodrug moieties. The prodrug compounds of the
invention can be used to treat any condition for which the lactam, imide, amide, sulfonamide,
carbamate or urea containing parent drug is useful as a treatment.

    incorporated herein by reference.
    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            (i) Field of the Invention.
            The present invention relates to prodrugs of lactam, amide, imide, sulfonamide,
10  carbamate, urea, benzamide, and acylaniline containing pharmacophores.
            (ii) Background of the Invention.
            Drug delivery systems are often critical for the safe and effective administration
    of a biologically active agent. Perhaps the importance of these systems is best realized
    when patient compliance and consistent dosing are taken under consideration. For
15  instance, reducing the dosing requirement for a drug from four-times-a-day to a single
    dose per day would have significant value in terms of ensuring patient compliance and
    optimizing therapy.
            Optimization of a drug's bioavailability has many potential benefits. For patient
    convenience and enhanced compliance it is generally recognized that less frequent
20  dosing is desirable. By extending the period through which the drug is released, a longer
    duration of action per dose is expected. This will then lead to an overall improvement of
    dosing parameters such as taking a drug once a day where it has previously required four
    doses per day or dosing once a week or even less frequently when daily dosing was
    previously required. Many drugs are presently dosed once per day, but not all of these
25  drugs have pharmacokinetic properties that are suitable for dosing intervals of exactly
    twenty-four hours. Extending the period through which these drugs are released would
    also be beneficial.
            One of the fundamental considerations in drug therapy involves the relationship
    between blood levels and therapeutic activity. For most drugs, it is of primary

   WO 2010/151711                                                          PCT/US2010/039878
    importance that serum levels remain between a minimally effective concentration and a
    potentially toxic level. In pharmacokinetic terms, the peaks and troughs of a drug's blood
    levels ideally fit well within the therapeutic window of serum concentrations. For certain
    therapeutic agents, this window is so narrow that dosage formulation becomes critical.
 5           In an attempt to address the need for improved bioavailability, several drug
    release modulation technologies have been developed. For example, poorly soluble 5,5
    diphenylimidazolidine-2,4-diones have been derivatized into phosphate ester prodrugs to
    improve solubility. (Stella et. al., U.S. Patent No. 4,260,769, 1981). Enteric coatings
    have been used as a protector of pharmaceuticals in the stomach and microencapsulating
10  active agents using proteinaceous microspheres, liposomes or polysaccharides have been
    effective in abating enzymatic degradation of the active agent. Enzyme inhibiting
    adjuvants have also been used to prevent enzymatic degradation.
             A wide range of pharmaceutical formulations provide sustained release through
    microencapsulation of the active agent in amides of dicarboxylic acids, modified amino
15  acids or thermally condensed amino acids. Slow release rendering additives can also be
    intermixed with a large array of active agents in tablet formulations.
             While microencapsulation and enteric coating technologies impart enhanced
    stability and time-release properties to active agent substances these technologies suffer
    from several shortcomings. Incorporation of the active agent is often dependent on
20  diffusion into the microencapsulating matrix, which may not be quantitative and may
    complicate dosage reproducibility. In addition, encapsulated drugs rely on diffusion out
    of the matrix or degradation of the matrix, or both, which is highly dependent on the
    chemical properties and water solubility of the active agent. Conversely, water-soluble
    microspheres swell by an infinite degree and, unfortunately, may release the active agent
25  in bursts with limited active agent available for sustained release. Furthermore, in some
    technologies, control of the degradation process required for active agent release is
    unreliable. For example, because an enterically coated active agent depends on pH to
    release the active agent and pH and residence time varies, the release rate is difficult to
    control.
30           Several implantable drug delivery systems have utilized polypeptide attachment
    to drugs. Additionally, other large polymeric carriers incorporating drugs into their
    matrices are used as implants for the gradual release of drug. Yet another technology
    combines the advantages of covalent drug attachment with liposome formation where the
    active ingredient is attached to highly ordered lipid films.
                                                2

   WO 2010/151711                                                           PCT/US2010/039878
             However there is still a need for an active agent delivery system that is able to
    deliver certain active agents which have been heretofore not formulated or difficult to
    formulate in a sustained release formulation for release over a sustained period of time
    and which is convenient for patient dosing.
 5           There is a generally recognized need for sustained delivery of drugs that reduces
    the daily dosing requirement and allows for controlled and sustained release of the parent
    drug and also avoids irregularities of release and cumbersome formulations encountered
    with typical dissolution controlled sustained release methods.
    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
10           The present invention accomplishes this by extending the period during which a
    lactam, amide, imide, sulfonamide, carbamate, urea, benzamide, acylaniline, and cyclic
    amide containing parent drug is released and absorbed after administration to the patient
    and providing a longer duration of action per dose than the parent drug itself. In one
    embodiment, the compounds suitable for use in the methods of the invention are
15  derivatives of lactam-, amide-, imide-, sulfonamide-, carbamate-, urea-, benzamide-,
    acylaniline-, and cyclic amide -containing parent drugs that are substituted at the amide
    nitrogen or oxygen atom with labile aldehyde-linked prodrug moieties. Preferably, the
    prodrug moieties are hydrophobic and reduce the polarity and solubility of the parent
    drug under physiological conditions.

    moiety of formula I, R1 is other than -CH(RA)OPO 3MY, CH(RA)OP(O)(OH) 2 , or
    CH(RA)OC(O)R 20.
            In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention having Formulas I, II and III
 5  are less soluble, and are preferably at least an order of magnitude less soluble, as
    compared to the parent drug from which they were derived. In one embodiment, the
    prodrugs of Formulas I, II and III have an aqueous solubility of less than about 0.5
    mg/ml, preferably less than about 0.1 mg/mL, preferably less than about 0.01 mg/mL,
    preferably less than about 0.001 mg/mL, preferably less than about 0.0001 mg/mL and
10  even more preferably less than about 0.0000 1 mg/ml when solubility is measured in a
    phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature.
            In a preferred embodiment, a compound of the invention provides sustained
    delivery of the parent drug over hours, days, weeks or months when administered, for
    example, orally or parenterally, to a subject. For example, the compounds can provide
15  sustained delivery of the parent drug for at least 8, 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours or at least 4, 7,
    15, 30, 60, 75 or 90 days or longer. Without being bound by a theory, it is believed that
    the compounds of the invention form an insoluble depot upon parenteral administration,
    for example subcutaneous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal injection. In one
    embodiment a prodrug of the invention may further comprise a sustained release delivery
20  system for providing additional protection of the prodrug from enzymatic or chemical
    degradation.
            In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for sustained delivery of
    a parent lactam, amide, imide, sulfonamide, carbamate, urea, benzamide, or acylaniline
    containing drug to a subject in need thereof. Each of these groups comprises an amidic
25  N-H group. The method comprises administering to the subject an effective amount of a
    prodrug formed by substituting on the NH group a labile, hydrophobic aldehyde-linked
    prodrug moiety wherein the prodrug has reduced solubility under physiological
    conditions compared to the parent drug and provides for longer sustained therapeutic
    levels of the parent drug following administration than observed levels following
30  administration of the parent drug. In a preferred embodiment, the amidic N-H group has
    a pKa of about 5 to about 22, preferably about 5 to about 21, and preferably about 5 to
    about 20.
           In a preferred embodiment, R1 is selected from Table-1.

             In addition to the reaction of aldehyde or ketone to compounds of formula XLV,
    other process for converting secondary lactam groups can be used. For example,

10           The invention further relates the sustained delivery of a compound of formula
    XLV by the administration of a compound of formula 1-111. Upon administration of a
    compound of formula 1-111, the labile R1 moiety may be cleaved off enzymatically,
    chemically or through first phase metabolism giving a compound of formula XLV.
    Without being bound to any theory, it is postulated that for some of the compounds of
15  formula 1-111, the release of a compound of formula XLV upon cleavage of the R1 moiety
    results in a therapeutically active agent. For example such active ingredient can be
    aripiprazole, ziprasidone or bifeprunox. In one embodiment, the sustained release
    comprises a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula XLV in the
    blood stream of the patient for a period of at least about 8, preferably at least about 12,
20  more preferably at least about 24 and even more preferably at least about 36 hours after
    administration of a compound of formula 1-111. In one embodiment, the compound of
    formula XLV is present in the blood stream of the patient for a period selected from: at
    least 48 hours, at least 4 days, at least one week, and at least one month. In one
    embodiment, a compound of formula 1-111 is administered by injection.
25           Compounds of formula IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV,
    XXXVI, and XXXVII are useful for the treatment of neurological and psychological
    disorders. Neurological and psychiatric disorders include, but are not limited to,

    Definitions
             Listed below are definitions of various terms used to describe this invention.
15  These definitions apply to the terms as they are used throughout this specification and
    claims, unless otherwise limited in specific instances, either individually or as part of a
    larger group.
             The term "aliphatic group" or "aliphatic" refers to a non-aromatic moiety that
    may be saturated (e.g. single bond) or contain one or more units of unsaturation, e.g.,
20  double and/or triple bonds. An aliphatic group may be straight chained, branched or
    cyclic, contain carbon, hydrogen or, optionally, one or more heteroatoms and may be
    substituted or unsubstituted.    In addition to aliphatic hydrocarbon groups, aliphatic
    groups include, for example, polyalkoxyalkyls, such as polyalkylene glycols,
    polyamines, and polyimines, for example. Such aliphatic groups may be further
25  substituted. It is understood that aliphatic groups may include alkyl, substituted alkyl,

             For simplicity, chemical moieties that are defined and referred to throughout can
    be univalent chemical moieties (e.g., alkyl, aryl, etc.) or multivalent moieties under the
20  appropriate structural circumstances clear to those skilled in the art. For example, an
    "alkyl" moiety can be referred to a monovalent radical (e.g. CH 3 -CH 2 -), or in other
    instances, a bivalent linking moiety can be "alkyl," in which case those skilled in the art
    will understand the alkyl to be a divalent radical (e.g., -CH 2-CH 2-), which is equivalent
    to the term "alkylene." Similarly, in circumstances in which divalent moieties are
25  required and are stated as being "alkoxy", "alkylamino", "aryloxy", "alkylthio", "aryl",
    "heteroaryl", "heterocyclic", "alkyl" "alkenyl", "alkynyl", "aliphatic", or "cycloalkyl",

 5           As used herein, the term "effective amount of the subject compounds," with
    respect to the subject method of treatment, refers to an amount of the subject compound
    which, when delivered as part of desired dose regimen, brings about management of the
    disease or disorder to clinically acceptable standards.
             "Treatment" or "treating" refers to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired
10  clinical results in a patient. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical
    results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: alleviation of
    symptoms, diminishment of extent of a disease, stabilization (i.e., not worsening) of a
    state of disease, preventing spread (i.e., metastasis) of disease, preventing occurrence or
    recurrence of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration of the
15  disease state, and remission (whether partial or total).
             The term "labile" as used herein refers to the capacity of the prodrug of the
    invention to undergo enzymatic and/or chemical cleavage in vivo thereby forming the
    parent parent drug. As used herein the term "prodrug" means a compounds as disclosed
    herein which is a labile derivative compound of a heteroaromatic NH-containing parent
20  drug which when administered to a patient in vivo becomes cleaved by chemical and/or
    enzymatic hydrolysis thereby forming the parent drug such that a sufficient amount of
    the compound intended to be delivered to the patient is available for its intended
    therapeutic use in a sustained release manner.
             Pharmaceutical Compositions
25           The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a
    therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention formulated
    together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.
             As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient"
    means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid, gel or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating
30  material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can

    agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and
    antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the
10  formulator.
             The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally,
    parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an
    implanted reservoir. In a preferred embodiment, administration is parenteral
    administration by injection.
15           The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional
    non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. In some cases, the
    pH of the formulation may be adjusted with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or
    buffers to enhance the stability of the formulated compound or its delivery form. The
    term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous,
20  intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal,
    intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.
             Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable
    emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the
    active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in
25  the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers
    such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol,
    benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in
    particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol,
    tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and
30  mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include
    adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening,
    flavoring, and perfuming agents.
             Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous
    suspensions, may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or
                                                159

    wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a
    sterile injectable suspension or emulsion, such as INTRALIPID@, LIPOSYN@ or
    OMEGAVEN@, or solution, in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for
    example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. INTRALIPID@ is an intravenous fat emulsion
 5  containing 10-30% soybean oil, 1-10% egg yolk phospholipids, 1-10% glycerin and
    water. LIPOSYN@ is also an intravenous fat emlusion containing 2-15% safflower oil,
    2-15% soybean oil, 0.5-5% egg phosphatides 1-10% glycerin and water.
    OMEGAVEN@ is an emulsion for infusion containing about 5-25% fish oil, 0.5-10%
    egg phosphatides, 1-10% glycerin and water. Among the acceptable vehicles and
10  solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, USP and isotonic sodium
    chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a
    solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed
    including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are
    used in the preparation of injectables.
15           The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a
    bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid
    compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile
    injectable medium prior to use.
             Additional sustained release in accordance with the invention may be
20  accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with
    poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of
    dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form.
    Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is
    accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot
25  forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable
    polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to
    polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can
    be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and
    poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the
30  drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.
             In one preferred embodiment, the formulation provides a sustained release
    delivery system that is capable of minimizing the exposure of the prodrug to water. This
    can be accomplished by formulating the prodrug with a sustained release delivery system
    that is a polymeric matrix capable of minimizing the diffusion of water into the matrix.

    Suitable polymers comprising the matrix include polylactide (PLA) polymers and the
    lactide/glycolide (PLGA) co-polymers.
             Alternatively, the sustained release delivery system may comprise poly-anionic
    molecules or resins that are suitable for injection or oral delivery. Suitable polyanionic
 5  molecules include cyclodextrins and polysulfonates formulated to form a poorly soluble
    mass that minimizes exposure of the prodrug to water and from which the prodrug
    slowly leaves.
             Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories
    which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non
10  irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository
    wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore
    melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.
             Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,
    powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with
15  at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate
    or dicalcium phosphate and/or: a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose,
    glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example,
    carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia,
    c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium
20  carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate,
    e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as
    quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol
    and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i)
    lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols,
25  sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the
    dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.
             Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and
    hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high
    molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
30           The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be
    prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known
    in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents
    and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or
    preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.

    Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and
    waxes.
             Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this
    invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays,
 5  inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a
    pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be
    required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, eye ointments, powders and solutions are
    also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.
             The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active
10  compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes,
    paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones,
    bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.
             Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention,
    excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and
15  polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain
    customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons.
             Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery
    of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing
    the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase
20  the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing
    a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.
             For pulmonary delivery, a therapeutic composition of the invention is formulated
    and administered to the patient in solid or liquid particulate form by direct administration
    e.g., inhalation into the respiratory system. Solid or liquid particulate forms of the active
25  compound prepared for practicing the present invention include particles of respirable
    size: that is, particles of a size sufficiently small to pass through the mouth and larynx
    upon inhalation and into the bronchi and alveoli of the lungs. Delivery of aerosolized
    therapeutics, particularly aerosolized antibiotics, is known in the art (see, for example
    U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,068 to VanDevanter et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,269 to Smith et al.,
30  and WO 98/43650 by Montgomery, all of which are incorporated herein by reference).
    A discussion of pulmonary delivery of antibiotics is also found in U.S. Pat. No.
    6,014,969, incorporated herein by reference.
             By a "therapeutically effective amount" of a prodrug compound of the invention
    is meant an amount of the compound which confers a therapeutic effect on the treated
                                                  162

   WO 2010/151711                                                           PCT/US2010/039878
    subject, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. The
    therapeutic effect may be objective (i.e., measurable by some test or marker) or
    subjective (i.e., subject gives an indication of or feels an effect).
              In accordance with the invention, the therapeutically effective amount of a
 5  prodrug of the invention is typically based on the target therapeutic amount of the parent
    drug. Information regarding dosing and frequency of dosing is readily available for
    many parent drugs from which the prodrugs of the invention are derived and the target
    therapeutic amount can be calculated for each prodrug of the invention. In accordance
    with the invention, the same dose of a prodrug of the invention provides a longer
10  duration of therapeutic effect as compared to the parent drug. Thus if a single dose of the
    parent drug provides 12 hours of therapeutic effectiveness, a prodrug of that same parent
    drug in accordance with the invention that provides therapeutic effectiveness for greater
    than 12 hours will be considered to achieve a "sustained release".
             The precise dose of a prodrug of the invention depends upon several factors
15  including the nature and dose of the parent drug and the chemical characteristics of the
    prodrug moiety linked to the parent drug. Ultimately, the effective dose and dose
    frequency of a prodrug of the invention will be decided by the attending physician within
    the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level
    and dose frequency for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors
20  including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the
    specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight,
    general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of
    administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of
    the treatment; drugs used in combination or contemporaneously with the specific
25  compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.

    The chloromethyl ester above is dried over 4      A molecular    sieves. A solution of
    aripiprazole (45 grams, 0.1 mol) in 1,4-dioxane (800 mL) was sonicated to dissolve the
    aripiprazole completely, and then treated with NaH (38 g, 0.95 mol, 60% dispersion) in
    one portion. After stirring this reaction mixture for 15 minutes at room temperature, the
20  reaction mixture was treated dropwise with chloromethyl ester (0.3 mol.) and a catalytic
    amount of sodium iodide (0.05 mol). The resultant cloudy mixture was heated to 90 0 C
    for 2 hours, cooled to ambient temperature and poured into water. The product was
    extracted with ethyl acetate, and the combined ethyl acetate layers washed with brine,
    dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. Column

    Example 68: Pharmacokinetic Evaluation in Rats
20  Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Prodrugs in Rats Following Intramuscular Injection
             Animals: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington,
    MA) were obtained. Approximately 24 rats were used in each study. Rats were
    approximately 350-375 g at time of arrival. Rats were housed 2 per cage with ad libitum
    chow and water. Environmental conditions in the housing room: 64-67 'F, 30% to 70%
25  relative humidity, and 12:12-h light:dark cycle. All experiments were approved by the
    institutional animal care and use committee.
             Pharmacokinetics study: Rats were dosed IM by means of a 25 gauge, 5/8 inch
    needle with 1 cc syringe 0.3mL suspension was withdrawn from the vial containing the
    test compound (see Table E). The mouse was injected in the muscles of the hind limb
30  after anesthesia with isoflourane. Blood samples were collected via a lateral tail vein
    after brief anesthesia with Isoflurane. A 271 2G needle and lcc syringe without an
    anticoagulant was used for the blood collection. Approximately 350gL of whole blood
    was collected at each sampling time-point of 6 hours, 24 hours and 2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 21,
    28, 35 days after administration. Once collected, whole blood was immediately

    transferred to tubes containing K2 EDTA, inverted 10-15 times and immediately placed
    on ice. The tubes were centrifuged for 2 minutes at >14,000 g's (11500 RPMs using
    Eppendorf Centrifuge 5417C, F45-30-11 rotor) at room temperature to separate plasma.
    Plasma samples were transferred to labeled plain tubes (MICROTAINER@) and stored
 5  frozen at < -70'C.
            Data Analysis: Drug concentrations in plasma samples were analyzed by liquid
    chromatography-mass spectroscopy using appropriate parameters for each compound.
    Half-life, volume of distribution, clearance, maximal concentration, and AUC were
    calculated by using WinNonlin Version 5.2_software (Pharsight, St. Louis, MO).

    Example 70- Pharmacodynamic Studies Using an Amphetamine-Induced
    Locomotion Model
10         Introduction: Prodrugs of the invention useful in the treatment of schizophrenia
    and bipolar disorder show predictive validity in rodent models of hyperlocomotion. D
    Amphetamine-induced locomotion is postulated to mimic the dopaminergic
                                                   189

   WO 2010/151711                                                         PCT/US2010/039878
    hyperactivity which forms the basis for the "dopamine hypothesis" of schizophrenia.
    The AMPH-induced hyperactivity model provides a simple, initial screen of
    antipsychotic compound efficacy. See, Fell et al., JournalofPharmacologyand
    Experimental Therapeutics (2008) 326:209-217. Amphetamine induced hyperactivity
 5  was used to screen various doses of orally administered (PO) prodrug formulations of
    aripiprazole to measure pharmacodynamic efficacy in an acute hyperlocomotion
    paradigm. The hypothesis of the study is that PO administration of aripiprazole prodrug
    formulations, which result in plasma concentrations of -100-200 ng/ml, will produce a
    significant attenuation of AMPH-induced locomotion.
10          General behavior and activity can be measured in experimental animals (typically
    rats and mice) in order to assess psychomotor stimulant properties, anxiogenic /
    anxiolytic or sedative properties of a drug. As such, open-field studies can provide
    insight into the behavioral effects of test compounds.   Certain prodrugs of the present
    invention are useful in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Aripiprazole
15  is a parent lactam containing drug from which some of the prodrugs of the invention are
    derived that is useful in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Such
    aripiprazole prodrugs of the invention show predictive validity in rodent models of
    hyperlocomotion. D-Amphetamine-induced locomotion is postulated to mimic the
    dopaminergic hyperactivity which forms the basis for the "dopamine hypothesis" of
20  schizophrenia. Likewise, glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist (MK-801, PCP, etc.)
    induced locomotion is postulated to mimic the NMDA hypoactivity hypothesis of
    schizophrenia (Fell et al., supra). These tests of drug-induced hyperactivity provide
    simple, initial screens of antipsychotic compound efficacy. Amphetamine induced
    hyperactivity will be used to screen various prodrugs of aripiprazole, administered PO in
25  oil solutions, to measure pharmacodynamic efficacy. The results of the D-AMPH
    induced locomotion done in this study will be compared to the historical results of
    subcutaneous (S.C.) aripiprazole administration on D-AMPH. The hypothesis of the
    study is that PO exposure to aripiprazole prodrugs, which results in aripiprazole
    concentrations of 100-200ng/ml at locomotor testing, will display efficacy in in-vivo
30  measures of antipsychotic efficacy.
            Materials: Experimental animals: 12, Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from
    Charles River Laboratory. The rats were approximately 90 days old, and weighed in the
    range of 350-275 grams upon receipt from the supplier. One rat was placed in a cage and

    allowed to acclimate for about 1 week. The rats were provided with food and water ad
    libitum.
            Dosing solution of D-Amphetamine (D-AMPH): D-AMPH was purchased from
    Sigma Aldrich. D-amphetamine HCl was prepared in 0.9% saline to a concentration of
 5  1.5mg/ml. D-Amphetamine was given I.P. per body weight at a dose of lml/kg
    (=1.5mg/kg). Salt form correction was not used in accordance with historical literature.
    D-Amphetamine was prepared fresh from solid form 30 min. prior to each test period.

            Behavior Box:    The behavior chambers were purchased from Med Associates,
    Inc. of St. Albans, VT, Model ENV-515.       Software for measuring animal movement is
    provided with the behavior chamber by the supplier.
            Methods: Following 1 week habituation to the animal facility, the activity
 5  assessments commenced. The animals were initially acclimated to the behavior box for
    about 15 minutes before they were removed from the box and injected PO with 1.5 ml of
    an aripiprazole prodrug compound of the invention, at concentrations which produce PK
    levels of 100-200 ng/ml approximately 1 hour after administration. After an additional
    15 minutes the animals were placed back in the behavior box for an additional 30 minute
10  drug-baseline test session. The mice were then administered by IP injection, D-AMPH
    (1.5 mg/kg) followed by a 60 minute experimental behaviorial measurement period. The
    parameters that were measured were a) total distance measured (primary measure), b)
    total number of ambulatory moves (second measure), c) total number of vertical moves
    (secondary measure) and d) time spent immobile (secondary measure).
15          Blood Sampling:     Tail vein blood was taken on experiment days immediately
    following locomotor activity measurements (2-hours post-prodrug administration) and
    again the following day a time-point corresponding to 22 hours post-prodrug
    administration. Blood samples were collected via a lateral tail vein after anesthesia with
    Isoflurane. A 2712 G syringe without an anticoagulant was used for the blood collection,
20  and the whole blood transferred to pre-chilled (wet ice) tubes containing K2 EDTA.
    0.5ml of blood per animal was collected per time point. The tubes were inverted 15-20
    times and immediately returned to the wet ice until being centrifuged for 2 minutes >
    14,000g to separate plasma. The plasma samples prepared in this manner were
    transferred to labeled plain tubes (MICROTAINER*) and stored frozen at < -70'C.

            Behavioral Data Acquisition: Behavioral data was captured electronically by the
    software package associated with the behavior chambers.       Data was transformed and
    analyzed via GRAPHPAD PRISM® 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).
    The data was analyzed using a 2-way repeated measures ANOVA.
30  Results and Discussion: The results are shown in Figures 6 and 7. The results indicate
    that orally administered D-AMPH caused a significant increase in the total distance
    traveled by the mice as compared to mice who were administered only saline. The
                                             192

    results also indicate that aripiprazole prodrug compound 4 of the invention significantly
    inhibited the increases in distance traveled caused by D-AMPH. The inhibition of
    distance travelled by compound 4 did not appear to be dose dependent.          Likewise,
    aripiprazole prodrug compounds 7 and 47 did appear to significantly inhibit increases in
 5  distance traveled caused by D-AMPH at the higher dose of 20 mg. This data indicates
    that in accordance with the invention, the prodrug compounds are cleaved in vivo to
