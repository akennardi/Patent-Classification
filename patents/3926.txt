ABSTRACT
A structure that is storable in a collapsed form and upwardly extensible in a locked operative
condition when required for use, is adapted for mounting to a drawer assembly, for concealed
stowage in a drawer, such as a drawer in a kitchen installation, when not in use. The structure
is made up of a functional platform connected to an extensible and collapsible supporting
assembly, displacement means interacting with the supporting assembly to displace the
platform alternately from its inutile condition when the structure is in collapsed configuration,
to a utile location in which the supporting assembly is in extended configuration. The platform
may offer a step for supporting the weight of a person or a temporary working surface.
Releasable locking means releasably lock the supporting assembly alternately in extended
configuration and in collapsed configuration, and release means are provided for releasing the
locking means. When released, alternate extension or collapsing of the support assembly
ensues automatically.

FURNITURE MOUNTABLE EXTENSIBLE STRUCTURE
Field of invention
[01]       This invention relates to a temporarily extensible weight-bearing
structure that is retractable for stowing away beneath a cupboard structure or
other furnishing item when not in use.
Background to the invention
[02]       In order to reach high places such as shelves mounted above a lower
cabinet or other furnishing standing on the floor of a room, a person is often
obliged to use a ladder, or may choose a more hazardous form of platform, such
as a chair or stool. To overcome the inconvenience, it has been proposed to
provide a built-in step mechanism that can be withdrawn from a storage cavity in
a furnishing unit for temporary use, before being stowed away.
[03]       One such mechanism is proposed in US patent number 5,005,667. It
has a drawback in that the actual step needs to be touched in order to release
the extending mechanism to cause the step surface to emerge for use.
[04]       Patent    application  publication   US    2014/0111072    discloses  an
extending drawer on which is mounted a collapsible structure including a step. A
drawback of this publication is that it does not address the problem of providing
for releasable automatic locking of the supporting assembly alternately in both
the extended configuration and in collapsed condition. In the case of causing the
structure to fold or collapse, the user is required to push the structure down until
the required degree of collapsing has been achieved for the structure to fit back
into the drawer.
[05]       A similar mechanism, requiring similar action by the user, is disclosed
in EP 1366692 (see paragraph [019] thereof).         In Japanese patent publication
H09-299176 A, pressing foot pedal releases a raised seat from operative position

                                              2
to a collapsed position, but further foot action is required to lock it in place, ready
for stowage.
Objects of the invention
[06]       It is an object of this invention to address the shortcomings of the prior
art and, in doing so, to provide apparatus for providing a temporarily extensible,
weight-bearing structure that may be stored away when not in use.
[07]       The preceding discussion of the background to the invention is
intended to facilitate an understanding of the present invention.           However, it
should be appreciated that the discussion is not an acknowledgement or
admission that any of the material referred to was part of the common general
knowledge in Australia or elsewhere as at the priority date of the present
application.
[08]       Further, and unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout
the description and the claims, the words 'comprise', 'comprising', and the like
are to be construed in an inclusive sense - that is of "including, but not being
limited to" - as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense - that is meaning
"including this and nothing else".
Summary of invention
[09]       According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an
upwardly extensible and selectively collapsible structure adapted for mounting to
a drawer assembly for concealed stowage in a drawer when not in use, the
structure comprising:
           a. A functional platform connected to an extensible and collapsible
                supporting assembly,
           b. Displacement means interacting with the supporting assembly to
                cause displacement of the functional platform alternately from
                inutile location in which the supporting assembly is in collapsed
                configuration, to utile location in which the supporting assembly is in
                extended configuration,

                                           3
           c. Releasable locking means for releasably locking the supporting
              assembly alternately in extended configuration and in collapsed
              configuration, and
           d. Release means operable for releasing the locking means, which,
              when released, allows automatic operation of the displacement
               means to cause alternate extension or collapsing of the support
              assembly.
[010]      In a preferred form of the invention, the releasable locking means
comprises a member that is fixed to the release means, the member having a
formation for receiving and holding against displacement once received, a
displaceable component that is mechanically connected to the supporting
assembly.
[011]      In a further preferred form of the invention, the member comprises a
latching plate having a slot formed therein, the formation being defined by first
and second bays located at respective opposite ends of the slot.
[012]      The release means is preferably operable to incline the slot of the
latching plate relative to the displaceable component.
[013]      The displacement means preferably comprises first and second biasing
means installed in the structure to cause displacement of the displaceable
component between the bays of the slot in respective opposite directions.
[014]      The first biasing means causes displacement of the displaceable
component to the first bay to be received therein, whereby displacement of the
component towards the first bay causes extension of the assembly and
displacement of the platform to reach utile location when the component is
received in the bay.
[015]      In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first bay is located
closer to an outer end of the drawer than the second bay.

                                           4
[016]      The first biasing means preferably comprises a gas spring. The gas
spring is operatively arranged to connect the release means to the supporting
assembly.
[017]      The gas spring is preferably touch-activated.
[018]      Further, according to a preferred form of the invention, the second
biasing means operates to urge the displaceable component to the second bay,
whereby displacement of the component causes collapse of the assembly and
displacement of the platform to inutile location.
[019]      In an embodiment of this form of the invention, the second bay is
located more proximate to an inner end of the drawer than the first bay.
[020]      In a preferred embodiment, the second biasing means comprises a
coiled spring. Preferably, an end of the coiled spring is operatively connected to
the locking means and a coiled portion of the spring is operatively located around
an element of the release means.
[021]      In a further preferred embodiment, the element comprises a rod fixed
to a manually operable lever.
[022]      The structure is adapted to support weight placed upon it. Preferably,
the functional platform is weight-supporting, being connected to the support
assembly comprising pivotally-connected link elements of scissor type.
[023]      The platform, in an embodiment, is capable of supporting the weight of
an adult human of reasonable proportions.
[024]      The functional platform may comprise a step. The step may comprise
a frame supporting a tread plate secured thereto.
[025]      In a further preferred form of the invention, the structure is mounted on
a drawer assembly, comprising a carriage             having a soft-touch opening
mechanism, operable to cause the structure to be expelled from within a
furnishing item, wherein said structure has been fitted for use.

                                            5
[026]     Expulsion of the structure preferably will result in the release means
being exposed for activation by a human operator, activation causing automatic
extension of the supporting assembly without further action by the operator.
[027]     According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an
upwardly extensible and selectively collapsible weight-bearing structure in kit
form, the structure being adapted for mounting to a drawer assembly for
concealed stowage in a drawer when not in use, the kit comprising:
          a. A functional platform connected to an extensible and collapsible
              supporting assembly,
          b. Displacement means interacting with the supporting assembly to
              cause displacement of the functional platform alternately from
              inutile location in which the supporting assembly is in collapsed
              configuration, to utile location in which the supporting assembly is in
              extended configuration,
          c. Releasable locking means for releasably locking the supporting
              assembly alternately in extended configuration and in collapsed
              configuration, and
          d. Release means operable for releasing the locking means, which,
              when released, allows automatic operation of the displacement
              means to cause alternate extension or collapsing of the support
              assembly.
[028]     The kit may further comprise mounting means, whereby the structure is
movably mountable within a cavity within a furnishing item, preferably to be
concealed therein when not in use.
[029]     Preferably, the displacement means is operable to cause the structure
to move from a first, retracted position within the cavity, to said utile location
beyond the cavity.

                                              6
[030]        According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a
furnishing having an internal cavity and, movably mounted within said cavity, an
outwardly-displaceable structure having mounted thereon:
             a. A functional platform connected to an extensible and collapsible
                supporting assembly connected to the structure,
             b. Displacement means interacting with the supporting assembly to
                cause displacement of the functional platform alternately from
                 inutile location in which the supporting assembly is in collapsed
                configuration, to utile location in which the supporting assembly is in
                extended configuration,
             c. Releasable locking means for releasably locking the supporting
                assembly alternately in extended configuration and in collapsed
                configuration, and
             d. Release means operable for releasing the locking means, which,
                when released, allows automatic operation of the displacement
                 means to cause alternate extension or collapsing of the support
                assembly
[031]        In a preferred embodiment, the release means comprises a foot
activated actuation mechanism.

Detailed description of an embodiment of the invention
[033]      The invention provides a frame which is mounted within a cavity in a
furnishing, to be withdrawable therefrom. At least partially within the frame is
mounted an extensible structure that is extensible from a collapsed configuration,
which fits within the cavity, to an operative extended configuration when
withdrawn from the cavity. The structure in extended configuration provides a
weight-bearing assembly, which is collapsible towards the frame, for rehousing in
the cavity when not in use. A foot-actuated mechanism causes emergence and

                                            8
withdrawal of the frame, as well as extension and collapsing of the structure from
and back to the frame, and comprises means for engaging the frame and
structure in emerged and extended condition, as well as alternatively in collapsed
and withdrawn condition.
[034]       The invention will now be described with particular reference to an
embodiment in which the structure supports a stepping platform on to which a
human user may step in order to gain elevation. Referring to Figure 1, in a
preferred embodiment of this invention, an extensible step assembly is generally
denoted by the number 10 and shown in perspective view, but partially
assembled, in its withdrawn and raised, weight-supporting configuration.
[035]       The step assembly comprises an upper frame 12 and a lower frame 14
of vertically oriented flat bars, defining opposite rear 16 and front 16' long sides,
connected by opposed short sides 18,18' for each frame.             Lower frame 14
defines a chassis, in the form of a flat open-topped tray or drawer, on and within
which various components are mounted, as discussed below. The upper frame,
when supporting a step, as in this embodiment, provides an upper closure for the
chassis.    Essentially, chassis and step-forming closure, when lowered to close
the chassis, together define a cartridge or cassette, within which an extensible
structure is housed.
[036]       The frames are represented in Figure 1 as being made of a transparent
material, such as Perspex TM . This is for convenience of illustrating the assembly
and its component mechanism, rendering otherwise obscured components of the
supporting structure visible: It will be appreciated that these transparent elements
may in other embodiments be replaced by opaque materials, dependent on
aesthetics, working environment and structural requirements.             Non-limiting
examples of suitable substances include aluminium or wood or composites
including ceramics or plastics, as are known in the art.
[037]       Frames 12 and 14 are inter-connected by means of scissor links 20,20'
having paired arms 22,24 and 22',24' with respective pivotal connections 26,26'.
Pairs of upper and lower pivot pins 28,30 and 28',30' provide pivotal attachment
at fixed locations to the upper and lower frames 12, 14 proximate the front side

                                           9
16'.   Rearwardly located pairings of paired link pins 32,34 and 32',34' provide
similar pivotal attachment, but are connected to be displaceable back and forth
from position R to position E in upper and lower roller guide slots 36,38 and
36',38' located in end elements 18,18' of the respective frames, as shown in
Figure 2.
[038]      As is shown in Figure 4 (to be discussed below), a stepping plate 40 is
placed over upper frame 12 and secured to it by conventional fastening means,
for example an angle bracket, bolts and screws. Attached similarly to the front of
lower frame 14 is a kick-board 42. The kick-board is selected to blend
aesthetically with the frontage of the furnishing item in which assembly 10 is to be
installed.
[039]      When roller pins 32 and 34 are at position E in their respective guide
slots 36 and 38, link arms 22 and 24 cross each other approximately at right
angles, separating frame 12 from frame 14. When the same rollers are moved to
position R (retracted), the distance of separation between the frames is reduced,
lowering upper frame 12 toward floor plate 58 of lower frame 14.
[040]       Before the upper frame can be raised from its folded down, storage
position, the chassis needs to be expelled from the cavity in the furnishing unit in
which it is housed. Facilitating expulsion and fixed to lower frame 14 are left and
right soft-touch locking drawer runner mechanisms 74 of known design and
operation. A supplier is Dunn & Watson Pty Ltd of 1378 Hemmant Road, Lytton,
Queensland (website <dunnandwatson.com.au>). These provide spring-biased
carriage for the frames of the assembly from stored folder position to expelled
position. Expulsion is initiated by a soft touch by a user, which causes
disengagement of a retaining latch. To return the frames to the storage cavity
after use, the user pushes the frames against the force of the spring biasing via
the kickplate, forcing the assembly back into the storage cavity until relatched. In
this embodiment, the runners are shown in side-mounted orientation relative to
lower frame 14, but in other embodiments they may be suitably mounted below
frame 14. This option permits adaptation of the assembly to the spatial
parameters of the receiving cavity in the furnishing.

                                           10
[041]       In order to cause the frames to be displaced relative to each other once
expelled from storage, so that the upper frame is raised to the operative level
above the lower frame, a propulsion device in the form of a gas spring of known
operation, and an actuating and latching mechanism are provided. The latter
comprises a lever-operated 2-position spring-loaded latching mechanism. The
lever is foot operated in this embodiment, but may be hand operable in an
alternative embodiment.
[042]       The latching mechanism comprises a foot-operable lever 60, as
illustrated in Figures 3 to 7.    Lever 60 is secured to rotatable rod 44, which is
welded to latch plate 46.         The latch plate comprises a slot 52, extending
longitudinally through it. The slot has first and second engagement bays 48 and
50 located at opposite ends thereof.
[043]       Latch plate 46 is movably connected to scissor links 20, 20' via a short
shaft 72 that extends from scissor arm 24, through the latch plate slot 52 and is
retained in the slot by a nut 56. Shaft 72 is moveable along and within slot 52,
from one retention bay 48 to the other 50 and back again.
[044]       A pair of coiled springs 54 serves to bias latch-plate 46 upwardly, away
from floor plate 58, thereby maintaining engagement between shaft extension 72
(which has retaining nut 56)       and whichever of retention bays 48 and 50 it is
located in. In order to cause the shaft to disengage from the cavity it occupies,
the user must exert a downward force vector on lever 60, which transmits
torsional force to rod 44 and against the upward force vector applied by coiled
spring 54 the upper end 76 of which is located in slot 52, as shown in Figure 4.
[045]       Downward pressure exerted on lever 60, is transmitted to act against
the coiled springs 54, forcing shaft portion 72 up and out of its place of retention
in rear bay 48 (distally located from the kick plate 42 - see Figure 7), so that it
slides along the groove to engage in the opposite, forward bay 50. The force that
propels shaft portion 72 forward is provided by gas spring 68, which is pivotally
coupled to a tie bar 64 and to drive rod 44. Tie bar 64 connects opposite scissor
arms 24, 24' to co-ordinate their pivoting movements in causing alternate
separation and bringing together of upper and lower frames 12, 14.

                                          11
[046]      Lower frame 14 has a floor plate 58 secured to it at its bottom edges to
define a tray having the flat bar frame elements 16,16',18,18' forming a side wall.
The floor plate provides increased structural stability to the assembly in extended
configuration. Plate 58 also provides a stable surface against which spring end
62 of coiled spring 54 bears to provide counterforce in use.
[047]      Connected to tie bar 64, is the piston end 66 of a gas spring 68 of
conventional design. The cylinder end 70 of the gas spring is connected to drive
rod 44. Interaction between the gas spring and coiled springs via rod 44 is such
as to cause gentle raising of the step assembly from its storage cavity under
power of the gas spring, when a user presses foot-lever 60 to release the latch
that holds the assembly in retracted position as described above with reference
to Figure 5.
[048]      Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the step assembly extended in the context
of a cupboard 78 having a side panel 80 and front panel 82.
[049]      Referring to Figure 5 and Figure 9, the step assembly is in its
withdrawn state, being stored for example in a cavity 80 beneath a cupboard unit
78 with front panel 82 and side panel 84. The cupboard is positioned on floor
surface 86. The assembly in expelled configuration is shown in the context of a
cupboard unit in Figure 8.
[050]      When the scissor link pairs 22,24 and 22',24' are unfolded, raising
interconnected upper frame 12 away from lower frame 14, upper frame 12
provides a structure capable of supporting the weight of an adult human when
stepped on. Preferably, the structure is capable of supporting 200kg.
[051]      The action of the mechanism constituted by the chassis of the lower
frame, the scissor links and the latch assembly is such as to cause emergence of
the step supported by the upper frame from the storage cavity before the step is
raised to operative height.
[052]      To fold down the step and return it to storage, the user will disengage
the latch 46 by pressing lever 60, and then push the step down so that scissor
links 20,20' fold together, collapsing the structure. Once they have collapsed to

                                         12
minimum height for entering the storage cavity, the user will push the assembly
into the cavity. The action of pushing the assembly into the cavity causes the gas
spring to compress, and become ready for causing raising of the assembly again
when next required. To prevent this happening until required again, the user will
again push down on lever 60, to re-engage the latch with shaft 72 in the rearward
engagement bay 48. When the user next wishes to use the step, they will begin
the cycle again by pressing on level 60 to disengage the raising mechanism
again.
[053]      In Figure 10, there is shown an embodiment of the invention assembly
100, in which a pair of telescopically extensible drawer sliders 94, denoted in
Figures 1 to 9 by the number 74, are shown mounted in flat orientation,
horizontally to the bottom of frame 14, which then passes over the telescopically
retracting sliders as it is pushed back into cavity 80 of furnishing unit 78 for
storage.    The release and engagement mechanism for raising the functional
surface 40 via scissor links 20, comprises a foot-operated lever 60 and latch plate
46 as before, and a gas spring 68.
[054]      Referring to Figure 11, there is shown in side view an alternative
embodiment in which a functional platform 112 is supported by a multiplicity of
link arms 122,124 in relation to a cupboard unit 178.      By way of example, the
platform may be in the form of a series of horizontally-disposed parallel bars 114
defining a clothes horse. In an embodiment, heating elements are incorporated
into the bars over which damp clothing or cloths may be hung out. Instead of
bars, there may be flexible clothes lines, suitable for the drying of kitchen cloths
or dish drying cloths. When such items have reached a condition of satisfactory
dryness, they may be removed and the assembly retracted and stored pending
later use.
[055]       Instead of a clothes-drying apparatus, the upper functional platform
may provide a table-like temporary work surface, or alternatively a seat.
Accordingly, depending on end use requirements, the number of scissor links
may be varied.

                                          13
[056]      The scissor-linked assembly is able to be extended and collapsed as
suggested by directional arrow A to be rested partially within frame elements 116
and 118.      The assembly is able to be pushed back into a cavity 180, on
telescopic touch activated sliders 174, and expelled in the direction of arrow D as
described in relation to Figures 1 to 10.
[057]      Illumination devices such as light emitting diodes may in further
embodiments be incorporated into the assembly for functional or decorative
purposes.
[058]      These embodiments merely illustrate particular examples of the
assembly, kit and apparatus of the invention providing an extensible step. With
the insight gained from this disclosure, the person skilled in the art is well placed
to discern further embodiments by means of which to put the claimed invention
into practice.
