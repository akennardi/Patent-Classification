                                     ABSTRACT
Loudspeakers are described that may reduce comb filtering effects perceived by a
listener by either 1) moving transducers closer to a sound reflective surface (e.g.,
a baseplate, a tabletop or a floor) through vertical (height) or rotational
adjustments of the transducers or 2) guiding sound produced by the transducers
to be released into the listening area proximate to the reflective surface through
the use of horns and openings that are at a prescribed distance from the reflective
surface. The reduction of this distance between the reflective surface and the
point at which sound emitted by the transducers is released into the listening
area may lead to shorter reflected path that reduces comb filtering effects caused
by reflected sounds that are delayed relative to the direct sound. Accordingly,
the loudspeakers shown and described may be placed on reflective surfaces
without severe audio coloration caused by reflected sounds.

                                        FIELD
[0002] A loudspeaker is disclosed for reducing the effects caused by reflections
off a surface on which the loudspeaker is resting. In one embodiment, the
loudspeaker has individual transducers that are situated to be within a specified
distance from the reflective surface, e.g., a baseplate which is to rest on a tabletop
or floor surface, such that the travel distances of the reflected sounds and direct
sounds from the transducers are nearly equivalent. Other embodiments are also
described.
                                   BACKGROUND
[0003] Loudspeakers may be used by computers and home electronics for
outputting sound into a listening area. A loudspeaker may be composed of
multiple electro-acoustic transducers that are arranged in a speaker cabinet. The
speaker cabinet may be placed on a hard, reflective surface such as a tabletop. If
the transducers are in close proximity to the tabletop surface, reflections from the
tabletop may cause an undesirable comb filtering effect to a listener. Since the
reflected path is longer than the direct path of sound, the reflected sound may
arrive later in time than the direct sound. The reflected sound may cause
                                           -1-

1002212719
constructive or destructive interference with the direct sound (at the listener's
ears), based on phase differences between the two sounds (caused by the delay.)
[0004] The approaches described in this Background section are approaches that
could be pursued, but not necessarily approaches that have been previously
conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, it should not be
assumed that any of the approaches described in this section qualify as prior art
or common general knowledge merely by virtue of their inclusion in this section.
                                      SUMMARY
[0004A] As used herein, except where the context requires otherwise, the term
"comprise" and variations of the term, such as "comprising", "comprises" and
"comprised", are not intended to exclude further additives, components, integers
or steps.
[0004B] According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided an electronic
device, comprising: a cabinet; and audio transducers distributed radially about
an interior of the cabinet, each of the audio transducers acoustically coupled to an
acoustic pathway that redirects audio generated by the audio transducers first
downward toward a base of the cabinet and then radially outward through a
sound output opening defined by the cabinet.
[0004C] According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided an
electronic device, comprising: a cabinet; and audio transducers radially
distributed within the cabinet and diaphragms of each of the audio transducer
oriented such that a forward face of each of the diaphragms is oriented inward
toward a central region of the cabinet.
[0004D] According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided an
electronic device, comprising: a cabinet; and an array of audio transducers
                                          -2-

1002212719
disposed within the cabinet at a radial interval, each of the audio transducers
being configured to generate audio waves that exit the cabinet through sound
output openings defined by a downward facing end of the cabinet.
[0005] In one arrangement, a loudspeaker is provided with a ring of transducers
that are aligned in a plane, within a cabinet. In one arrangement, the
loudspeaker may be designed to be an array where the transducers are all
replicates so that each is to produce sound in the same frequency range. In other
arrangement, the loudspeaker may be a multi-way speaker in which not all of the
transducers are designed to work in the same frequency range. The loudspeaker
may include a baseplate coupled to a bottom end of the cabinet. The baseplate
may be a solid flat structure that is sized to provide stability to the loudspeaker
so that the cabinet does not easily topple over while the baseplate is seated on a
tabletop or on another surface (e.g., the floor). The ring of transducers may be
located at a bottom of the cabinet and within a predefined distance from the
baseplate, or within a predefined distance from a a tabletop or floor (in the case
where no baseplate is used and the bottom end of the cabinet is to rest on the
tabletop or floor.) The transducers may be angled downward toward the bottom
end at a predefined acute angle, so as to reduce comb filtering caused by
reflections of sound from the transducer off of the tabletop or floor, in
comparison to the transducers being upright.
[0006] Sound emitted by the transducers may be reflected off the baseplate or
other reflective surface on which the cabinet is resting, before arriving at the ears
of a listener, along with direct sound from the transducers. The predefined
distance may be selected to ensure that the reflected sound path and the direct
sound path are similar, such that comb-filtering effects perceptible by the listener
are reduced. In some arrangements, the predefined distance may be selected
based on the size or dimensions of a corresponding transducer or based on the
                                           -3-

1002212719
set of audio frequencies to be emitted by the transducer.
[0007] In one arrangement, this predefined distance may be achieved through the
angling of the transducers downward toward the bottom end of the cabinet. This
rotation or tilt may be within a range of values such that the predefined distance
is achieved without causing undesired resonance. In one arrangement, the
transducers have been rotated or tilted to an acute angle, e.g., between 37.5' and
42.50, relative to the bottom end of the cabinet (or if a baseplate is used, relative to
the baseplate.)
[0008] In another arrangement, the predefined distance may be achieved through
the use of horns. The horns may direct sound from the transducers to sound
output openings in the cabinet that are located proximate to the bottom end.
Accordingly, the predefined distance in this case may be between the center of
the opening and the tabletop, floor, or baseplate, since the center of the opening is
the point at which sound is allowed to propagate into the listening area.
Through the use of horns, the predefined distance may be shortened without the
need to move or locate the transducers themselves proximate to the bottom end
or to the baseplate.
[0009] As explained above, the loudspeakers described herein may show
improved performance over traditional loudspeakers. In particular, the
loudspeakers described here may reduce comb filtering effects perceived by a
listener due to either 1) moving transducers closer to a reflective surface on
which the loudspeaker may be resting (e.g., the baseplate, or directly on a
tabletop or floor) through vertical or rotational adjustments of the transducers or
2) guiding sound produced by the transducers so that the sound is released into
the listening area proximate to the reflective surface, through the use of horns
and through openings in the cabinet that are at the prescribed distance from the
                                          -4-

1002212719
reflective surface. The reduction of this distance, between the reflective surface
and the point at which sound emitted by the transducers is released into the
listening area, reduces the reflective path of sound and may reduce comb filtering
effects caused by reflected sounds that are delayed relative to the direct sound.
Accordingly, the loudspeakers shown and described may be placed on reflective
surfaces without severe audio coloration caused by reflected sounds.
[0010] The above summary does not include an exhaustive list of all aspects of
the present invention. It is contemplated that the invention includes all systems
and methods that can be practiced from all suitable combinations of the various
aspects summarized above, as well as those disclosed in the Detailed Description
below and particularly pointed out in the claims filed with the application. Such
combinations have particular advantages not specifically recited in the above
summary.

                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0049] Several embodiments are described with reference to the appended
drawings are now explained. While numerous details are set forth, it is
understood that some embodiments of the invention may be practiced without
these details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures, and techniques
have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the understanding of this
description.
[0050] Figure 1 shows a view of a listening area 101 with an audio receiver 103, a
loudspeaker 105, and a listener 107. The audio receiver 103 may be coupled to
the loudspeaker 105 to drive individual transducers 109 in the loudspeaker 105 to
emit various sound beam patterns into the listening area 101. In one
embodiment, the loudspeaker 105 may be configured and is to be driven as a
loudspeaker array, to generate beam patterns that represent individual channels
                                          -9-

1002212719
of a piece of sound program content. For example, the loudspeaker 105 (as an
array) may generate beam patterns that represent front left, front right, and front
center channels for a piece of sound program content (e.g., a musical composition
or an audio track for a movie). The loudspeaker 105 has a cabinet 111, and the
transducers 109 are housed in a bottom 102 of the cabinet 111 and to which a
baseplate 113 is coupled as shown.
[0051] Figure 2A shows a component diagram of the audio receiver 103
according to one embodiment. The audio receiver 103 may be any electronic
device that is capable of driving one or more transducers 109 in the loudspeaker
105. For example, the audio receiver 103 may be a desktop computer, a laptop
computer, a tablet computer, a home theater receiver, a set-top box, or a
smartphone. The audio receiver 103 may include a hardware processor 201 and a
memory unit 203.
[0052] The processor 201 and the memory unit 203 are generically used here to
refer to any suitable combination of programmable data processing components
and data storage that conduct the operations needed to implement the various
functions and operations of the audio receiver 103. The processor 201 may be an
applications processor typically found in a smart phone, while the memory unit
203 may refer to microelectronic, non-volatile random access memory. An
operating system may be stored in the memory unit 203 along with application
programs specific to the various functions of the audio receiver 103, which are to
be run or executed by the processor 201 to perform the various functions of the
audio receiver 103.
[0053] The audio receiver 103 may include one or more audio inputs 205 for
receiving multiple audio signals from an external or remote device. For example,
the audio receiver 103 may receive audio signals as part of a streaming media
                                        -10-

1002212719
service from a remote server. Alternatively, the processor 201 may decode a
locally stored music or movie file to obtain the audio signals. The audio signals
may represent one or more channels of a piece of sound program content (e.g., a
musical composition or an audio track for a movie). For example, a single signal
corresponding to a single channel of a piece of multichannel sound program
content may be received by an input 205 of the audio receiver 103, and in that
case multiple inputs may be needed to receive the multiple channels for the piece
of content. In another example, a single signal may correspond to or have
encoded therein or multiplexed therein the multiple channels (of the piece of
sound program content),.
[0054] In one embodiment, the audio receiver 103 may include a digital audio
input 205A that receives one or more digital audio signals from an external
device or a remote device. For example, the audio input 205A may be a
TOSLINK connector, or it may be a digital wireless interface (e.g., a wireless local
area network (WLAN) adapter or a Bluetooth adapter). In one embodiment, the
audio receiver 103 may include an analog audio input 205B that receives one or
more analog audio signals from an external device. For example, the audio input
205B may be a binding post, a Fahnestock clip, or a phono plug that is designed
to receive a wire or conduit and a corresponding analog signal.
[0055] In one embodiment, the audio receiver 103 may include an interface 207
for communicating with the loudspeaker 105. The interface 207 may utilize
wired mediums (e.g., conduit or wire) to communicate with the loudspeaker 105,
as shown in Figure 1. In another embodiment, the interface 207 may
communicate with the loudspeaker 105 through a wireless connection. For
example, the network interface 207 may utilize one or more wireless protocols
and standards for communicating with the loudspeaker 105, including the IEEE
802.11 suite of standards, IEEE 802.3, cellular Global System for Mobile
                                        -11-

1002212719
Communications (GSM) standards, cellular Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA) standards, Long Term Evolution (LTE) standards, and/or Bluetooth
standards.
[0056] As shown in Figure 2B, the loudspeaker 105 may receive transducer drive
signals from the audio receiver 103 through a corresponding interface 213. As
with the interface 207, the interface 213 may utilize wired protocols and
standards and/or one or more wireless protocols and standards, including the
IEEE 802.11 suite of standards, IEEE 802.3, cellular Global System for Mobile
Communications (GSM) standards, cellular Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA) standards, Long Term Evolution (LTE) standards, and/or Bluetooth
standards. In some embodiments, the drive signals are received in digital form,
and so in order drive the transducers 109 the loudspeaker 105 in that case may
include digital-to-analog converters (DACs) 209 that are coupled in front of the
power amplifiers 211, for converting the drive signals into analog form before
amplifying them to drive each transducer 109.
[0057] Although described and shown as being separate from the audio receiver
103, in some embodiments, one or more components of the audio receiver 103
may be integrated in the loudspeaker 105. For example, as described below, the
loudspeaker 105 may also include, within its cabinet 111, the hardware processor
201, the memory unit 203, and the one or more audio inputs 205.
[0058] As shown in Figure 1, the loudspeaker 105 houses multiple transducers
109 in a speaker cabinet 111, which may be aligned in a ring formation relative to
each other, to form a loudspeaker array. In particular, the cabinet 111 as shown is
cylindrical; however, in other embodiments the cabinet 111 may be in any shape,
including a polyhedron, a frustum, a cone, a pyramid, a triangular prism, a
hexagonal prism, a sphere, a frusto conical shape, or any other similar shape.
                                         -12-

1002212719
The cabinet 111 may be at least partially hollow, and may also allow the
mounting of transducers 109 on its inside surface or on its outside surface. The
cabinet 111 may be made of any suitable material, including metals, metal alloys,
plastic polymers, or some combination thereof.
[0059] As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2B, the loudspeaker 105 may include a
number of transducers 109. The transducers 109 may be any combination of full
range drivers, mid-range drivers, subwoofers, woofers, and tweeters. Each of the
transducers 109 may have a diaphragm or cone that is connected to a rigid basket
or frame via a flexible suspension that constrains a coil of wire (e.g., a voice coil)
that is attached to the diaphragm to move axially through a generally cylindrical
magnetic gap. When an electrical audio signal is applied to the voice coil, a
magnetic field is created by the electric current in the voice coil, making it a
variable electromagnet. The coil and the transducers' 109 magnetic system
interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached
cone) to move back and forth, thereby reproducing sound under the control of
the applied electrical audio signal coming from an audio source, such as the
audio receiver 103. Although electromagnetic dynamic loudspeaker drivers are
described for use as the transducers 109, those skilled in the art will recognize
that other types of loudspeaker drivers, such as piezoelectric, planar
electromagnetic and electrostatic drivers are possible.
[0060] Each transducer 109 may be individually and separately driven to produce
sound in response to separate and discrete audio signals received from an audio
source (e.g., the audio receiver 103). By having knowledge of the alignment of
the transducers 109, and allowing the transducers 109 to be individually and
separately driven according to different parameters and settings (including
relative delays and relative energy levels), the loudspeaker 105 may be arranged
and driven as an array, to produce numerous directivity or beam patterns that
                                          -13-

1002212719
accurately represent each channel of a piece of sound program content output by
the audio receiver 103. For example, in one embodiment, the loudspeaker 105
may be arranged and driven as an array, to produce one or more of the
directivity patterns shown in Figure 3. Simultaneous directivity patterns
produced by the loudspeaker 105 may not only differ in shape, but may also
differ in direction. For example, different directivity patterns may be pointed in
different directions in the listening area 101. The transducer drive signals needed
to produce the desired directivity patters may be generated by the processor 201
(see Figure 2A) executing a beamforming process.
[0061] Although a system has been described above in relation to a number of
transducers 109 that may be arranged and driven as part of a loudspeaker array,
the system may also work with only a single transducer (housed in a cabinet 111.)
Thus, while at times the description below refers to the loudspeaker 105 as being
configured and driven as an array, in some embodiments a non-array
loudspeaker may be configured or used in a similar fashion described herein.
[0062] As shown and described above, the loudspeaker 105 may include a single
ring of transducers 109 arranged to be driven as an array. In one embodiment,
each of the transducers 109 in the ring of transducers 109 may be of the same type
or model, e.g. replicates. The ring of transducers 109 may be oriented to emit
sound "outward" from the ring, and may be aligned along (or lying in) a
horizontal plane such that each of the transducers 109 is vertically equidistant
from the tabletop, or from a top plane of a baseplate 113 of the loudspeaker 105.
By including a single ring of transducers 109 aligned along a horizontal plane,
vertical control of sound emitted by the loudspeaker 105 may be limited. For
example, through adjustment of beamforming parameters and settings for
corresponding transducers 109, sound emitted by the ring of transducers 109 may
be controlled in the horizontal direction. This control may allow generation of
                                          -14-

1002212719
the directivity patterns shown in Figure 3 along a horizontal plane or axis.
However, by lacking multiple stacked rings of transducers 109 this directional
control of sound may be limited to this horizontal plane. Accordingly, sound
waves produced by the loudspeaker 105 in the vertical direction (perpendicular
to this horizontal axis or plane) may expand outwards without limit.
[0063] For example, as shown in Figure 4, sound emitted by the transducers 109
may be spread vertically with minimal limitation. In this scenario, the head or
ears of the listener 107 are located approximately one meter and at a twenty
degree angle relative to the ring of transducers 109 in the loudspeaker 105. The
spread of sound from the loudspeaker 105 may include sound emitted 1)
downward and onto a tabletop on which the loudspeaker 105 has been placed
and 2) directly at the listener 107. The sound emitted towards the tabletop will
be reflected off the surface of the tabletop and towards the listener 107.
Accordingly, both reflected and direct sound from the loudspeaker 105 may be
sensed by the listener 107. Since the reflected path is indirect and consequently
longer than the direct path in this example, a comb filtering effect may be
detected or perceived by the listener 107. A comb filtering effect may be defined
as the creation of peaks and troughs in frequency response that are caused when
signals that are identical but have phase differences are summed. An undesirably
colored sound can result from the summing of these signals. For example, Figure
5 shows a logarithmic sound pressure versus frequency graph for sound detected
at one meter and at twenty degrees relative to the loudspeaker 105 (i.e., the
position of the listener 107 as shown in Figure 4). A set of bumps or peaks and
notches or troughs illustrative of this comb filtering effect may be observed in the
graph shown in Figure 5. The bumps may correspond to frequencies where the
reflected sounds are in-phase with the direct sounds while the notches may
                                          -15-

1002212719
correspond to frequencies where the reflected sounds are out-of-phase with the
direct sounds.
[0064] These bumps and notches may move with elevation or angle (degree)
change, as path length differences between direct and reflected sound changes
rapidly based on movement of the listener 107. For example, the listener 107 may
stand up such that the listener 107 is at a thirty degree angle or elevation relative
to the loudspeaker 105 as shown in Figure 6 instead of a twenty degree elevation
as shown in Figure 4. The sound pressure vs. frequency as measured at the thirty
degree angle (elevation) is shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the bumps and
notches in the sound pressure versus frequency behavior move with changing
elevation, and this is illustrated in the contour graph of Figure 8 which shows the
comb filtering effect of Figures 5 and 7 as witnessed from different angles. The
regions with darker shading represent high SPL (bumps), while the regions with
lighter shading represent low SPL (notches). The bumps and notches shift over
frequency, as the listener 107 changes angles/location relative to the loudspeaker
105. Accordingly, as the listener 107 moves in the vertical direction relative to the
loudspeaker 105, the perception of sound for this listener 107 changes. This lack
of consistency in sound during movement of the listener 107, or at different
elevations, may be undesirable.
[0065] As described above, comb filtering effects are triggered by phase
differences between reflected and direct sounds caused by the longer distance the
reflected sounds must travel en route to the listener 107. To reduce audio
coloration perceptible to the listener 107 based on comb filtering, the distance
between reflected sounds and direct sounds may be shortened. For example, the
ring of transducers 109 may be oriented such that sound emitted by the
transducers 109 travels a shorter or even minimal distance, before reflection on
the tabletop or another reflective surface. This reduced distance will result in a
                                           -16-

1002212719
shorter delay between direct and reflected sounds, which consequently will lead
to more consistent sound at locations/angles the listener 107 is most likely to be
situated. Techniques for minimizing the difference between reflected and direct
paths from the transducers 109 will be described in greater detail below by way
of example.
[0066] Figure 9A shows a loudspeaker 105 in which an integrated transducer 109
has been moved closer to the bottom of the cabinet 111 than its top, in
comparison to the transducer 109 in the loudspeaker 105 shown in Figure 4. In
one embodiment, the transducer 109 may be located proximate to a baseplate 113
that is fixed to a bottom end of the cabinet 111 of the loudspeaker 105. The
baseplate 113 may be a solid flat structure that is sized to provide stability to the
loudspeaker 105 while the loudspeaker 105 is seated on a table or on another
surface (e.g., a floor), so that the cabinet 111 can remain upright. In some
embodiments, the baseplate 113 may be sized to receive sounds emitted by the
transducer 109 such that sounds may be reflected off of the baseplate 113. For
example, as shown in Figure 9A, sound directed downward by the transducer
109 may be reflected off of the baseplate 113 instead of off of the tabletop on
which the loudspeaker 105 is resting. The baseplate 113 may be described as
being coupled to a bottom 102 of the cabinet 111, e.g., directly to its bottom end,
and may extend outward beyond a vertical projection of the outermost point of a
sidewall of the cabinet. Although shown as larger in diameter than the cabinet
111, in some embodiments, the baseplate 113 may be the same diameter of the
cabinet 111. In these embodiments the bottom 102 of the cabinet 111 may curve
or cut inwards (e.g., until it reaches the baseplate 113) and the transducers 109
may be located in this curved or cutout section of the bottom 102 of the cabinet
111 such as shown in Figure 1.
                                            -17-

1002212719
[0067] In some embodiments, an absorptive material 901, such as foam, may be
placed around the baseplate 113, or around the transducers 109. For example, as
shown in Figure 9C, a slot 903 may be formed in the cabinet 111, between the
transducer 109 and the baseplate 113. The absorptive material 901 within the slot
903 may reduce the amount of sound that has been reflected off of the baseplate
113 in a direction opposite the listener 107 (and that would otherwise then be
reflected off of the cabinet 111 back towards the listener 107). In some
embodiments, the slot 903 may encircle the cabinet 111 around the base of the
cabinet 111 and may be tuned to provide a resonance in a particular frequency
range to further reduce sound reflections. In some embodiments, the slot 903
may form a resonator coated with the absorptive material 901 designed to
dampen sounds in a particular frequency range to further eliminate sound
reflections off the cabinet 111.
[0068] In one embodiment, as seen in Figures 9D, 9E, a screen 905 may be placed
below the transducers 109. In this embodiment, the screen 905 may be a
perforated mesh (e.g., a metal, metal alloy, or plastic) that functions as a low-pass
filter for sound emitted by the transducers 109. In particular, and as best seen in
Figure 9D, the screen 905 may create a cavity 907 (similar to the slot 903 depicted
in Figure 9C) underneath the cabinet 111 between the baseplate 113 and the
transducers 109. High-frequency sounds emitted by the transducers 109 and
which reflect off the cabinet 111 may be attenuated by the screen 905 and
prevented from passing into the listening area 101. In one embodiment, the
porosity of the screen 905 may be adjusted to limit the frequencies that may be
free to enter the listening area 101.
[0069] In one embodiment, the vertical distance D between a center of the
diaphragm of the transducer 109 and a reflective surface (e.g., the top of the
baseplate 113) may be between 8.0 mm and 13.0 mm as shown in Figure 9B. For
                                         -18-

1002212719
example, in some embodiments, the distance D may be 8.5 mm, while in other
embodiments the distance D may be 11.5 mm (or anywhere in between 8.5 mm
11.5 mm). In other embodiments, the distance D may be between 4.0 mm and
20.0 mm. As shown in Figures 9A and 9B, by being located proximate (i.e., a
distance D) from the surface upon which sound is reflected (e.g., the baseplate
113, or in other cases a tabletop or floor surface itself such as where no baseplate
113 is provided), the loudspeaker 105 may exhibit a reduced length of its
reflected sound path. This reduced reflected sound path consequently reduces
the difference between the lengths of the reflected sound path and the direct
sound path, for sound originating from a transducer 109 integrated within the
cabinet 111, e.g., the difference, reflected sound path distance - direct sound path
distance, approaches zero). This minimization or at least reduction in difference
between the length of the reflected and direct paths may result in a more
consistent sound (e.g., a consistent frequency response or amplitude response) as
shown in the graphs of Figure 10A and Figure 10B. In particular, the bumps and
notches in both Figure 10A and Figure 10B have decreased in magnitude and
moved considerably to the right and closer to the bounds of human perception
(e.g., certain bumps and notches have moved above 10kHz). Thus, comb filtering
effects as perceived by the listener 107 may be reduced.
[0070] Although discussed above and shown in Figures 9A-9C for a single
transducer 109, in some embodiments each transducer 109 in a ring formation of
multiple transducers 109 (e.g., an array of transducers) may be similarly
arranged, along the side or face of the cabinet 111. In those embodiments, the
ring of transducers 109 may be aligned along or lie within a horizontal plane as
described above.
[0071] In some embodiments, the distance D or the range of values used for the
distance D may be selected based on the radius of the corresponding transducer
                                            -19-

1002212719
109 (e.g., the radius of the diaphragm of the transducer 109) or the range of
frequencies used for the transducer 109. In particular, high frequency sounds
may be more susceptible to comb filtering caused by reflections. Accordingly, a
transducer 109 producing higher frequencies may need a smaller distance D, in
order to more stringently reduce its reflections (in comparison to a transducer 109
that produces lower frequency sounds.) For example, Figure 11A shows a multi
way loudspeaker 105 with a first transducer 109A used/designed for a first set of
frequencies, a second transducer 109B used/designed for a second set of
frequencies, and a third transducer 109C used/designed for a third set of
frequencies. For instance, the first transducer 109A may be used/designed for
high frequency content (e.g., 5kHz-l0kHz), the second transducer 109B may be
used/designed for mid frequency content (e.g., 1kHz-5kHz), and the third
transducer 109C may be used/designed for low frequency content (e.g., 100Hz
1kHz). These frequency ranges for each of the transducers 109A, 109B, and 109C
may be enforced using a set of filters integrated within the loudspeaker 105.
Since the wavelengths for sound waves produced by the first transducer 109A are
smaller than wavelengths of sound waves produced by the transducers 109B and
109C, the distance DA associated with the transducer 109A may be smaller than
the distances DB and Dc associated with the transducers 109B and 109C,
respectively (e.g., the transducers 109B and 109C may be located farther from a
reflective surface on which the loudspeaker 105 is resting, without notches
associated with comb filtering falling within their bandwidth of operation).
Accordingly, the distance D between transducers 109 and a reflective surface
needed to reduce comb filtering effects may be based on the size/diameter of the
transducers 109 and/or the frequencies intended to be reproduced by the
transducers 109.
                                         -20-

1002212719
[0072] Despite being shown with a single transducer 109A, 109B, and 109C, the
multi-way loudspeaker 105 shown in Figure 11A may include rings of each of the
transducers 109A, 109B, and 109C. Each ring of the transducers 109A, 109B, and
109C may be aligned in separate horizontal planes.
[0073] Further, although shown in Figure 11A as including three different types
of transducers 109A, 109B, and 109C (i.e., a 3-way loudspeaker 105), in other
embodiments the loudspeaker 105 may include any number of different types of
transducers 109. In particular, the loudspeaker 105 may be an N-way array as
shown in Figure 11B, where N is an integer that is greater than or equal to one.
Similar to Figure 11A, in this embodiment shown in Figure        11B, the distances DA
DN associated with each ring of transducers 109A-109N may be based on the
size/diameter of the transducers 109A-109N and/or the frequencies intended to
be reproduced by the transducers 109A-109N.
[0074] Although achieving a small distance D (i.e., a value within a range
described above) between the center of the transducers 109 and a reflective
surface may be achievable for transducers 109 with smaller radii by moving the
transducers 109 closer to a reflective surface (i.e., arranging transducers 109 along
the cabinet 111 to be closer to the baseplate 113), as transducers 109 increase in
size the ability to achieve values for the distance D within prescribed ranges may
be difficult or impossible. For example, it would be impossible to achieve a
threshold value for D by simply moving a transducer 109 in the vertical direction
along the face of the cabinet 111 closer to the reflective surface when the radius of
the transducer 109 is greater than the threshold value for D (e.g., the threshold
value is 12.0 mm and the radius of the transducer 109 is 13.0mm). In these
situations, additional degrees of freedom of movement may be employed to
achieve the threshold value for D as described below.
                                          -21-

1002212719
[0075] In some embodiments, the orientation of the transducers 109 in the
loudspeaker 105 may be adjusted to further reduce the distance D between the
transducer 109 and the reflective surface, reduce the reflected sound path, and
consequently reduce the difference between the reflected and direct sound paths.
For example, Figure 12 shows a side view of a loudspeaker 105 according to one
embodiment. Similar to the loudspeaker 105 of Figure 9, the loudspeaker 105
shown in Figure 12 includes a ring of transducers 109 situated in or around the
bottom of the cabinet 111 and near the baseplate 113. The ring of transducers 109
may encircle the circumference of the cabinet 111 (or may be coaxial with the
circumference), with equal spacing between each adjacent pairs of transducers
109 as shown in the overhead cutaway view in Figure 13.
[0076] In the example loudspeaker 105 shown in Figure 12, the transducers 109
are located proximate to the baseplate 113, by being mounted in the bottom 102
of the cabinet 111. The bottom in this example is frusto conical as shown having
a sidewall that joins an upper base and a lower base, and wherein the upper base
is larger than the lower base and the base plate 113 is coupled to the lower base
as shown. Each of the transducers 109 in this case may be described as being
mounted within a respective opening in the sidewall such that its diaphragm is
essentially outside the cabinet 111, or is at least plainly visible along a line of
sight, from outside of the cabinet 111. Note the indicated distance D being the
vertical distance from the center of the diaphragm, e.g., the center of its outer
surface, down to the top of the baseplate 113. The sidewall (of the bottom 102)
has a number of openings formed therein that are arranged in a ring formation
and in which the transducers 109 have been mounted, respectively. As was
noted above in relation to Figures 9A and 9B, by positioning the transducers 109
close to a surface upon which sound from the transducers 109 is reflected, e.g., by
minimizing the distance D while restricting the angle theta.
                                          -22-

1002212719
[0077] Referring to Fig. 14b, the angle theta may be defined as depicted in that
figure, namely as the angle between 1) a plane of the diaphragm of the
transducer 109, such as a plane in which a perimeter of the diaphragm lies, and 2)
the tabletop surface, or if a baseplate 113 is used then a horizontal plane that
touches the top of the base plate 113.) The angle theta of each of the transducers
109 may be restricted to a specified range, so that the difference between the path
of reflected sounds and the path of direct sounds may be reduced, in comparison
to the upright arrangement of the transducer 109 shown in Figure 14a. A
transducer 109 that is not angled downward is shown in Figure 14A, where it
may be described as being upright or "directly facing" the listener 107, defining
an angle theta of at least ninety degrees, and a distance D1 between the center of
the transducer 109 and a reflective surface below, e.g., a tabletop or the top of the
baseplate 113. As shown in Figure 14B, angling the transducer 109 downward at
an acute angle theta (0) results in a distance D2 between the center of the
transducer 109 and a reflective surface, where D2<Di.      Accordingly, by rotating
(tilting or pivoting) the transducer 109 "forward" and about its bottommost
point, so that its diaphragm is more directed to the reflective surface, the distance
D between the center of the transducer 109 and the reflective surface decreases
(because the bottommost edge of the diaphragm remains fixed between Figure
14A and Figure 14B, e.g., as close as possible to the reflective surface.) As noted
above, this reduction in D results in a reduction in the difference between the
direct and reflected sounds paths and a consequent reduction in audio coloration
caused by comb filtering. The reduction in the reflected sound path may be seen
in Figure 14C, where the solid line from the non-rotated transducer 109 is longer
than the dashed line from the transducer 109 that is tilted by an angle theta, 6.
Thus, to further reduce the distance D (e.g., the distance between the center of the
transducer 109 and either the baseplate 113 or other reflective surface underneath
the cabinet 111) and consequently reduce the reflected path, the transducer 109
                                          -23-

1002212719
may be angled downward toward the baseplate 113 as explained above and also
as shown in Figure 12.
[0078] As described above, the distance D is a vertical distance between the
diaphragm of each of the transducers 109 and a reflective surface (e.g., the
baseplate 113). In some embodiments, this distance D may be measured from the
center of the diaphragm to the reflective surface. Although shown with both
protruding diaphragms and flat diaphragms, in some embodiments inverted
diaphragms may be used. In these embodiments, the distance D may be
measured from the center of the inverted diaphragm, or from the center as it has
been projected onto a plane of the diaphragm along a normal to the plane, where
the diaphragm plane may be a plane in which the perimeter of the diaphragm
lies. Another plane associated with the transducer may be a plane that is defined
by the front face of the transducer 109 (irrespective of the inverted curvature of
its diaphragm).
[0079] Although tilting or rotating the transducers 109 may result in a reduced
distance D and a corresponding reduction in the reflected sound path, over
rotation of the transducers 109 toward the reflective surface may result in
separate unwanted effects. In particular, rotating the transducers 109 past a
threshold value may result in a resonance caused by reflecting sounds off the
reflective surface or the cabinet 111 and back toward the transducer 109.
Accordingly, a lower bound for rotation may be employed to ensure an
unwanted resonance is not experienced. For example, the transducers 109 may
be rotated or tilted between 30.00 and 50.0' (e.g., 6 as defined above in Figure 14B
may be between 30.0' and 50.0'). In one embodiment, the transducers 109 may
be rotated between 37.5' and 42.5' (e.g., 6 may be between 37.5' and 42.50). In
other embodiments, the transducers 109 may be rotated between 39.0' and 41.0'.
                                         -24-

1002212719
The angle theta of rotation of the transducers 109 may be based on a desired or
threshold distance D for the transducers 109.
[0080] Figure 15A shows a logarithmic sound pressure versus frequency graph
for sound detected at a position (of the listener 107) along a direct path that is one
meter away from the loudspeaker 105, and twenty degrees upward from the
horizontal - see Figure 4. In particular, the graph of Figure 15A represents sound
emitted by the loudspeaker 105 shown in Figure 12 with a degree of rotation
theta of the transducers 109 at 45'. In this graph, sound levels are relatively
consistent within the audible range (i.e., 20Hz to 10kHz). Similarly, the contour
graph of Figure 15B for a single transducer 109 shows relative consistency in the
vertical direction, for most angles at which the listener 107 would be located. For
instance, a linear response is shown in the contour graph of Figure 15B for a
vertical position of the listener 107 being 0' (the listener 107 is seated directly in
front of the loudspeaker 105) and for a vertical position between 45' and 60' (the
listener 107 is standing up near the loudspeaker 105). In particular, notches in
this counter graph have been mostly moved outside the audible range, or they
have been moved to vertical angles where the listener 107 is not likely to be
located (e.g., the listener 107 would not likely be standing directly above the
loudspeaker 105, at the vertical angle of 90').
[0081] As noted above, rotating the transducers 109 achieves a lower distance D
between the center of the transducers 109 and a reflective surface (e.g., the
baseplate 113). In some embodiments, the degree of rotation or the range of
rotation may be set based on the set of frequencies and the size or diameter of the
transducers 109. For example, larger transducers 109 may produce sound waves
with larger wavelengths. Accordingly, the distance D needed to mitigate comb
filtering for these larger transducers 109 may be longer than the distance D
needed to mitigate comb filtering for smaller transducers 109. Since the distance
                                          -25-

1002212719
D is longer for these larger transducers 109 in comparison to smaller transducers
109, the corresponding angle 6 at which the transducers are tilted, as needed to
achieve this longer distance D, may be larger (less tilting or rotation is needed), in
order avoid over-rotation (or over-tilting). Accordingly, the angle of rotation 0
for a transducer 109 may be selected based on the diaphragm size or diameter of
the transducers 109 and the set of frequencies desired to be output by the
transducer 109.
[0082] As described above, positioning and angling the transducers 109 along the
face of the cabinet 111 of the loudspeaker 105 may reduce a reflective sound path
distance, reduce a difference between a reflective sound path and a direct sound
path, and consequently reduce comb filtering effects. In some embodiments,
horns may be utilized to further reduce comb filtering. In such embodiments, a
horn enables the point at which sound escapes from (an opening in) the cabinet
111 of the loudspeaker 105 (and then moves along respective direct and reflective
paths toward the listener 107) to be adjusted. In particular, the point of release of
sound from the cabinet 111 and into the listening area 101 may be configured
during manufacture of the loudspeaker 105 to be proximate to a reflective surface
(e.g., the baseplate 113). Several different horn configurations will be described
below. Each of these configurations may allow use of larger transducers 109 (e.g.,
larger diameter diaphragms), or a greater number or a fewer transducers 109,
while still reducing comb filtering effects and maintaining a small cabinet 111 for
the loudspeaker 105.
[0083] Figure 16A shows a cutaway side view of the cabinet 111 of the
loudspeaker 105 having a horn 115 and no baseplate 113. Figure 16B shows an
elevation or perspective view of the loudspeaker 105 of Figure 16A configured as,
and to be driven as, an array having multiple transducers 109 arranged in a ring
formation. In this example, the transducer 109 is mounted or located further
                                          -26-

1002212719
inside or within the cabinet 111 (rather than within an opening in the sidewall of
the cabinet 111), and a horn 115 is provided to acoustically connect the
diaphragm of the transducer 109 to a sound output opening 117 of the cabinet
111. In contrast to the embodiment of Figure 9D where the transducer 109 is
mounted within an opening in the sidewall of the cabinet 111 and is visible from
the outside, there is no "line of sight" to the transducer 109 in Figures 16A, 16B
from outside of the cabinet 111. The horn 115 extends downward from the
transducer 109, to the opening 117, which is formed in the sloped sidewall of the
bottom 102 of the cabinet 111 which lies on a tabletop or floor. In this example,
the bottom 102 is frusto conical. The horn 115 directs sound from the transducer
109 to an inside surface of the sidewall of the cabinet 111 where the opening 117
is located, at which point the sound is then released into the listening area
through the opening 117. As shown, although the transducer may still be closer
to the bottom end of the cabinet 111 than it top end, the transducer 109 is in a
raised position (above the bottom end) in contrast to the embodiment of Fig. 12.
Nevertheless, sound emitted by the transducer 109 can still be released from the
cabinet 111 at a point that is "proximate" or close enough to the reflective surface
underneath. That is because the sound is released from an opening 117 which
itself is positioned in close proximity to the baseplate 113. In some embodiments,
the opening 117 may be positioned and oriented to achieve the same vertical
distance D that was described above in connection with the embodiments of
Figures 9B, 12, 14B (in which the distance D was being measured between the
diaphragm and the reflective surface below the cabinet 111.) For the horn
embodiment here, the predefined vertical distance D (from the center of the
opening 117 vertically down to the tabletop or floor on which the cabinet 111 is
resting) may be for example between 8.0 millimeters and 13.0 millimeters. In the
case of the horn embodiment here, the distance D may be achieved in part by
inclining the opening 117 (analogous to the rotation or tilt angle theta of Figure
                                          -27-

1002212719
14B), for example, appropriately defining the angle or slope of the sidewall of the
frusto-conical bottom 102 (of the cabinet 111) in which the opening 117 is formed.
[0084] The horn 115 and the opening 117 may be formed in various sizes to
accommodate sound produced by the transducers 109. In one embodiment,
multiple transducers 109 in the loudspeaker 105 may be similarly configured
with corresponding horns 115 and openings 117 in the cabinet 111, together
configured, and to be driven as, an array. The sound from each transducer 109 is
released from the cabinet 111 at a prescribed distance D from the reflective
surface below the cabinet 111 (e.g., a tabletop or a floor on which the cabinet 111
is resting, or a baseplate 113). This distance D may be measured from the center
of the opening 117 (vertically downward) to the reflective surface. Since sound is
thus being emitted proximate to the baseplate 113, reflected sound may travel
along a path similar to that of direct sound as described above. In particular,
since sound only travels a short distance from the opening 117 before being
reflected, the difference in the reflected and direct sound paths may be small,
which results in a reduction in comb filtering effects perceptible to the listener
107. For example, the contour graph of Figure 17 corresponding to the
loudspeaker 105 shown in Figures 16A and 16B shows a smooth and consistent
level difference across frequencies and vertical angles (which are angles that
define the possible vertical positions of the listener 107), in comparison to the
comb filtering effect shown in Figure 8.
[0085] Figure 18 shows a cutaway view of the cabinet 111 of the loudspeaker 105,
according to another horn embodiment. In this example, the transducers 109 are
mounted to or through the sidewall of the cabinet 111, but are pointed inward
(rather than outward as in the embodiment of Figure 9D, for example. In other
words, the forward faces of their diaphragms are facing into the cabinet 111.
Corresponding horns 115 are acoustically coupled to the front faces of
                                          -28-

diaphragms of the transducers 109, respectively, and extend downward along
respective curves to corresponding openings 117. In this embodiment, although
the transducers 109 are facing a first direction, the curvature of the horns 115A
allow sound to be emitted from the openings 117, which are aimed to emit sound
into the listening area 101 in a second direction (different than the first direction).
The openings 117 of the cabinet 111 in this embodiment may be positioned and
oriented the same as described above in connection with the horn embodiments
of Figures 16A, 16B. Additionally, a phase plug 119 may be added into the
acoustic path between the transducer 109 and its respective opening 117, as
shown, so as to redirect high frequency sounds to avoid reflections and
cancellations. The contour graph of Figure 19 corresponding to the loudspeaker
105 of Figure 18 shows a smooth and consistent level difference across
frequencies and vertical listening positions (vertical direction angles), in
comparison to the undesirable comb filtering effects shown in Figure 8.
[0086] Figure 20 shows a cutaway view of the cabinet 111 of the loudspeaker 105,
according to yet another embodiment. In this example, the transducers 109 are
also mounted within the cabinet 111 but they are pointed downwards (rather
than sideways as in the embodiment of Figure 18 in which the transducers 109
may be mounted to the sidewall of the cabinet 111). This arrangement may
enable the use of horns 115 that are shorter than those in the embodiment of
Figure 18. As shown in the contour graph of Figure 21, the shorter horns 115
may contribute to a smoother response by this embodiment, in comparison to the
other embodiments that also use horns 115 (described above.) In one
embodiment, the length of the horns 115 may be between 20.0 mm and 45.0 mm.
The openings 117 of the cabinet 111 in this embodiment may also be formed in
the sloped sidewall of the frusto-conical bottom 102 of the cabinet 111, and may
be positioned and oriented the same as described above in connection with the
                                          -29-

horn embodiments of Figures 16A, 16B to achieve a smaller distance D relative to
the reflective surface, e.g., the top surface of the baseplate 113.
[0087] Figure 22 shows a cutaway view of the cabinet 111 in the loudspeaker 105,
according to yet another embodiment. In this example, each of the transducers
109 is mounted within the cabinet 111, e.g., similar to Figure 20, but the horn 115
(which directs sound emitted from its respective transducer 109 to its respective
opening 117) is longer and narrower than in Figure 20. In some embodiments, a
combination of one or more Helmholtz resonators 121 may be used for each
respective transducer 109 (e.g., an 800Hz resonator, a 3kHz resonator, or both)
along with phase plugs 119. The resonators 121 may be aligned along the horn
115 or just outside the opening 117, for absorbing sound and reducing reflections.
As shown in the contour graph of Figure 23, the longer, narrower horns 115 of
this embodiment, together with 800Hz and 3kHz Helmholtz resonators 121 may
result in a smooth frequency response (at various angles in the vertical direction).
[0088] Figure 24 shows a cutaway or cross section view taken of a combination
transducer 109 and its phase plug 119, in the cabinet 111 of the loudspeaker 105,
according to another embodiment. In this embodiment, the phase plug 119 is
placed adjacent to its respective transducer 109, and each such combination
transducer 109 and phase plug 119 may be located entirely within (inward of the
sidewall of) the cabinet 111 as shown. In one embodiment, a shielding device
2401 that is coupled to the outside surface of the cabinet 111 or also to the
baseplate 113 may hold the phase plug 119 in position against its transducer 109.
The shielding device 2401 may extend around the perimeter or circumference of
the cabinet 111, forming a ring that serves to hold all of the phase plugs 119 of all
of the transducers 109 (e.g., in the case of a loudspeaker array). The phase plug
119 may be formed as several fins 2403 that extend from a center hub 2405. The
fins 2403 may guide sound (through the spaces between adjacent ones of the fins
                                           -30-

1002212719
2403) from the diaphragm of the corresponding transducer 109 to an aperture
2407 formed in the shielding device 2401. Accordingly, the phase plug 119 may
be shaped to surround the transducer 109, including a diaphragm of the
transducer 109 as shown, such that sound may be channeled from the
transducers 109 to the aperture 2407. By also guiding the sound from the
transducers 109 to the openings 117, respectively, the phase plugs 119 of this
embodiment are also able to place the effective sound radiation area of the
transducers 109 closer to the reflective surface (e.g., the baseplate 113, or a
tabletop on which the loudspeaker 105 is resting). As noted above, by
positioning the sound radiation area or sound-radiating surface of the
transducers 109 closer to a reflective surface, the loudspeaker 105 in this
embodiment may reduce the difference between reflective and direct sound
paths, which in turn may reduce comb filtering effects.
[0089] Turning now to Figure 25, in this embodiment, the loudspeaker 105 has a
partition 2501. The partition 2501 may made of a rigid material (e.g., a metal,
metal alloy, or plastic) and extends from the outside surface of the cabinet 111
over the bottom 102 of the cabinet 111, to partially block the transducers 109 - see
Figure 12 which shows an example of the bottom 102 of the cabinet 111 and the
transducers 109 therein, which would be blocked by the partition 2501 of Figure
25. The partition 2501 in this example is a simple cylinder (extending straight
downward) but it could alternatively have a different curved shape, e.g., wavy
like a skirt or curtain, to encircle the cabinet 111 and partially block each of the
transducers 109. In one embodiment, the partition 2501 may include a number of
holes 2503 formed in its curved sidewall as shown which may be sized to allow
the passage of various desired frequencies of sound. For example, one group or
subset of the holes 2503 which are located farthest from the baseplate 113 may be
sized to allow the passage of low-frequency sounds (e.g., 1OOHz-1kHz) while
                                           -31-

1002212719
another group or subset of holes 2503 that lies below the low-frequency holes
may be sized to allow the passage of mid-frequency sounds (e.g., 1kHz-5kHz). In
this embodiment, high-frequency sounds may pass between a gap 2505 created
between the bottom end of the partition 2501 and the baseplate 113. Accordingly,
high-frequency content is pushed closer to the baseplate 113 by restricting this
content to the gap 2505. This movement of high-frequency content closer to the
baseplate 113 (i.e., the point of reflection) reduces the reflected sound path and
consequently reduces the perceptibility of comb filtering for high-frequency
content, which as noted above is particularly susceptible to this form of audio
coloration.
[0090] Turning now to Figures 26A, 26B, these illustrate the use of acoustic
dividers 2601 in a multi-way version, or in an array version, of the loudspeaker
105, in accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention. The divider
2601 may be a flat piece that forms a wall joining the bottom 102 of the cabinet
111 to the baseplate 113, as best seen in the side view of Fig. 26B. The divider
2601 begins at the transducer 109 and extends outward lengthwise, e.g., until a
horizontal length given by the radius r, which extends from a center of the
cabinet (through which a vertical longitudinal axis of the cabinet 111 runs - see
Fig. 26b. The divider 2601 need not reach the vertical boundary defined by the
outermost sidewall of the cabinet 111, as shown. A pair of adjacent dividers 2601
on either side of a transducer 109 may, together with the surface of the bottom
102 of the cabinet 111 and the top surface of the baseplate, act like a horn for the
transducer 109.
[0091] As explained above, the loudspeakers 105 described herein when
configured and driven as an array provide improved performance over
traditional arrays. In particular, the loudspeakers 105 provided here reduce
comb filtering effects perceived by the listener 107 by either 1) moving
                                           -32-

1002212719
transducers 109 closer to a reflective surface (e.g., the baseplate 113, or a tabletop)
through vertical or rotational adjustments of the transducers 109 or 2) guiding
sound produced by the transducers 109 to be released into the listening area 101
proximate to a reflective surface through the use of horns 115 and openings 117
that are the prescribed distance from the reflective surface. The reduction of this
distance between the reflective surface and the point at which sound emitted by
the transducers 109 is released into the listening area 101 consequently reduces
the reflective path of sound and reduces comb filtering effects caused by reflected
sounds that are delayed relative to the direct sound. Accordingly, the
loudspeakers 105 shown and described may be placed on reflective surfaces
without severe audio coloration caused by reflected sounds.
[0092] As also described above, use of an array of transducers 109 arranged in a
ring may assist in providing horizontal control of sound produced by the
loudspeaker 105. In particular, sound produced by the loudspeaker 105 may
assist in forming well-defined sound beams in a horizontal plane. This
horizontal control, combined with the improved vertical control (as evidenced by
the contour graphs shown in the figures) provided by the positioning of the
transducers 109 in close proximity to the sound reflective surface underneath the
cabinet 111, allows the loudspeaker 105 to offer multi-axis control of sound.
However, although described above in relation to a number of transducers 109, in
some embodiments a single transducer 109 may be used in the cabinet 111. In
these embodiments, it is understood that the loudspeaker 105 would be a one
way or multi-way loudspeaker, instead of an array. The loudspeaker 105 that has
a single transducer 109 may still provide vertical control of sound through careful
placement and orientation of the transducer 109 as described above.
[0093] While certain embodiments have been described and shown in the
accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that such embodiments are
                                         -33-

merely illustrative of and not restrictive on the broad invention, and that the
invention is not limited to the specific constructions and arrangements shown
and described, since various other modifications may occur to those of ordinary
skill in the art. The description is thus to be regarded as illustrative instead of
limiting.
