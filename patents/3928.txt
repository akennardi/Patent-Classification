                                             SUMMARY
            [0003] In general, in a first aspect, the invention features a kiosk or computing
   device for gaming by patrons. The kiosk has a housing designed to hold a processor,
15 identification acceptor, and biological sensor(s), and to permit installation at a site for
   interaction with human patrons. The identification acceptor mounted in the kiosk housing
   is designed to accept an identification document(s) and to scan identification information
   from the identification document(s) into digital form for transmission over a network.
   One or more biological sensor(s) mounted in the kiosk housing is oriented to obtain
20 biological data describing a human patron at the kiosk or computing device into digital
   form for transmission over a communication network. Input-output device(s) mounted in
   the kiosk or computing device housing is designed to accept registration/login
   information and gaming commands from a human patron and to present information to
   the human patron for interactive gaming. One or more microprocessors mounted in the
25 kiosk housing are programmed to: present instructions to the human patron through the
   input-output device(s), including an instruction to the patron to insert an identification
   document(s) into the identification acceptor; obtain a digital form of the patron's
   identification from the identification acceptor; obtain biological data describing a
   biological feature of the patron from the biological sensor; verify the identity of the

                                                   2
   patron and acceptability of the patron for gaming based at least in part on the digital form
   of the patron's identification and the biological data; and on verification, to offer gaming
   activities to the verified patron.
            [0004] In general, in a second aspect, the invention features a kiosk or computing
 5 device for gaming by patrons. A kiosk or computing device housing holds a processor,
   input/output devices, currency acceptor and dispenser, to protect them against intrusion,
   and to permit installation at a site for interaction with human patrons. Input-output
   device(s) accept registration/login information and gaming commands from a human
   patron and to present information to the human patron for interactive gaming. A currency
10 acceptor and dispenser mounted in the housing accepts currency and dispense currency
   for gaming. One or more microprocessors are programmed to: present instructions to the
   human patron through the input-output device(s), including an instruction to the patron to
   register and verify the patron's identity; accept currency at the currency acceptor for
   deposit into a wagering account held in an off-site computer; on verification and
15 acceptance of currency, offer gaming activities to the verified patron out of the wagering
   account; and pay out gaming winnings from the wagering account at the currency
   dispenser.
            In general, in a third aspect, the invention features a method. By an output device
   of a computing device that has a processor and memory, instructions are presented to the
20 human patron through the input-output device(s), including an instruction to the patron to
   register and verify the patron's identity. At input-output device(s) of the computing
   device, registration and identification information are accepted from a human patron.
   The identity of the biological patron is verified against a legal identity to validate legal
   entitlement to participate in gaming activities. Funds are accepted at a funds acceptor for
25 deposit into a wagering account held for wagering activities hosted in off-site computer(s)
   at two or more different gaming operators, the gaming operators being distinct legal
   entities from an operator of the computing device.

   signature pad and the biological data may be a digital representation of the patron's
   signature. The patron identity may be verified based at least in part on face recognition
   and comparison of the digital image against a reference photograph. The identity of the
   patron may be verified based at least in part on a verification received from an off-site
 5 verification office in response to the digital image of the patron's face and at least part of
   the digital identification data. The identity of the patron may be verified based at least in
   part on transmitting the biological data to an off-site verification office. The identity of
   the patron may be verified based at least in part on processing by a microprocessor in the
   kiosk or computing device. The identity of the patron may be verified based at least in
10 part on analysis of the biological data against a reference in a microprocessor mounted in
   the kiosk or computing device. The identification acceptor may be designed to accept
   and scan a government-issued driver's license, passport or identification card. The
   identity of the patron may be verified based at least in part on information regarding a
   financial account of the patron. The identity of the patron may be verified based at least in
15 part on analysis of the biological data against databases of government and/or regulatory
   authorities.

                                           DESCRIPTION
            [0010] Gaming and other financial transactions may be facilitated by computing
   device 100 that has the ability to obtain input to verify a person's identity. The
   computing device may be a purpose-designed device, such as a purpose-designed kiosk,
 5 or may be a conventional computer with a camera and facial recognition software, iris
   scan or fingerprint scan, or the like. Computing device 100 may be used to register a new
   user or patron for an account, or may be used for day-to-day transactions such as gaming
   activities, ATM cash transactions, or the like.
            [0011] Patron 130 may use computing device 100 to:
10     e    Register/establish an account, access and conduct transactions to the account, for
            gaming or other financial activities.
       e    create a unique identifier for future access/transactions.
       e    engage in gaming activities and conduct transactions related to gaining.
       e    transfer funds to, from, and/or between accounts, withdraw funds from accounts
15          (including payment back to debit/credit/stored value cards or some other form of
            payment back, such as digital currency or points) and conduct transactions related
            to the accounts.
       e    confirm/verify the identity of the person accessing the accounts or engaging in
            transactions is permitted under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.
20 In some cases, these activities may be supported by computing device 100 (purpose
   designed kiosk, mobile device, tablet, phone, PC, terminal station, etc.) that connects to a
   gaming operator 140 or other financial institution over a network. In some cases,
   computing device 100 may have sufficient input/output devices to gather sufficient
   information to confirm all necessary identity and permission information; in other cases,
25 computing device 100 may gather information to forward to a live person for
   confirmation or verification.
            [0012] In some cases, administrative/registrar entity 150 may perform tasks,
   functions or administrative functions on behalf of or for gaming operator 140 related to
   patrons 130 of a gaming operator or on behalf of the gaming operator. In some cases,
30 administrative/registrar entity 150 may be an agent of gaming operator 140 and may be an

                                                   5
   entity that the gaming operator trusts (i.e., a trusted entity). In some cases,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may be an automated process. In some cases,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may assist gaming operator 140 with
   registering/signing up new patrons, with accepting funds/money from patron 130 and
 5 depositing these funds in the patron's gaming account for patron 130 to bet/wager with,
   with receiving requests from patron 130 to withdrawal funds from the patron's account
   and paying patron 130 the withdrawn funds, etc. In some cases, administrative/registrar
   entity 150 may perform functions related to patron administration/administrative
   functions (such as patron registration, fund deposit, fund withdrawal, etc.) for a gaming
10 operator(s) 140. In some cases, administrative/registrar entity 150 may also perform
   other functions for gaming operator 140, such as marketing. In some cases,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may perform administrative functions for a gaming
   operator(s) 140 but may also perform other functions completely separate from gaming
   operator 140. Gaming operator 140 may issue to administrative/registrar entity 150 a
15 unique ID(s) 154. Administrative/registrar entity 150, when performing tasks for gaming
   operator 140, may authenticate itself to the gaming operator 140 through ID 154.
   I.      Kiosk or computing device 100
            [0013] Referring to FIG. 1, kiosk or computing device 100 for gaming
   applications may have components that permit verification and registration of a patron,
20 adding money into an electronic wallet, paying out winnings, and entering commands to
   engage or participate in various gaming activities and/or gaming related transactions.
   Kiosk or computing device 100 may have one or more microprocessors 110, ID card
   acceptor 302, keypad 310, one or more display screens 312, one or more cameras 410,
   one or more network connectors 420, acceptor 522 for credit/debit/stored value/ATM
25 card, PayPal account, digital currency or points or some other form of funding, currency
   and/or coin validator/acceptor 520, currency and/or coin dispenser 702, printer 712, and
   nonvolatile storage.
            [0014] Kiosk or computing device 100 may have one or more connectors 420 to
   various networks. Security may be improved if these connectors 420 should have static IP
30 addresses. In some cases kiosk or computing device 100 may have dual connectors 420,

                                                  6
   one connector 420 to the public internet, and a second connector 420 to a financial
   transaction network, such as the ATM network, the FIX, FAST, or SWIFT networks, etc.
            [0015] Kiosk or computing device 100 may have multiple microprocessors 110.
   For example, one microprocessor may perform all management and interconnection of
 5 the various devices, while gaming, gaming related transactions and other user-level
   software may execute on a second processor. This provides some isolation against
   intrusion.
            [0016] Screen 312 may be a touch-sensitive display.
            [0017] Kiosk or computing device 100 may have additional input/output devices
10 for gaming and gaming related transactions, such as keypads, card swipe terminals,
   readers or scanners, joysticks, touchpads, trackballs, pushbuttons, a slot machine arm,
   loudspeakers, haptic transducers (for example, as described in U.S. Pat. App. Ser. No.
   11/754,944, "Game with Hand Motion Control," filed May 29, 2007, incorporated by
   reference), etc.
15          [0018] Currency acceptors/dispensers/cassettes 520, 702 suitable for use are
   available from Fujitsu and other companies.
            [0019] Kiosk or computing device 100 may have an uninterruptible power supply.
            [0020] A light on kiosk 100 may be used to illuminate patron 130 for
   photography, and/or may alert staff when assistance is required, when there is a large
20 payout, or when there is an error at kiosk 100.
            [0021] In some cases, gaming related transactions, such as account registration, or
   other gaming and account interaction may be provided through a general purpose
   computer 100 or other computing device 100, such as a desktop computer, laptop or tablet
   computer, mobile phone, or specialized computing device, that provides the requisite
25 input/output, networking, and computational capabilities.
            [0022] Kiosk or computing device 100 may use cameras, thumbprint readers,
   facial recognition, iris scan, voice recognition, thermal emanation verification, signature
   readers, fingerprint or handprint readers, or other biometric devices to obtain
   identification verification information. Kiosk or computing device 100 may have a
30 keyboard (physical, on-screen soft keys, or other) to accept an account number, patron ID

                                                  7
   number, personal identification number, social security number, taxpayer ID number, or
   other identification number. Kiosk or computing device 100 may have one or more
   readers that accept government documents (such as driver's license, government issued
   ID card, passport), ID cards issued by a specific commercial operator (such as a patron ID
 5 card issued by gaming operator 140), or credit, debit, stored value or ATM cards or some
   other form of identification. Kiosk or computing device 100 may have other similar
   devices that gather information that tends to validate personal identity. In some cases, the
   device may be installed at the factory, such as a camera or thumbprint reader that is
   typically found on laptop computers or mobile phones. In other cases, the device may be
10 an aftermarket plug-in, such as USB devices that plug in to computers, or devices that
   plug into the expansion port of devices such as the dock connector of an Apple iPhone, or
   devices that connect through blue tooth or other wireless technology, to kiosk or
   computing device 100. In some cases, a specific institution may assemble multiple
   sensors into a specialized device that may be issued to a specific person for the duration
15 of gaming activities or an account relationship. In some cases, kiosk or computing device
   100 may have two, three, four, or more separate devices to gather identification
   information. Such separate device(s) may be issued to a specific person for the duration
   of gaming activities or an account relationship by a specific institution. In some cases,
   kiosk 100 may be a docking station with certain 1/0 and verification devices that allows a
20 patron to connect his or her personal device to allow registration, account transactions,
   etc.
   II.     Administrative/registrar entity 150
            [0023] In some cases, gaming operator 140 may contract with a third-party
   administrative/registrar entity 150 to perform certain gaming functions, such as patron
25 registration, verification, age and identity checking, and the like. Administrative/registrar
   entity 150 may operate as a customer-facing "retail" vendor of gaming activity that is
   hosted by a central gaming operator or licensee 140. By law, if gaming activities
   conducted through administrative/registrar entity 150 involve gaming for value, then
   gaming operator or licensee 140 may be under an obligation to do due diligence on
30 administrative/registrar entity 150 to ensure compliance with all other gaming law. If the

                                                  8
   gaming activities are not for value (just play for fun), then gaming operator or licensee
   140 may contract with administrative/registrar entity 150 at will. In some jurisdictions,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may be subject to licensing requirements separate from
   and in addition to the licensing requirements of gaming operator or licensee 140.
 5          [0024] In some cases, administrative/registrar entity 150 may be a bank/bank
   teller, an owner of a store, a notary, a lawyer, a payment or funds processor, etc.
   Administrative/registrar entity 150 may perform other and/or additional functions for
   gaming operator 140, and may perform functions for multiple different gaming operators
   140. In some cases, one gaming operator 140 may register a patron 130, and make that
10 registration available as administrative/registrar entity 150 to other gaming operators 140.
   Multiple administrative/registrar entities 150 may operate. A given
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may be associated with one gaming operator 140
   exclusively, or may be associated with a plurality of gaming operators 140. In some
   cases, two or more gaming operators may be affiliated (such as through a common owner,
15 through agreement, etc.). Here, administrative/registrar entity 150 may have/use the same
   ID 154 to perform functions for affiliated gaming operators.
            [0025] In some cases, administrative/registrar entity 150 may collect a common
   registration 134 for a single patron 130 that is accepted by multiple gaming operators 140.
   In some cases, administrative/registrar entity 150 may act as custodian for an account of
20 patron 130, and may have agreements with the gaming operators 140 to allow patron 140
   to access that account from each gaming operator. This may permit all gaming operators
   to have a common view of the patron's finances, to limit excessive credit risk to a single
   patron 130. In some cases, the administrative/registrar entity 150 may segregate patrons
   for gaming, related gaming transactions or other purposes, such as custodial purposes,
25 such segregation may be by location, gaming operator, jurisdiction, etc. In some cases,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 or kiosk or computing device 100 may limit access to
   gaming based on permissions provided by patron 130, gaming operator 140,
   administrative/registrar entity 150, governmental or regulatory authorities, or other users.
            [0026] Administrative/registrar entity 150 may have one or more physical
30 locations that patron 130 can physically visit. Such location(s) may be physically

                                                   9
   separate from and/or remote from gaming operator 140. Administrative/registrar
   locations 150 may be physically dispersed over a geographic area, such as a town, city,
   state, nation, international waters, multiple jurisdictions, etc.
            [0027] Administrative/registrar entity 150 may assist gaming operator 140 by
 5 performing identity verification of patrons 130. For example, administrative/registrar
   entity 150 may physically view patron 130 and a photo ID of that patron and verify to the
   gaming operator that "John Doe" is in fact "John Doe" (example name).
   Administrative/registrar entity 150 may call the gaming operator 140 and/or enter into a
   computer system that in fact administrative/registrar entity 150 has made this visual
10 verification and authenticate this information to gaming operator 140 through the use of
   ID 154. In other words, through the use of the ID 154, the gaming operator may trust
   that gaming operator is communicating with a trusted agent and therefore trust the
   information received from administrative/registrar entity 150.
            [0028] ID 154 may take various forms. For example, ID 154 may be a login
15 and/or password. As another example, in addition to or in place of a login/password, ID
   154 may simply be a value, encryption key or other electronic security cookie/token that
   administrative/registrar entity 150 knows and provides when necessary. ID 154 may be
   encoded on a card (e.g., an RFID card, magnetic strip, bar code, etc) that
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may swipe through a reader and thereby provide ID
20 154 to gaming operator 140. ID 154 may be encoded or otherwise transferred into kiosk
   or computing device 100 or computing system 152. ID 154 may be encoded on a
   memory device/memory stick that administrative/registrar entity 150 inserts into a
   computer thereby providing ID 154 to gaming operator 140 140. As another variation,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may need to provide a biometric (e.g., retina scan,
25 fingerprint, etc) to verify the identification of entity 150, in conjunction with providing ID
   154.
            [0029] Administrative/registrar entity 150 may have more computing systems 152
   such as a computer, server, laptop, computing pad, smart phone etc. that may
   intercommunicate with a server 142, for example. Such a computing system 152 may be
30 dedicated to interworking with a gaming operator(s) 140/server(s) 142 (one computing

                                                 10
   system 152 may interwork with only one gaming operator and therefore
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may need multiple systems, and/or computing system
   152 may interwork with many gaming operators), and/or may be a general purpose
   device. Such a computing system may include one or more processors and one or
 5 memories and/or be interfaced to one or more external memories, such as one or more
   and/or databases. Computing system 152 may include one or more network
   hardware/software/firmware based interfaces that enable the device to connect to and
   communicate over network 102. Computing system 152 may also have one or more
   software and/or firmware and/or hardware based application(s) that execute on the
10 computing system to intercommunicate with gaming operator 140/server 142. As another
   example, computing system 152 may interwork with gaming operator        140/server 142
   through a web based application hosted by server 142. Other variations are possible.
   III.    Patron registration, login, and verification
            [0030] Referring to FIG. 2, kiosk or computing device 100 may invite patrons to
15 engage in gaming activities or related gaming transactions by displaying a screen that
   asks patrons to insert or provide information from a casino patron card or account, a
   driver's license, passport, or other government issued ID into ID acceptor 302 and/or
   using keypad 310 or softkeys displayed on screen 312.
            [0031] Referring to FIG. 3, when patron 130 inserts an ID into ID acceptor 302 or
20 scans or provides a picture of an ID, microprocessor may instruct ID acceptor 302 to scan
   the ID card or collect the information from the ID card, and populate a registration
   information template 304 for display to patron 130 on screen 312. Patron 130 may fill in
   whatever fields are not ascertainable from the ID card that was inserted, scanned or
   photographed, using keypad 310 or softkeys displayed on screen 312.
25          [0032] Referring to FIG. 4, kiosk or computing device 100 may then display an
   invitation to patron 130 to stand in front of camera 410 so that a photograph of the
   patron's actual face can be captured by camera 410. Kiosk or computing device 100 may
   display the current picture from camera 410 and ask patron 130 to pose, and give a
   countdown until the picture will be taken. Once the picture is taken by camera 410, the
30 image may be stored in digital form.

                                                 11
            [0033] In some cases, kiosk or computing device 100 may request a credit, debit,
   stored value or ATM card or some other form of funding, such as digital currency or
   points, at credit/debit/stored value/ATM card or some other form of funding, such as
   digital currency or points, acceptor 522 or by patron inputting information to gather
 5 additional information for verification. Credit/debit/stored value/ATM card or some
   other form of funding, such as digital currency or points, acceptor 522 may be
   programmed to gather a digital image of a signature from the card or other funding source
   to use in verification.
            [0034] In some cases, kiosk or computing device 100 may request entry of a bank
10 transfer number and account number, a wagering account number, credit/debit/stored
   value/ATM card or some other form of funding, such as digital currency or points, or a
   Paypal or other account number and password, to gather verification information.
            [0035] In some cases, kiosk or computing device 100 may have a signature pad to
   gather a signature from patron 130. In some cases, kiosk or computing device 100 may
15 have a thumb scan or device to gather fingerprint data from patron 130. In some cases,
   kiosk or computing device 100 may have an iris scan sensor to gather an iris scan from
   patron 130. In some cases, kiosk or computing device 100 may have any one, two, three,
   four, or more of the biometric or identity devices listed above.
            [0036] In some cases, kiosk or computing device 100, computer 152 of
20 administrative/registrar entity 150, or some other computer of the gaming system may
   send an email to an email address 330 or an SMS text to a phone number designated by
   patron 130 to obtain further verification.
            [0037] Kiosk or computing device 100 may ascertain a tax status for patron 130
   the patron's tax domicile, whether patron 130 has existing tax withholding paperwork
25 registered with an entity that operates the gaming activities at kiosk or computing device
   100, etc. Kiosk or computing device 100 may gather any information remaining needed
   to generate any W-2G, 1099, 1042-S, or similar tax reporting to the federal government,
   state government, or other tax jurisdiction. The information may be gathered from patron
   130, gaming operator 140 140, or administrative/registrar entity 150.

                                                   12
            [0038] After all patron identification/verification information is received, kiosk or
   computing device 100 may verify the identity of patron 130, and his/her
    suitability/acceptability/permissibility for registration and/or access to a financial or
   gaming account and/or for gaming activities and/or related gaming transactions. The
 5 verification may determine suitability/acceptability/permissibility on a jurisdiction by
   jurisdiction basis and/or by gaming activity by gaming activity basis and/or by related
   gaming transaction by related gaming transaction basis. For example, kiosk 100 or
   another computer of the gaming system may have information that indicates that patron
    130 is permitted to engage in card table games in Nevada or off-track betting in New
10 York, and for-fun gaming in Texas, but not gaming-for-value in Texas.
            [0039] In some cases, verification may involve a remote computer and/or remote
   human. Patron ID information, digital image from camera 410, a digital image of the
   signature, and/or other verification information may be forwarded over one of network
   links 420 to a supervisory office. Verification may be performed by computer. In other
15 cases, a human at the supervisory office may review the information, photographs, and/or
   signature. The human at the supervisory office may compare the live photograph from
   camera 410 against the photo scanned from the ID card photographs to verify the patron's
   identity. The human may verify that patron 130 is eligible for use of the gaming system,
   and that patron 130 has a valid account on the gaming system.
20          [0040] In some cases, kiosk or computing device 100 may use verification
   software hosted on local microprocessor 110 to analyze and verify identity and suitability
   acceptability/permissibility of patron 130. For example, facial recognition software,
   signature verification software, and/or other identity verification techniques may be used.
            [0041] Referring to FIG. 5, once verification is complete and approved, the
25 supervisory office may either send a message to kiosk or computing device 100 for
   display to patron 130, or may send an email to the patron's email address, explaining
   either that patron 130 is verified, additional information or action is required, or that
   verification has failed, as the case may be.
            [0042] Once patron 130 is verified, patron 130 may establish a wallet or patron
30 wagering account or engage in gaming and/or gaming related transactions. Kiosk or

                                                  13
   computing device 100 may request any additional information not already received that is
   necessary to establish the account. In addition, this may be a convenient time to gather
   any information required for tax withholding and reporting. In some cases, gathering any
   information required for tax withholding and reporting may be required before
 5 establishing the account. In other cases, such information gathering may be deferred until
   patron 130 has winnings great enough to trigger an obligation to prepare a tax filing, as
   described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,210,931, incorporated by reference. Patron 130 may fund the
   wallet or wagering account by inserting cash, check, a credit, debit, stored value or ATM
   card or some other form of funding, such as digital currency or points, or a value ticket or
10 voucher, such as casino slot machine ticket, into appropriate acceptor devices of kiosk or
   computing device 100. For example, an "add deposit" button on the kiosk's home page
   may lead to a series of screens where kiosk or computing device 100 asks patron 130 how
   much money is to be deposited, and in what form, and then leads patron 130 to insert cash
   into bill acceptor 520, or card credit or other source of funding into acceptor 522, or the
15 like, to fund the patron's wallet or wagering account.
            [0043] In some cases, patron 130 may be able to enroll himself or herself in
   problem gaming programs, such as setting self-imposed limits on wagering or losses, or
   self-imposed restrictions on types of gaming to which the patron wishes to limit
   him/herself. In cases where administrative/registrar entity 150 accepts a common
20 registration to be used by multiple gaming operators 140, those self-imposed limits or
   restrictions may be provided by administrative/registrar entity 150 to the multiple gaming
   operators 140, and may receive data from the multiple gaming operators 140 to maintain
   the sum of the patron's gaming activity, stop-loss maximum on losses, for all gaming
   operators at the patron's self-imposed limit.
25          [0044] Referring to FIG. 6, when patron 130 returns in the future, patron 130 may
   be able to use a shorter-form sign-in, by entering an account number and PIN, or a card
   and a PIN, or the like. This login may fail if the account is expired or locked out, if the
   PIN is incorrectly entered, if the backing bank account cannot be accessed, if patron 130
   verification from FIG. 5 is not yet complete or was refused, if the patron's email address
30 or telephone number cannot be verified, etc.

                                                 14
            [0045] In some cases, before patron 130 begins using the services of gaming
   operator 140 (e.g., engaging in gaming or gaming related transactions), patron 130 may
   need to register with gaming operator 140 to become an authorized patron and/or to create
   a gaming account and/or engage in gaming or gaming related transactions. In some cases,
 5 patron 130 may register (or verify identity for subsequent visits) in person at gaming
   operator 140, or in person with administrative/registrar entity 150. In some cases, patron
   130 may register or verify remotely via a computing system, such as computing device
   100. In some cases, patron 130 may register or verify by some combination of steps
   partially in person and partially via a computing system. In some cases, patron 130, via a
10 computing device 100, may access a web site hosted by a server 142 (patron 130 may
   access server 142 in other fashions). Via that web site, patron 130 may indicate a desire
   to register with the gaming operator 140. As part of the registration, server 142 may
   prompt patron 130 may to enter at computing device 100 an identity (e.g., first and/or last
   name), date of birth, physical address of residence, social security number, and/or email
15 address, etc. Assuming the registration is successful, in return server 142 may assign an
   ID(s) 134 to patron 130, such as login and password. The login and/or password may be
   chosen by patron 130 and/or server 142. As part of registration, server 142 may also
   prompt patron 130 to answer one or more questions (such as, for example, first pet/pet
   name, high school/college graduated from, mother's maiden name, etc.). Assuming the
20 registration is successful, patron 130 may also add funds to a gaming account (assuming
   the wagering is for money) as part of the registration. For example, patron 130 may
   provide a credit card or other source of funding to fund the account, fund the account via
   PayPal, may wire transfer funds to the account, etc. As another example, patron 130 may
   mail in a check, etc. Patron 130 may fund the account in other manners. Once the
25 account is open, patron 130 may be able to begin gaming activity. In some cases, patron
   130 may deposit funds via administrative/registrar entity 150. In some cases, patron 130
   may transfer funds between patron 130 accounts and/or accounts of other patrons 130.
            [0046] In some cases, as part of registration, patron 130 may also verify to
   gaming operator 140 one or more pieces of information provided to gaming operator 140
30 during registration. For example, patron 130 may need to verify that he indeed is the

                                                     15
   person he entered/identified to the system during registration. Accordingly, as part of
   registration, server 142 may inform patron 130 via computing device 100, for example,
   that patron 130 needs to physically visit administrative/registrar entity 150 to
   authenticate/verify to gaming operator 140 that patron 130 is who he says he is. Server
 5 140 may also inform patron 130 as to one or more documents patron 130 needs to provide
   administrative/registrar entity 150 (such as license, passport, photo ID, tax bill, social
   security card, utility bill, etc) to verify this information. Server 142 may provide patron
   130 with the name and/or location of one or more administrative/registrar entities 150.
   Server 142 may also force patron 130 to choose administrative/registrar entity 150 and/or
10 assign patron 130 to administrative/registrar entity 150. Here, server 142 may notify that
   administrative/registrar entity 150 in advance (such as electronically via computing
   system 152) that patron 130 will be coming to complete registration. Server 142 may also
   warn patron 130 that patron 130 has x hrs/days/weeks/etc. to perform the verification or
   his account will be closed/locked. In some cases, patron 130 may be able to participating
15 in gaming and/or gaming related transactions, wager real money and/or win money, even
   though patron 130 has not completed the verification. In some cases, patron 130 may not
   be able to withdraw any funds from his account (even deposited funds) and/or may only
   be able to withdraw limited funds from his account until the verification is completed. In
   some cases, patron 130 may only be able to wager a portion of the deposited funds until
20 the verification is completed. In some cases, patron 130 may not be able to withdraw any
   winnings from his account and/or may only be able to withdraw limited winnings from
   his account until the verification is completed. Here, patron 130 may be able to withdraw
   deposited funds. In some cases, patron 130 may be able to make a deposit of any amount,
   or only of a limited amount into his account until the verification is completed. In some
25 cases, patron 130 may only be able to transfer a portion of the deposited funds until the
   verification is completed.
   IV.     Verifying identity and gaming permissions through computing device 100 or
           agent 150
            [0047] Referring again to FIGS. 2 and 3, computing device or kiosk 100 or
30 administrative/registrar entity 150 may request that patron 130 submit information as

                                                   16
   follows, for registration or to commence gaming activities against a previously-registered
   account, or to make a financial transaction:
       e   Personal identification information-name, address, social security number,
           taxpayer ID, etc. In some cases, this may be scanned from an identification
 5         document such as a driver's license.
       e   one, two, three, or more biometric measurements
       e    an identification document, for example, a driver's license, passport, or the like
       e    a credit card, debit card, stored value card, or similar privately-issued card, or
           other source of funding
10     e   patron preference for matters such as privacy, problem gaming limitations, etc.
            [0048] The data/information required may vary depending on the jurisdiction in
   which the person is located. For example, gaming in New Jersey may require more or less
   or different information than gaming in Nevada. Computing device or kiosk 100 or
15 administrative/registrar entity 150 may ascertain which jurisdiction patron 130 is
   physically located or domiciled, or the jurisdiction of game 140, and adapt the
   registration/access process to the jurisdiction.
            [0049] The data/information required may vary depending on the type of gaming
   that patron 130 wishes to participate in, or the stakes for which patron 130 wagers.
20 Computing device or kiosk 100 or administrative/registrar entity 150 may adapt the
   registration/access process accordingly. For example, play for no money may require
   less-comprehensive registration or verification than gaming for money, and high-stakes
   gaming may require more verification than low-stakes gaming. Verification of an 18
   year old may be more comprehensive than when patron 130 is 21 years old or older. Also,
25 the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act requires parental consent for children under
   13 years old, so computing device or kiosk 100 or administrative/registrar entity 150 may
   require parental consent and registration for a youthful patron 130.
            [0050] In some cases, server 142 may prompt computing device or kiosk 100 or
   administrative/registrar entity 150 to ask patron 130 answers to one or more questions
30 patron 130 provided during registration. Server 142 may provide the answers to

                                                  17
   computing device or kiosk 100 or administrative/registrar entity 150 so computing device
   or kiosk 100 or administrative/registrar entity 150 may do a visual comparison, and/or
   computing device or kiosk 100 or administrative/registrar entity 150 may submit the
   answers to server 142 for the server to do comparisons.
 5         [0051] Some of the information or data collected from patron 130 may be
   confirmed or verified against various public, government and private databases.
       e   that various identification information is consistent-for example, that the
           patron's name, patron's age, and patron's address are consistent with each other.
       *   that the patron's physical (or virtual) gaming location and/or domicile and identity
10         are consistent with the specific kind of gaming that the patron proposes to engage
           in.
       e   checking credit to determine credit worthiness.
       e   issuing credit for gaming (e.g., running credit reports, etc. with goal to issue funds
           for credit against future gaming).
15     e   that the patron is not a prohibited person or in a prohibited jurisdiction (e.g., listed
           with the Office of Foreign Asset Control, or a national of North Korea).
       e   etc.
           [0052] In some cases, gaming server 142 may also inform patron 130 that patron
20 130 can deposit funds into his account, withdraw funds from his account and/or transfer
   funds between or among accounts by visiting administrative/registrar entity 150 or
   through computing device 100. Server 142 may provide such information to patron 130
   as part of registration and/or the information may be accessible to patron 130 when
   gaming, for example, via an information/help page, for example.
25         [0053] In some cases, subsequent to registering, patron 130 may physically visit
   administrative/registrar entity 150 informing administrative/registrar entity 150 that
   patron 130 needs to complete registration. In response, administrative/registrar entity 150,
   using computing device 100/152, for example, may access server 142 such as through a
   dedicated application and/or through a web based application hosted by server 142. Upon
30 accessing server 142, administrative/registrar entity 150 may indicate to the server that

                                                 18
   administrative/registrar entity 150 is verifying the identity of patron 130, for example, to
   complete the patron's registration. Server 142 may provide administrative/registrar entity
   150 with a list of patron's awaiting verification for administrative/registrar entity 150 to
   choose from. As another and/or additional example, administrative/registrar entity 150
 5 may enter the name of patron 130 that administrative/registrar entity 150 is attempting to
   verify/authenticate. As a further and/or additional example, administrative/registrar entity
   150 may be required to enter (or have patron 130 enter) the ID(s) 134 assigned to patron
   130 during registration. As part of verification, administrative/registrar entity 150 may
   visually inspect one or more documents provided by patron 130. Administrative/registrar
10 entity 150 may also visually compare patron 130 to a photo ID provided by patron 130.
            [0054] In particular, to perform verification/authentication, server 142 may
   provide administrative/registrar entity 150 with information patron 130 provided during
   registration and administrative/registrar entity 150 may compare that information to the
   document(s) provided by patron 130. If all information matches including for example,
15 the photo proffered by patron 130 matches to patron 130, administrative/registrar entity
   150 may indicate to server 142 that patron 130 is verified. As another and/or additional
   example, administrative/registrar entity 150 may enter into the system information
   obtained from the documents provided by patron 130, which information may be
   conveyed to server 142. Here, server 142 may determine if all information matches and
20 convey back to administrative/registrar entity 150 that patron 130 is verified. Here again,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may still need to indicate patron 130 matches a photo
   ID provided by patron 130. As another and/or additional example,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may need to scan a photo ID of patron 130 and submit
   the scan in addition to a photo of patron 130 taken by administrative/registrar entity 150
25 to server 142. Here, an administrator of gaming operator 140 may compare the photo and
   scan as part of the verification. As another and/or additional example,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may need to scan one or more documents provided by
   patron 130 and submit these to server 142, possibly in addition to a scan of a photo ID of
   the patron and a photo of the patron. Here again, an administrator of gaming operator 140
30 may analyze all information provided by administrative/registrar entity 150 in connection

                                                 19
   with information previously provided by patron 130 to perform verification. As another
   example, administrative/registrar entity 150 may contact an administrator of gaming
   operator 140 (such as by phone) and verbally verify to the administrator that the person is
   verified. Other variations are possible including again, any variation/combination of the
 5 above. In general, regardless of how verification is performed, administrative/registrar
   entity 150 may need to scan one or more documents provided by patron 130 and submit
   these to server 142, possibly in addition to a scan of a photo ID of the patron and a photo
   of the patron.
           [0055] In some cases, administrative/registrar entity 150, at some time during the
10 verification, may need to submit to server 142 his ID 154. In this fashion, server
   142/gaming operator 140 knows that the information is coming from an authorized agent.
   In the example where administrative/registrar entity 150 speaks with an administrator of
   gaming operator 140, administrative/registrar entity 150 may need to verbally provide ID
   154 and/or submit ID 154 to server 142 via computing system 152.
15 V.      Gaming activities
           [0056] Patron 130 may then use screen 312 and keypad 310 to participate in
   gaming offered on kiosk or computing device 100. The games may be hosted on
   microprocessor 110 on kiosk 100, or kiosk 100 may operate as a terminal/browser client
   for games hosted on a remote server. Gaming tasks may be divided among various
20 computers in various ways, for example, betting lines may come from one remote
   computer, the betting book and patron accounts may be handled on another, and kiosk
   100 may manage other parts of the gaming activity.
           [0057] As patron 130 begins each form of gaming activity, kiosk or computing
   device 100 or some other gaming device may confirm the legal suitability/permissibility
25 of patron 130 for that specific type of gaming in the specific relevant jurisdictions.
           [0058] As gaming progresses, patron 130 may request transfers of funds to or
   from an account maintained by the gaming establishment for gaming at kiosk or
   computing device 100 and the patron's bank, credit card or other source of funding, or
   other accounts.

                                                20
            [0059] Kiosk or computing device 100 may collect data at each taxable event (for
   example, a win of a bet, especially a win that takes the patron's winnings for a day above
   a threshold for W-2G, 1099, or 1042-S reporting) and complete, file, submit and/or print
   transaction records, forms and reports, including for government and regulatory
 5 authorities. If tax withholding information was not gathered during the
   verification/registration phase, kiosk or computing device 100 may ask patron 130 for
   that information at any time that patron 130 becomes subject to withholding or reporting
   requirements.
            [0060] At the end of gaming activities, patron 130 may request that any portion of
10 the balance remaining in the patron's wagering account be paid out to him or her. Payout
   may be paid through currency/coin dispenser 702, or may be refunded to one of the
   patron's bank accounts or credit card account or other account designated as a source of
   funding. The request for payout may be offered from the kiosk's home page, and kiosk or
   computing device 100 may then lead patron 130 through a series of screens that ask
15 patron 130 what portion of the current balance of the wagering account is to be paid out,
   and in what form. Kiosk or computing device 100 may send a receipt or report to the
   patron's email address.
   VI.     Handling funds through computing device 100 or agent 150
            [0061] In some cases, patron 130 may also and/or alternatively use
20 administrative/registrar entity 150 to deposit funds into and/or withdraw funds from the
   patron's account. In some cases, patron 130 may physically visit administrative/registrar
   entity 150 informing administrative/registrar entity 150 that patron 130 would to make a
   deposit and/or withdrawal funds. In response, administrative/registrar entity 150, using
   computing system 152, for example, may access server 142 such as through a dedicated
25 application and/or through a web based application hosted by server 142. Upon accessing
   server 142, administrative/registrar entity 150 may indicate to the server that
   administrative/registrar entity 150 is making a withdrawal and/or making deposit. Server
   142 may provide administrative/registrar entity 150 with a list of patrons 130 to choose
   from. As another and/or additional example, administrative/registrar entity 150 may enter
30 the name of patron 130. As a further and/or additional example, administrative/registrar

                                                 21
   entity 150 may be required to enter (or have patron 130 enter) the ID(s) 134 assigned to
   patron 130 during registration. Assuming patron 130 is in the system and can identified
   by server 142, server 142 may pull one or more pieces of information from the patron's
   account, such as the patron's account balance, and may provide that information to
 5 computing system 152. Server 142 also provide a photo of the patron to computing
   system 152 and request administrative/registrar entity 150 to visually verify the photo
   matches the patron. Administrative/registrar entity 150 may be required to respond to
   server 142 that there is a match. Server 142 also provide an account status such as locked,
   partially locked, or unlocked thereby indicate whether patron 130 may or may not be able
10 to make a deposit and/or withdrawal and/or may or may not be able to make a partial
   deposit and/or partial withdrawal.
            [0062] Assuming patron 130 is seeking to make a deposit and the account is open,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may physically receive funds (such as cash, check,
   money order, etc.) from patron 130 and communicate to server 142 the amount of
15 received funds. In response, server 142 may add the funds to the patron's account.
   Alternatively, patron 130 may indicate that the funds should be transferred to the gaming
   account from some other account, such as from a credit card or other source of funding.
   Here, administrative/registrar entity 150 may receive the account i information from patron
   130 and submit such information to server 142 such that the server may effectuate the
20 transfer and add the funds to the patron's account (note that in some cases, through the
   use of administrative/registrar entity 150, there is some reassurance to gaming operator
   140 that the account from which funds are being taken is indeed the patron's account.)
   Regardless, the server may then communicate a receipt to patron 130 via email, text, etc.
   The server may also and/or alternatively communicate a receipt to computing system 152
25 for the patron's inspection and/or for printing by administrative/registrar entity 150 for
   patron 130. Server 142 may also display on computing system 152 the patron's adjusted
   balance. Other means may be used to convey a verification of account status to patron
   130. As another example, upon receiving funds from patron 130, administrative/registrar
   entity 150 may alternatively and/or in addition speak with an administrator of gaming
30 operator 140 and indicate that administrative/registrar entity 150 has received funds from

                                                 22
   patron 130 and that the patron's account balance should be adjusted accordingly. Again, a
   receipt may be communicated to patron 130 in various fashions such as through email,
   text, by communicating a receipt to computing system 152 for printing, etc. Other and/or
   additional variations are possible.
 5          [0063] As part of making a deposit to a patron's account, administrative/registrar
   entity 150, at some time during the deposit, may need to submit to server 142 his ID 154.
   In this fashion, server 142/gaming operator 140 knows that an authorized agent has the
   funds. In the example where administrative/registrar entity 150 speaks with an
   administrator of gaming operator 140, administrative/registrar entity 150 may need to
10 verbally provide ID 154 and/or submit ID 154 to server 142 via computing system 152.
            [0064] Assuming patron 130 is seeking to make a withdrawal and the account is
   open, administrative/registrar entity 150 may communicate to server 142 that amount of
   funds patron 130 wishes to withdraw. In response, server 142 may determine if such
   requested amount can be withdrawn (e.g., does the account have sufficient funds) and/or a
15 lesser amount that can be withdrawn and accordingly withdraw the funds from the
   patron's account/adjust the account balance. The server may then communicate to
   computing system 152 the amount withdrawn (again, which amount may be less than
   requested). In turn, administrative/registrar entity 150 may then hand to patron 130 the
   indicated amount of funds (e.g., in cash, check, money order, etc). Alternatively, patron
20 130 may indicate that the funds should be transferred from the gaming account to some
   other account, such as a credit card account or other source of funding. Here,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may receive the account information from patron 130
   and submit such information to server 142 such that the server may effectuate the transfer
   and remove the funds to the patron's account and add the funds to the designated account
25 (in some cases, through the use of administrative/registrar entity 150, there is some
   reassurance to gaming operator 140 that the account to which funds are being transferred
   is indeed the patron's account). The server may then communicate a receipt to patron 130
   via email, text, etc. The server may also and/or alternatively communicate a receipt to
   computing system 152 for the patron's inspection and/or for printing by
30 administrative/registrar entity 150 for patron 130. Server 142 may also display on

                                                 23
   computing system 152 the patron's adjusted balance. Other means may be used to
   convey a verification of account status to patron 130. As another example,
   administrative/registrar entity 150 may alternatively and/or in addition speak with an
   administrator of gaming operator 140 and indicate that patron 130 wishes to withdrawal
 5 funds and that the patron's account balance should be adjusted accordingly. Similar to
   above, the administrator of gaming operator 140 may determine an amount, if any that
   can be withdrawn, and communicate such to administrative/registrar entity 150. Again, a
   receipt may be communicated to patron 130 in various fashions such as through email,
   text, by communicating a receipt to computing system 152 for printing, etc. Other and/or
10 additional variations are possible.
           [0065] As part of making a withdrawal from a patron's account,
   administrative/registrar entity 150, at some time during the withdrawal, may need to
   submit to server 142 his ID 154. In this fashion, server 142/gaming operator 140 knows
   that an authorized agent is making the request and that funds are being properly dispersed
15 to patron 130. In the example where administrative/registrar entity 150 speaks with an
   administrator of gaming operator 140, administrative/registrar entity 150 may need to
   verbally provide ID 154 and/or submit ID 154 to server 142 via computing system 152.
           [0066] In some cases, patron 130 may also and/or alternatively use
   administrative/registrar entity 150 to transfer funds between multiple gaming accounts of
20 patron 130. For example, gaming operator 140 may require patron 130 have different
   accounts for different types of gaming or retail activity. For example, patron 130 may
   have one account for wagering/betting on sports, one account for wagering/betting on
   casino type games, one account for wagering/betting on interactive games (like poker),
   and one account for retail activity such as food, entertainment, or nightclubs at host
25 casino. As another example, patron 130 may have multiple accounts with different
   gaming operators 140. In some cases, patron 130 may physically visit
   administrative/registrar entity 150, informing administrative/registrar entity 150 that
   patron 130 would like to transfer funds between accounts. Assuming the accounts are
   with the same gaming operator, administrative/registrar entity 150, using computing
30 system 152, for example, may access a server 142 of the provider as similarly discussed

                                                 24
   above, and then instruct the server to transfer funds between the accounts, as similarly
   discussed above. Assuming the accounts are with different gaming operators,
   administrative/registrar entity 150, using a computing system 152, for example may
   access a server 142 of each gaming operator as similarly discussed above, and withdrawal
 5 the funds from one account and deposit the funds into another account, as similarly
   discussed above. Between transfers, administrative/registrar entity 150 may place the
   funds in an account of administrative/registrar entity 150. Other variations are possible to
   transfer funds between accounts.
           [0067] In some cases, administrative/registrar entity 150 may charge and/or
10 collect a fee from patron 130 and/or gaming operator 140 for assisting in the registration
   of patron 130, for depositing funds into a patron's account, and/or for withdrawing funds
   from a patron's account.
           [0068] In some cases, a computing device or kiosk 100 with a camera and face
   recognition software, or with other biometric sensors, may provide additional account
15 security to permit financial services transactions that are not traditionally available at a
   routine ATM. For example, most banks limit maximum withdrawals to $1000 or some
   similar amount. With the additional identity verification permitted by one, two, three,
   four, or more biometric sensors, a bank may permit a larger withdrawal, or may permit
   transactions that are not routinely available with simple entry of a four-digit PIN.
20 VII.    Regulatory and financial records, statements, and reporting
           [0069] Kiosk or computing device 100, or gaming server 142, or another
   computer of the computing system may be programmed to gather information to ensure
   compliance with gaming regulations, tax laws, financial monitoring laws (for example,
   money laundering, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws), and for financial
25 reporting.
           [0070] In some cases, patron 130 via computing device 100 and/or via an
   agent/computing system 152 may be able to obtain from gaming operator 140 via server
   142, for example, each amount patron 130 has won, each amount patron 130 has lost,
   total winnings, total losses, and/or net losses or winnings. Such a report may be over a
30 specified duration of time, such as a given month or months, a given calendar year, etc.

                                                   25
   In the event patron 130 has multiple accounts with a given gaming operator, the report
   may be over each account and a summary for all accounts. In some cases,
   administrative/registrar entity 150, such as through computing device 100, may generate
   such a report for patron 130 if patron 130 has accounts across multiple gaming operators
 5 140. In some cases, patron 130 may be able to use such a report(s) for tax reporting
   purpose to one or more jurisdictions (such as a country, state, city, federal, or other
   geographical region or tax jurisdiction.)
           [0071] Computing device or kiosk 100 may permit patron 130 to obtain account
   statements for:
10     e   personal tax reporting-for example, patron 130 may be able to request tax
           statements relating to his or her gaming activities, which could be delivered
           electronically or by mail
       e   gaming activities (e.g., win/loss statements, points accumulation, etc.)
       e   retail activities (e.g., restaurant consumption use, resort activity, etc)
15         [0072] Computing device or kiosk 100 may permit gaming operator 140 to file
   reports required by government and regulatory authorities, including:
       e   SARC (Suspicious Activity Report for Casinos) filings-for example, if patron
           130 engages in a transaction that requires SARC filing, then the system would
           recognize the event and automatically file a SARC.
20     e   Any other regulatory, tax, etc. filings.
   VIII.   Other features
           [0073] Kiosk 100 may be programmed to function as an ordinary ATM, once a
   person inserts a traditional ATM card into card acceptor 522. Similar, kiosk or
   computing device may be programmed to accept large bills and provide small bills,
25 simply to make change for patrons.
           [0074] Printer 712 may be used to print various receipts of registration, deposit, or
   withdrawal or transaction records, forms and reports. Printer 712 may also be used to
   print bar coded tickets with negotiable value. Receipts or transaction records, forms and
   reports may be sent to the patron's email account or by SMS to the patron's telephone.

                                                  26
            [0075] Nonvolatile storage may be used to journal patron-visible transactions,
   machine errors, and patron-invisible machine state transitions. Events journaled may
   include various errors, deposits, payouts, and the like. The journal may be printed on
   printer 712, emailed to the managing operator's office, or the like.
 5          [0076] Microprocessor 110 of kiosk or computing device 100 may support a
   number of management/maintenance operations, such as inquiries of cash inventor, cash
   taken in or paid out, bill rejections, and the like.
   IX.      Computer implementation
            [0077] Various processes described herein may be implemented by appropriately
10 programmed general purpose computers, special purpose computers and computing
   devices. Typically a processor (e.g., one or more microprocessors 110, one or more
   microcontrollers, one or more digital signal processors) will receive instructions (e.g.,
   from a memory or like device), and execute those instructions, thereby performing one or
   more processes defined by those instructions. Instructions may be embodied in one or
15 more computer programs, or one or more scripts. The processing may be performed on
   one or more microprocessors, central processing units (CPUs), computing devices,
   microcontrollers, digital signal processors, or like devices or any combination thereof.
   Programs that implement the processing, and the data operated on, may be stored and
   transmitted using a variety of media. In some cases, hard-wired circuitry or custom
20 hardware may be used in place of, or in combination with, some or all of the software
   instructions that can implement the processes. Algorithms other than those described
   may be used.
            [0078] In some cases, kiosk or computing device 100 may be a "thin client," with
   almost all processing performed at a central server. In other cases, kiosk or computing
25 device 100 may be software-heavy, hosting most of the management operations, device
   operations, gaming activities, etc. Kiosk or computing device 100 may have one or
   multiple microprocessors 110. A server computer or centralized authority may or may
   not be necessary or desirable. In various cases, the network may or may not include a
   central authority device. Various processing functions may be performed on a central

                                                  27
   authority server, one of several distributed servers, or other distributed devices. Tasks
   and computation may be divided as convenient.
            [0079] Programs and data may be stored in various media appropriate to the
   purpose, or a combination of heterogeneous media that may be read and/or written by a
 5 computer, a processor or a like device. The media may include non-volatile media,
   volatile media, optical or magnetic media, dynamic random access memory (DRAM),
   static ram, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic
   medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other
   physical medium with patterns of holes, electromagnetic domains or spots, a RAM, a
10 PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge or other
   memory technologies. Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber
   optics, including the wires that comprise a system bus coupled to the processor.
            [0080] Databases may be implemented using database management systems or ad
   hoc memory organization schemes. Alternative database structures to those described
15 may be readily employed. Databases may be stored locally or remotely from a device
   which accesses data in such a database.
            [0081] Processing may be performed in a network environment including a
   computer that is in communication (e.g., via a communications network) with one or
   more devices. The computer may communicate with the devices directly or indirectly,
20 via any wired or wireless medium (e.g. the Internet, LAN, WAN or Ethernet, Token Ring,
   a telephone line, a cable line, a radio channel, an optical communications line,
   commercial on-line service providers, bulletin board systems, a satellite communications
   link, a combination of any of the above). Each of the devices may themselves comprise
   computers or other computing devices, such as those based on the Intel@ Pentium@ or
25 CentrinoTM processor, that are adapted to communicate with the computer. Any number
   and type of devices may be in communication with the computer.
            [0082] A computer network system may be used for gaming or other financial
   transactions. System may include one or more gaming operators 140, one or more
   administrative/registrar entities 150, and a plurality of patrons 130. Network 102 may

                                                 28
   include a public and/or private network(s) and be a wired and/or wireless network based
   on any type of technology. Network 102 may include in part the Internet.
           [0083] Any given patron 130 may engage in gaming activities through one or
   more computing systems 100 such as a computer, server, laptop, computing pad, smart
 5 phone etc. that may intercommunicate with a server 142, for example, and/or one or more
   other computing systems 100 of other patrons 130. A computing device 100 may be
   dedicated to interworking with gaming operator(s) 140/server 142 and or may be a
   general purpose device. Such a computing system may include one or more processors
   and one or memories and/or be interfaced to one or more external memories, such as one
10 or more and/or databases. Computing device 100 may include one or more network
   hardware/software/firmware 320 based interfaces that enable the device to connect to and
   communicate over network 102. Computing device 100 may also include one or more
   software and/or firmware and/or hardware based application(s) that execute on the
   computing system to intercommunicate with gaming operator 140/server 142 and/or other
15 patrons/computing devices 100 to participate in gaming, for example. As another
   example, computing device 100 may interwork with gaming operator 140/server 142
   through a web based application hosted by server 142. Other variations are possible.
           [0084] Gaming operator 140 may provide gaming services to patrons 130,
   offering one or more types of gaming activities to patrons 130. Such games may include,
20 for example, any one or more of:
       e   Games where patron 130 may bet/wager against a house entity 140. Such games
           may include, e.g., casino type games such as card games (e.g., blackjack,
           baccarat), dice games (e.g., craps), roulette, slots, etc. These games may be
           virtual games (e.g., use computer generated cards, dice, roulette wheel spins, slot
25         machine reel spins) in which game outcomes/game results are based
           on/determined from random number generator(s), for example. As another
           example, these games may be non-virtual games in which game outcomes/game
           results are based on actual cards, dice, roulette wheel spins, slot machine reel
           spins, etc. As another example, these games may be a combination of both.

                                           29
   e Games where patron 130 may bet/wager on sporting events, including, for
     example, football, soccer, basketball, baseball, hockey, horses, dogs, cars, etc.
   e Games where patron 130 may participate in fantasy sporting events, including, for
     example, football, soccer, basketball, baseball, hockey, horses, dogs, cars, etc.
 5 e Interactive games where patron 130 wagers against one or more other patrons, for
     example. Such games may include casino type games such as card games (e.g.,
     poker). These games may be virtual games (e.g., use computer generated cards)
     in which game outcomes/game results are based on/detennined from random
     generator(s), for example. As another example, these games may be non-virtual
10   games in which game outcomes/game results are based on actual cards.
   * Games may include fantasy sporting events in which patrons wager against one
     another. As another example, such games may be video games in which patrons
     wager against patrons. As another example, such games may include games of
     chance, semi-chance, or skill, such as chess, checkers, board games, Scrabble,
15   Risk, etc.
   * Lottery/lotto games where patron 130 may choose one or more numbers, for
     example, lottery, keno, bingo, etc., or may include an electronic scratch card.
     These games may be virtual games in which selected numbers, for example, to
     determine game outcomes are based on/determined from random generator(s), for
20   example. As another example, these games may be non-virtual games in which
     selected numbers, for example, to determine game outcomes are based
     on/determined from actual numbers pulled from hoppers, for example.
   e Games where patron 130 wagers on external events, such as weather, movies,
     elections, game shows, time of birth or name to be assigned by celebrity parents of
25   soon-to-be-born babies, etc.
   * gambling, betting, wagering, gaming, games, fantasy sports, tournaments, leagues,
     social games, skill games, play-for-fun, promotions, sweepstakes and contests and
     fantasy or virtual sports, exchanges or markets.

                                                 30
       * Patron 130 may wager against a house type entity/book maker (e.g. gaming
            operator 140) and/or be wagered against other patrons (e.g., side bets in craps),
            and/or in pari-mutuel against other bettors, and/or other arrangements.
       * Patron 130 may wager real money/currency, points/tokens/credits/digital
 5          currency/etc. that patron 130 purchases with real money, and/or
            points/tokens/credits/digital currency/etc. that patron 130 is assigned but that
            patron 130 does not purchase with real money.
   These games are merely examples; gaming operator 140 may offer other types of games.
            [0085] Entity 140 may be a casino, book maker, racing track, internet gaming
10 operation, or other gaming operator, or may be a financial institution such as a bank or
   other financial entity that needs verification of customer identity.
            [0086] Gaming operator 140 may own and/or operate one or more computing
   systems (e.g., servers) 142. (The use of the term "server" is non-limiting, and that other
   types of computing systems may be used.) Server 142 may include one or more
15 processors and one or memories and/or be interfaced to one or more external memories,
   such as one or more databases. Server 142 may include one or more network
   hardware/software/firmware based interfaces 100 that enable the server to connect to and
   communicate over network 102. Server 142 may also include one or more software
   and/or firmware and/or hardware based application(s) 100 that execute on the server. One
20 or more of such applications may be web based applications. As an example, such
   applications may include actual games offered by gaming operator 140, and
   administrative applications 100 such as patron account balance management, patron
   registration/signup, etc.
            [0087] The apparatus that performs the process can include a plurality of
25 computing devices that work together to perform the process. Some of the computing
   devices may work together to perform each step of a process, may work on separate steps
   of a process, may provide underlying services that other computing devices that may
   facilitate the performance of the process. Such computing devices may act under
   instruction of a centralized authority. In another embodiment, such computing devices
30 may act without instruction of a centralized authority. Some examples of apparatus that

                                                31
   may operate in some or all of these ways may include grid computer systems, cloud
   computer systems, peer-to-peer computer systems, computer systems configured to
   provide software as a service, and so on. For example, the apparatus may comprise a
   computer system that executes the bulk of its processing load on a remote server but
 5 outputs display information to and receives patron input information from a local patron
   computer, such as a computer system that executes VMware software.
            [0088] Further, programs that implement such methods (as well as other types of
   data) may be stored and transmitted using a variety of media (e.g., computer readable
   media) in a number of manners. In some embodiments, hard-wired circuitry or custom
10 hardware may be used in place of, or in combination with, some or all of the software
   instructions that can implement the processes of various embodiments. Thus, various
   combinations of hardware and software may be used instead of software only.
            [0089] Where databases are described, (i) alternative database structures to those
   described may be readily employed, and (ii) other memory structures besides databases
15 may be readily employed. Any illustrations or descriptions of any sample databases
   presented herein are illustrative arrangements for stored representations of information.
   Any number of other arrangements may be employed besides those suggested by, e.g.,
   tables illustrated in drawings or elsewhere. Similarly, any illustrated entries of the
   databases represent exemplary information only; the number and content of the entries
20 can be different from those described herein. Further, despite any depiction of the
   databases as tables, other formats (including relational databases, object-based models
   and/or distributed databases) could be used to store and manipulate the data types
   described herein. Likewise, object methods or behaviors of a database can be used to
   implement various processes, such as the described herein. In addition, the databases
25 may, in a known manner, be stored locally or remotely from a device which accesses data
   in such a database.
            [0090] Various embodiments can be configured to work in a network environment
   including a computer that is in communication (e.g., via a communications network) with
   one or more devices. The computer may communicate with the devices directly or
30 indirectly, via any wired or wireless medium (e.g. the Internet, LAN, WAN or Ethernet,

                                                  32
   Token Ring, a telephone line, a cable line, a radio channel, an optical communications
   line, alternative spectrum, commercial on-line casinos, bulletin board systems, a satellite
   communications link, a combination of any of the above). Each of the devices may
   themselves comprise computers or other computing devices, such as those based on the
 5 Intel*, Pentium*, or CentrinoTM, Atomi" or CoreTm processor, that are adapted to
   communicate with the computer. Any number and type of devices may be in
   communication with the computer.
            [0091] In an embodiment, a server computer or centralized authority may not be
   necessary or desirable. For example, the present invention may, in an embodiment, be
10 practiced on one or more devices without a central authority. In such an embodiment,
   any functions described herein as performed by the server computer or data described as
   stored on the server computer may instead be performed by or stored on one or more such
   devices.
            [0092] In various encryption methods, ciphers may require a supplementary piece
15 of information called a key. A key may consist, for example, of a string of bits. A key
   may be used in conjunction with a cipher to encrypt plaintext. A key may also be used in
   conjunction with a cipher to decrypt ciphertext. In a category of ciphers called symmetric
   key algorithms (e.g., private-key cryptography), the same key is used for both encryption
   and decryption. The sanctity of the encrypted information may thus depend on the key
20 being kept secret. Examples of symmetric key algorithms are DES and AES. In a
   category of ciphers called asymmetric key algorithms (e.g., public-key cryptography),
   different keys are used for encryption and decryption. With an asymmetric key
   algorithm, any member of the public may use a first key (e.g., a public key) to encrypt
   plaintext into ciphertext. However, only the holder of a second key (e.g., the private key)
25 will be able to decrypt the ciphertext back in to plaintext. An example of an asymmetric
   key algorithm is the RSA algorithm.
