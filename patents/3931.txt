ABSTRACT
The present invention relates to a method of treating MS in a human patient in need of
such treatment and comprises administering to said patient a combination therapy in a
single oral dosage form (e.g. a tablet or capsule) of dimethylfumarate and one agent
selected from teriflunomide (or its prodrug leflunomide), fingolimod and laquinimod. This
combination is more effective than the single agents alone and/or has reduced side
effects and better tolerability than the single agents alone and/or can be given in a
reduced frequency. Moreover, the present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical
composition suitable for the oral treatment of multiple sclerosis consisting of
dimethylfumarate and one agent selected from teriflunomide, fingolimod and laquinimod
as active ingredients and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.

             COMBINATION THERAPY FOR TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2013298517,
which is an Australian national phase application derived from International Patent
Application No. PCT/EP2013/066285 filed on 2 August 2013, which claims the benefit of
priority from European Application No. 12179232.9 filed on 3 August 2012, European
Application No. 12187939.9 filed on 10 October 2012, and U.S. Application No. 61/712,008
filed on 10 October 2012, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by
reference in their entirety.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions for oral use comprising a fixed
combination of a first active pharmaceutical ingredient of dimethylfumarate or a
pharmaceutically acceptable administration form thereof and a second active
pharmaceutical ingredient selected from teriflunomide, fingolimod and laquinimod or a
pharmaceutically acceptable administration form thereof and to the use of such
compositions in treating multiple sclerosis. The use of dimethylfumarate in combination
with teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod according to this invention allows lowering
the dose of dimethylfumarate and/or the agent selected from teriflunomide, fingolimod and
laquinimod below levels previously believed to be necessary for efficacy, while achieving
better efficacy with comparable adverse effects than seen for the individual agents.
Depending on the selected doses the combination therapy can also achieve non-inferior
efficacy compared to each of the individual agents when given alone at optimally effective
dose but will be associated with less adverse effects compared to the individual agents when
given alone at an optimally effective dose. The combinations according to the present
invention may also allow for a reduced dosing frequency.
BACKGROUND
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that attacks myelinated axons in
the central nervous system (CNS). It is thought that MS is caused by a T-cell triggered,
autoimmune inflammatory reaction with additional B cell activation, involvement of
monocytes and macrophages, secretion of cytokines and breakdown of the blood-brain
barrier. When myelin is lost nerves can no longer effectively conduct signals which can lead
to a plethora of clinical symptoms including sensory defects, motor dysfunctions, visual
impairments, bladder and bowel difficulties, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, and even cognitive
impairment.
Initially, most cases of MS follow a relapsing-remitting pattern where short episodes of
neurologic exacerbations resolve completely but relapses occur (relapsing-remitting MS,
RRMS). Later, approximately half of patients develop a continuously progressive pattern
with often permanent disability (secondary progressive MS, SPMS). Some cases of MS
follow a continuously progressive pattern without remission phases already from the
beginning (primary progressive MS, PPMS). Other cases have periods of acute exacerbations
while proceeding along a course of increasing neurological deficits without remissions
(progressive-relapsing MS, PRMS). The onset of the disease is usually in young adults and it
is more common in women. About 2-2.5 million people are living with MS worldwide.
                                                1

The treatment of choice for exacerbations is generally high doses of corticosteroids. The
treatment of the chronic progression of MS aims to target the underlying immune disorder
with the goal to reduce the frequency of relapses, to reduce the progression of disability and
to preserve brain structure.        The available treatments are generally based on
immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory mechanisms while for some drugs additional
direct neuroprotective effects are postulated.
                                              1A

Treatment success in clinical trials is primarily measured by the reduction in annual relapse rate (ARR) while
other commonly used endpoints include time to disability progression as assessed by the Expanded
Disablity Status Scale (EDSS) or reduction in new brain lesions as measured by brain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI).
Al currently available agents are only approved for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. The first agents
were aI injectable drugs (FDA        approved are Interferon     beta-la (Avonex  Rebif    Interferon beta-lb
(Betaseron    Extavia) Glatiramer    cetate (Copaxone and Natalizumab (Tysabri)) and only recently two oral
drugs received an MS label (Fingolimod (Gilenya) in 2010 and teriflunomide (Aubaglo in 2012). In addition,
MS is treated with chemotherapeutic agents such as the FDA approved Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) or off
label azathioprine, methotrexate, cadribine and cyclophosphamide.
Besides the approved oral drugs fingolimod and teriflunomide, various other oral agents are in clinical
development for MS the most advanced being dimethylfumarate (Panaclar (BG-12), Biogen Idec), and
laquinimod (SAIK-MS, Active Biotech) al having completed Phase H11      studies.
Dimethylfumarate ("DMF"; trans-1I2-Ethylenedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester) (Formula 1) belongs to the
class of fumaric acd esters (FAE) and appears to have the most attractive safety profile and good efficacy
based on two randomized, double-blind placebo-controled dose-comparison Pmse IMstudies with overall
more than 2600 patients (DEFINE study (Gold R. et al. N Eng         Med. 2012 Sep 20;367(12):1098-107) and
CONFIRM study (Fox RJ et at, N Engl j Med. 2012 Sep 20;367(12):1087-97). Both studies evaluated
direthylfumarate (BG-12) 240 mg twice daly (BID) and three times daily (TID) versus placebo while the
CONFRM study also included an active, reference comparator arm with subcutaneous glatiramer acetate
(GA) 20 rng daily,
Regarding efficacy 240 mg BiD and 240 mg TID of direthylfumarate appeared to be superior to the most
widely used conventional agents the Interferons (based on indirect comparison) and Glatiramer acetate
(based on direct comparison n the CONFIRM trial)         but still many patients do experience relapses and
progression of disability and may require subsequent therapy with more effective but potentially also more
harmful intravenous agents such as Natalizurnab (Tysabri Biogen Idec) or of-label Alemtuzumab (Campath
Sanoi).
Regarding safety, the studies found that the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, including
serious infections and discontinuations due to dverse effects were similar across all study groups,
including placebo. This excellent safety profile is supported by more than 150.000 patient years experience
with another DMF-containing drug, Fumaderm, which has been approved for psoriasis in Germany in 1994
(Morwietz et     l, J Dtsch Dermatol Ges. 2007 Aug;5(8):716-7). Despite promising long-term safety data
dimethylfumarate is associated with some short term tolerabilty issues, mainly diarrhea and flushing,
which can lead to discontinuation of the drug in some patients.
 n more    etai CONFIRM which analyzed the safety and efficacy of dimethylfumnrate 240 mg po (per os         =
oral) capsule BID or TD vs. placebo vs. glatiramer acetate 20 mg sc (subcutaneously        once-daily in 1430
patients with RRMS showed that dimethylfumarate met the primary endpoint by significantly reducing
                                                      2

 annualized relapse rate by 44% and 51% for BID and TID, respectively versus placebo, It also met all
 secondary relapse and MRI endpoints in both dose regimens. Dimethylfumarate BID and TID reduced the
 number of new or newly enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions by 71 and 73%, new T1-hypointense lesions by
 57 and 65% and the proportion of patients who relapsed by 34 and 45% compared to 54, 41 and 29% for
glatiramer acetate, respectively. Dimethylfumarate also reduced 12-week confirmed disability progression
as measured by EDSS by 21% for BID and 24% for TID at 2 years compared to 7% for placebo and glatiramer
acetate. The most common adverse effects in the dimethylfumarate groups were flushing and
gastrointestinal (GI) events. There were no malignancies in the dimethylfumarate groups. The incidence of
these events decreased substantially in the dimethylfumarate groups after the 1st month. The most
frequently reported serious adverse effect was MS relapse, with no other events reported by more than 2
patients in any group (Press releases, Biogen, andFox RJ et al., N Engl J Med. 2012 Sep 20;367(12)1087-97
DEFINE, which analyzed the efficacy and safety of dimethylfumarate 240 po capsules BID and TID in 1237
patients with RRM showed a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with RRMS who relapsed at
2 years compared with placebo (primary endpoint, 49% reduction versus placebo for BID and 50%'
reduction versus placebo for TID). Both doses of dimethylfumarate showed a significant reduction in
annualized relapse rate (53% reduction versus placebo for BID and 48% reduction versus placebo for TID,
in the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions, in new gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+)
lesions, and in the rate of disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Severity Scale
(EDSS) at 2 years (secondary endpoint) (Gold R.et al., N Engl J Med. 2012 Sep 20;367(12):1098-107).
The exact mechanism of action of FAE has not been established but it is generally thought that effects are
mediated through depletion in intracellular glutathione (GSH) stores associated with a switch from an
inflammatory Th1 to a more anti-inflammatory Th2 immune response, reduction of peripheral CD4+ and
CD8+ T-lymphocytes due to apoptosis, and also nuclear factor kappa 8 (NF-KB)-dependent down
modulation of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecule expression (Mrowietz et al, Trends Mol.
Med. 2005 Jan;11(1):43-8). More recently, it was proposed that DMF could also act through induction of
type 11dendritic cells (Ghoreschi et al., J Exp Med. 2011; 208(11):2291-303). Finally, data also suggests a
direct anti-oxidant and neuroprotective effect mediated through nrf2 (Gold et al., Clin Immunol. 2012 Jan;
142(1):44-8).

Formula 1: Dimethylfumarate.
One candidate, teriflunomide (Genzyme) ((Z)-2-cyano-3-hydroxy-but-2-enoic acid-(4'-trifluoro
methylphenyl)-amide) (Formula 2) that, in accordance with this invention, may be used in combination with
DMF, also has an excellent safety profile in Phase IlIl trials where data on more than 2500 patients has
already been presented (TEMSO study, O'Connor et al, N Engl J Med. 201;365(14):1293-303, TENERE study
Press release, Sanofi, 20 Dec 2012, TOWER study, Press release, Sanofi, 1 Jun 2012). The most important
side effects seen in Phase IlIl trials were diarrhea, hair thinning and elevation of transaminases.
                                                   3

Teriflunomide's safety is supported through extensive use of Its prodrug leflunomide (Arava) in rheumatoid
arthritissince its initial approval in 1998. However, clinical efficacy of teriflunomide against MS was only In
the range of the conventional agents (indirect comparison to Interferons and direct comparison Glatiramer
acetate) and many patients do experience relapses and progression of disability, In fact, for the 7 mg dose,
the TENERE study found a higher relapse rate compared with Interferon and the TOWER study even found
no significant difference in 12-week sustained accumulation of disability compared with placebo.
More specifically, TEMSO, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase Ill trial of teriflunomide 7
mg and 14 mg p.o. once-daily in 1088 RRMS patients showed that teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg
significantly reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 31.2% and 31.5% at 2 years compared to placebo
(primary endpoint). The risk of disability progression was reduced by 24% and 30 for teriflunomide 7 mg
and 14 mg, respectively. Teriflunomide also reduced the brain disease activity on a range of magnetic
resonance imaging measures including reduction of the burden of disease by 39% and 67% for
teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, compared to placebo. Teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 rmg doses
were well tolerated, with treatment emergent adverse events including diarrhea, nausea and alanine
transferase increases were reported in similar number of patients. No serious opportunistic infections
occurred in patients treated with teriflunomide. Further results showed that teriflunomide 7 mg and 14mg
significantly increased the time to first relapse by 53.7% and 56.5% during the two years of the study
compared to 45.6% on placebo, respectively (TEMSO study, O'Connor et al, N Engl J Med.
201;365(14):1293-303 and Press release, Sanofi-Aventis, 30 Aug 2010 and Press release, Sanofi, 5 Oct
2011).
On the other hand, TENERE, a randomized, open-label Phase Il trial in 324 patients with RRMS to assess the
effectiveness of 2 doses of teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg po tablet once-daily vs Interferon-pla showed no
statistical superiority between the Rebif and teriflunomide arms (7 mg and 14 mg) on risk of treatment
failure, which was defined as the occurrence of a confirmed relapse or permanent treatment
discontinuation for any cause, whichever came first. However, the teriflunomide 7 mg dose showed a
higher relapse rate (0.410) than the 14 mg daily dose (0,259) and Rebif (0.216). Most adverse events
observed in the teriflunomide arms were mild in severity, including nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, hair thinning,
and back pain. These occurred with a higher incidence than in the Rebif arm. The most common adverse
 events observed in the Rebif arm were increases in alanine aminotransferase levels, headache and flu-like
 symptoms. These occurred with a higher incidence than In the teriflunomide arms. There were no deaths in
the trial (Press release, Sanofi, 20 Dec 2012).
 TOWER, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase Ill trial in 1169 RRMS patients,
 to evaluate 2 doses of teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg p.o. tablet once-daily versus placebo showed that
 patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg had a significant reduction of 36.3% in annualized relapse rate and
 31.5% reduction in the risk of 12wk sustained accumulation of disability compared to placebo, in the 7 mg
 group a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate was observed compared to placebo but there was
 no significant difference observed for the risk of 12wk sustained accumulation of disability. The most
 common types of adverse events reported more frequently in the teriflunomide arms were headache, ALT
 elevations, hair thinning, diarrhea, nausea and neutropenia (Press release, Sanofi, 1Jun 2012).
 Although in the above mentioned trials the 7 mg dose seemed to have somewhat lower efficacy than the
 14 mg dose both doses where approved by the FDA for treatment of RRMS in 2012.
                                                     4

Another Phase Il study, TOPIC, is underway in early MS or clinically isolated syndrome. Teriflunomide is
also being evaluated together with interferon-8 in the Phase IlIl TERACLES trial. With up to 10 years of
continuous use in a Phase 11 extension, teriflunomide has the longest clinical experience of any
investigational oral MS therapy.
Teriflunomide was also used in a Phase I combination trial as add-on therapy to IFN where a significant
effect on MRI endpoints was observed for 7 mg and 14 mg doses while no significant effect was seen for
the reduction in annualized relapse rate (Freedman, Neurology. 2012 Jun 5;78(23):1877-1885). In another
Phase il combination trial Teriflunomide at 7 mg or 14 mg added to glatiramer acetate was more effective
than placebo added to in reducing T1-Gd lesions (Freedman et a. Neurology. 2010;74(9):A293.).
Teriflunomide selectively and reversibly inhibits dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase (DHODHI), a mitochondrial
enzyme required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. De novo pyrimidine synthesis is required for fast
proliferating cells such as activated lymphocytes to meet their needs in DNA, lipid, and sugar metabolism.
These effects finally result in strong anti-inflammatory properties through reduced activation and
expansion of T- and B-cells in response to autoantigens without apparent cytotoxicity. Teriflunomide has
also demonstrated efficiency in Inhibiting T-cell-dependent antibody production, suggesting that it
modulates the interaction between T cells and B cells. Other effects Include reduction of migratory
capability of T cells, a diminished ability for exposed T cells to activate monocytes, induction of naive T cells
to favor anti-inflammatory Th-2 differentiation. Cells that rely on DHODH-independent salvage pathways
for pyrimidine synthesis (e.g. cells of the hematopoietic system and the gastrointestinal lining) are largely
 unaffected by teriflunomide's antiproliferative effects.

 Formula 2: Teriflunomide
 Another drug candidate that may be used in combination with DMF, according to the present invention, Is
 fingolimod (Formula 3). Fingolimod is already approved for RRMS in the US, many European countries and
 Japan at a dose of 0.5 mg p.o. once daily (Gilenya, Novartis), Fingolimod is an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate
 receptor (SIPR) modulator which blocks lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs. After uptake,
 fingolimod is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to the active form which can now bind with high
 affinity to S1PR. Binding of phosphorylated fingolimod leads to internalization and degradation of the
 receptor and also to downregulation of S1PR messenger RNA. This results In a decrease of S1PR on the cell
 surface with consecutive Inhibition of lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues into the peripheral blood
 and decreased lymphocyte levels In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which finally contributes to reduction of
                                                      5

inflammatory events in the central nervous system. In addition to its effects on peripheral blood
lymphocytes, it is postulated that fingolimod also has a direct neuroprotective effects through interaction
with SIPR on oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia.
The large Phase 3 clinical trial program of fingolimod in RRMS presented strong efficacy results and an
overall acceptable safety profile.
In detail, the 12-months active-comparator Phase IlIl trial TRANSFORMS which randomized 1292 patients
with RRMS and a history of at least one relapse to oral fingolimod (0.5 or 1.25mg/day) or intramuscular
(i.m.) IFN-b-la (Avonex, 30tpg/week) found that 1-year relapse rates with Fingolimod were 52% (0.5
mg/day) and 38% (1.25 mg/day) lower than with Avonex and that 83% (0. 5 mg/day and 0% (1.25
mg/day) of patients on fingolimod remained relapse-free vs. only 69% on Avonex. In addition, patients on
fingolimod had significantly fewer new or enlarged hyperintense T2 lesions and gadolinium-enhancing T1
lesions on MRI compared with patients on IFN-b-la. There were no significant differences among groups
with respect to EDSS scores. Fingolimod was well tolerated with no significant difference in the overall
number of AEs between the fingolimod and the IFN-b-la group, however the overall number of SAE in the
1.25 mg group seemed to be elevated (10.7% for 1.25 mg vs. 7.0% for 0.5 mg vs. 5.8% for IFN-b-la). AE
leading to the discontinuation of a study medication were also most frequent in the 1.25 mg group (10.0%
for 1.25 mg vs. 5.6% for 0.5 mg vs. 3.7% for IFN-b-1a), mainly consisting of bradycardia and atrioventricular
block. Overall, there was a transient, dose-dependent reduction in the heart rate that developed within 1
hour after the initial administration of fingolimod, which was consistent with the findings in prior trials. 1%
of patients in the 1.25 mg group and 0.5% of patients in the 0.5 mg group developed macular edema.
Reflecting fingolimod's mechanism of action lymphocyte counts were reduced after 1 month by 77% in the
1.25 mg group and by 73% in the 0.5 mg group. Mild and moderate upper and lower respiratory tract
infections were slightly more frequent among patients receiving fingolimod (Press releases Novartis and
Cohen JA et al., N EngI J Med. 2010 Feb 4;362(5):402-15).
The 24-month double-blind, placebo-controlled FREEDOMS trial studied 1272 patients with EDSS scores of
0-5.5, and at least one relapse in the previous year or at least two relapses in the previous 2 years and
fingolimod doses of 0.5 mg/day and 1.25 mg/day versus placebo, In this trial Fingolimod reduced the
frequency of MS relapses by 54% and 60%, and the risk of disability progression by 30% and 32% confirmed
after 3 months during the 24-months period and 37% and 40% confirmed after 6 months during the 24
 months period, respectively, vs. placebo. These findings were supported by positive effects on brain lesions
on MRI scans. Fingolimod was well tolerated with no difference in the overall number of AE, SAE and
 deaths between the fingolimod and the placebo group. However, AEs that led to discontinuation of the
study drug were more common with fingolimod at a dose of 1.25 mg (14.2% of patients) than with
 fingolimod at a dose of 0.5 mg (7.5% of patients) or with placebo (7.7% of patients), mainly consisting of
 bradycardia, atrioventricular conduction block at, macular edema, elevated liver-enzyme levels, and
 hypertension. Again, as seen in the earlier trial there was an increased risk for episodes of bradycardia in
 the two fingolimod groups but only after administration of the first dose, Effects on the heart rate and
 atrioventricular conduction appear to be dose-related and result from the modulation of sphingosine-l
 phosphate type I receptors in cardiac tissue. Macular edema was diagnosed in seven patients, all of whom
 were receiving 1.25 mg of fingolimod. Lymphopenia of less than 0.2x109 per liter developed In 5.4%, 3.5%
                                                     6

and 0.5% for the 1.25 mg dose, the 0.5 mg dose and placebo, respectively. Lower respiratory tract
infections were more common with fingolimod than with placebo, otherwise the incidence of infections
was similar (Press releases Novartis and Kappos L et al., N Engl J Med. 2010 Feb 4;362(5):387-401 and
Gergely P, Mult Scler 2009;15:Suppl 2:5125-5126.).
The follow-up up study FREEDOMS-11 and an extension trial of TRANSFORMS generally confirmed the data
discussed above (Press releases Novartis and Kathrl B et al, Lancet Neurol. 2011 Jun;10(6):520-9). With an
overall lower incidence of adverse events on 0.5 mg and no significant differences in efficacy, this dose was
selected as the preferred dosage for further development and was the dose finally approved by regulatory
agencies.

Formula 3: Fingolimod.
A further candidate which may be combined with DMF, in accordance with the present invention, is
laquinimod (Formula 4). Laquinimod has passed two large Phase IllIstudies (ALLEGRO and BRAVO trials with
 more than 2400 patients with RRMS) and was filed for marketing authorization in the EU in 2012, while a
confirmatory Phase III trial (CONCERTO in 1800 RRMS patients) to support the US submission is ongoing
 (Press releases Teva and Active Biotech and Comi G et al., N Engl J Med. 2012 Mar 15;366(11):1000-9).
 In ALLEGRO, the first of the two finished Phase Ill trials, patients were randomized to receive once-daily
 oral 0.6 mg laquinimod or matching placebo for 24 months. The primary endpoint was the number of
 confirmed relapses during the 24-months double blind study period while secondary endpoints included
 confirmed disability progression and changes in MRI. The study enrolled 1106 RRMS patients (Press
 releases Teva and Active Biotech and Comi G et al., N Engl J Med. 2012 Mar 15;366(11):1000-9). In
                                                                                              24
 ALLEGRO laquinimod showed a statistically significant 23% reduction in ARR (p=0.00 ) and a 36%
 reduction in the risk of EDDS progression (p=0.01 ) as well as a 33% significant reduction in progression of
                                                    22
 brain atrophy (p<0.0001). Laquinimod was generally safe and well-tolerated, The overall frequency of AEs
 was similar between the active and the placebo groups, with 87% for laquinimod and 81% for placebo. The
 four most common adverse events in the laquinimod group were ALT (alanine aminotransferase) elevation
 of greater than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range but less than or equal to 5 times the upper limit
 (3.6% for laquinimod vs. 0.4% for placebo), abdominal pain (5.8% vs. 2.9%, respectively), back pain (16,4%
 vs. 9.0%, respectively), and cough (7.5% vs. 4.5%, respectively). SAEs occurred in 11.1% of patients receiving
 laquinimod and in 9.5% of patients receiving placebo,
 The Phase 3 BRAVO trial was again a two-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a
 once-daily oral dose of 0.6 mg laquinimod in RRMS patients (n=1331), however this time an exploratory
  interferon beta-la arm was added. In BRAVO, the primary endpoint of reduction In ARR versus placebo did
  not reach statistical significance (p = 0.075), and only after running a pre-specifled sensitivity analysis to
  correct for baseline characteristics imbalances between the active and the placebo group, statistical
                                                     7

significance was met with a reduced ARR of 21%. In this corrected analysis laquinimod also demonstrated a

34% reduction in the risk of EDSS progression (p=0.0 4) and a 28% reduction in brain volume loss
(p=<0.0001). Safety and tolerability of laquinimod were similar to ALLEGRO with no signal of
immunosuppression. With interferon beta-la ARR was reduced by 29% compared to placebo (p = 0.002)
and disability progression was reduced by 29% (p = 0.089) while no treatment effect was observed on brain
atrophy.
Due to the fact that BRAVO missed its primary endpoint, CONCERTO, a Phase IlI trial of 0.6 mg or 1.2 mg
laquinimod in 1800 RRMS patients was initiated.
Phase It trials had also established clinical efficacy of a lower 0.3 mg dose (Comi G et al, Lancet. 2008 Jun
21;371(9630):2085-92 and Polman C et al., Neurology. 2005 Mar 22;64(6):987-91) however r a 0.1 mg dose
was not able to significantly affect disease activity as measured by the cumulative number of active CNS
lesions (Polman C et at., Neurology. 2005 Mar 22;64(6):987-91).
Regarding mechanism of action, it is thought that laquinimod has immunomodulatory properties within the
central nervous system and may also have direct neuroprotective effects (reviewed in Giacomini PS, Clin
Immunol. 2012 Jan; 142(1):38-43). Laquinimod's molecular target is not well-defined, however some
studies suggest that it can bind S10OA9, a calcium binding protein that influences cell signaling. Pre-clinical
studies were able to show that laquinimod's effects are in part mediated through decreased Th1 and Th17
responses and an increase in regulatory T cells with reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-y and
TNFa while promoting production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-f.          In addition
 laquinimod seems to be able to interfere with lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system
through interaction with specific adhesion molecules. Other data suggests that laquinimod may also
 directly reduce demyelination and induce axonal protection, potentially through upregulation of
 neurotrophic factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Thbne J, Am J Patholt 2012
Jan;180(1):267-74 and Schulze-Topphoff U, PLoS One. 2012; 7(3): e33797. Published online on March 30,

 Formula 4: Laquinimod
  Notwithstanding the above reported works and (partial) progresses, it Is still the case that all available
 agents are only partly effective in halting ongoing inflammatory tissue damage and clinical progression of
  MS. The reason why therapies are only moderately effective may be seen In the complex and
  heterogeneous MS pathogenesis where targeting only one aspect of the disease may not suffice to
                                                       8

completely stop the disease process. One strategy with the potential to increase treatment efficacy is to
combine two or more drugs with distinct modes of action. Such combinations have, for example, been
generally described in WO 2007/006307 (salts of fumaric acid monoalkylesters with a multitude of other
drugs, see pages 20-25) and specifically claimed in WO 2011/100589 (fumaric acid esters such as
dimethylfumarate with either glatiramer acetate or interferon beta). The above described experimental
combination therapies with teriflunomide are further examples, but they have not resulted in
unequivocally positive results.
Thus, while major advances in MS therapy have already been made, there is still a large unmet need for
drugs with improved effectiveness, less side effects, better tolerability and more convenience. The present
invention to treat MS with a fixed combination of teriflunomide and dimethylfumarate or combination of
fingolimod and dimethylfumarate or combination of laquinimode and dimethylfumarate addresses these
needs.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
This invention is in its broadest aspect is directed toward novel combination of oral agents to treat multiple
sclerosis, i.e. a combination of teriflunomide, fingolimod or laquinimod with dimethylfumarate.
Teriflunomide, fingolimod and laquinimod have been selected as powerful partners to be combined with
dimethylfumarate due to the partly non-overlapping mechanism of action with dimethylfumarate as well as
the generally non-overlapping side-effect profile.
The two active ingredients contained in the combination formulation, i.e. dimethylfumarate in combination
with teriflunomide, fingolimod or laquinimod, may be present in any pharmaceutically acceptable
 administration form of either of them. Such pharmaceutically acceptable administration forms, as used
 herein, include any pharmaceutically acceptable and therapeutically effective crystalline and non
 crystalline forms, solvates or hydrates, and in the case of teriflunomide its Z- and E-enolic forms and
 mixtures thereof and also its prodrug leflunomide. A further component of the claimed oral pharmaceutical
 composition according to the present invention is one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The
 term "excipient" as used In this application is to be understood broadly and encompasses any
 pharmaceutically acceptable inactive substance that may be present In an oral pharmaceutical
 administration form, including (but not limited to) fillers, diluents, binders, matrix formers, disintegrants,
 lubricants, sustained release agents, coating agents and the like.
 This invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition containing dimethylfumarate in combination
 with teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod as the sole active ingredients, together with one or several
 pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which is suitable for once daily administration.
 One preferred embodiment of the invention provides for administering a novel fixed-dose combination for
 once daily oral use of a first active component which is dimethylfumarate, at a dose that Is therapeutically
 effective when used alone, and of a second active component which isteriflunomide, at a dose that has not
 shown therapeutic efficacy when used alone, Therefore, according to a preferred aspect of the invention,
                                                      9

this pharmaceutical composition contains dimethylfumarate at a dose range of 500 mg to 750 mg and
teriflunomide at a dose range of 1 mg to 6 mg.
Another preferred embodiment of the invention provides for administering a novel fixed-dose combination
for once daily oral use of a first active component which is dimethylfumarate, at a dose that is
therapeutically effective when used alone, and of a second active component which isfingolimod, at a dose
that has not shown therapeutic efficacy when used alone. Therefore, according to a preferred aspect of the
invention, this pharmaceutical composition contains dimethylfumarate at a dose range of 500 mg to 750
mg and fingolimod at a dose range of 0.05 mg to 0.45 mg.
Also, another preferred embodiment of the invention provides for administering a novel fixed-dose
combination for once daily oral use of a first active component which is dimethylfumarate, at a dose that is
therapeutically effective when used alone, and of a second active component which is laquinimod, at a
dose that has not shown therapeutic efficacy when used alone. Therefore, according to a preferred aspect
of the invention, this pharmaceutical composition contains dimethylfumarate at a dose range of 500 mg to
750 mg and laquinimod at a dose range of 0.05 mg to 0.25 mg.
According to the present invention, the combination products described herein will show better efficacy (as
measured by reduction of annualized relapse rate and/or progression of disability and/or a similarly
accepted endpoint) than dimethylfumarate alone. In addition, the inventive combination products will not
show an Increase in severe adverse events            compared with dimethylfumarate and the individual
combination partners alone.
A further embodiment of the invention provides for administering a novel fixed-dose combination for once
daily oral use of a first component which is dimethylfumarate, in a daily dose below the daily doses shown
to be therapeutically effective for MS in DEFINE and CONFIRM studies, and of a second active component
which Is teriflunomide, fingolimod or laquinimod at a dose that has not shown therapeutic efficacy when
used alone. The combination product according to this preferred aspect of the invention will show a non
inferior efficacy (as measured by reduction of annualized relapse rate and/or progression of disability
and/or a similarly accepted endpoint) compared with each dimethylfumarate and teriflunomide, fingolimod
and laquinimod, respectively, when used at therapeutically effective doses alone but will be associated
with less adverse effects compared to the individual agents when given alone at a respective dose. Thus, in
a preferred aspect of the present invention the composition contains dimethylfumarate at a dose range of
125 mg to 500 mg and teriflunomide at a dose range of I mg to 6 mg. In another preferred aspect of the
present invention the composition contains dimethylfumarate at a dose range of 125 mg to 500 mg and
fingolimod at a dose range of 0.05 mg to 0.45 mg. In yet another preferred aspect of the present invention
the composition contains dimethylfumarate at a dose range of 125 mg to 500 mg and laquinimod at a dose
range of 0.05 mg to 0.25 mg.
A further embodiment of the invention provides for administering a novel fixed-dose combination for twice
daily oral use of a first active component which is dimethylfumarate, at a dose that is therapeutically
effective when used alone, and of a second active component which is teriflunomide, fingolimod or
laquinimod, at an absolute daily dose that has not shown therapeutic efficacy when used alone. According
                                                    10

to the invention, the combination product will show a significantly better efficacy (as measured by
reduction of annualized relapse rate and/or progression of disability and/or a similarly accepted endpoint)
then dimethylfumarate alone. In addition, this combination will not show a statistically significant increase
in severe adverse events compared with dimethylfumarate alone.
A further embodiment of the invention provides for administering a novel fixed-dose combination for twice
daily oral use of a first component which is dimethylfumarate, in a dose below the doses shown to be
therapeutically effective in DEFINE and CONFIRM studies, and of a second active component which is
teriflunomide, fingolimod or laquinimod at an absolute daily dose that has not shown therapeutic efficacy
when used alone. This combination product will show a non-inferior efficacy (as measured by reduction of
annualized relapse rate and/or progression of disability and/or a similarly accepted endpoint compared
with each dimethylfumarate and teriflunomide, fingolimod and laquinimod, respectively when used at
therapeutically effective doses alone but will be associated with less adverse effects compared to the
individual agents when given alone at a respective dose.
 In further embodiments of the invention, teriflunomide is replaced in all of the above combinations by its
prodrug leflunomide at a bloequivalent dose (as measured by teriflunomide pharmacokinetics).
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
This invention is related to a method of treating MS in a human patient in need of such treatment and
comprises administering to said patient a combination therapy in a single oral dosage form (e.g. a tablet or
capsule) of dimethylfumarate in combination with teriflunomide (or its prodrug leflunomide), fingolimod or
laquinimod. The combination formulation Is more effective than the single agents alone and/or has
 reduced side effects and better tolerability than the single agents alone and/or can be given In a reduced
frequency.
Although dimethylfumarate as well as teriflunomide, fingolimod and laquinimod have each been used
 individually for the treatment of MS, the agents have not been used in combination for the treatment of
 MS. The inventors have recognized that anadded or synergistic effect of dimethylfuma rate, on the one
 hand, and terifunomide, fingolimod or laquinimod, on the other hand, will most likely be due to the fact
that dimethylfumarate and the other three agents have different molecular targets and many non
 overlapping modes of action in the pathophysiology of MS. Dimethylfumarate acts through depletion of
 GSH stores and activation of nrf2 which mediates significant neuroprotective properties in addition to Its
 leading Immunomodulatory effects with interference with the Thl/Th2 differentiationwhile no major
 Immunosuppressive effects have been observed. On the other hand Teriflunomide, acting through selective
 inhibition of dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), fingolimod, acting through downregulatlon of S1PR
 on the cell surface, and laquinimod, potentially acting through S10OA9, are assumed to have effects on
 additional aspects of the immune response, such as lymphocyte migration, regulatory T cell responses and
 antibody production, leading to a potentially more               broad inhibitory effect with relevant
 Immunosuppressive activity. According to the present invention, the specific spectrum of activities of these
 respective agents and the selection of optimal doses allows for a particularly advantageous efficacy and
 side effect profile of the combination.

In a preferred combination therapy according to the present invention a drug such as teriflunomide,
fingolimod or laquinimod at a dose that was not shown to have a significant clinical effect when used alone
still has a significant additional effect when used in combination with another drug (dimethylfumarate) at a
dose that is effective alone. In addition, the combination will be associated with a similar or even more
benign side effect profile compared to the single drugs. Finally, combining a drug usually used in a twice
daily regime such as dimethylfumarate with a drug usually used in a once daily regime such as
teriflunomide, fingolimod or laquinimod may allow creating a once daily combination drug with non
inferior efficacy to both drugs when used alone and, depending on specific side effect profile and dose no
increase in side effects.

 According to preferred aspects of the present invention, teriflunomide or fingollmod or laquinimod Is used
 at doses that are below demonstrated therapeutic effectiveness when used alone. Thus, the therapeutic
 benefit of the preferred inventive combinations is caused by unexpected additional effects provided by
 teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod at doses heretofore thought to be probably ineffective.
 Dimethylfumarate has been demonstrated to induce a disease modifying and disease Intervening effect as
 measured on annual relapse rates and progression of disability in patients. Seen in combination with its
                                                   15

different (orthogonal) mechanism of action than teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod and in the
context of the demonstrated safety, with side effects primarily consisting of mild tolerability issues such as
diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, dimethylfumarate is an ideal partner for combination with teriflunomide
or fingolimod or laquinimod. Most pharmaceutical drugs have S-shaped dose-response curves or bell
shaped dose response curves. The addition of another pharmacological agent such as teriflunomide or
fingolimod or laquinimod would thus be expected to shift the aggregated dose-response curve in a
favorable manner and thus be of major clinical and therapeutic utility.
A further aspect of the present invention is a suitable pharmaceutical formulation for once or twice daily
oral administration of the inventive combination of dimethylfumarate and teriflunomide or fingolimod or
laquinimod. The formulation can be any oral formulation, but is preferably a tablet or pelet formulation, or
a capsule formulation, e.g. a gelatin capsule. Tablets, pellets or capsules can be enteric-coated or non
enteric -coated.
According to a particular aspect of this invention, the two active ingredients are present in different
portions of the oral formulation that are designed to release the respective active ingredient with different
speeds.
Thus, according to this aspect, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral use
against MS that contains dimethylfumarate and teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod as the active
 ingredients, wherein the dimethylfumarate is contained in a portion of the composition that provides for
 prolonged release of the active ingredient and the teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod Is contained
 in a portion of the composition that provides for rapid release of the active ingredient,
 in a particular embodiment of the invention the dimethylfumarate is contained in a prolonged release
 matrix portion of a tablet and the teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod is contained in a coating
 surrounding the matrix portion, In a particular embodiment, the teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod
 is contained in an outer enteric coating surrounding the matrix portion of the tablet, which embeds and
 surrounds the dimethylfumarate. In an alternative embodiment teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod
 is contained in a separate water-soluble or readily water-disintegratable layer between the core and the
 outer enteric coating, or as the outermost layer. Suitable tablets according to the invention may contain
 lactose (e.g. tablettose) or microcrystalline cellulose as a filler, hydroxypropylcellulose or
  hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as matrix-forming retarding agent and magnesium stearate as a lubricant,
 and they may be coated, e.g. with a film coat or an enteric coat or a drug-containing layer. Useful coating
  agents include acrylic polymers, eg. from the Eudragit series, such as Eudragit L30D and cellulose esters
 such as hypromellose.
  Prolonged or sustained release matrix formulations that are suitable to serve as prolonged release matrix
  portions of the inventive tablets are disclosed In WO 2010/079222 the disclosure of which is incorporated
  herein in its entirety. Such prolonged release matrix formulations may be provided with an additional fast
  release coating containing teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod. Alternatively, teriflunomide or
  fingolimod or laquinimod may be added to an enteric coating as provided in many of the examples of WO
  2010/079222.
                                                     16

Thus, a coated erosion matrix tablet can be used to formulate the combination of dimethylfumarate and
teriflunomide or fingolimod or laquinimod according to the present invention, Alternatively, the two active
ingredients can also be put into respective controlled release (CR) and immediate release (IR) microtablets
or pellets, which can then be filled Into gelatin capsules or sachets. in such an embodiment
dimethylfumarate will again be in a CR microtablet or pellet, whereas teriflunomide or fingolimod or
laquinimod will be in the IRmicrotablet or pellet.
The DMF core tablets can also consist of 2 layers, one being a controlled release (CR) and a second being an
immediate release (IR); the table gives a typical composition for a selected distribution of DMF to CR and IR
layer; other distributions of DMF are also possible.
The described 2-layer tablet cores can be coated as the DMF tablets described elsewhere in the patent to
yield the combination products.

A clinical trial will include multiple sclerosis patients of Remitting-Relapsing type diagnosed on McDonald
criteria, with a baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDDS) between 0 and 5 and either at least one
relapse within the last 12 months of randomisation and a previous MRI scanning showing lesions consistent
with multiple sclerosis or GdE lesions on MR] scan done within 6 months of randomisation. Excluded will be
patients with a relapse within 50 days of randomisation or no stabilization from a previous relapse. Patients
who within the last year have been treated with T-cell or T-receptor vaccination, total lymphold irradiation
or therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatment, who had been treated with mitoxantron or
cyclophosphamide within the last year of randomisation were also excluded. Also patients who within 6
months of randomisation had been treated with cyclosporin, azathioprin, methotrexate or plasmapheresis

pancreatic disease will be excluded as well. Patients with lymphocytopenia, low white blood cell count or
calculated creatinine clearance of < 60 mL/min at baseline will also be excluded.
The trial will be approved by all relevant Competent Agencies as well as all relevant Ethic Committees.
The trial will be a randomized, double blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled parallel group design
testing 3 active treatment arms and a placebo arm:
Example 1:
          1.I: a combination tablet consisting of 500mg prolonged release DMF and the instant release 6 mg
          teriflunomide in a single formulated enteric coated tablet;
          1.2: a teriflunomide 6 mg plus placebo DMF enteric coated tablet;
          1.3: a 500mg DMF dose with a teriflunomide placebo enteric coated tablet;
          1.4: a placebo DMF and placebo teriflunomide enteric coated tablet.

Primary endpoints will be based on MRI scans using the number and volume of new GdE lesions on post
contrast Ti-weighed sequences as well as the number of T2-weighed enlarged lesions. Secondary
endpoints will be the number of relapses monitored monthly and the EDDS that will be assessed at 12
weeks interval from baseline as well as brain atrophy. Safety will be followed closely in particular on
differential count of white blood cells, liver enzyme values, gastrointestinal side effects and infections,
Laboratory examination will be performed every 4 weeks and general safety as assessed by the reporting of
SAE's and AE's and neurological and physical examination. Treatment time will be 24 weeks initially for the
evaluation of the primary endpoint followed by a blinded 24 week follow up where the active treatment
groups will continue their randomized treatment and the patients on placebo will transferred to active
treatment with a continued blinded dosing where they will receive an active combination tablet consisting
of 500mg DMF in the prolonged release formulation and the instant release of either teriflunomide,
fingolimod or laquinimod in an enteric coated tablet. The number of patients will e 400 with a 1:1:1:1
randomisation between the groups based on previously reported mean MRI lesions reduction data with
DMF treatment and       treatment with either teriflunomide, fingolimod or laquinimod, assuring a 20%
reduction in the number of new GdE lesions, a power of 80% to detect a treatment effect based on a two
sided 5%significance level.
All MRI evaluations will be performed centrally by an experienced neuro-radiologist. An interim analysis is
planned after all patients have completed the first 24 weeks comparing each active arm against placebo
and furthermore the combination tablet treatment arm compared to each of the single treatment arms.
Analysis will be performed using adaptive design and closed analysis with no adjustment of the significance
level.
Patients who enter the trial after screening and randomisation will follow a schedule of investigations
running at week 2 from randomisation/baseline, at week 4 and then every 4 weeks for the entire trial
period with an 8 week follow up for each patient at the end of treatment, Plasma samples for population
kinetics will be sampled at baseline, week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 of the trial schedule.
Patients who discontinue prematurely will be offered alternative treatment at the discretion of the
 Investigators. An independent Safety Data Monitoring Committee will monitor safety data on a monthly
basis, review all SAE's and possible Infections and decide on out of schedule laboratory or other safety
measures including a for safety reasons premature discontinuation of patients. The trial will be carried out
in approximately 50-60 centers in 6-8 countries.
 Examples 4-6. Formulation Examples
An enteric coated tablet containing an erosion matrix core with a film coat is used to formulate the
 combination of dimethylfumarate and teriflunomide (Example 4), dimethylfumarate and fingollmod
 (Example 5) and dimethylfumarate and laquinimod (Example 6), respectively, according to the present
 invention.
The enteric coated tablet consists of an erosion matrix core hosting the dimethylfumarate covered by afilm
 coating hosting teriflunomide (Example 4), fingolimod (Example 5) and laquinimod (Example 6),
                                                    19

respectively, and an outer thin enteric coating. The enteric coating rapidly dissolves when reaching the
small intestine and releases teriflunomide, fingolimod and laquinimod, respectively, in the duodenum at
weakly alkaline pH values. In contrast, due to the erosion matrix the dimethylfumarate is released in a
prolonged manner (controlled release) over several hours.
The composition of the tablet core for a 125 mg DMF strength is shown in the following table (same for all
Example 4, Example 5, and Example 6).
Ingredient                           Amount of ingredient/275         Amount of ingredient/core

Magnesium stearate                    2                               0.73
These 275 mg cores are then coated with 5 wt-% of an aqueous PVA-solution containing e.g. 5 mg
teriflunomide or e.g. 0.3 mg fingolimod or e.g. 0.25 mg laquinimod so as to obtain a teriflunomide-or
fingolimod- or laquinimod-containing layer that rapidly dissolves when being contacted with water.
A thin enteric coating is then applied to these coated cores. The coating has the following composition:
 Eudragit L30D55*                 7.56 mg (2.75%**)
Triethylcitrate                   0.76 mg

         solid    contents     are     listed   (Eudragit    is a suspension           with    30%     solids),
 **      theoretically applied coating composition, the actually applied coat is approximately 2 wt.-%.
 Further tablet strengths with varying combinations of a tablet core with prolonged release formulation of
 DMF containing 60 mg, 125mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, 375 mg and 500 mg combined with 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg,
 2.5 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg and 6 mg of teriflunomide embedded in the film coating will apply. Regarding
fingolimod, the following combinations are envisaged: varying combinations of a tablet core with
 prolonged release formulation of DMF containing 60 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, 375 mg and 500 mg
 combined with 0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, 0.4 mg, 0.45 mg of fingolimod embedded in the film
 coating. Regarding laquinimod, the following combinations are envisaged: varying combinations of a tablet
 core with prolonged release formulation of DMF containing 60 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, 375 mg and
 500 mg combined with 0.025 mg, 0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.25 mg of laquinimod embedded in the film
 coating will apply.
 The manufacture and coating steps are carried out by known methods such as, e.g., described in
 WO 2010/079222, examples 21 and 22.
