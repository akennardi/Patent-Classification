Equine Nasal Spray & Douche
ABSTRACT
Equine Nasal Spray & Douche consists of a new combination of ingredients in a nasal
spray and lavage, that provides mechanical removal of nasal irritants and pollution
debris. It is a large polyethylene squeezable bottle with a novel delivery system with 3
channels specifically designed for wide angle/broad space delivery into the large
equine multi-meatal nasal cavity. An oval shaped soft wide bore minimises nasal
entry irritation. The nozzle has an insufflatable balloon to conform to the equine nasal
cavity and prevent dislodgement , furthermore the stem is corrugated to allow
different angles. It also contains anti-oxidant and other ingredients to counteract the
effects of pollution on the nasal and sinus mucosa. These may aid in repair of the
membranes and ciliary flow. These may also improve nasal function, help removal of
pollution and other debris which in turn may improve lung mucosal function. It
contains saline, antioxidants and others ingredients. It also contains ingredients that
may help combat infection.

Equine Nasal Spray & Douche
BACKGROUD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The present invention Equine Nasal Spray & Douche consists of a new
combination of ingredients in a nasal spray and lavage, that provides mechanical
removal of nasal irritants and pollution debris. It also contains anti-oxidant and other
ingredients to counteract the effects of pollution on the nasal and sinus mucosa. These
may aid in repair of the membranes and improve ciliary flow. These may also
improve nasal function, help removal of pollution and other debris which in turn may
improve lung mucosal function. It contains saline, antioxidants and others ingredients.
It also contains ingredients that may help combat infection. The delivery system is
novel as it consists of a silicone triple-lumen oval shaped balloon/insufflatable nozzle.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
Technical Problem
[0002] Horses are obligate nasal breathers. They are exposed to various nasal irritants
both in stables and on the track. There are many nasal problems that result from these
irritants. The small particles irritate the nasal mucosa and may damage ciliary flow,
mucosal membranes, infection and may even cause mitosis.
[0003] The equine nasal opening is three-fold and there are three large meati/cavities,
thus a broad spray/ rinse is needed.
[0004] Horses will be innately resistant to a foreign body in their nasal cavity.

                                             2
Solution to problem
[0005] The present invention Equine Nasal Spray & Douche provides mechanical
removal of nasal irritants and pollution debris. It also contains anti-oxidant and other
ingredients to counteract the effects of pollution on the nasal and sinus mucosa. This
may aid in repair of the membranes and ciliary flow. This may also result in improved
nasal function, removal of pollution and other debris and minimise or protect from the
mitotic pollution effect which in turn may improve lung mucosal function. It contains
saline, antioxidants and others ingredients (may also be in a powdered form for
dissolution).
[0006] It also contains ingredients that may help combat nasal and sinus infection.
[0007] Equine Nasal Spray & Douche consists of a large polyethylene squeezable
bottle with a novel delivery system that has 1-3 channels/ports that deliver the
solution into the broad/wide equine nasal cavity. The delivery system is novel as it
contains a triple-lumen oval shaped balloon silicone nozzle for wide angle/broad
space delivery in to the large equine multi-meatal nasal cavity. (see fig 1)
Advantageous Effects of Invention
[0008] Equine Nasal Spray & Douche provides mechanical removal of nasal irritants
and pollution debris.
[0009] Equine Nasal Spray & Douche may aid in repair of the membranes and ciliary
flow.
[0010] Equine Nasal Spray & Douche has anti-oxidant and other ingredients to
counteract the effects of pollution on the nasal and sinus mucosa.

                                            3
[0011] Equine Nasal Spray & Douche may minimise or protect from the mitotic
pollution effect.
[0012] Equine Nasal Spray & Douche may secondarily improve lung ciliary and
mucosa function by improving nasal function.
[0013] Equine Nasal Spray & Douche has a soft wide bore insufflatable triple-lumen
nozzle to conform to the nasal cavity, help keep it in place and provide wide delivery
fluid stream. (see fig 1).
Description of Embodiments
[0014] The present invention Equine Nasal Spray & Douche is a combination of anti
oxidant and other ingredients that may counteract the effects of pollution on the nasal
and sinus by providing mechanical removal of nasal irritants and pollution debris.
[0015] It also contains ingredients that may help combat nasal and sinus infection.
[0016] Equine Nasal Spray & Douche consists of a large polyethylene (650ml)
squeezable bottle with a novel delivery system that has 1-3 channels/ports that deliver
the solution into the broad/wide equine nasal cavity. (see fig 1)
[0017] It has a new curved stem comprised of corrugated tubing that is malleable
to an adjustable angle. (see fig 1)
[0018] Equine Nasal Spray & Douche has a soft wide bore insufflatable nozzle to
conform to the nasal cavity and help keep it in place. The soft nozzle minimises nasal
entry irritation. (see fig 1)
[0019] Maximal flow is in middle and most inferior lumens and is novel. (see fig 1)
