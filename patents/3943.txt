                                           ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
                Fluoride varnish compositions for temporary application and adhesion to a
   person's teeth include a carrier that remains stable and translucent during storage.                The
   compositions include a carrier comprising a stable and translucent resin and a fluoride ion
 5 source (e.g., a fluoride salt such as sodium fluoride) dispersed within the carrier so as to
   provide biologically available fluoride ions to teeth being treated.                The carrier resists
   formation of solids that can plug a 25 gauge or smaller syringe brush applicator tip. The
   compositions may also include an adhesion promoting agent comprising an alkyl
   phosphoric acid.                   The composition adheres only temporarily to tooth tissue (e.g., for a
10 period of at least about 4 minutes, but not more than about 1 year), after which the
   composition spontaneously wears away as a natural result of the action of the tongue,
   saliva and/or other factors.

                                    AND METHODS OF MANUFACTURE AND USE
                The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent
 5 Application No. 2014235110, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated into the
   present specification by this cross-reference.
                                         BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
10 1.           The Field of the Invention
                The present invention generally relates to dental treatment compositions, including
   fluoride treatment compositions.
   2.           The Relevant Technology
                In the field of dentistry, fluoride compositions are applied to a patient's teeth as
15 part of a routine dental cleaning. Application of fluoride has been widely recognized as a
   method for preventing tooth decay. According to one method, a fluoride gel composition
   is dispensed within a dental tray, after which the tray is placed over the patient's teeth.
   The tray holds the fluoride gel composition adjacent to the patient's teeth, and after a
   desired amount of time (e.g., a minute or less), the tray is removed and the remaining gel
20 composition is rinsed off the patient's teeth.
                Alternatively, fluoride varnish compositions can be applied to a person's teeth and
   left in place for days or weeks. In many cases fluoride varnish compositions are yellow or
   opaque white and therefore are not aesthetically pleasing. In addition, fluoride varnish are
   typically dispensed from a container using a brush. The practitioner typically dips the
25 brush into the container and then paints the fluoride varnish onto the patient's teeth like
   fingernail polish. This dipping and painting procedure is repeated several times, perhaps
   once for each tooth, which made the procedure cumbersome and potentially messy.
                And while it may be desirable to dispense a fluoride varnish composition from a
   syringe and onto a patient's teeth using a brush tip, existing fluoride compositions have
30 lacked sufficient stability and shelf life to remain as a stable gel over time during storage
   and prior to use. As a result, they can become gritty over time, which causes plugging of
   the brush tip, especially narrow gauge tips that are suitable for dispensing relatively low
   viscosity fluids such as fluoride varnish compositions. Formation of solids also reduces
   10088956_1 (GHMatter) P1011 14.AU.1

                                                         2
   initial translucency and causes fluoride varnish compositions to become hazy or white
   over time, reducing their aesthetic appeal.
   SUMMARY OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 5              Disclosed herein are stable dental varnish compositions for application to a
   person's teeth, which comprise a stable liquid or gel carrier and an active agent dispersed
   within the carrier. The carrier includes a solvent, a resin component and an acidifying
   component. The resin component comprises an acidic hydrogenated wood rosin that has
   been at least partially neutralized to raise its pH to above 5. The acidifying component
10 comprises at least organic or inorganic acid that lowers the pH of the liquid or gel carrier
   to below 5.
                The dental varnish compositions can be formulated to be stable for at least about 3
   months so as to remain translucent and not form solids that plug a 25 gauge or smaller
   syringe brush applicator tip.                According to one embodiment, the dental varnish
15 composition can be stable for at least about 6 months so as to remain translucent and not
   form solids that plug a 30 gauge or smaller syringe brush applicator tip.
                According to one embodiment, the dental varnish composition may further
   comprise an organo phosphoric acid having at least one alkyl group.                 The organo
   phosphoric acid can be useful to increase adhesion of the varnish composition to a tooth
20 surface.
                According to one embodiment, the active agent comprises a fluoride ion source so
   that the dental varnish composition is a fluoride varnish. Alternatively or in addition to
   fluoride ions, the active agent may include at least one of a calcium ion source or a
   phosphate ion source.               If the fluoride varnish composition is anhydrous, premature
25 reaction and precipitation of fluoride and calcium ions is minimized or prevented.
                A method of manufacturing a stable dental varnish composition for application to a
   person's teeth comprises: (1) preparing a stable liquid or gel carrier by mixing together an
   acidic hydrogenated wood rosin that has been at least partially neutralized to raise its pH
   to above 5, a solvent, and an acidifying agent to lower the pH of the carrier to below 5;
30 and (2) adding an active agent before, during or after formation of the stable liquid or gel
   carrier.

20              DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
   I.           INTRODUCTION
                Disclosed herein are stable dental varnish compositions for use in providing a
   desired treatment to a person's teeth. The stable dental varnish compositions include a
   liquid or gel carrier that is formulated so that the dental varnish composition remains
25 stable and translucent over time (e.g., for at least about 3 months) and does not form solids
   that plug a 25 gauge or smaller syringe brush applicator tip.            Surprisingly, increased
   stability is provided by formulating the liquid or gel carrier to include an acidic
   hydrogenated wood rosin that has been at least partially neutralized with a base to raise its
   pH to above 5 (e.g., to about 6-7) and then acidifying the carrier to below 5 (e.g., to about
30 4 or less). Dental varnish compositions prepared in this manner have substantially greater
   stability over time compared to varnish compositions made using an acidic hydrogenated
   wood rosin that has not been neutralized. Such increased stability is achieved even when
   acidification of the neutralized hydrogenated wood rosin causes the composition to have
   10088956_1 (GHMatter) P1011 14.AU.1

                                                          4
   the same pH as a composition made using acidic hydrogenated wood rosin that is not
   neutralized with a base.
   II.         EXEMPLARY DENTAL VARNISH COMPOSITIONS
 5             Exemplary dental varnish compositions as disclosed herein include a stable liquid
   or gel carrier and an active agent dispersed within the carrier. a stable liquid or gel carrier
   and an active agent dispersed within the carrier. The carrier typically comprises a solvent,
   a resin component and an acidifying component.                The resin component advantageously
   includes an acidic hydrogenated wood rosin that has been at least partially neutralized to
10 raise its pH to above 5.                The acidifying component may include at least organic or
   inorganic acid included in an amount in order to lower the pH of the liquid or gel carrier to
   below 5.
               An example of a suitable resin component is Foral@ NC synthetic resin, which is
   manufactured by Pinova, Inc., Bruswick, Georgia, USA, and is the partial sodium resinate
15 of the highly hydrogenated wood rosin, Foral@ AX resin, also manufactured by Pinova,
   Inc. Foral@ AX is a thermoplastic, acidic resin produced by hydrogenating wood rosin to
   a high degree. According to Product Data Sheet, Foral@ AX Synthetic Resin, provided by
   Pinova, Inc., http://www.pinovasolutions.com/docs/Foral%20AX.pdf               Foral@ AX is the
   "most highly stabilized rosin commercially available". Compared to a competitor's resin,
20 Foral® AX "has better initial color and color retention, and even greater resistance to
   oxidation". Id.               Foral Foral® AX acidic hydrogenated wood rosin has a softening point
   (Ring & Ball, minimum) of 66 0 C, a color (USRG rosin scale, maximum) of XB, an acid
   number (minimum) of 158 mg KOH/g, an abietic acid (UV, maximum) value of 0.2%, and
   refractive index at 100 0 C (maximum) of 1.4970. Id.
25             By way of comparison, Foral® NC is similar to Foral® AX except that an "added
   benefit of the partial sodium neutralization is an increase in softening point and glass
   transition temperatures, which allows Foral NC to be packaged as free-flowing pastilles in
   easily handled bags."                Product Data Sheet, Foral® NC Synthetic Resin, provided by
   Pinova, Inc., http://www.pinovasolutions.com/docs/Foral%20NC.pdf.               Foral Foral® NC
30 sodium resinate of the highly hydrogenated wood rosin Foral AX has a softening point
   (Ring & Ball) of 78-920 C (typically 83 0 C), a color (USRG, maximum) of X (typically
   XB), an acid number of 120-138 mg KOH/g (typically 126 mg KOH/g), and a typical
   abietic acid value of <2%. Id.

                                                    5
                When formulating dental varnish compositions using Foral® AX as the sole
   hydrogenated rosin, the resulting varnish has a pH of about 3. Such varnish compositions
   are initially highly translucent and have good flow properties, which permits them to be
   dispensed through a narrow gauge syringe brush tip onto a person's tooth surfaces.
 5 However, after a few months (e.g., 3 months), such dental varnish compositions can form
   precipitates, which can cause them to become gritty and less translucent, causing loss of
   aesthetic appeal and, worse, plugging of the syringe brush applicator tip.     By comparison.
   substituting at least a portion of the Foral@ AX with Foral® NC, which is less acidic and
   has a higher pH, and then adding an acid to lower the pH so that the varnish composition
10 has the same or similar pH as varnishes made using Foral® AX as the sole hydrogenated
   rosin results in a varnish composition that is substantially more stable over time.
   Substituting at least a portion of Foral@ AX with Foral® NC and then acidifying the
   composition to have same low pH unexpectedly reduces or eliminates formation of
   precipitates that reduce translucency and cause syringe tip plugging.            This result is
15 surprising and unexpected and would not be predicted based on a comparison of the
   Product Data Sheets of these products provided by Pinova, Inc.
                Example acids that can be used to lower the pH of the liquid or gel carrier
   containing a base neutralized acidic hydrogenated wood rosin include organic acids and
   inorganic acids, such as citric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, malic acid, and the like.
20 The acid can be added in order to adjust the pH of the liquid or gel carrier containing a
   base neutralized acidic hydrogenated wood rosin to less than 5, preferably less than about
   4.5, more preferably less than about 4, and most preferably to less than about 3.5.
   According to one embodiment, the pH can be lowered to about 3 or below.
                The dental varnish compositions can be formulated to be stable for at least about 3
25 months so as to remain translucent and not form solids that plug a 25 gauge or smaller
   syringe brush applicator tip.          According to one embodiment, the dental varnish
   composition can be stable for at least about 6 months so as to remain translucent and not
   form solids that plug a 30 gauge or smaller syringe brush applicator tip.
                In addition to the main resin component, which is the aforementioned acidic
30 hydrogenated wood rosin that has been at least partially neutralized to raise its pH to
   above 5, the dental varnish composition may optionally include one or more auxiliary
   resins.        Examples of auxiliary resins include natural resins, non-hydrogenated wood
   rosins, acidic hydrogenated wood rosins, synthetic resins, colophonium, shellac, and
   10088956_1 (GHMatter) P1011 14.AU.1

                                                         6
   combinations thereof                The auxiliary resins are typically hydrophobic, substantially
   insoluble in water, and freely soluble in alcohol, benzene, ether, glacial acetic acid, oils,
   and carbon disulfide. Various materials that are individually referred to as "colophonium"
   include Canadian balsam, Olibanum balsam, Elemi resin, Opopanax resin, Tolu balsam,
 5 Peruvian balsam, and Poly-Pale'M resin, which is a partially dimerized rosin available
   from Eastman Chemical, located in Kingsport, Tennessee.                Examples of hydrogenated
   wood rosins include the aforementioned Foral@ AX. a fully hydrogenated tree rosin,
   Staybelite@ resin, a partially hydrogenated wood rosin, and Endere@ S, a highly
   hydrogenated allergen tested resin from wood rosin feedstock.               Other rosins or rosin
10 derivatives include Pexite@ FF, an acidic resin extracted from pine tree stumps, Pexalyn@
   295, a synthetic, acid functionalized resin from wood rosin feedstock, Pentalyn® FC, a
   pentaerythritol ester of maleic anhydride-modified wood rosin, Staybelite® Ester 10-A, an
   ester of hydrogenated rosin, Hercolyn® D, a methyl ester of hydrogenated wood rosin,
   Pentalyn® H-A, a pentaerythritol ester of hydrogenated rosin.
15              The one or more resin components may be included in the dental varnish
   compositions in various amounts, such as in an amount in a range of about 20% to about
   90% by weight, preferably in a range of about 25% to about 80% by weight, more
   preferably in a range of about 35% to about 75% by weight, and most preferably in a
   range of about 40% to about 70% by weight.
20              Dental varnish compositions as disclosed herein may include any desired active
   agent. For example, the active agent can be a fluoride ion source that provides fluoride
   treatment to a person's tooth. Instead of or in addition to the fluoride ion source, the
   active agent may comprise a calcium ion source and/or a phosphate ion source.               Even
   though calcium ions and fluoride ions can react in water to form an insoluble calcium
25 fluoride precipitate, providing a dental varnish composition that is anhydrous (e.g., so as to
   have a water content of less than 2%, preferably less than about 1.5%, more preferably
   less than about 1%, and most preferably less than about 0.5%) prevents premature reaction
   and precipitation. Once applied to a person's teeth, such reaction can beneficially occur
   on or in the teeth in the presence of saliva.
30              Examples of fluoride ion sources include sodium fluoride, BiF 3, SnF2, ZnF2, KF,
   CaF2, ZrF 4, sodium mono-fluorophosphate (Na2FPO 3), hexafluorosilicic acid, sodium
   hexafluorosilicate, or combinations thereof. When included, the fluoride ion source (e.g.,
   sodium fluoride) may be included in an amount in a range of about 0.1% to about 10% by
   10088956_1 (GHMatter) P1011 14.AU.1

                                                        7
   weight, preferably in a range of about 1% to about 8% by weight, and more preferably in a
   range of about 2.5% to about 7% by weight.
               Examples of calcium and phosphate ion sources include calcium phosphate,
   calcium nitrate, calcium glycerophosphate, calcium gluconate, calcium chloride, sodium
 5 phosphates, sodium polyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphates, and potassium phosphates.
   Calcium and phosphate ion sources, when included, can be in a range of about 0.1 - 5%
   by weight of the varnish composition.
               According to one embodiment, the dental varnish composition may further include
   an organo phosphoric acid (or phosphoric acid ester) that can enhance adhesion of the
10 dental varnish composition to tooth surfaces. The organo phosphoric acid can comprise an
   alkyl phosphoric acid (also referred to as an alkyl phosphoric acid ester) having from 3 to
   about 30 carbon atoms in the alkyl group.                 Mono-alkyl phosphoric acid esters are
   particularly useful, although di-alkyl phosphoric acid components may alternatively and/or
   additionally be used. The generic chemical structure of an exemplary organo phosphoric
15 acid is as follows:
                                                        OH
                                                   R-O-P-OH

               "R" represents an alkyl group, which may have from 3 to about 30 carbon atoms.
20 More preferably the alkyl group may include from about 5 to about 30 carbon atoms, more
   preferably from about 10 to about 25 carbon atoms, and most preferably from about 15 to
   about 22 carbon atoms.               Hexadecyl phosphoric acid (also referred to as hexadecane
   phosphate) (having 16 carbon atoms) and docosyl phosphoric acid (having 22 carbon
   atoms) have been found to provide excellent adhesion properties to the carrier. Docosyl
25 phosphoric            acid is also believed to exhibit anti-microbial (specifically   anti-viral)
   properties.           Structures for both hexadecyl phosphoric acid and docosyl phosphoric acid,
   respectively, are shown below:

               According to one embodiment, the alkyl groups can be fully saturated so that they
 5 contain no polymerizable groups as the compositions are intended to adhere relatively
   weakly to the tissue, not form a permanent bond with underlying tooth tissue.               It is
   believed that the hydrophilic phosphoric acid groups have an affinity (e.g., through
   hydrogen bonding and/or ionic forces) to hydrophilic tooth surfaces, which contain high
   quantities of minerals (e.g., calcium-based minerals).
10             Although adhesion promoting agents having alkyl groups with from 3 to about 30
   carbon atoms have been found to be useful, it may be possible to employ an adhesion
   promoting agent having at least one alkyl group that includes significantly more carbon
   atoms. For example, it may be possible to use alkyl groups up to one thousand, ten
   thousand, or even 100,000 or more by diluting the adhesion promoting agent with
15 appropriate solvents.
               When included, the organo phosphoric acid component may be included in any
   desired amount, for example in a range of about 0.5% to about 40% by weight, preferably
   in a range of about 1% to about 30% by weight, more preferably in a range of about 3% to
   about 20% by weight, and most preferably in a range of about 5% to about 15% by weight.
20 The use of higher molecular weight, longer alkyl chain adhesion promoting agents may
   require relatively lower concentrations, which may even be less than 0.5% depending on
   the degree of dilution (e.g., with a solvent) required to form a composition having the
   desired consistency.
               The liquid or gel carrier will typically include one or more solvents into which the
25 resin materials are dissolved to provide a varnish composition having a desired
   consistency and flow properties.           Ethanol is a useful solvent as it is non-toxic and
   generally safe for use in the oral cavity, although other solvents (e.g., acetone or isopropyl
   alcohol) could alternatively be used. If included, the solvent is typically selected so that it
   evaporates relatively quickly after the composition is applied to the teeth in order for the
30 dental varnish composition to form a film of solid varnish material on the tooth surface.
   The one or more solvents are typically included in an amount in a range of 5% to about

   75% by weight, preferably in a range of about 10% to about 60% by weight of the
   composition, more preferably in a range of about 15% to about 50% by weight, and most
   preferably in a range of about 20% to about 45% by weight.
                One or more solubilizing agents, such as one or more polyoxyethylene emulsifiers
 5 (e.g., polysorbates), may advantageously be included to help prevent phase separation of
   the various carrier components.                    Exemplary  solubilizing  agents  include various
   polysorbates (e.g., polysorbate 20, polysorbate 40, polysorbate 60, polysorbate 80),
   although other emulsifiers may also be used. Polysorbate 80 (e.g., Tween@ 80), which
   includes a monooleate type fatty acid associated with the polyoxyethylene sorbitan part of
10 the molecule, is a particularly useful solubilizing agent.             The one or more solubilizing
   agents may be included in an amount in a range of about 0.001% to about 3% by weight,
   preferably in a range of about 0.01% to about 1% by weight, and more preferably in a
   range of about 0.1% to about 0.5% by weight.
                Examples of flavorants that may be included are bubble gum, peach, tropical
15 punch, grape, watermelon, lemon-lime, cinnamon, methyl salicylate, natural wintergreen,
   natural cool mint, natural wintermint, peppermint ocean, and/or creme de menthe.
   Examples of sweeteners include sucralose, xylitol, sodium saccharine, aspartame, and
   stevia. Furthermore, xylitol has been found to exhibit antimicrobial effects. Flavorant(s),
   sweetener(s), and colorant(s) may each be included in an amount in a range of about 0.1%
20 to about 10% by weight, preferably from about 0.5% to about 8% by weight, and more
   preferably from about 1% to about 5% by weight.
                A rheology modifying agent may also be included if desired.           Fumed silica is a
   useful rheology modifying agent and has been found to thicken the composition for
   improved handling, as well as reducing the tendency of insoluble fluoride salts to settle
25 during storage.                 Rheology modifying component(s) may be included in an amount in a
   range of about 0.1% to about 10% by weight, preferably in a range of about 0.5% to about
   8% by weight, and more preferably in a range of about 1% to about 5% by weight.
                Advantageously, the dental varnish compositions are sufficiently adhesive so as to
   allow the practitioner to brush, paint, or otherwise apply the composition onto a patient's
30 teeth without having to worry about the composition running or dripping off. Exemplary
   adhesive compositions may have a relatively low viscosity (e.g., less than about 1000
   centipoise). For example, the dental varnish compositions may have a viscosity of about
   10088956_1 (GHMatter) P1011 14.AU.1

                                                             10
   200 centipoise to about 800 centipoise, preferably about 300 centipoise to about 600
   centipoise.
                The dental varnish compositions can be formulated to temporarily adhere to tooth
   tissue (e.g., for a period of at least about 4 minutes, but not more than about 1 year, more
 5 typically about 5 minutes to about 90 days, more typically about 30 minutes to about 5
   days).        Over time, the varnish composition can spontaneously wear away as a natural
   result of the action of the tongue, saliva and/or other factors. The varnish composition
   may also be removed by applying mechanical action, for example, by brushing.
   III.         EXEMPLARY MIXING SYSTEMS AND METHODS
10              Figure 1 illustrates a syringe-to-syringe mixing system 100 for mixing a dental
   varnish composition preparatory to applying it to a person's teeth. Mixing system 100
   includes a first syringe 102a coupleable to a second syringe 102b.              First syringe 102a
   includes a first barrel 104a and a first plunger 106a slidably disposed within first barrel
   104a. First plunger 106a forms a seal against the inner wall of first barrel 104a, allowing
15 plunger 106a to push the contents of barrel 104a out of the barrel. Second syringe 102b
   includes a second barrel 104b and a second plunger 106b disposed within second barrel
    104b. First syringe 102a and second syringe 102b are illustrated as being coupled together
   so as to allow the dental varnish composition 108 to be cycled back and forth between the
   syringes so as to substantially suspend any solid particles (e.g., insoluble fluoride salts,
20 calcium ion salts, and/or phosphate ions salts) phase within a generally hydrophobic liquid
   carrier phase of the composition.
                As illustrated in Figures 2A and 2B, a dental practitioner is able to apply
   turbulence to the multi-phase dental varnish composition 108 within first and second
   syringes of system 100 by manipulating plungers 106a and 106b so as to cycle the varnish
25 composition 108 back and forth. In such a mixing system the dental varnish composition
   may be cycled back and forth as many times as desired so as to substantially suspend the
   solid particle phase within the liquid phase of the composition.
                System 100 may advantageously be configured so as to contain a single use
   quantity          of the            multi-phase dental varnish composition 108.   Such   a system
30 advantageously provides a single use system that can be provided to the dental practitioner
   as a uni-dose system which can be mixed and applied to the teeth of a single patient, after
   which the empty syringe-to-syringe mixing apparatus can be discarded.
   10088956_1 (GHMatter) P1011 14.AU.1

                                                           11
                Such a syringe-to-syringe           configuration is effective in suspending insoluble
   particulate components of the composition within the carrier as particles (e.g., fluoride
   salts) may tend to settle out during storage.                The inclusion of fumed silica within the
   composition may reduce or eliminate settling.                     In addition, the syringe-to-syringe
 5 configuration is effective in mixing together any other components of the varnish
   composition that may tend to form separate phases during prolonged storage.                       For
   example, compositions not including a solubilizing agent (e.g., polysorbate 80) to help
   prevent the resin from separating from other components of the carrier may tend to form
   separate phases during storage. If such is the case with any given varnish composition, the
10 syringe-to-syringe configuration allows for quick and easy remixing of the composition
   prior to application to a patient's teeth.
                Once the solid particles (e.g., fluoride salt) has been suspended, the dental varnish
   composition may be applied to a person's teeth. According to one method, as seen in
   Figures 3A-3B, an applicator tip 150 may be coupled to syringe 102a containing the
15 varnish composition 108 after the syringe has been separated from the remainder of the
   mixing system.                   Tip 150 may be coupled to first syringe 102a so as to allow a dental
   practitioner to dispense dental varnish composition 108 onto a person's teeth.                     As
   illustrated, applicator tip 150 may include a flocked tip 152 so as to allow the user to paint
   the composition 108 onto the teeth. Use of an applicator tip 150 including a flocked tip
20  152 are particularly useful, although other types of tips (e.g., a tip including a foam pad, a
   cotton swab, or other absorbent material) can be used.
                Figure 4 illustrates a dental practitioner using applicator tip 150 to apply varnish
   composition 108 to a person's tooth 160.                    Dental varnish composition 108 may be
   substantially colorless or, alternatively, it may provide a visual contrast against the surface
25 of a person's teeth to allow a dental practitioner to easily determine where the composition
   has been applied.                    Suspension of the particulate phase (and/or remixing of other
   components) advantageously provides an even distribution of the active agent (e.g.,
   fluoride salt), carrier, and other components to the teeth, providing a more consistent
   concentration of active agent and more consistent adhesion characteristics, resulting in
30 overall better treatment across the full surface area of the tooth being treated. Although
   dispensing and application of the varnish composition is described using syringe-to
   syringe mixing device 100, it is understood that any apparatus or method of application
   may be used. Alternative devices that can be used to suspend and dispense the fluoride

   varnish composition are disclosed in United States Patent Application 11/348,055 filed
   February 6, 2006 and entitled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR MIXING A MULTI
   PART FLUORIDE VARNISH COMPOSITION, and United States Patent Application
    12/258,746             filed October 27, 2008 entitled MIXING DEVICE INCLUDING A
 5 PLUNGING MIXING MEMBER FOR USE WITH A SYRINGE, each of which is
   incorporated herein by reference.
                The dental varnish composition can be formulated to remain adhered to a person's
   teeth for an extended period of time relative to typical in-office fluoride treatments, yet
   still be temporary.                 For example, the varnish may remain adhered for at least about 4
10 minutes, but no more than about 1 year, more preferably at least about 5 minutes but not
   more than about 90 days.                    In one embodiment, the varnish composition may remain
   adhered to a person's teeth for at least about 30 minutes, preferably at least about 2 hours,
   more preferably at least about one day, and most preferably at least about two days.
   Nevertheless, such compositions may wear away in about 5 days or less. Advantageously,
15 the varnish composition can spontaneously wear away as a natural result of the action of
   the tongue, saliva and/or other factors within a temporary period, typically no more than
   about 5 days. Of course, the composition may be removed earlier than it would wear
   away naturally, for example, by aggressive brushing. A small fraction of the varnish
   composition may remain adhered to interproximal spaces between teeth (e.g., as long as 7
20  10 days) absent removal by aggressive brushing and/or flossing.
                Extended adherence by the varnish composition to tooth tissue is advantageous as
   the tooth tissues can be exposed to the active agent (e.g., fluoride ions) for significantly
   longer times than is possible with in-office treatments or other treatments in which
   exposure to teeth is significantly less than what is provided by the disclosed varnish
25 compositions.                 In particular, extended adherence to interproximal spaces between teeth
   may be particularly advantageous as these locations often harbor tooth decay.
   IV.          EXAMPLES
                Following are examples of dental varnish compositions within the scope of the
   disclosure, most of which have been found to be stable over time so as resist formation of
30 precipitates or other solids that can plug a syringe brush applicator tip, as well as a
   comparative example of a composition that is not stable over time but can result in
   plugging of a syringe brush applicator tip after storage for several months.

               Examples 1-7 illustrate the beneficial effect of substituting at least a portion of
  Foral@ AX acidic hydrogenated wood rosin with Foral@ NC, the sodium neutralized form
  of acidic hydrogenated wood rosin, and then adding an acid to lower the pH.                 The
5 composition of Example 1 includes Foral® AX acidic hydrogenated wood rosin as the
  sole resin component. This composition is very translucent and flowable when initially
  manufacture but over time (e.g., 3 months or more) can become less translucent (e.g..
  white) and gritty. In some cases, depending on the size or gauge of the syringe brush
  applicator tip, the composition of Example 1 can plug the applicator tip.

               The varnish compositions of Examples 22-28 remained more translucent and
  resisted fonnation of grittiness over time as compared to Example 1.
               The compositions made according to Examples 2-28 are very similar to the
5 composition of Example 1 in that they all include similar amounts of wood rosin
  derivatives. However, Examples 2-28 all included some amount of Foral@ NC, which,

   surprisingly and unexpectedly, yielded varnish compositions that were more stable,
   translucent and less gritty over time as compared to the varnish of Example 1. This was so
   even though Examples 2-28 were acidified using one or more acids in order to reduce the
   pH to the same of similar pH as Example 1.                     Thus, neutralizing highly acidic
 5 hydrogenating wood rosin using a base such as sodium carbonate and then re-acidifying
   the neutralized hydrogenating wood rosin resulted in a highly hydrogenated and acidic
   wood rosin that nevertheless remained more stable over time.
