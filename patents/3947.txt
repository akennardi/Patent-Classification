Processes for Operating and Using Storage Units
[0090]              Figures 3-3C illustrate different methods of operating a storage unit 100. Figure 3
depicts one embodiment of a process 300 of controlling a storage unit 100. The process 300
begins by displaying a prompt to a user as depicted at block 301. This prompt or message
may be a request for input such as, for example, user identification, item identification, task
identification, item delivery, item retrieval, payment, an instruction, storage receptacle
selection, or any other input, or may be an information display.
[0091]              The process 300 continues to block 302 and receives a user input.           In some
embodiments, this input is in response to the prompt displayed in block 300. This input may
correspond to, for example, user identification, item identification, task identification,
payment, item delivery, item retrieval, storage receptacle selection, or any other input.
[0092]              The process 300 continues to block 304 and executes stored instructions
corresponding to the user input. These instructions may correspond to, for example, the
functions of the storage unit 100, including, for example, requesting information, transmitting
information, disengaging a lock, engaging a lock, receiving an input, scanning an identifier,
and receiving payment.
[0093]              After execution of stored instructions corresponding to the user input at block 304,
the process 300 moves to decision state 306 and determines whether additional user input is
required. If additional user input is required, the process moves to block 300. If no additional
user input is required, the process terminates at block 308.
[0094]              The general method of operation outlined in Figure 3 is generally applied in all of
the other processes performed with the storage unit 100. Thus, this general method is applied

C:\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\DXL\17109789
                                     _.docx-9/06/2018
                                                         - 26
in, for example, the process of Figure 3A which depicts one embodiment of a process 300A of
controlling the storage unit 100 during item pickup and item delivery. The process 300A
begins at block 301A, when an item is deposited in a storage unit, which triggers a sending
notification to a user or the intended recipient of the item. The notification may be sent as an
email, an SMS text message, a written notice, or by any other notification method. After
notification is sent, process 300A moves to block 302A when control unit 144 receives
identification information from the user. The identification may comprise a broad range of
information and may be received by the control unit in a variety of formats.                     In some
embodiments, the identification comprises, for example, a username and password, a unique
account number, and unique information stored in a computer readable medium. In some
embodiments, the identification information provides input to the control unit by a user action,
such as, typing, speaking, selecting, or scanning. In some embodiments, for example, a user
can enter a usemame and password by typing the username and password, by speaking his
usemame and password into a microphone, by spelling his username and password into a
microphone, by scanning a computer readable code, or by any other desired method.
[0095]              After receiving identification information from the user, the process 300A moves to
decision state 303A and determines whether the information identifies a user. In some
embodiments, this step can comprise a comparison of received identification information with
stored user identification information. If the identification information does not identify a
user, the process 300A terminates as depicted at block 304A.
[0096]              If the identification information identifies a user, the process 300A moves to block
306A and the storage unit 100 displays the availability and location of items scheduled for
pickup by the user. In some embodiments, these items may be at the instant storage unit 100,
and in other embodiments, these items may be located at a different storage unit 100.
[0097]              After displaying the availability and location of an item scheduled for pickup by the
user, in some embodiments, the process 300A moves to decision state 308A and determines
whether the item is located at the present storage unit 100. If the item is not at the present
storage unit 100, then the process ends at block 31 OA.
[0098]              If the item is at the present storage unit 100, the process 300A moves to block 312A
and the user is prompted to pick-up the item. The process 300A moves to decision state 314A
and determines if the user has elected to pick-up the item. If the user has elected to pick-up

C:\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\DXL\17109789
                                     _.docx-9/06/2018
                                                        - 27
the item, then the user is allowed to pick-up the item at block 316A.
 [0099]             After the user picks-up the item at block 316A, or if the storage unit determines at
decision state 314A that the user has not elected to pick-up the item, the process moves to
block 318A, where the user is prompted to indicate whether they will deposit an item for
delivery. The process 300A moves to decision state 320A and determines if the user elected to
deposit the item for delivery. If it is determined that the user elected to deposit the item for
delivery, the user is allowed to deposit the item at block 322A. After the user has deposited
the item at block 322A, or if the storage unit 100 determines that the user did not elect to
deposit the item for delivery, the process ends at block 324A. Although the processes herein
are described with regard to a single item, the processes could be carried out with multiple
items and multiple users.
[0100]              The process of controlling the storage unit during item pick-up and/or delivery may
include further sub-processes. These sub-processes may include, for example, processing
further steps relating to the item pick-up and relating to the item delivery. Figure 3B depicts
one embodiment of a process for item pick-up 300B. The process 300B begins at block 302B
when the storage unit 100 receives a user input indicating intent to pick-up an item. After
receiving this input, the process 300B moves to decision state 304B to determine if there is an
item available for pick-up by the user. This determination can, in some embodiments, be
performed locally at the storage unit 100, or in some embodiments, this determination may
comprise transmitting a request to the storage unit system control unit for whether the user has
an item available for pick-up at the storage unit. If no item is available for pick-up, the
process terminates at block 306B.
[0101]              If an item is available for pick-up at the storage unit 100, the process 300B indicates
the storage receptacle 132 containing the item available for pick-up. This indication may be
achieved in a variety of ways. In some embodiments, for example, the screen 148 shows a
depiction of the storage unit 100, and visually indicates the storage receptacle 132 in which the
item is being stored. In some embodiments, the visual indication of the location of the item
may include, for example, a schematic illustration of the storage unit with a visual indication,
such as highlighting, one or several storage receptacles containing items for pick-up. In some
other embodiments, the position of storage receptacles 132 containing an item available for
pick-up may be indicated through, for example, activation of a light, or any other desired

C:\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\DXL\17109789
                                     _.docx-1906/2018
                                                      -28
method.
 [0102]             The process continues at step 3 1OB, where control unit sends a signal to open the
door 136 of the storage receptacle 132, and the door 136 of the receptacle 132 opens or is
made accessible to the user by the control unit 114. In some embodiments, opening of the
door comprises, for example, unlocking of the securement feature 140, or causing the door 136
of the receptacle to move to an opened position.
 [0103]             After opening the door 136 of the storage receptacle 132 as depicted in block 310B,
the process moves to block 3 12B, and the storage unit 100 requests confirmation by the user
that he picked-up the item in the designated storage receptacle 132.
[0104]              The storage unit 100 receives confirmation that the user picked-up the item in the
designated storage receptacle 132 at block 314B. In some embodiments, for example, the user
provides a signature if required for pick-up, and additionally confirms the pick-up via
signature, or other input to the storage unit 100. In some embodiments, the user signs in a
signature capture space located on a touch screen, and the signature is electronically captured.
In some embodiments, storage receptacle 132 comprises a scale or other device to detect a
change in the weight within the volume of the storage receptacle. If a user picks up an item,
the scale senses the reduction in weight, and the reduction in weight may be a pick-up
confirmation provided to the storage unit 100. In some embodiments, sensor 145 may provide
a sensing function to sense when an item has been removed from the storage unit 132, and
may provide confirmation of item pickup to storage unit 100.
[0105]              Upon receiving confirmation that the user picked-up the item in the designated
storage receptacle 132 as depicted in block 314B, the process 300B, advances to block 316B,
where the door 136 of the storage receptacle 132 is closed and/or secured.                     In some
embodiments, the door 136 of the storage receptacle 132 is configured to automatically close.
In some embodiments, the door 136 of the storage receptacle 132 is configured to controllably
close.          In some embodiments, the door 136 of the storage receptacle 132 may not be
configured to controllably or automatically close.
[0106]              In some embodiments, the securement feature 140 of the storage receptacle 132 is
configured for activation upon user confirmation of pick-up, or upon the elapsing of a
specified time, such as an automatic log-off. In some embodiments, the securement feature
 140 is activated as depicted in block 314B to re-secure the door 136 of the storage receptacle

[0107]              After the door 136 of the storage receptacle 132 has been closed and/or secured as
depicted in Figure 3B, the process 300B advances to decision state 318B, where it determines
if another item is available for pick-up by the user. If another item is available for pick-up by
the user, the process returns to block 308B. If another item is not available for pick-up by the
user, then the process 300B terminates at block 320B.
[0108]              Figure 3C provides further detail into the steps of some processes used in picking
up an item from a storage unit. Specifically, Figure 3C depicts one embodiment of a process
300C for requesting confirmation of item pick-up as depicted in Block 312B of Figure 3B.
Accordingly, the steps of the present process 300C occur within block 312B of Figure 3B.
[0109]              As depicted in Figure 3C, the process 300C for requesting confirmation of item
pick-up begins at block 322C by prompting the user to pick-up the item. This prompt may be,
for example, in addition to an indication of which storage receptacle 132 contains the item,
and in addition to opening of the storage receptacle 132 containing the item.
[0110]              After prompting the user to pick-up the item, the process 300C advances to block
324C where the user is prompted to scan an identifier on the item. In some embodiments, this
may comprise, for example, scanning a computer readable code, receiving a radio frequency
transmission, scanning a text string, or scanning any other identifying feature of the item.
[0111]              After prompting the user to scan the identifier as depicted in block 324C, the
process 300C advances to block 326C, where the storage unit 100 receives data from the
scanning of the identifier.
[0112]              After receiving data from the scanning of the identifier as depicted in block 326C,
the storage unit 100 prompts the user to confirm the pick-up of the item at block 328C. The
process 300C then advances to decision state 330C where it determines whether a user
signature is required. If a signature is required, the storage unit 100 prompts the user to
provide a signature as depicted in block 332C. The storage unit then receives the signature as
depicted in block 334C. After receiving the signature as depicted in block 334C, or after
determining that no signature is required in decision state 330C, the process 300C terminates
at block 336C.
[0113]              The steps of process 300C as depicted are illustrative, and need not be performed in
the order described. For example, steps 324C and 325C maybe performed prior to step 322C.

[0114]              Figure 3D depicts one embodiment of a process 300D for deposit of an item. The
process 300D begins at block 302D when the storage unit 100 receives a user input indicating
a user' s intent to deposit an item at the storage uni 100.
[0115]              The process 300D then moves to block 304D, where the user input is requested
relating to the size of the item for deposit. In some embodiments, the user may respond to this
request by inputting, for example, the dimensions of the item for deposit, or specifying the
general item size, such as, for example, small, medium, or large. In some embodiments, the
request to input the size of the item for deposit may provide general guidance as to how to
classify an item as small, medium, or large.
[0116]              In some embodiments, a scale, a sensor, or measuring device may be located at the
storage unit 100, or may be incorporated into storage unit 100, providing a user with an
opportunity to measure the size and weight of an item and provide the measurements to the
storage unit 100. A user may manually input the measured item dimensions into the control
unit 144, or the scale, sensor, or measuring device may communicate the measured item
dimensions to control unit 144. In some embodiments, the item may be provided in a flat-rate
box, or one of a set of standard size boxes. In this embodiment, the user may select or input
an identifier from the flat-rate or standard size box. The control unit 144 recognizes the
identifier for the flat rate or standard size box, and selects appropriately sized storage
receptacles 132 for deposit of the item in the flat-rate or standard size box.
[0117]              After requesting that the user input information relating to the dimensions of the
item for deposit, the process 300D moves to decision state 306D and determines whether the
user indicated the item size. In some embodiments, the item size may be indicated to the
control unit 144 according to the postage required or paid, where the postage required
corresponds to a flat-rate or standard size box.
[0118]              If the user indicated the item size, the process 300D advances to decision state
308D, and determines whether any storage receptacles 132 of adequate size to hold the
deposited item are available. In some embodiments, this determination includes, for example,
a query of the receptacle database 171 to determine which receptacles are available and the
sizes of the available receptacles.
[0119]              If no storage unit of adequate size is available, the process moves to block 31 OD and
communicates to the user that no storage receptacles 132 of adequate size are available in the

storage unit 100. In some embodiments, the control unit 144 may display on screen 148 the
location of the nearest storage unit 100 having an available storage receptacle 132 appropriate
to the item or item size. In some embodiments, screen 148 may display the location of the
nearest delivery or pick-up points, such as the nearest post offices to the storage unit 100. In
some embodiments, this information may be provided on a print out, a receipt, email, or SMS
message to the user.
 [0120]             If storage units of adequate size are available, or if the user does not indicate the
item size as determined at decision state 306D, the process 300D moves to block 312D and
communicates the location of available storage receptacles.                  In some embodiments, for
example, the screen 148 shows a depiction of the storage unit 100, and visually indicate, by,
for example, highlighting, available storage receptacles 132.
[0121]              The process 300D then moves to block 314D where the user is prompted to select a
storage receptacle. After receiving the user selection of the storage receptacle 132 as depicted
in block 316D, the door to the selected storage receptacle is opened as depicted in block 318D.
[0122]              The process 300D then proceeds to block 320D, where the user is prompted to
deposit the item in the storage receptacle 132. In some embodiments, the door 136 may
automatically shut after the item is deposited, or the door may be controllably shut after the
item is deposited. In some embodiments, the user may be additionally prompted to shut the
door 136. In some embodiments, a sensor incorporated into securement feature 140 provides
confirmation to the control unit 144 that the door has been secured and locked. In some
embodiments, sensor 145 provides a signal to the control unit 144 that the door is closed,
secured, and/or locked.
[0123]              The process then moves to block 322D, and the door 136 is secured. In some
embodiments in which the presence of an item in the storage receptacle is not automatically
detected, after the door is secured, the user is prompted, as depicted in block 324D, to confirm
that the item was deposited in the storage receptacle 132.                     After receiving the user
confirmation that the item was deposited in the storage receptacle as depicted in block 326D,
or after receiving sensing information indicating that the item was deposited in the storage
receptacle, the process moves to block 328 where the user is asked if he has another item to
deposit.
[0124]              After receiving the user input as to whether he has another item for deposit as

depicted in block 330D, the process 300D moves to decision state 322 and determines whether
the user has another item for deposit. If the user has another item for deposit, the process
300D moves to block 302D and continues through the flow chart. If the user does not have
another item for deposit, then the process 300D ends at block 334D.
 [0125]             Figure 3E depicts one embodiment of the process 300E associated with prompting
the user to deposit an item in the storage receptacle 132 as depicted in block 320D of Figure
3D. As depicted in Figure 3E, the process 300E moves to decision state 302E and determines
if postage is required. In some embodiments, determining if postage is required may comprise
evaluating whether a certain item or identifier input by a user qualifies for deposit into storage
unit 100. For example, a user may generate an identifier, such as a postage bar code, and
provide the barcode to the storage unit 100 via scanner 150. The process, in decision state
3 02E may evaluate whether the provided postage barcode is eligible for use at the storage unit
 100. This determination may be based on the identification of the user and an input from the
user identifying the item is a mail item to be sent to a particular recipient or location. In
decision block 302E, the determination of whether postage is required may also be made based
on input or scanned dimensions and weight of the item. In some embodiments the user inputs
a description of the item, any special delivery instructions, delivery destination, value of item
being deposited, and other similar parameters. Based on these parameters, control unit may
determine how much postage is required for the item to be deposited. In some embodiments
in which the user is the agent, no postage may be required. In contrast, in some embodiments
in which the customer is the user, postage may be required.
[0126]              If postage is required, the process 300E moves to block 304E and requests and
receives User indication of payment of postage.              In some embodiments, this comprises
completion of a postage purchase transaction at the storage unit 100. In some embodiments,
this may provide providing an indication of a previously completed postage purchase
transaction. In some embodiments, this indication may comprise scanning a unique identifier
associated with the postage purchase transaction, entering a unique identifier associated with
the postage purchase transaction, scanning postage located on the item, or any other method of
identifying a completed postage transaction. Upon each transaction, control unit 144 may
update a database maintained on a central controller or server, which will be described in more
detail below.

 [0127]             The process 300E then moves to decision state 306E and determines if an indication
of payment has been received from the control unit 144. If the indication of payment has not
been received, then the process terminates at block 308E. If the indication of payment has
been received, then the process moves to decision state 3 10E and determines if scanning of an
item identifier is required. Advantageously, the scanning of a unique item identifier may
allow the storage unit 100 to track each individual item that is placed in a storage receptacle.
[0128]              This identifier may comprise a range of identifiers, and may include a computer
readable code, a barcode, a text string, a radio-frequency emitter such as an RFID tag, or any
other identifier.
[0129]              If scanning of an identifier is required, the process 300E moves to block 312E and
prompts the user to scan the identifier. The process 300E then moves to decision state 314E
and determines if the user scanned the identifier. If the user did not scan the identifier, then
the process returns to block 3 12E and prompts the user again to scan the identifier. If the user
scanned the identifier, or if no identifier scan was required, the process 300E moves to
decision state 316E and determines if an item deposit date is required. If an item deposit date
is required, the process 300E moves to block 318E and records the deposit date. In some
embodiments, the storage unit 100 is configured to track the date, and so will be able to store
the deposit date without user input. In other embodiments in which the storage unit 100 is not
configured to track the date, the user may be prompted to input a deposit date, which entered
date is stored at block 318E.
 [0130]             After the deposit date has been stored in block 318E, or if no deposit date is
required, the process 300E moves to decision state 320E and determines if recipient
identification is desired. In some embodiments in which an agent is depositing an item in a
storage unit, the recipient information may be requested so that the recipient is notified that his
item is in the storage unit 100 and so that the recipient can identify himself to retrieve the item
from the storage unit 100. In other embodiments in which the customer is depositing an item
in the storage unit 100, the identification of the recipient may not be requested.
 [0131]             If the recipient information is desired, the process 300E moves to block 322E and
the user is prompted to input recipient information. In some embodiments, the user may
manually input the recipient information, may scan an identifier containing the recipient
information, or may use any other technique to enter the recipient information.

 [0132]             The process 300E then moves to decision state 324E and determines if the recipient
identification information has been received. If the recipient identification information has not
been received, the process moves to block 322E and the user is again prompted to enter the
recipient identification information.                 If the recipient identification information has been
entered, or if the recipient identification information is not required, then the process moves to
block 326E and the deposit information is stored at the storage unit 100. The process then
moves to block 328E and transmits the item deposit information. In some embodiments, this
transmission is from the storage unit 100 and to the storage unit system 400. Specifically, this
transmission is from the storage unit 100 and to the central management system 404. The
process then terminates at block 330E.
[0133]              In some embodiments of a storage unit 100, the storage unit is configured to track
the amount of time that an item has been in a storage receptacle 132, and designate the item
for removal from the storage receptacle 132 if the item has been in the storage receptacle 132
in excess of some duration. Figure 3F depicts one embodiment of a process 300F for
determining whether an item should be classified for removal based on the time it has been in
the storage receptacle 132. In some embodiments, the time an item may be stored in the
storage unit 132 may be input by a user into control unit 144 upon deposit.                        In some
embodiments, the time an item may be stored may be determined by the storage unit 100
based on the category of the item, input by the user at time of deposit. In some embodiments,
when time an item may be stored is not specified, control unit 144 may select a default time
for storage of a unit such as 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 1 week, 2 weeks,
 1 month, 2 months, or any other amount of time. In some embodiments, the control unit 144
records the time of deposit regardless of user input. The time of deposit may initiate a
standard allowed time for an item to remain in a storage receptacle 132 according to a pre
determined storage time.
 [0134]             The process 300F depicted in Figure 3F starts at block 302F by determining the
classification of the item. This classification may relate to a characteristic of the delivery
service provided for the item, such as, for example, mail class and/or mail type, the nature of
the item, such as, for example, its degree of perishability or size, economic or market factors,
such as the relative demand for the storage receptacle occupied by the item, or any other factor
relevant to the time that an item should be allowed to remain in the storage receptacle 132.

 [0135]             The process 300F moves to block 304F and determines the date that the item was
placed in the storage unit 100. In some embodiments, the storage unit 100 is configured to
track the date, and so this date may be retrieved from storage unit 100 resources. In other
embodiments in which the storage unit 100 is not configured to track the date, this date may be
retrieved from remote resources located within a storage unit system.
[0136]              After determining the date that the item was placed in the storage unit 100 at block
304F, the process 300F moves to decision state 306F and determines if the initial time for item
pick-up has passed, or if the item has been stored longer than input or predetermined time for
an item to be stored in the storage receptacle 132 has elapsed. If the initial time period for
item pick-up has not passed, the process 300F terminates at block 308F.
 [0137]             If the initial time period for item pickup has passed, the process 300F proceeds to
block 31 OF and a notice is sent to the intended recipient of the item to pick-up the item. In
some embodiments, this notice provides the address of the storage unit 100, identify the
storage receptacle 132 holding the item within the storage unit 100, provide a date before
which the item must be picked-up, provide notice procedures if the item is not retrieved, and
any other desired information. In some embodiments, this notice comprises an electronic
communication to, for example, an email account, a telephone number, a social network
homepage, or any other electronic communication.                       In some embodiments, the notice
comprises a voice communication sent to a telephone number or other account capable of
receiving a voice communication.                      In some embodiments, the notice comprises a paper
communication sent to the address of the intended recipient of the item. The notice may be
generated upon a user request, or automatically by the storage unit 100.
 [0138]             After sending the notice to the user at block 310F, the process 300F advances to
block 312F and waits until the designated time period has passed. After the time period has
passed, the process 300F advances to decision state 314F and determines whether the item has
been picked-up. If the item has been picked-up, the process 300F terminates at block 316F. If
the item has not been picked-up, the process 300F moves to block 318F and determines if any
additional time is available for picking-up the item.                In some embodiments, the user may
specify whether there is an extended time for pick-up of the item, or that the item may be
stored in the storage unit 132. In some embodiments, the storage unit 100 may determine two
time periods, the first period being the initial time for storage, and the second period being an

extended or additional time for item pickup, which may be available upon payment of an
additional fee. In some embodiments, the user may indicate whether the item should be
provided to another storage unit 100 upon the first period elapsing.
 [0139]             If additional time is available to pick-up the item, the process 300F moves to block
3 1OF, and continues through the flow-chart until the process is terminated. If the item is not
picked up within a first time period, the above notice is sent. If the item is not picked up
within the second extended or additional time period, a second notice is sent.
[0140]              If there is no additional time period available for picking-up of the item, the process
300F advances to block 320F where the item is identified as being held beyond its allowed
retention period. In some embodiments, this designation is stored in a local database at the
storage unit 100, and in other embodiments, this designation is stored at a central database in a
storage unit system. In addition to designating the item as being held beyond its allowed
retention period at block 320F, the process 300F designates the item for removal from the
storage unit at block 322F. In some embodiments, this designation is stored in a local
database at the storage unit 100, and in other embodiments, this designation is stored at a
central database in a storage unit system. In some embodiments, once the allowed storage
time has elapsed, the item is returned to the sender, or the depositor is notified to come retrieve
the item.
Storage Unit System
 [0141]             As discussed above, in some embodiments, the storage unit 100 is a standalone unit.
In some embodiments, however, a plurality of storage units 100 may be integrated into a
single storage unit system.                           Figures 4 through 4D depict schematic illustrations of
embodiments of storage unit systems 400. As depicted in Figure 4, a storage unit system 400
comprises a storage unit 402. In one embodiment, the storage unit 402 of the storage unit
system 400 comprises a storage unit 402 as described with respect to item 100 in Figures 1-2.
In some embodiments, the storage unit system 400 comprises a plurality of storage units 402.

connected with a plurality of customers 422a, 422b, 422c, and an agent 432. As further
depicted, the communication to the customers 422a, 422b, and 422c may be achieved through
a variety of means, including, for example, an electronic communication such as an email
422c or an SMS 422b, or through delivery of written notification 422a.
 [0158]             In some embodiments, the customer 422 receives and transmits information to the
storage unit system 422. In some embodiments, the customer 422 accesses the storage unit
system 422 using a computing device via the network and request information relating to the
status of a delivery, the location of an item, the availability of specified storage units 402,
locations of storage units 402, or any other desired information.
 [0159]             In some embodiments, and as depicted in Figure 4A, an agent 432 delivering items
can communicate with customers 422a, 422b, 422c, with a central server 430 and with other
components of the storage unit system 400. In some embodiments, this communication is via
a wireless device, such as, for example, a handheld device, a Smartphone, a mobile device, or
any other device capable of wireless network communications. In some embodiments, the
wireless device communicates with the storage unit system via, for example, a transmission
feature 434. Advantageously, such communication may allow an agent to receive and transmit
real-time information relating to the availability status of storage units 402 and relating to the
delivery of items.
[0160]              In some embodiments, the customer 422 may access the central server 430 via
network 424 via a user interface existing on network 424. Using the user interface, the
customer 422 may check availability of one or more storage receptacles 132 in one or more
storage units 100 located in a user-specified geographic area, capable of receiving a particular
item. The customer 422 receives a report of storage units available to receive the particular
item. The customer 422 may reserve a particular storage receptacle 132 via the user interface
over the network, and then the customer 422 may physically go to the particular storage
receptacle 132 and deposit an item as described herein.
[0161]              In some embodiments, a storage unit 100 containing an item designated for an
intended recipient can send a notification or information about the item to the central server
430, which can then route the notification or information to the customer 422 for whom the
item is designated or intended. In some embodiments, the agent 432 may communicate its
position continuously or at periodic intervals to the central server 430. The central server may

also receive periodic updates about deposits and items in storage receptacles 132. When the
central server 430 receives information regarding an item to be picked-up from or delivered to
a particular storage unit 100, the central server 430 sends a notification to the agent 432
directing the agent to pick up an item from or deliver an item to a particular storage unit 100.
This notification may be coordinated by the central server 430 such that notifications are
preferably sent to the agents 432 who are nearest in proximity to the storage unit containing
the item to be picked-up or the storage unit to which the item is to be delivered. In some
embodiments, the central server notifies the agent 432 whose planned route passes in
proximity to the storage unit 100 where the item is to be picked up or delivered.
 [0162]             Figure 5 depicts one embodiment of a process 500 of controlling a storage unit
system 100. In some embodiments, the process 500 is performed at the storage unit 100, and a
cooperating process is performed by computing resources elsewhere in the storage unit system
400. Although Figure 5 depicts steps specifically performed by the storage unit, a person of
skill in the art will recognize that any other component of the storage unit system 400 can
perform similar or identical steps. As described herein, when messages are sent and/or
received, the messages may originate in the control unit 144 or in the central server 430, as the
circumstances require. The central server 430 may control the process 500, and may direct the
operations of other components, including the sending of messages by the control units 144.
The central server 430 may facilitate message and information sending between various
components of the storage unit system 400 according to the processes and methods described
herein.
[0163]              The process 500 moves to decision state 502 and determines if a designated time
interval has passed.                        The time interval may be any specified time interval. In some
embodiments, the time interval may be, for example, 1 second, 1 minute, 5 minutes 15
minutes, 30 minutes 1 hour, 12 hours, 1 day, 1 week, or any other desired time interval. The
time interval may be determined by a number of factors, including, for example, the frequency
with which customers use the storage unit 100, the frequency with which software updates of
hardware maintenance is required, the location of the storage unit 100, the system bandwidth
and/or processing capabilities, and/or any other factor.
[0164]              If the time interval has passed, an alive message is sent as depicted at block 504.
This message indicates that the storage unit 100 is properly functioning, and has no specific

needs.
 [0165]             After sending the alive message at block 504, the process 500 moves to block 506
and await receipt of a response to the alive message. Once the response to the alive message is
received, the process 500 moves to decision state 508 and determines if the response is an
acknowledgement. An acknowledgement may comprise a message indicating that the alive
message was received. In some embodiments, an acknowledgement may include further
instructions for execution by the storage unit. In some embodiments, the acknowledgement
may not include any instructions. If the response is an acknowledgment, then the process
terminates at block 510.
 [0166]             If the response is not an acknowledgement, then the process moves to decision state
512 and determines if the response is a configuration update. A configuration update may
provide a software update or software patch to maintain and improve the operating system of
the storage unit 100.
[0167]              If the response is not a configuration update, the process moves to decision state 514
and determines if the response is a status or statistics request message. In some embodiments,
a status or statistics request message is periodically requested to provide an update on usage of
the storage unit 100, usage of the individual storage receptacles 132 of the storage unit 100,
any maintenance requests, present availability of storage receptacles, and/or any other
information relating to the storage unit.
[0168]              If the message is not a status or statistics request message, the process moves to
decision state 516 and determines if the response is a customer update message. A customer
update message may provide, for example, an update relating to customers who have used the
storage unit 100.                    This may include, for example, user identification information, user
passwords, user pictures, and identification of user transactions with the storage unit 100 such
as, for example, the picking-up or depositing of one or several items.
[0169]              If the message is a customer update message, the process moves to block 518 and a
customer update is provided. After providing the customer update, the process terminates at
block 520. Returning again to block 516, if the response is not a customer update message,
the process moves to block 522 and requests a new response as the response was not of an
expected type, in an expected format, or otherwise not readable. After requesting a new
response, the process terminates at block 524.

 [0170]             Returning again to block 514, if the response is a status or statistics request
message, the process moves to block 526 and determines the status of the storage unit 100.
This may include, for example, determining the availability of storage receptacles 132,
determining whether any maintenance or updates are required, determining how many storage
receptacles 132 are occupied, determining how many storage receptacles 132 are reserved, and
making any other determination relating to the status of the storage unit 100.
[0171]              The process then moves to block 528 and determines storage unit 100 statistics.
These statistics may include, for example, the average number of available storage receptacles
 132, the average number of occupied storage receptacles 132, the average number of reserved
storage receptacles, the number of customers who have used the storage receptacle, the
average number of customers using the storage receptacle in a specified time period, the actual
number of customers using the storage receptacle in a specified time period, the average
amount of time an item is left in the storage receptacle 132 before being picked-up, or any
other desired statistic relating to the storage unit 100.
[0172]              The process 500 then moves to block 530 and the status and statistics message is
sent. In some embodiments, the status and statistics messages are sent to the central server
430. The process 500 then terminates at block 532.
[0173]              Returning again to block 512, if the process determines that the response is a
configuration update, then the process moves to block 534 and creates a local backup of the
old software configuration. This backup may be of the entire software configuration, or
portions of the software configuration that will be replaced by the present configuration
update. After backing-up the old configuration, the process 500 moves to block 536 and
evaluates the new configuration. This evaluation may be configured to determine which
portions of the software configuration will be updated, to detect any obvious errors in the new
configuration, and to screen the new configuration for security threats, such as, malware
and/or viruses.
[0174]              The process then moves to decision state 544 and determines if the new
configuration may be activated. If the new configuration may be activated, the process moves
to block 546 and the new configuration is activated. The process then terminates at block 548.
[0175]              If the process determines that the new configuration cannot be activated, the process
moves to block 538 and the old, backup configuration is activated. After activating the backup

configuration, the storage unit transmits an error message indicating that the new configuration
cannot be activated at block 540. The process 500 then moves to block 542 and the storage
unit 100 receives a new configuration message. The process then returns to block 536 and the
new configuration is evaluated. From this block, the process moves to block 544 and proceeds
as described above.
 [0176]             Returning again to block 502, if the designated time interval has not passed, the
process moves to decision state 550 and determines if a new software configuration is
required. If no new software configuration is required, then the process moves to decision
state 552 and determines if a status message should be sent. A status message may comprise
information relating to, for example, the status of the storage unit 100 and the status of the
storage receptacles 132. This may include information relating to any required maintenance,
the availability of storage receptacles 132, the number and identification of storage receptacles
 132 occupied by an item, the number and identification of storage receptacles 132 reserved for
receiving an item, the length of time that items have been in the occupied storage receptacles
 132, and any other desired status information.
[0177]              If the process 500 determines that a status message should be sent, then the message
is sent at block 554, and the process terminates at block 556.
[0178]              If a status message should not be sent, as decided at decision state 552, the process
moves to decision state 558 and determines if a statistics message should be sent. A statistics
message may include, for example, the average number of available storage receptacles 132,
the average number of occupied storage receptacles 132, the average number of reserved
storage receptacles, the number of customers who have used the storage receptacle, the
average number of customers using the storage receptacle in a specified time period, the actual
number of customers using the storage receptacle in a specified time period, the average
amount of time an item is left in the storage receptacle 132 before being picked-up, or any
other desired statistic relating to the storage unit 100. If the statistics message should be sent,
then the process moves to block 560 and the message is sent and the process terminates at
block 556.
 [0179]             If a statistics message should not be sent, then the process moves to decision state
562 and determines if an error message should be sent. An error message may report a
malfunction of the hardware or software of the storage unit 100. In some embodiments, for

                                                      - 46
example, an error message is sent when a door 136 of a storage receptacle 132 cannot be shut
and/or re-secured. Similarly, in some embodiments, an error message is sent when some
aspect of the software fails to properly operate. If an error message should be sent, then the
process moves to decision state 564 and the error message is sent, after which the process
terminates at block 566. An error message may be sent if a printer is out of paper, a scanner
fails, a storage receptacle 132 fails, high heat or humidity are detected, vandalism detected,
power failure, or other error conditions.
 [0180]             Returning again to block 550, if a new configuration is required, the process moves
to block 568 and a request configuration message is sent. The process then moves to block
570 and a configuration message is received. The process then proceeds to back up the old
configuration as depicted at block 534 and to evaluate the new configuration at block 536.
The process then proceeds to decision state 544 and proceeds through the flow-chart as
discussed above.
[0181]              Some embodiments of a storage unit system 400 include security features to protect
deposited items and to avoid accidental removal of the wrong item. One of these features is
the user identification system. One process 500A used for user identification is depicted in
Figure 5A.
 [0182]             In some embodiments, the storage unit system 400 includes security features. For
example, a storage unit 100 may comprise an accelerometer configured to identify an abrupt,
sharp, or other unexpected movement of the storage unit 100, and communicate this
acceleration as evidence of tampering or attempted tampering. The cameras associated with
storage unit 100, including the camera on the control cabinet 146 and on the roof 124 may be
motion activated and provide monitoring of transactions. These security measures may be
provided to meet stringent standards as requested or required by a particular organization, such
as, for example, the United States Postal Service. In some embodiments, the storage unit
system, specifically the storage units 100, may be configured to meet underwriting laboratory
(UL) requirements, ergonomic requirements, or specific industry standard requirements.
 [0183]             Process 500A begins at block 502A when the user identification and password are
received. At block 504A the entered user identification and picture captured at the time of
entry of the user identification are stored.
 [0184]             The process then proceeds to decision state 506A and determines whether the

customer identification is a default agent identification. The decision may be based on a list of
agent identification stored on database 171 in memory 170.
 [0185]             If the identification is an agent identification, then the process moves to block 508A
and the identification and entered password are locally authenticated by the storage unit 100
where the identification and password were entered.
[0186]              The process then proceeds to decision state 510 and determines if the entered
password is correct. If the password is incorrect, the process moves to block 5 12A and access
to the storage unit 100 is denied.
[0187]              If the entered password is correct for the entered agent identification, then the
process moves to block 514A and access is allowed. The process then moves to block 516A
and the storage unit 100 transmits a logged-in message to the central management system 404.
The logged-in message may include the date and time the user logged in to the storage unit. In
some embodiments, the logged-in message may include the user identification, password,
and/or image captured at the time of user log-in.
 [0188]             The process 500A then moves to block 518A and the storage unit performs the
operations requested by the agent and outlined throughout the present specification. The
process 500A then ends at block 520A.
 [0189]             Returning again to block 506A, if the user identification is not a default agent
identification, then the process moves to block 522A and transmits the user identification and
password to the customer directory 412 and requests verification of the identification and
password by the customer directory 412. The process then moves to block 524A and receives
the response transmission.
[0190]              The process then moves to decision state 526A and determines if the identification
and password are verified. If the identification and password are not verified, the process
moves to block 528A and access to the storage unit is denied. In some embodiments, the
identification and password are verified by comparing the transmitted user identification and
password to prestored user identification and password contained in customer directory 412.
A user may provide the prestored user identification and password upon signing up to use the
storage system 400, or by registering as a customer of the storage system 400.
[0191]              If the identification and password are verified, the process moves to block 530A and
access to the storage unit is allowed. The process then moves to block 532A and the storage

unit 100 sends a logged-in message to the central management system 404. The logged-in
message may include the date and time the user logged in to the storage unit. In some
embodiments, the logged-in message may include the user identification, password, and/or
image captured at the time of user log-in.
 [0192]                The process 500A then moves to block 534A and the storage unit performs the
operations requested by the user and outlined throughout the present specification.                 The
process 500A then ends at block 536A.
 [0193]             Figure 5B depicts one embodiment of the process 500B of customer verification
performed using the customer directory 412. The process 500B begins at block 502B when
the customer identification and password and a request for authentication of the customer
identification and password are received. The process 500B moves to block 504B and the
customer directory 412 is queried.
[0194]              The process 500B then moves to decision state 506B and determines if the customer
identification and password match information stored in the customer directory 412. If the
customer identification and password do not match the information stored in the customer
directory, then the process 500B moves to block 508B and a response is transmitted to the
storage unit 100 that indicates that the identification and password combination are incorrect.
[0195]              If the customer identification and password match information in the customer
directory 412, then the process 500B moves to block 5 1OB, and the response is transmitted to
the storage unit 100 indicating that the identification and password combination is correct.
[0196]              The process 500B then moves to block 512B and a logged-in message is received
from the storage unit 100 indicating that the customer has successfully logged-in. The logged
in message may include information relating to the user and the log-in, including, for example,
the customer password, customer identification, customer image captured during log-in, date
of log-in, time of log-in, or any other information related to the log-in. The process 500B then
moves to block 514B and the logged-in message is stored, and then the process terminates at
block 516B.
[0197]              Figure 5C provides further detail into the steps of some processes used in picking
up an item from a storage unit 100 when the storage unit 100 is functioning as part of a storage
unit system 400. Specifically, Figure 5C depicts one embodiment of a process 500C for
requesting confirmation of item pick-up as depicted in block 312B of Figure 3B. Accordingly,

C:\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\DXL\17109789

                                                      - 49
the steps of the present process 500C occur within block 312B of Figure 3B.
 [0198]             As depicted in Figure 5C, the process 500C for requesting confirmation of item
pick-up begins at block 522C by prompting the user to pick-up the item. This prompt may be,
for example, in addition to an indication of which storage receptacle 132 contains the item,
and in addition to opening of the storage receptacle 132 containing the item.
[0199]              After prompting the user to pick-up the item, the process 500C advances to block
524C where the user is prompted to scan an identifier on the item. In some embodiments, this
may comprise, for example, scanning a computer readable code, receiving a radio frequency
transmission, scanning a text string, or scanning any other identifying feature of the item.
[0200]              After prompting the user to scan the identifier as depicted in block 524C, the
process 500C advances to block 526C, where the storage unit 100 receives data from the
scanning of the identifier.
[0201]              After receiving data from the scanning of the identifier as depicted in block 526C,
the storage unit 100 prompts the user to confirm the pick-up of the item at block 528C. The
process 500C then advances to decision state 530C where it determines whether a user
signature is required. If a signature is required, the storage unit 100 prompts the user to
provide a signature as depicted in block 532C. The storage unit then receives the signature as
depicted in block 534C.
 [0202]             After receiving the signature as depicted in block 534C, or after determining that no
signature is required in decision state 530C, the process 500C moves to block 536C and stores
pick-up-information. This information may include, for example, the user identification, the
user password, the image captured at the time of log-in, the user image captured at the time of
pick-up or pick-up confirmation, the item number, and/or any other information relating to the
item pick-up.
 [0203]             The process 500C then moves to block 538C and requests and receives information
relating to the communications status of the storage unit 100. The process then proceeds to
decision state 540C and determines whether the storage unit is online and able to communicate
with other components of the storage unit system 400. If the storage unit is not online, the
process moves to block 542C and waits until the communications with the storage unit system
400 have been reestablished and the storage unit 100 is online. After the storage unit 100
returns online, or if the storage unit is online in decision state 540C, the process moves to

                                                                  - 50
block 544C and the storage unit transmits the confirmation to the other components of the
storage unit system 400. The process then terminates at block 546C.
[0204]              Figure 5D depicts one embodiment of aspects of the process 500D for depositing
items at a storage unit 100 that is functioning as part of a storage unit system 400. The process
5OOD begins at block 502D when the storage unit 100 receives a user input indicating intent to
deposit an item.                     The process 500D moves to block 504D and requests and receives
information relating to the storage unit 100 communications status, and specifically to the
ability of the storage unit 100 to communicate with other components of the storage unit
system 400.
[0205]              The process then moves to decision state 506D and determines if the storage unit
100 is online and may communicate with other components of the storage unit system 400. If
the storage unit is online, the process moves to block 508D, and the user continues with the
deposit of the item following processes outlined in this specification.
[0206]              If the storage unit 100 is not online and cannot communicate with other components
of the storage unit system 400, then the process moves to block 51 OD and communicates to
the user that items cannot be presently deposited. The process then terminates at block 512D.
[0207]              Figure 5E depicts one embodiment of a process 500E for registering users to allow
access to the storage units 402 of the storage unit system 400. Process 500E moves to block
502E and receives user registration information. In some embodiments, user registration
information may be received in electronic or non-electronic form. In some embodiments, a
user may fill out a registration form. This form may be, for example, delivered to an agent of
the storage unit system 400 who can verify the user information. In another embodiment, the
user can fill out and submit an electronic form located, for example, on a website. This user
information may include, for example, a desired username, a desired password, the user' s
name, the user' s address, the user' s preferred stage unit 402 locations, the user' s email
address, the user' s telephone number, and any othenlesired information.
[0208]              The process then moves to block 504E and requests user authentication and
completion of registration.                           The request may be made via any form of communication,
including electronic communication, such as, for example, email, SMS, telecommunications,
mail, or any other desired form of communication.                           The request for authentication and
completion of registration may request verification of the already received information, further

information about the user, and that the user contacts an agent of the storage unit system 400
for verification of user provided information.
 [0209]             The process then moves to block 506E and receives the completed and authenticated
registration information from the user. The process then moves to decision state 508E and
determines if the user information may be validated.                  In some embodiments, the user
information is validated by comparison of user submitted information to public or secure
information relating to the user. In some embodiments, the user information is validated by a
comparison to secure information maintained by a postal agency such as, for example the
United States Postal Service.
[0210]              If the user information cannot be validated, the process 500E moves to block 51OE
and follow-up is requested from an agent 432 in order to determine whether the user
information was correct, or whether there is an error in the system. If the used information is
validated, process 500E proceeds to block 5 12E and the user account is designated as active.
The process then moves to block 514E and notification of account activation is sent to the
user. In some embodiments, this may include sending a user identification and user password
for accessing the storage units 400. Following notification, the process ends in block 516E.
In some embodiments, this includes providing a computer readable card or object containing
information uniquely identifying the user. A person of skill in the art will recognize that a
variety of methods of identifying a user may be used and the present disclosure is not limited
to any specific form of user identification.
[0211]              In some embodiments, the storage unit system 400 facilitates the delivery of an item
by tailoring delivery to a recipient' s delivery prdierences. The delivery preferences of a
recipient may be provided to the storage unit system 400 upon deposit of the item. In some
embodiments, the delivery preferences of a recipient may be provided upon registering as a
customer or user of the storage unit system 400, and the delivery preferences may be stored in
the customer data 412. Figure 5F depicts one embodiment of process 50OF used in connection
with a storage unit system for delivering an item. The process 50OF begins at block 502F and
receives a request for delivery of an item to a storage unit 402. The process 502F then
proceeds to block 504F and requests and receives information relating to a preferred storage
unit 402. The preferred storage unit may be indicated by a user or customer upon depositing
the item, or by the user when registering or signing up to use the storage unit system 412. In

C:\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\DXL\17109789

                                                                - 52
some embodiments, a customer may specify one or more preferred storage units 402 for
receiving item delivery.                          In some embodiments, these preferences are ranked from most
preferential to least preferential. In some further embodiments, a user is assigned a default
storage unit 402.                    The default storage unit 402 may comprise a vast number of storage
receptacles 132, and may be located, at, for example, a post office.                           Advantageously,
evaluation of the availability of preferred storage units 402 based on their preference rank
results in placement of the item in the most preferred storage unit 402 with an available
storage receptacle 132 of adequate size to hold the item.
 [0212]             The process 50OF then moves to block 506F and determines if the preferred storage
unit can receive the item. If the evaluated storage unit 100 cannot hold the item, the process
5OOF moves to decision state 508F and determines if the customer has an additional preferred
storage unit 402. If the customer has an additional preferred storage unit, then the process
returns to block 506F and determines if that next preferred storage unit 402 can receive the
item.
[0213]              Returning to decision state 508F, if there are no additional preferred storage units,
the process 50OF moves to decision state 5 1OF and determines if a default storage unit 402 is
available. If a default storage unit 402 is available, then the process 50OF moves to decision
state 512F and determines if the default storage unit 402 can receive the item. If the default
storage unit 402 cannot receive the item, or if there is no default storage unit 402, then the
process moves to block 514F and the item is designated for alternate delivery. In some
embodiments, alternate delivery may comprise in person delivery, or delayed delivery when
one of the preferred or default storage units 402 can receive the item.
 [0214]             Returning again to decision state 512F, if the default storage unit can receive the
item, or if one of the preferred storage units can receive the item, then the process moves to
block 516F and the item is designated for delivery to the available storage unit 402.
 [0215]             The process then proceeds to block 518F and reserves the required storage
receptacle 132 in the desired storage unit 402 for receipt of the item. In some embodiments,
this reservation may be made through communication with the central management system
404. In some embodiments, the reservation is made by communication with the storage unit
402 to which the item will be delivered. In some embodiments, the reservation is made by a
communication to both the storage unit 402 to which the item will be delivered and to the

central management system 404. The reservation is communicated to central server 430,
which maintains a database of the status of each storage receptacle 132 within storage unit
system 400.                 The status includes which storage receptacles 132 are available, which are
occupied, and which have been reserved, thus preventing the storage unit system 400 from
reserving a particular storage receptacle 132 to more than one user or customer.
 [0216]             The process 50OF then proceeds to block 520F and requests updated capacity status
from the storage unit 402 to which the item will be delivered. The updated capacity status is
then stored in the database 414 in the central management system 404, updating the capacity
information for the storage unit as depicted in block 522F.
[0217]              The process then moves to block 524F and communicates delivery information to
the recipient. This information may be communicated with any communication method,
including,              for example,                  electronic communication, telecommunication, or postal
communication, and the process terminates at block 526F.
[0218]              In some embodiments, the use of a storage unit system may affect methods of
delivery an item. In some embodiments, the method of delivery is tailored to a customer
preference. Figure 6 depicts one exemplary process 600 for matching delivery to a customer' s
preference. The process 600 begins at block 602 and receives item recipient information.
This information may include item information, recipient identification, recipient delivery
preferences, recipient physical address, recipient storage unit address, and any other recipient
information. The information may be provided by the user who deposits the item, or by a
vendor or merchant who requests that an item be delivered via the storage unit system 400.
The process then moves to decision state 604 and determines if the recipient is registered for
storage unit delivery. If the recipient is not registered for storage unit delivery, the process is
terminated at block 606.
[0219]              If the recipient is registered for storage unit delivery, the process moves to decision
state 608 and determines if the recipient has requested first attempt personal delivery. First
attempt personal delivery occurs when the agent delivering the item makes a first attempt to
deliver the item to the physical address or other specified location associated with the
recipient. If the recipient wants first attempt personal delivery, then the process moves to
block 610 and the agent attempts to deliver the item to the recipient. The process then moves
to decision state 612 and determines if the recipient received the item by accessing pick-up

confirmation information of control unit 144 or central server 430. If the recipient received
the item, then the process terminates at block 614.
[0220]              If the recipient did not receive the item, or if the recipient has noted that they do not
desire first attempt personal delivery, then the process moves to block 616 and prepares for
item delivery to a storage unit 402. In some embodiments, this may include placing a unique
identification feature on the item, scanning the identification feature to enter the item into the
system, entering the recipient information into the system so as to associate the recipient
information with the item, and any other steps. In some embodiments, this information
relating to the item identification and the recipient information is stored in the database 414 of
the central management system 404.
[0221]              The process then proceeds to block 618 and the customer is notified of the pending
delivery to the storage unit 402. As mentioned above, this notification may be provided
electronically, by telephone, or by writing. The process then proceeds to block 620 and the
delivery procedure continues as outlined throughout this specification. After completion of
the delivery procedure, the process terminates as depicted at block 622.
[0222]              Figure 6A depicts one embodiment of a process 600A used by an agent in
delivering an item.                      The process 600A may be performed by the agent with a device
configured to network communication such as, for example, a computer, a Smartphone, a
tablet, a handheld device with network access, a wireless device with network access, or any
other device with network communication capability. The process 600A begins at block 602A
when item recipient information is received. The process 600A continues to block 604A and
requests and receives information relating to whether the recipient receives storage unit
deliveries.
[0223]              The process 600A continues at decision state 606A and determines if the recipient
receives storage unit deliveries. If the recipient does not receive storage unit deliveries, the
process 600A terminates at block 608A. If the recipient receives storage unit deliveries, the
process 600A continues at block 610A and requests and receives information relating to
whether the recipient receives first attempt deliveries.
[0224]              The process 600A continues to decision state 612A and determines if the recipient
receives first attempt deliveries. If the recipient receives first attempt deliveries, the process

616A, the process 600A determines if the delivery of the item was successful based on
delivery status provided by an agent 432. If the delivery was successful, the process 600A
terminates at block 618A. If the delivery attempt was unsuccessful, then the process 600A
moves to block 620A and the recipient is notified of the pending delivery to the storage unit
402.
 [0225]             After notifying the recipient of the pending delivery to the storage unit 402, or if the
recipient does not receive first attempt deliveries, the process 600A continues to block 622A
and sends a request for the location of the preferred and available storage unit 402. At block
624A, the process 600A receives information relating to the location of the preferred and
available storage unit 402. The process 600A continues to block 626A and sends a request to
reserve an available storage receptacle 132.
[0226]              The process 600A continues at block 628A where the item is delivered to the
reserved storage receptacle 132 at the designated storage unit 402. At block 630A, the
recipient is notified of the successful delivery of the item to the storage unit 402 and provided
information relating to picking-up of the item from the storage unit 402.                        In some
embodiments, this information may include a time frame in which pick-up is required, item
identification information, any other information required to retrieve the item, and/or any other
desired information. The process 600A then terminates at block 632A
[0227]              In some embodiments, the storage unit is configured for the sale of postage to
facilitate customer deposit of items for delivery. In some embodiments, the storage unit 402
may be configured to receive indicia of a purchase of postage and to dispense postage to
facilitate customer deposit of items for delivery. Some embodiments relate to a system in
which the purchase of postage is remote from the storage unit 402, such as, for example over
the internet, and postage is dispensed at the postage in response to inputting an identifier of the
postage purchase to the storage unit 402. Figure 7 depicts one embodiment of a process 700
that may be used in purchasing and obtaining postage. The process 700 begins at block 702
with the receipt of the selection of postage for purchase. This selection may comprise the
designation of the item size and the desired time frame for delivery, the selection of postage of
a specific value, or any other designation of postage type. The process 700 continues at block
704 and receives shipping information. This information may include, for example, the
recipient name, the recipient address, the mailer name, the mailer address, and any other

information required for transport of the item.
 [0228]             The process 700 continues at block 706 with the selling of the postage. This step
may require payment processes, such as providing electronic payment information such as
credit card or bank card number, payment of cash, or any other payment process. The process
700 continues at block 708 with the distribution of a purchased postage identifier. In some
embodiments, the purchased postage identifier may comprise a unique identifier that identifies
the specific transaction, the type of postage purchased, and, in some embodiments, other
shipping details.                   In some embodiments, the identifier may comprise a text string, or a
computer readable code such as, for example, a bar code, including linear barcodes, 2D
barcodes, or any other barcode. In some embodiments, the identifier is printable, transmitted,
such as, by email.
 [0229]             The process 700 continues at block 710 when the system receives the identifier of
the postage purchase at a location capable of printing the postage. In some embodiments, this
location is at, for example, a storage unit. In some embodiments, the identifier is entered into
the postage printing components, for example, into the storage unit. In some embodiments,
the identifier is manually entered into the storage unit 402. In some embodiments in which the
identifier comprises a computer readable code, the identifier is scanned into the storage unit
402 via the scanner 150.
[0230]              In response to receipt of the identifier of the postage purchase, the postage printing
component may dispense the printed postage. In embodiments in which the storage unit 402 is
the postage printing component, the printer 152 of the storage unit may print the postage.
After printing the postage, the process may terminate at block 714.
 [0231]             In some embodiments, the method of Figure 7 is used to make other payments
associated with an item, such as, for example, payment of customs, payment of taxes, post
office box payments, or any other payments. As shown above, these payments may be made
at a location separate from the storage unit 402 and the storage unit 402 is used to print
labelling indicative of the completion of these payments.
Further Uses
 [0232]             In some embodiments, the storage unit 402 and/or storage unit system 400 is used to
facilitate new types of deliveries. In one embodiment, for example, a customer storage unit

C:\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\DXL\17109789
                                      _.docx-9/06/2018
                                                          - 57
address is used to facilitate anonymous delivery of items. As the customer storage unit
address does not identify the customer or their physical address, the customer storage unit
address may allow delivery of items to a customer without disclosing the identity of the
customer to the originator of the item. This anonymity may facilitate customer safety and
privacy in all transactions, and may be particularly beneficial in electronic transactions, or
transaction of sensitive items.
[0233]              In some embodiments, a storage unit 402 may be used as an unmanned sales
merchant office. In one such embodiment, a storage unit 402 may be wholly or partly
assigned for use to a merchant, and items ordered from the merchant are delivered to the
storage unit 402. In some embodiments, these deliveries are available to registered users of
the storage unit.                    In other embodiments, these deliveries are available to unregistered
recipients of the storage unit 402. In embodiments in which a recipient is unregistered, a
unique identifier is be used to identify the recipient to allow the recipient to pick-up the
delivered item. In some embodiments, a government issued identification is be used as the
unique identifier. In other embodiments, the merchant provides a unique identifier, such as a
transaction number, a code, a password, a computer readable identifier, or any other unique
identifier to the item recipient. Upon inputting of the unique identifier, the storage unit 402
allows the recipient to access their item.
[0234]              In another embodiment, the storage unit 402 is be used in connection with day
and/or time-specific deliveries. In such an embodiment, the storage unit includes instruction
not to allow access to the contents of storage receptacles containing the items for day- and/or
time-specific delivery until the designated day and/or time has passed. Delivery capability
may beneficially facilitate sales and deliveries of items having a particular release date, such
as the release date of a product, including, for example, a book, a video, a device, a toy, or any
other item.
[0235]              In one embodiment, the storage unit system 400 is configured to enable proactive
inventory management at the storage unit 402 and/or to enable customers to determine
availability of storage receptacles at the delivery location before sending an item.
Advantageously, such inventory management increases efficiency of operations.
[0236]              In one embodiment, the storage unit system 400 is configured to provide a vendor,
business entity, or other entity the ability to reserve a particular storage receptacle 132 on a

[0237]              In one embodiment, a portion or all of the storage receptacles 132 at a given storage
unit 402 may be assigned to a specific customer. In this embodiment, a customer may be
assigned a specific storage receptacle 132, and only items for that customer are delivered to
that receptacle 132.

[0249]              The foregoing description details certain embodiments of the systems, devices, and
methods disclosed herein. It will be appreciated, however, that no matter how detailed the
foregoing appears in text, the systems, devices, and methods may be practiced in many ways.
As is also stated above, it should be noted that the use of particular terminology when
describing certain features or aspects of the invention should not be taken to imply that the

interchanged or excluded from other embodiments.
 [0251]             With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein,
those having skill in the art may translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the
singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application.                 The various
singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.
[0252]              It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein are
generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be interpreted as
"including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the
term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited to," etc.). It will be
further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim
recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence
of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the
following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and
"one or more" to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be
construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or
"an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments
containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory
phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a"
and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same
holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even
if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the
art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the
recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically
means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances
where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a
construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the
convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not be
limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B
and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention
analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is
intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a

have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or
A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually
any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the
description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of
including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase "A or
B" will be understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."
[0253]              All references cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. To
the extent publications and patents or patent applications incorporated by reference contradict
the disclosure contained in the specification, the specification is intended to supersede and/or
take precedence over any such contradictory material.
[0254]              The term "comprising" as used herein is synonymous with "including,"
"containing," or "characterized by," and is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude
additional, unrecited elements or method steps.
[0255]              All numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth
used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by
the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set
forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending
upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least,
and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the
claims, each numerical parameter should be construed in light of the number of significant
digits and ordinary rounding approaches.
[0256]              The above description discloses several methods and materials of the present
invention. This invention is susceptible to modifications in the methods and materials, as well
as alterations in the fabrication methods and equipment. Such modifications will become
apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of this disclosure or practice of the
invention disclosed herein. Consequently, it is not intended that this invention be limited to
the specific embodiments disclosed herein, but that it cover all modifications and alternatives
coming within the true scope and spirit of the invention as embodied in the attached claims.
