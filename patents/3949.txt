                                          ABSTRACT
The present invention provides antibodies that neutralize flavivirus and methods of use thereof.
These antibodies are derived from mAbl 1 which recognizes West Nile virus E protein and is
cross-reactive with members of the flavivirus family, including Denge virus. The antibodies of
the present invention prevent antibody-dependent enhancement of a viral infection by having a
modified Fc region that does not bind to the Fcy receptor. The invented antibody is used to treat
flaviviral infections and symptoms thereof.

                                   RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]         This application is a divisional application of Australian Application
No. 2014227909, filed on 14 March 2014, and is related to International Patent Application
No. PCT/US2014/0283 10, filed on 14 March 2014 and claims benefit of, and priority to, U.S.
S.N. 61/792,336 failed on 15 March 2013; the contents of which are hereby incorporated by
reference in its entirety.
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]         This invention relates generally to flavivirus neutralizing antibodies as well as to
methods for use thereof.
                                   GOVERNMENT INTEREST
[0003]         This invention was made with government support under A10703431 awarded by
the National Institutes of Health. The United States government has certain rights in the
invention.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0004]         Flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus and Dengue virus, present a significant
threat to global health. West Nile virus causes a febrile illness that can lead to fatal meningitis
or encephalitis across multiple species. West Nile virus can be carried by both birds and
mosquitos, which has allowed its spread at an alarming pace worldwide.
Similarly, four serotypes of Dengue virus can be transmitted through mosquito bites, and causes
tens of millions of human cases of dengue annually, including 500,000 hospitalizations and
20,000 deaths, with an economic burden rivalling that of malaria.
[0005]         Vaccines and antibody therapeutics are currently in development to prevent and
treat flavivirus infection. However, evidence from dengue virus infections indicate that
vaccination strategies for flaviviruses may not be as straightforward as other viruses. A first
infection with one Dengue virus serotype induces protective immunity to the homologous
serotype. However, there is no cross-protection against infection by a different serotype.
Instead, pre-existing immunity is associated with increased risk of infection and illness due to
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. In ADE, antibodies raised by prior
                                                   1

flavivirus infection or passively transferred from mother to child cause an increased rate of
infection and pathogenicity. Thus, conventional methods of antibody-based therapeutics or
                                    [Text continues on page 2.]
                                                 la

vaccines against flavivirus may exponentially increase incidence of flavivirus infection and
illness.
[00061          Accordingly, there is an urgent need for therapeutics and methods for
preventing flavivirus infection, and diseases and disorders related thereto, without
increasing the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.
                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0007]          The invention is based upon the discovery of monoclonal antibodies which
bind and neutralize flavivirus, and do not contribute to the antibody-dependent enhancement
of flavivirus infection. The monoclonal antibody is fully human. The antibodies recognize
the West Nile virus envelope protein E (WNE), and have broad cross-reactivity across other
members of the flavivirus family. Importantly, the antibodies contain mutations in the Fc
region that prevent binding to the Fcy receptor. The antibodies are referred to herein as
huFV antibodies.
[00081          The invention provides an isolated humanized monoclonal antibody having a
heavy chain with three CDRs, wherein the CDR1 includes amino acid sequence GYSTH
(SEQ ID NO:4), wherein the CDR2 includes amino acid sequence
WDNPSSGDTTYAENFRG (SEQ ID NO:5), and wherein the CDR3 includes amino acid
sequence GGDDYSFDH (SEQ ID NO:6) respectively; a light chain with three CDRs,
wherein the CDR1 includes amino acid sequence RGDSLRSYYAS (SEQ ID NO:7),
wherein the CDR2 includes amino acid sequence GENNRPS (SEQ ID NO:8), and wherein
the CDR3 includes amino acid sequence NSRDSSDHLLL (SEQ ID NO:8) respectively.
The antibody has a modified Fc region such that the Fc region does not bind to the Fcy
receptor, and binds to a flavivirus. Exemplary Fc regions are disclosed herein.
[0009]          In one aspect, the invention provides an isolated humanized monoclonal
antibody having a VH amino acid sequence having SEQ ID NO: 1, a VL amino acid
sequence having SEQ ID NO: 3. In another aspect, the invention provides an isolated
humanized monoclonal antibody comprising a VH nucleotide sequence having SEQ ID NO:
2, a VL nucleotide sequence having SEQ ID NO: 4. The antibody further comprises a
modified Fc region such that the Fc region does not bind to the Fcy receptor, and binds to a
flavivirus.
[0010]          The present invention provides an isolated humanized monoclonal antibody
that neutralizes a flavivirus.
                                               2

[0011]          The present invention provides antibodies with a modified Fe region such
that the Fe region does not bind to the Fcy receptor. The modified Fc region contains
mutations at amino acid positions 234 and 235. In one aspect, the mutations are L234A and
L235A. In one embodiment, the modified Fc region comprises a CH2 region wherein the
amino acids at positions 4 and 5 of the CH2 region are mutated. For example, the leucine
amino acids at positions 4 and 5 are mutated to a different amino acid, preferably, an
alanine. In other embodiments, the modified Fc region comprises an Fc region where the
amino acids at positions 108 and 109 are mutated. For example, the leucines at positions
 108 and 109 of the Fc region are mutated to a different amino acid, preferably, an alanine.
In another embodiment, the modified Fe region comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ
ID NO: 7. The modified Fe region binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).
[0012]          In one aspect, the antibody does not contribute to an antibody-dependent
enhancement of a flavivirus infection.
[0013]          In one aspect, the antibody is linked to a therapeutic agent. The therapeutic
agent is a toxin, a radiolabel, a siRNA, a small molecule, or a cytokine. For example, the
cytokine is TGF-beta.
[0014]          The present invention further provides a cell producing a huFV antibody.
The cell may be a mammalian cell (i.e., a mouse, rabbit, goat, or sheep), or a plant cell (i.e.
tobacco plant).
[0015]          The present invention provides a method for preventing antibody-dependent
enhancement of a flavivirus infection by administering a huFv antibody to a subject. In one
aspect, the antibody is administered after a first infection by a flavivirus.
[0016]          Additionally, the present invention provides a method of increasing vaccine
efficiency by administering to a subject a huFV antibody and a vaccine. In one aspect, the
huFV antibody and the vaccine are administered sequentially or concurrently. In one aspect,
the vaccine is a viral vaccine.
[0017]          The present invention further provides a method for treating or alleviating a
symptom of a flavivirus infection by administering to a subject in need thereof a
composition containing a huFV antibody. In another aspect, the present invention features a
method for delaying the onset or progression of one or more symptoms of a flavivirus
infection. Symptoms of flavivirus infection include, but are not limited to, weight loss,
paralysis, fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, and body aches. In one aspect, an
anti-viral agent is also administered to the subject. In one aspect, the huFV antibody and the
                                                 3

anti-viral agent are administered sequentially or concurrently. The anti-viral agent is an
antibody, an antibody linked to a therapeutic agent, or a small molecule.
[00181          The flavivirus is West Nile virus, Dengue virus (serotypes 1-4), St. Louis
encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley
encephalitis virus.
[0019]          The invention further provides a nucleic acid sequence containing a nucleic
acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4 and 8.
[0020]          The invention further provides a nucleic acid sequence encoding a
polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 and 3. The invention further provides a polypeptide
containing the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3 and 7.
[0021]          The invention further provides a vector containing the nucleic acid sequence
containing SEQ ID NO: 2, 4 and 8, or encoding a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3 and 7.
[0022]          Additionally, the invention provides a cell containing a vector containing the
nucleic acid sequence containing SEQ ID NO: 2, 4 and 8, or encoding a polypeptide of SEQ
ID NO: 1, 3 and 7.
[0023]           Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from and are
encompassed by the following detailed description and claims.

                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0030]          The present invention provides antibodies that neutralize infection by
members of the flavivirus family without contributing to antibody-dependent enhancement
of virus infection. Antibodies that bind and neutralize West Nile virus are described in
International Publication WO 2005/123774, the contents of which are incorporated by
reference in its entirety. The antibodies of the present invention were produced by
modifying an antibody against West Nile virus, mAb 11, such that the Fc region of the
antibody does not bind to the Fc-gamma receptor. Thus, the modified antibody does not
contribute to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. The antibodies and methods
disclosed herein relate to this antibody, and methods for treating or preventing an infection
by a flavivirus, and related diseases and disorders. The antibody of the present invention,
mAB 11 -LALA has demonstrated increased capability of preventing and treating flavivirus
infection compared to the wild-type mAb 11, as described herein and demonstrated in the
examples.
[00311          MAb 11 was identified using a phage display screening and binds to the West
Nile virus envelope protein E, within the DI and DII domains and specifically at the fusion
loop peptide (Gould et al., Journal of Virology, 2005, 79(23):14606-14613; Sultana et al.,
Journal of Immunology, 2009, 183: 650-660, the contents of which are incorporated herein
                                                5

in their entirety). The engineered mAb 11 antibody with mutations at amino acids positions
234 and 235 in the Fe region is referred to herein as "mAb 1-LALA".
[0032]           The antibodies of the present invention have broad cross-reactivity to the
members of the Flavivirus family. For example, the antibody demonstrates cross-reactivity
and neutralization of several different flaviviruses, including, but not limited to West Nile
virus, Dengue virus (serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4), St. Louis encephalitis virus, yellow fever
virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus.
[00331           Neutralizing antibodies have been and are being currently developed for the
treatment and prevention of viral infections, specifically infections by members of the
Flavivirus genus. Initial studies have demonstrated that such antibodies show increased
neutralization and protection from infection by flavivirus family members (i.e., West Nile
Virus or one of the four Dengue virus serotypes). However, subsequent virus challenge
studies, in which experimental subjects were treated with neutralizing antibodies and then
challenged with doses of flavivirus (i.e., Dengue virus), did not show a decrease in viremia.
In some cases, treatment with such antibodies resulted in enhancement of infection
compared to controls, which is believed to be mediated though a mechanism called
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). These results demonstrate the importance of
developing therapeutics and methods that prevent antibody-dependent enhancement of
flavivirus infection.
[0034]           Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection can be accomplished by the
binding of the Fc region of the antibody to an Fcy receptor (FcyR) on a host cell. Infectious
viral particles bound to these antibodies are therefore more efficiently brought to host cells
by Fc region-Fc receptor binding. This increases the infection and replication rate of the
virus, thereby enhancing the infectivity and pathogenicity of the virus.
[0035]           In contrast to standard anti-viral antibodies, the antibodies of the present
invention have reduced binding to the Fcy receptors (FcyR) or do not bind to the FcyR. Fcy
receptors include, for example, FcyRI, FcyRIIIa, FcyRIIIb, and FcyRIIIc. In one
embodiment, the antibodies of the invention contain one or more mutations in the Fc region.
The mutation(s) may be any mutation that reduces or abrogates binding of the antibody to a
FcyR. Mutations can be substitutions, additions, or deletions of amino acids in the Fc
region. Although the antibodies of the present invention have mutated Fc regions, the
antibodies still confer potent flavivirus neutralization.
                                                  6

[00361          The Fc region of an antibody comprises two domains, CH2 and CH3. These
domains, or specific amino acids within these domains known in the art, mediate the
interaction with FcyR. Antibodies of the present invention contain any mutation (i.e.,
substitution, addition, or deletion of one or more than one amino acid) in the CH2 or CH3
domain, or both, that reduces or abrogates the binding of the antibody to an FcyR. For
example, antibodies of the present invention contain a mutation or substitution of at least
one amino acid at positions 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 250, 314, or 428 of the wild-type Fc
region. Preferably, the amino acid substitution is to an alanine.
[0037]          In one embodiment, the Fc region of an antibody of the invention comprises
a substitution at positions 234 or 235 of the heavy chain of the antibody, or both. In general,
the amino acid at positions 234 and 235 of the wild-type Fc region is a leucine ("L"). In one
embodiment, the antibodies of the invention comprise an amino acid at position 234, 235, or
both, that is not a leucine. In another embodiment, the antibodies of the invention comprise
an alanine ("A") at position 234, 235 or both. An antibody comprising the mutations at
positions 234 and 235 of the Fc region where the leucines are mutated to alanines is referred
to herein as a "LALA" variant.
[00381          In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention are full
length, or intact, antibodies, wherein the antibodies contain an antigen-binding region (i.e.,
Fab region or Fab fragment) and an Fc region (modified or mutated, as described herein).
Previously developed antibodies in the art that were designed to circumvent ADE often lack
the Fc region to prevent binding to FcyR. Antibodies of the present invention provide
superior properties by retaining the Fc region. One such property is the ability to bind to the
neonatal receptor (FcRn) expressed on endothelial cells, which plays a critical role in the
homeostasis of circulating IgG levels. Binding of circulating antibodies to the FcRn induces
internalization through pinocytosis, in which the antibodies are recycled to the cell surface,
and released at the basic pH of blood. This mechanism protects the antibodies of the
present invention from degradation and increases the half-life compared to other unmodified
antibodies or antibody fragments lacking the Fc region. Increased persistence of the
antibodies of the present invention in the serum provides increased efficacy by allowing
higher circulating levels, less frequent administration, and reduced doses. Another property
of the antibodies of the present invention may include the ability to bind to complement
factors. Binding of complement factors, such as CIq, to the Fc region of the antibody
triggers a signaling cascade to activate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).
                                                7

[00391           It is known in the art that the binding sites on the Fc region of Fcy receptors
is distinct from the binding site of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Therefore, the
antibodies of the present invention have Fc regions modified such that they have reduced
binding or cannot bind to the Fcy receptors, however are still competent for binding to the
FcRn receptor. Antibodies of the invention can be modified by introducing random amino
acid mutations into particular region of the CH2 or CH3 domain of the heavy chain in order
to alter their binding affinity for FeyR and/or FcRn and/or their serum half-life in
comparison to the unmodified antibodies. Examples of such modifications include, but are
not limited to, substitutions of at least one amino acid from the heavy chain region selected
from the group consisting of amino acid residues 234, 235, 236, 237, 250, 314, and 428.
Accordingly, the antibodies of the present invention have greater half-life than unmodified
antibodies, which confers increased efficacy in the prevention and treatment of flavivirus
infections and subsequent disease.
[0040]           In one aspect, the antibodies of the present invention have Fc regions
modified such that have reduced binding or cannot bind to the Fey receptors, however are
still competent for binding to complement factors, such as Cl q.
[0041]           One of ordinarily skill in the art could readily prepare the modified
antibodies of the present invention. Recombinant DNA techniques for introducing
mutations or substitutions in the Fe region of an antibody are known in the art.
Characterization of the Fe region for their ability to bind or not bind to Fc receptors (Fcyr or
FcRn) can be readily performed by the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example by
immunoprecipitation, immunoassay, affinity chromatography, or array techniques.
[0042]           The humanized antibodies described herein may be produced in mammalian
expression systems, such as hybridomas. The humanized antibodies described herein may
also be produced by non-mammalian expression systems, for example, by transgenic plants.
For example, the antibodies described herein are produced in transformed tobacco plants (N.
benthamianaand N. tabaccum).

Antibodies
[0066]          As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to immunoglobulin molecules and
immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules, i.e., molecules that
contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds (immunoreacts with) an antigen. By
"specifically binds" or "immunoreacts with" is meant that the antibody reacts with one or
more antigenic determinants of the desired antigen and does not react with other
polypeptides. Antibodies include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, and
chimeric antibodies
[0067]          In general, antibody molecules obtained from humans relate to any of the
classes IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD, which differ from one another by the nature of the
heavy chain present in the molecule. Certain classes have subclasses as well, such as IgG 1,
IgG 2, and others. Furthermore, in humans, the light chain may be a kappa chain or a lambda
chain. The term "antigen-binding site," or "binding portion" refers to the part of the
immunoglobulin molecule that participates in antigen binding. The antigen binding site is
formed by amino acid residues of the N-terminal variable ("V") regions of the heavy ("H")
and light ("L") chains. Three highly divergent stretches within the V regions of the heavy
and light chains, referred to as "hypervariable regions," are interposed between more
conserved flanking stretches known as "framework regions," or "FRs". Thus, the term "FR"
refers to amino acid sequences which are naturally found between, and adjacent to,
hypervariable regions in immunoglobulins. In an antibody molecule, the three hypervariable
regions of a light chain and the three hypervariable regions of a heavy chain are disposed
relative to each other in three dimensional space to form an antigen-binding surface. The
antigen-binding surface is complementary to the three-dimensional surface of a bound
antigen, and the three hypervariable regions of each of the heavy and light chains are
referred to as "complementarity-determining regions," or "CDRs."
[00681          As used herein, the term "epitope" includes any protein determinant capable
of specific binding to an immunoglobulin, a scFv, or a T-cell receptor. Epitopic
determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as
amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural
characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. For example, antibodies may be
raised against N-terminal or C-terminal peptides of a polypeptide.
[00691          As used herein, the terms "immunological binding," and "immunological
binding properties" refer to the non-covalent interactions of the type which occur between
an immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific. The
                                               13

strength, or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed in terms of the
dissociation constant (Kd) of the interaction, wherein a smaller     Kd represents a greater
affinity. Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides can be quantified using
methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the rates of antigen
binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those rates depend on the
concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction, and geometric
parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the "on rate
constant" (Ko.) and the "off rate constant" (Koff) can be determined by calculation of the
concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation. (See Nature 361:186-87
(1993)). The ratio of Koff /Kon enables the cancellation of all parameters not related to
affinity, and is equal to the dissociation constant Kd. (See, generally, Davies et al. (1990)
Annual Rev Biochem 59:439-473). An antibody of the present invention is said to
specifically bind to a flavivirus epitope when the equilibrium binding constant (K) is 1
pM, preferably      100 nM, more preferably     K 10 nM, and most preferably       100 pM to
about 1 pM, as measured by assays such as radioligand binding assays or similar assays
known to those skilled in the art.
[0070]           An flavivirus protein (i.e., an envelope protein or West Nile envelope protein
E) of the invention, or a derivative, fragment, analog, homolog or ortholog thereof, may be
utilized as an immunogen in the generation of antibodies that immunospecifically bind these
protein components.
[0071]           Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is possible to determine, without
undue experimentation, if a human monoclonal antibody has the same specificity as a
human monoclonal antibody of the invention by ascertaining whether the former prevents
the latter from binding to flavivirus. If the human monoclonal antibody being tested
competes with the human monoclonal antibody of the invention, as shown by a decrease in
binding by the human monoclonal antibody of the invention, then it is likely that the two
monoclonal antibodies bind to the same, or to a closely related, epitope.
[0072]           Another way to determine whether a human monoclonal antibody has the
specificity of a human monoclonal antibody of the invention is to pre-incubate the human
monoclonal antibody of the invention with the flavivirus envelope proteins, such as West
Nile virus protein E, with which it is normally reactive, and then add the human monoclonal
antibody being tested to determine if the human monoclonal antibody being tested is
inhibited in its ability to bind flavivirus envelope proteins, such as West Nile virus E. If the
                                                  14

human monoclonal antibody being tested is inhibited then, in all likelihood, it has the same,
or functionally equivalent, epitopic specificity as the monoclonal antibody of the invention.
Screening of human monoclonal antibodies of the invention, can be also carried out by
utilizing WNE and determining whether the test monoclonal antibody is able to neutralize
members of the flavivirus family.
[0073]          Various procedures known within the art may be used for the production of
polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies directed against a protein of the invention, or against
derivatives, fragments, analogs homologs or orthologs thereof. (See,for example,
Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow E, and Lane D, 1988, Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, incorporated herein by reference).
[0074]          Antibodies can be purified by well-known techniques, such as affinity
chromatography using protein A or protein G, which provide primarily the IgG fraction of
immune serum. Subsequently, or alternatively, the specific antigen which is the target of
the immunoglobulin sought, or an epitope thereof, may be immobilized on a column to
purify the immune specific antibody by immunoaffinity chromatography. Purification of
immunoglobulins is discussed, for example, by D. Wilkinson (The Scientist, published by
The Scientist, Inc., Philadelphia PA, Vol. 14, No. 8 (April 17, 2000), pp. 25-28).
[0075]          The term "monoclonal antibody" or "MAb" or "monoclonal antibody
composition", as used herein, refers to a population of antibody molecules that contain only
one molecular species of antibody molecule consisting of a unique light chain gene product
and a unique heavy chain gene product. In particular, the complementarity determining
regions (CDRs) of the monoclonal antibody are identical in all the molecules of the
population. MAbs contain an antigen binding site capable of immunoreacting with a
particular epitope of the antigen characterized by a unique binding affinity for it.
[0076]          Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as
those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975). In a hybridoma method, a
mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an
immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies
that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes can be
immunized in vitro.
[0077]          The immunizing agent will typically include the protein antigen, a fragment
thereof or a fusion protein thereof. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes are used
if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if
non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an
                                                15

immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a
hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press,
(1986) pp. 59-103). Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells,
particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse
myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells can be cultured in a suitable culture
medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival
of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme
hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium
for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine ("HAT
medium"), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.
[0078]           Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support
stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are
sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are
murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell
Distribution Center, San Diego, California and the American Type Culture Collection,
Manassas, Virginia. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also
have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies. (See Kozbor, J.
Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques
and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63)).
[0079]           The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be
assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably,
the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is
determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as
radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such
techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal
antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard,
Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980). Moreover, in therapeutic applications of monoclonal
antibodies, it is important to identify antibodies having a high degree of specificity and a
high binding affinity for the target antigen.
[0080]           After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones can be subcloned
by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. (See Goding, Monoclonal
Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-103). Suitable culture
media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and
                                                16

RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in vivo as ascites in a
mammal.
[00811          The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones can be isolated or
purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin
purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite
chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.
[0082]          Monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods,
such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal
antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional
procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to
genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of
the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA can be
placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as simian
COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise
produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the
recombinant host cells. The DNA also can be modified, for example, by substituting the
coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the
homologous murine sequences (see U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Morrison, Nature 368,
812-13 (1994)) or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part
of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a
non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an
antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the variable domains of one
antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent
antibody.
[00831          Fully human antibodies are antibody molecules in which the entire sequence
of both the light chain and the heavy chain, including the CDRs, arise from human genes.
Such antibodies are termed "humanized antibodies", "human antibodies", or "fully human
antibodies" herein. Human monoclonal antibodies can be prepared by using trioma
technique; the human B-cell hybridoma technique (see Kozbor, et al., 1983 Immunol Today
4: 72); and the EBV hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (see
Cole, et al., 1985 In: MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND CANCER THERAPY, Alan R. Liss, Inc.,
pp. 77-96). Human monoclonal antibodies may be utilized and may be produced by using
human hybridomas (see Cote, et al., 1983. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 80: 2026-2030) or by
                                               17

transforming human B-cells with Epstein Barr Virus in vitro (see Cole, et al., 1985 In:
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND CANCER THERAPY,              Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96).
[0084]          In addition, humanized antibodies can be produced in transgenic plants, as an
an inexpensive production alternative to existing mammalian systems. For example, the
transgenic plant may be a tobacco plant, i.e., Nicotiania benthamiana, and Nicotiana
tabaccum. The antibodies are purified from the plant leaves. Stable transformation of the
plants can be achieved through the use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens or particle
bombardment. For example, nucleic acid expression vectors containing at least the heavy
and light chain sequences are expressed in bacterial cultures, i.e., A. tumefaciens strain
BLA4404, via transformation. Infiltration of the plants can be accomplished via injection.
Soluble leaf extracts can be prepared by grinding leaf tissue in a mortar and by
centrifugation. Isolation and purification of the antibodies can be readily be performed by
many of the methods known to the skilled artisan in the art. Other methods for antibody
production in plants are described in, for example, Fischer et al., Vaccine, 2003, 21:820-5;
and Ko et al, Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, Vol. 332, 2009, pp. 55-78.
As such, the present invention further provides any cell or plant comprising a vector that
encodes the antibody of the present invention, or produces the antibody of the present
invention.
[0085]          In addition, human antibodies can also be produced using additional
techniques, including phage display libraries. (See Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol.,
227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991)). Similarly, human antibodies
can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice
in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely
inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely
resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and
antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos.
5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016, and in Marks et al.,
Bio/Technology 10, 779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368 856-859 (1994); Morrison,
Nature 368, 812-13 (1994); Fishwild et al, Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-51 (1996);
Neuberger, Nature Biotechnology 14, 826 (1996); and Lonberg and Huszar, Intern. Rev.
Immunol. 13 65-93 (1995).
[00861          Human antibodies may additionally be produced using transgenic nonhuman
animals which are modified so as to produce fully human antibodies rather than the
                                                18

animal's endogenous antibodies in response to challenge by an antigen. (See PCT
publication W094/02602). The endogenous genes encoding the heavy and light
immunoglobulin chains in the nonhuman host have been incapacitated, and active loci
encoding human heavy and light chain immunoglobulins are inserted into the host's
genome. The human genes are incorporated, for example, using yeast artificial
chromosomes containing the requisite human DNA segments. An animal which provides
all the desired modifications is then obtained as progeny by crossbreeding intermediate
transgenic animals containing fewer than the full complement of the modifications. The
preferred embodiment of such a nonhuman animal is a mouse, and is termed the
Xenomouse m as disclosed in PCT publications WO 96/33735 and WO 96/34096. This
animal produces B cells which secrete fully human immunoglobulins. The antibodies can
be obtained directly from the animal after immunization with an immunogen of interest, as,
for example, a preparation of a polyclonal antibody, or alternatively from immortalized B
cells derived from the animal, such as hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies.
Additionally, the genes encoding the immunoglobulins with human variable regions can be
recovered and expressed to obtain the antibodies directly, or can be further modified to
obtain analogs of antibodies such as, for example, single chain Fv (scFv) molecules.
[0087]           An example of a method of producing a nonhuman host, exemplified as a
mouse, lacking expression of an endogenous immunoglobulin heavy chain is disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 5,939,598. It can be obtained by a method, which includes deleting the J
segment genes from at least one endogenous heavy chain locus in an embryonic stem cell to
prevent rearrangement of the locus and to prevent formation of a transcript of a rearranged
immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, the deletion being effected by a targeting vector
containing a gene encoding a selectable marker; and producing from the embryonic stem
cell a transgenic mouse whose somatic and germ cells contain the gene encoding the
selectable marker.
[00881           One method for producing an antibody of interest, such as a human antibody,
is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,916,771. This method includes introducing an expression
vector that contains a nucleotide sequence encoding a heavy chain into one mammalian host
cell in culture, introducing an expression vector containing a nucleotide sequence encoding
a light chain into another mammalian host cell, and fusing the two cells to form a hybrid
cell. The hybrid cell expresses an antibody containing the heavy chain and the light chain.
[00891           In a further improvement on this procedure, a method for identifying a
clinically relevant epitope on an immunogen and a correlative method for selecting an
                                               19

antibody that binds immunospecifically to the relevant epitope with high affinity, are
disclosed in PCT publication WO 99/53049.
[0090]          The antibody can be expressed by a vector containing a DNA segment
encoding the single chain antibody described above.
[0091]          These can include vectors, liposomes, naked DNA, adjuvant-assisted DNA,
gene gun, catheters, etc. Vectors include chemical conjugates such as described in WO
93/64701, which has targeting moiety (e.g. a ligand to a cellular surface receptor), and a
nucleic acid binding moiety (e.g. polylysine), viral vector (e.g. a DNA or RNA viral vector),
fusion proteins such as described in PCT/US 95/02140 (WO 95/22618) which is a fusion
protein containing a target moiety (e.g. an antibody specific for a target cell) and a nucleic
acid binding moiety (e.g. a protamine), plasmids, phage, etc. The vectors can be
chromosomal, non-chromosomal or synthetic.
[0092]          Preferred vectors include viral vectors, fusion proteins and chemical
conjugates. Retroviral vectors include moloney murine leukemia viruses. DNA viral vectors
are preferred. These vectors include pox vectors such as orthopox or avipox vectors,
herpesvirus vectors such as a herpes simplex I virus (HSV) vector (see Geller, A. I. et al., J.
Neurochem, 64:487 (1995); Lim, F., et al., in DNA Cloning: Mammalian Systems, D.
Glover, Ed. (Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford England) (1995); Geller, A. I. et al., Proc Natl.
Acad. Sci.: U.S.A. 90:7603 (1993); Geller, A. I., et al., Proc Natl. Acad. Sci USA 87:1149
(1990), Adenovirus Vectors (see LeGal LaSalle et al., Science, 259:988 (1993); Davidson,
et al., Nat. Genet 3:219 (1993); Yang, et al., J. Virol. 69:2004 (1995) and Adeno-associated
Virus Vectors (see Kaplitt, M. G.. et al., Nat. Genet. 8:148 (1994).
[0093]          Pox viral vectors introduce the gene into the cells cytoplasm. Avipox virus
vectors result in only a short term expression of the nucleic acid. Adenovirus vectors,
adeno-associated virus vectors and herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors are preferred for
introducing the nucleic acid into neural cells. The adenovirus vector results in a shorter term
expression (about 2 months) than adeno-associated virus (about 4 months), which in turn is
shorter than HSV vectors. The particular vector chosen will depend upon the target cell and
the condition being treated. The introduction can be by standard techniques, e.g. infection,
transfection, transduction or transformation. Examples of modes of gene transfer include
e.g., naked DNA, CaPO 4 precipitation, DEAE dextran, electroporation, protoplast fusion,
lipofection, cell microinjection, and viral vectors.
[0094]          The vector can be employed to target essentially any desired target cell. For
example, stereotaxic injection can be used to direct the vectors (e.g. adenovirus, HSV) to a
                                                20

desired location. Additionally, the particles can be delivered by intracerebroventricular (icv)
infusion using a minipump infusion system, such as a SynchroMed Infusion System. A
method based on bulk flow, termed convection, has also proven effective at delivering large
molecules to extended areas of the brain and may be useful in delivering the vector to the
target cell. (See Bobo et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:2076-2080 (1994); Morrison et
al., Am. J. Physiol. 266:292-305 (1994)). Other methods that can be used include catheters,
intravenous, parenteral, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injection, and oral or other known
routes of administration.
[0095]          These vectors can be used to express large quantities of antibodies that can
be used in a variety of ways. For example, to detect the presence of flavivirus in a sample.
The antibody can also be used to try to bind to and disrupt flavivirus envelope protein
activity.
[0096]          In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention are full
length antibodies, containing an Fc region similar to wild-type Fc regions that bind to Fc
receptors.
[0097]          Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present
invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies.
Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to
unwanted cells (see U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (see WO
91/00360; WO 92/200373; EP 03089). It is contemplated that the antibodies can be
prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those
involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins can be constructed using a
disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents
for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980.
[0098]          It can be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to
effector function, so as to enhance, e.g., the effectiveness of the antibody in neutralizing or
preventing viral infection. For example, cysteine residue(s) can be introduced into the Fc
region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The
homodimeric antibody thus generated can have improved internalization capability and/or
increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC). (See Caron et al., J. Exp Med., 176: 1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, J. Immunol.,
 148: 2918-2922 (1992)). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered that has dual Fc
regions and can thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. (See
                                                21

Stevenson et al., Anti-Cancer Drug Design, 3: 219-230 (1989)). In a preferred embodiment,
the antibody of the present invention has modifications of the Fc region, such that the Fc
region does not bind to the Fc receptors. Preferably, the Fc receptor is Fcy receptor.
Particularly preferred are antibodies with modification of the Fc region such that the Fc
region does not bind to Fcy, but still binds to neonatal Fc receptor.
[0099]            The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody
conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of
bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e.,
a radioconjugate).
[00100]           Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include
diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from
Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin,
Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and
PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor,
gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. A variety of
radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples
include  2 12Bi, 131    In, 90 Y, and "'Re.
[00101]           Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of
bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate
(SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl
adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as
glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine),
bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine),
diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such
as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as
described in Vitetta et al., Science 238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled
 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3 -methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an
exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. (See
W094/11026).
[00102]           Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a large variety of
possible moieties can be coupled to the resultant antibodies or to other molecules of the
invention. (See, for example, "Conjugate Vaccines", Contributions to Microbiology and
                                                 22

Immunology, J. M. Cruse and R. E. Lewis, Jr (eds), Carger Press, New York, (1989), the
entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).
[001031          Coupling may be accomplished by any chemical reaction that will bind the
two molecules so long as the antibody and the other moiety retain their respective activities.
This linkage can include many chemical mechanisms, for instance covalent binding, affinity
binding, intercalation, coordinate binding and complexation. The preferred binding is,
however, covalent binding. Covalent binding can be achieved either by direct condensation
of existing side chains or by the incorporation of external bridging molecules. Many
bivalent or polyvalent linking agents are useful in coupling protein molecules, such as the
antibodies of the present invention, to other molecules. For example, representative
coupling agents can include organic compounds such as thioesters, carbodiimides,
succinimide esters, diisocyanates, glutaraldehyde, diazobenzenes and hexamethylene
diamines. This listing is not intended to be exhaustive of the various classes of coupling
agents known in the art but, rather, is exemplary of the more common coupling agents. (See
Killen and Lindstrom, Jour. Immun. 133:1335-2549 (1984); Jansen et al., Immunological
Reviews 62:185-216 (1982); and Vitetta et al., Science 238:1098 (1987)). Preferred linkers
are described in the literature. (See,for example, Ramakrishnan, S. et al., Cancer Res.
44:201-208 (1984) describing use of MBS (M-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide
ester). See also, U.S. Patent No. 5,030,719, describing use of halogenated acetyl hydrazide
derivative coupled to an antibody by way of an oligopeptide linker. Particularly preferred
linkers include: (i) EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride;
(ii) SMPT (4-succinimidyloxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-alpha-(2-pridyl-dithio)-toluene        (Pierce
Chem. Co., Cat. (21558G); (iii) SPDP (succinimidyl-6 [3-(2-pyridyldithio)
propionamido]hexanoate (Pierce Chem. Co., Cat #2165 1G); (iv) Sulfo-LC-SPDP
(sulfosuccinimidyl 6 [3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propianamide] hexanoate (Pierce Chem. Co. Cat.
#2165-G); and (v) sulfo-NHS (N-hydroxysulfo-succinimide: Pierce Chem. Co., Cat.
#24510) conjugated to EDC.
[00104]         The linkers described above contain components that have different
attributes, thus leading to conjugates with differing physio-chemical properties. For
example, sulfo-NHS esters of alkyl carboxylates are more stable than sulfo-NHS esters of
aromatic carboxylates. NHS-ester containing linkers are less soluble than sulfo-NHS esters.
Further, the linker SMPT contains a sterically hindered disulfide bond, and can form
conjugates with increased stability. Disulfide linkages, are in general, less stable than other
linkages because the disulfide linkage is cleaved in vitro, resulting in less conjugate
                                               23

available. Sulfo-NHS, in particular, can enhance the stability of carbodimide couplings.
Carbodimide couplings (such as EDC) when used in conjunction with sulfo-NHS, forms
esters that are more resistant to hydrolysis than the carbodimide coupling reaction alone.
[00105]          The antibodies disclosed herein can also be formulated as immunoliposomes.
Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as
described in Epstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 3688 (1985); Hwang et al., Proc.
Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 77: 4030 (1980); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545.
Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,013,556.
[00106]          Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse-phase
evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol,
and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded
through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab'
fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as
described in Martin et al., J. Biol. Chem., 257: 286-288 (1982) via a disulfide-interchange
reaction.
[00107]          Use of Antibodies Against Flaviviruses
[00108]          Methods for the screening of antibodies that possess the desired specificity
include, but are not limited to, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and other
immunologically mediated techniques known within the art.
[00109]          Antibodies directed against a flavivirus envelope protein such as WNE (or a
fragment thereof) may be used in methods known within the art relating to the localization
and/or quantitation of a flavivirus envelope protein such as WNE (e.g., for use in measuring
levels of the flavivirus protein within appropriate physiological samples, for use in
diagnostic methods, for use in imaging the protein, and the like). In a given embodiment,
antibodies specific to an flavivirus envelope protein such as WNE, or derivative, fragment,
analog or homolog thereof, that contain the antibody derived antigen binding domain, are
utilized as pharmacologically active compounds (referred to hereinafter as "Therapeutics").
[00110]          An antibody specific for a flavivirus envelope protein such as WNE of the
invention can be used to isolate a flavivirus polypeptide by standard techniques, such as
immunoaffinity, chromatography or immunoprecipitation. Antibodies directed against an
flavivirus protein (or a fragment thereof) can be used diagnostically to monitor protein
levels in tissue as part of a clinical testing procedure, e.g., to, for example, determine the
efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling (i.e.,
physically linking) the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable
                                                  24

substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent
materials, bioluminescent materials, and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable
enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, p-galactosidase, or
acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include
streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include
umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine
fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material
includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and
aequorin, and examples of suitable radioactive material include      1,    1,    S or 3H.
[00111]          Antibodies of the invention, including polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized
and fully human antibodies, may used as therapeutic agents. Such agents will generally be
employed to treat or prevent a flavivirus -related disease or pathology (e.g., dengue fever) in
a subject. An antibody preparation, preferably one having high specificity and high affinity
for its target antigen, is administered to the subject and will generally have an effect due to
its binding with the target. Administration of the antibody may abrogate or inhibit or
interfere with the internalization of the virus into a cell. In this case, the antibody binds to
the target and prevents binding to an Fc receptor-expressing cell, thereby blocking fusion
the virus to the cell membrane inhibiting internalization of the virus in antibody-dependent
enhancement of infection.
[00112]          A therapeutically effective amount of an antibody of the invention relates
generally to the amount needed to achieve a therapeutic objective. As noted above, this
may be a binding interaction between the antibody and its target antigen that, in certain
cases, interferes with the functioning of the target. The amount required to be administered
will furthermore depend on the binding affinity of the antibody for its specific antigen, and
will also depend on the rate at which an administered antibody is depleted from the free
volume other subject to which it is administered. Common ranges for therapeutically
effective dosing of an antibody or antibody fragment of the invention may be, by way of
nonlimiting example, from about 0.1 mg/kg body weight to about 50 mg/kg body weight.
Common dosing frequencies may range, for example, from twice daily to once a week.
[00113]          Antibodies specifically binding a flavivirus protein or a fragment thereof of
the invention, as well as other molecules identified by the screening assays disclosed herein,
can be administered for the treatment of a flavivirus -related disorders in the form of
pharmaceutical compositions. Principles and considerations involved in preparing such
                                                 25

compositions, as well as guidance in the choice of components are provided, for example, in
Remington: The Science And Practice Of Pharmacy 19th ed. (Alfonso R. Gennaro, et al.,
editors) Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa., 1995; Drug Absorption Enhancement: Concepts,
Possibilities, Limitations, And Trends, Harwood Academic Publishers, Langhorne, Pa.,
 1994; and Peptide And Protein Drug Delivery (Advances In Parenteral Sciences, Vol. 4),
 1991, M. Dekker, New York.
[00114]          In the embodiments of the present invention, antibody fragments are not
preferred, specifically antibody fragments lacking an Fc region. Peptide molecules can be
designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be
synthesized chemically and/or produced by recombinant DNA technology. (See, e.g.,
Marasco et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 7889-7893 (1993)). The formulation can
also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being
treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each
other. Alternatively, or in addition, the composition can comprise an agent that enhances its
function, such as, for example, a cytotoxic agent, cytokine, chemotherapeutic agent, or
growth-inhibitory agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts
that are effective for the purpose intended.
[00115]          The active ingredients can also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for
example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example,
hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacrylate)
microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes,
albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles, and nanocapsules) or in
macroemulsions.
[00116]          The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This
is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.
[00117]          Sustained-release preparations can be prepared. Suitable examples of
sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic
polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g.,
films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters,
hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)),
polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and y
ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic
acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT m (injectable microspheres composed of
lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and
                                                26

poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic
acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release
proteins for shorter time periods.
[001181          An antibody according to the invention can be used as an agent for detecting
the presence of a flavivirus (or a protein or a protein fragment thereof) in a sample.
Preferably, the antibody contains a detectable label. Antibodies can be polyclonal, or more
preferably, monoclonal. An intact antibody is preferred. The term "labeled", with regard to
the probe or antibody, is intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by
coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance to the probe or antibody, as well as
indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with another reagent that is directly
labeled. Examples of indirect labeling include detection of a primary antibody using a
fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody and end-labeling of a DNA probe with biotin such
that it can be detected with fluorescently-labeled streptavidin. The term "biological sample"
is intended to include tissues, cells and biological fluids isolated from a subject, as well as
tissues, cells and fluids present within a subject. Included within the usage of the term
"biological sample", therefore, is blood and a fraction or component of blood including
blood serum, blood plasma, or lymph. That is, the detection method of the invention can be
used to detect an analyte mRNA, protein, or genomic DNA in a biological sample in vitro
as well as in vivo. For example, in vitro techniques for detection of an analyte mRNA
include Northern hybridizations and in situ hybridizations. In vitro techniques for detection
of an analyte protein include enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), Western
blots, immunoprecipitations, and immunofluorescence. In vitro techniques for detection of
an analyte genomic DNA include Southern hybridizations. Procedures for conducting
immunoassays are described, for example in "ELISA: Theory and Practice: Methods in
Molecular Biology", Vol. 42, J. R. Crowther (Ed.) Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 1995;
"Immunoassay", E. Diamandis and T. Christopoulus, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA,
 1996; and "Practice and Theory of Enzyme Immunoassays", P. Tijssen, Elsevier Science
Publishers, Amsterdam, 1985. Furthermore, in vivo techniques for detection of an analyte
protein include introducing into a subject a labeled anti-analyte protein antibody. For
example, the antibody can be labeled with a radioactive marker whose presence and
location in a subject can be detected by standard imaging techniques.
[00119]          Pharmaceutical compositions
[00120]          The antibodies or agents of the invention (also referred to herein as "active
compounds"), and derivatives, fragments, analogs and homologs thereof, can be
                                                27

incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such
compositions typically comprise the antibody or agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier. As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is intended to
include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents,
isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical
administration. Suitable carriers are described in the most recent edition of Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences, a standard reference text in the field, which is incorporated herein
by reference. Preferred examples of such carriers or diluents include, but are not limited to,
water, saline, ringer's solutions, dextrose solution, and 5% human serum albumin.
Liposomes and non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils may also be used. The use of such
media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except
insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use
thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be
incorporated into the compositions.
[00121]         A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be
compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration
include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation),
transdermal (i.e., topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions
used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following
components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils,
polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial
agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or
sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers
such as acetates, citrates or phosphates, and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as
sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as
hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in
ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.
[00122]         Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile
aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the
extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous
administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water,
Cremophor ELTM (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases,
the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability
                                               28

exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be
preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.
The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol,
polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the
like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by
the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the
case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms
can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,
chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be
preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol,
sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable
compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays
absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
[00123]           Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active
compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of
ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally,
dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that
contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those
enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable
solutions, methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder
of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously
sterile-filtered solution thereof.
[00124]           Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier.
They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral
therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and
used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared
using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is
applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible
binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The
tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or
compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth
or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid,
Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such
                                                  29

as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring
agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.
[00125]          For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of
an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant,
e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.
[00126]          Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means.
For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be
permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and
include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid
derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal
sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are
formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.
[00127]          The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with
conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention
enemas for rectal delivery.
[00128]          In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that
will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled
release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems.
Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate,
polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods
for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The
materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected
cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in
the art, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811.
[00129]          It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in
dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as
used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be
treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to
produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical
carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and
directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular
                                                30

therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding
such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.
[001301         The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or
dispenser together with instructions for administration.
[001311         Screening Methods
[00132]         The invention provides methods (also referred to herein as "screening
assays") for identifying modulators, i.e., candidate or test compounds or agents (e.g.,
peptides, peptidomimetics, small molecules or other drugs) that modulate or otherwise
interfere with the fusion of an flavivirus to the cell membrane. Also provided are methods
of identifying compounds useful to treat flavivirus infection. The invention also
encompasses compounds identified using the screening assays described herein.
[001331         For example, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test
compounds which modulate the interaction between the flavivirus and the cell membrane.
The test compounds of the invention can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches
in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: biological libraries; spatially
addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods
requiring deconvolution; the "one-bead one-compound" library method; and synthetic
library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library approach is
limited to peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide,
non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds. (See, e.g., Lam, 1997.
Anticancer Drug Design 12: 145).
[00134]         A "small molecule" as used herein, is meant to refer to a composition that
has a molecular weight of less than about 5 kD and most preferably less than about 4 kD.
Small molecules can be, e.g., nucleic acids, peptides, polypeptides, peptidomimetics,
carbohydrates, lipids or other organic or inorganic molecules. Libraries of chemical and/or
biological mixtures, such as fungal, bacterial, or algal extracts, are known in the art and can
be screened with any of the assays of the invention.
[00135]         Examples of methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in
the art, for example in: DeWitt, et al., 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90: 6909; Erb, et
al., 1994. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91: 11422; Zuckermann, et al., 1994. J. Med. Chem.
37: 2678; Cho, et al., 1993. Science 261: 1303; Carrell, et al., 1994. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.
Engl. 33: 2059; Carell, et al., 1994. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 33: 2061; and Gallop, et
al., 1994. J. Med. Chem. 37: 1233.
                                                31

[001361          Libraries of compounds may be presented in solution (see e.g., Houghten,
 1992. Biotechniques 13: 412-421), or on beads (see Lam, 1991. Nature 354: 82-84), on
chips (see Fodor, 1993. Nature 364: 555-556), bacteria (see U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409),
spores (see U.S. Patent 5,233,409), plasmids (see Cull, et al., 1992. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA 89: 1865-1869) or on phage (see Scott and Smith, 1990. Science 249: 386-390;
Devlin, 1990. Science 249: 404-406; Cwirla, et al., 1990. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87:
6378-6382; Felici, 1991. J. Mol. Biol. 222: 301-310; and U.S. Patent No. 5,233,409.).
[00137]          In one embodiment, a candidate compound is introduced to an antibody
antigen complex and determining whether the candidate compound disrupts the antibody
antigen complex, wherein a disruption of this complex indicates that the candidate
compound modulates the interaction between a flavivirus and the cell membrane. For
example, the antibody may be monoclonal antibody mAb 11, mAb 11 -LALA, or any variant
thereof, and the antigen may be located on an envelope protein of a flavivirus (i.e., West
Nile virus protein E).
[001381          In another embodiment, at least one flavivirus envelope protein is provided,
which is exposed to at least one neutralizing monoclonal antibody. Formation of an
antibody-antigen complex is detected, and one or more candidate compounds are introduced
to the complex. If the antibody-antigen complex is disrupted following introduction of the
one or more candidate compounds, the candidate compounds is useful to treat a flavivirus
related disease or disorder, e.g. Dengue fever. For example, the at least one flavivirus
protein may be provided as a flavivirus molecule.
[001391          Determining the ability of the test compound to interfere with or disrupt the
antibody-antigen complex can be accomplished, for example, by coupling the test
compound with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the test compound to
the antigen or biologically-active portion thereof can be determined by detecting the labeled
compound in a complex. For example, test compounds can be labeled with "'I, "S, "C, or
3 H, either directly or indirectly, and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of
radioemission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively, test compounds can be
enzymatically-labeled with, for example, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or
luciferase, and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an
appropriate substrate to product.
[00140]          In one embodiment, the assay comprises contacting an antibody-antigen
complex with a test compound, and determining the ability of the test compound to interact
with the antigen or otherwise disrupt the existing antibody-antigen complex. In this
                                                 32

embodiment, determining the ability of the test compound to interact with the antigen
and/or disrupt the antibody-antigen complex comprises determining the ability of the test
compound to preferentially bind to the antigen or a biologically-active portion thereof, as
compared to the antibody.
[00141]         In another embodiment, the assay comprises contacting an antibody-antigen
complex with a test compound and determining the ability of the test compound to modulate
the antibody-antigen complex. Determining the ability of the test compound to modulate
the antibody-antigen complex can be accomplished, for example, by determining the ability
of the antigen to bind to or interact with the antibody, in the presence of the test compound.
[00142]         Those skilled in the art will recognize that, in any of the screening methods
disclosed herein, the antibody may be a flavivirus neutralizing antibody, such as
monoclonal antibody Ab- 11 or any variant thereof wherein the Fc region is modified such
that it has reduced binding or does not bind to the Fc-gamma receptor. Additionally, the
antigen may be a flavivirus envelope protein, or a portion thereof.
[00143]         The screening methods disclosed herein may be performed as a cell-based
assay or as a cell-free assay. The cell-free assays of the invention are amenable to use of
both the soluble form or the membrane-bound form of the proteins and fragments thereof.
In the case of cell-free assays comprising the membrane-bound forms of the proteins, it may
be desirable to utilize a solubilizing agent such that the membrane-bound form of the
proteins are maintained in solution. Examples of such solubilizing agents include non-ionic
detergents such as n-octylglucoside, n-dodecylglucoside, n-dodecylmaltoside,
octanoyl-N-methylglucamide, decanoyl-N-methylglucamide, Triton X- 100, Triton
X- 114, Thesit*, Isotridecypoly(ethylene glycol ether),
N-dodecyl--N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio- 1-propane sulfonate, 3-(3-cholamidopropyl)
dimethylamminiol- 1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS), or
3-(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamminiol-2-hydroxy-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPSO).
[00144]         In more than one embodiment, it may be desirable to immobilize either the
antibody or the antigen to facilitate separation of complexed from uncomplexed forms of
one or both following introduction of the candidate compound, as well as to accommodate
automation of the assay. Observation of the antibody-antigen complex in the presence and
absence of a candidate compound, can be accomplished in any vessel suitable for containing
the reactants. Examples of such vessels include microtiter plates, test tubes, and
micro-centrifuge tubes. In one embodiment, a fusion protein can be provided that adds a
domain that allows one or both of the proteins to be bound to a matrix. For example,
                                                33

GST-antibody fusion proteins or GST-antigen fusion proteins can be adsorbed onto
glutathione sepharose beads (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) or glutathione derivatized
microtiter plates, that are then combined with the test compound, and the mixture is
incubated under conditions conducive to complex formation (e.g., at physiological
conditions for salt and pH). Following incubation, the beads or microtiter plate wells are
washed to remove any unbound components, the matrix immobilized in the case of beads,
complex determined either directly or indirectly. Alternatively, the complexes can be
dissociated from the matrix, and the level of antibody-antigen complex formation can be
determined using standard techniques.
[00145]         Other techniques for immobilizing proteins on matrices can also be used in
the screening assays of the invention. For example, either the antibody or the antigen (e.g.
the can be immobilized utilizing conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Biotinylated
antibody or antigen molecules can be prepared from biotin-NHS (N-hydroxy-succinimide)
using techniques well-known within the art (e.g., biotinylation kit, Pierce Chemicals,
Rockford, Ill.), and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin-coated 96 well plates (Pierce
Chemical). Alternatively, other antibodies reactive with the antibody or antigen of interest,
but which do not interfere with the formation of the antibody-antigen complex of interest,
can be derivatized to the wells of the plate, and unbound antibody or antigen trapped in the
wells by antibody conjugation. Methods for detecting such complexes, in addition to those
described above for the GST-immobilized complexes, include immunodetection of
complexes using such other antibodies reactive with the antibody or antigen.
[00146]         The invention further pertains to novel agents identified by any of the
aforementioned screening assays and uses thereof for treatments as described herein.
[00147]         Diagnostic Assays
[00148]         Antibodies of the present invention can be detected by appropriate assays,
e.g., conventional types of immunoassays. For example, an assay can be performed in
which a flavivirus envelope protein (e.g., West Nile virus protein E) or fragment thereof is
affixed to a solid phase. Incubation is maintained for a sufficient period of time to allow the
antibody in the sample to bind to the immobilized polypeptide on the solid phase. After this
first incubation, the solid phase is separated from the sample. The solid phase is washed to
remove unbound materials and interfering substances such as non-specific proteins which
may also be present in the sample. The solid phase containing the antibody of interest bound
to the immobilized polypeptide is subsequently incubated with a second, labeled antibody or
antibody bound to a coupling agent such as biotin or avidin. This second antibody may be
                                                34

another anti-flavivirus antibody or another antibody. Labels for antibodies are well-known
in the art and include radionuclides, enzymes (e.g. maleate dehydrogenase, horseradish
peroxidase, glucose oxidase, catalase), fluors (fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine,
phycocyanin, fluorescarmine), biotin, and the like. The labeled antibodies are incubated
with the solid and the label bound to the solid phase is measured. These and other
immunoassays can be easily performed by those of ordinary skill in the art.
[00149]         An exemplary method for detecting the presence or absence of a flavivirus
(in a biological sample involves obtaining a biological sample from a test subject and
contacting the biological sample with a labeled monoclonal antibody according to the
invention such that the presence of the flavivirus is detected in the biological sample.
[00150]         As used herein, the term "labeled", with regard to the probe or antibody, is
intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by coupling (i.e., physically
linking) a detectable substance to the probe or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the
probe or antibody by reactivity with another reagent that is directly labeled. Examples of
indirect labeling include detection of a primary antibody using a fluorescently-labeled
secondary antibody and end-labeling of a DNA probe with biotin such that it can be
detected with fluorescently-labeled streptavidin. The term "biological sample" is intended
to include tissues, cells and biological fluids isolated from a subject, as well as tissues, cells
and fluids present within a subject. That is, the detection method of the invention can be
used to detect an flavivirus in a biological sample in vitro as well as in vivo. For example,
in vitro techniques for detection of a flavivirus include enzyme linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISAs), Western blots, immunoprecipitations, and immunofluorescence.
Furthermore, in vivo techniques for detection of a flavivirus include introducing into a
subject a labeled anti-flavivirus antibody. For example, the antibody can be labeled with a
radioactive marker whose presence and location in a subject can be detected by standard
imaging techniques.
[00151]         In one embodiment, the biological sample contains protein molecules from
the test subject. One preferred biological sample is a peripheral blood leukocyte sample
isolated by conventional means from a subject.
[00152]         The invention also encompasses kits for detecting the presence of a flavivirus
in a biological sample. For example, the kit can comprise: a labeled compound or agent
capable of detecting a flavivirus (e.g., an anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody) in a
biological sample; means for determining the amount of a flavivirus in the sample; and

                                                35

compound or agent can be packaged in a suitable container. The kit can further comprise
instructions for using the kit to detect a flavivirus in a sample.
[00153]         Passive Immunization
[00154]         Passive immunization has proven to be an effective and safe strategy for the
prevention and treatment of viral diseases. (See Keller et al., Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 13:602
 14 (2000); Casadevall, Nat. Biotechnol. 20:114 (2002); Shibata et al., Nat. Med. 5:204-10
(1999); and Igarashi et al., Nat. Med. 5:211-16 (1999), each of which are incorporated
herein by reference)). Passive immunization using neutralizing human monoclonal
antibodies could provide an immediate treatment strategy for emergency prophylaxis and
treatment of flavivirus infection and related diseases and disorders while the alternative and
more time-consuming development of vaccines and new drugs in underway.
[00155]         Subunit vaccines potentially offer significant advantages over conventional
immunogens. They avoid the safety hazards inherent in production, distribution, and
delivery of conventional killed or attenuated whole-pathogen vaccines. Furthermore, they
can be rationally designed to include only confirmed protective epitopes, thereby avoiding
suppressive T epitopes (see Steward et al., J. Virol. 69:7668 (1995)) or immunodominant B
epitopes that subvert the immune system by inducing futile, non-protective responses (e.g.
"decoy" epitopes). (See Garrity et al., J. Immunol. 159:279 (1997)).
[00156]         Moreover, those skilled in the art will recognize that good correlation exists
between the antibody neutralizing activity in vitro and the protection in vivo for many
different viruses, challenge routes, and animal models. (See Burton, Natl. Rev. Immunol.
2:706-13 (2002); Parren et al., Adv. Immunol. 77:195-262 (2001)). The data presented
herein demonstrate that the mAb-1 1 human monoclonal antibody and other mAb variants
can be further developed and tested in in vivo animal studies to determine its clinical utility
as a potent ADE inhibitor for prophylaxis and treatment of flavivirus infection and related
diseases and disorders.
[00157]         Antigen-Ig chimeras in vaccination
[00158]         It has been over a decade since the first antibodies were used as scaffolds for
the efficient presentation of antigenic determinants to the immune systems. (See Zanetti,
Nature 355:476-77 (1992); Zaghouani et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:631-35 (1995)).
When a peptide is included as an integral part of an IgG molecule (e.g., the 11 A or 256
IgGI monoclonal antibody described herein), the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the
peptide epitopes are greatly enhanced as compared to the free peptide. Such enhancement is
                                                 36

possibly due to the antigen-IgG chimeras longer half-life, better presentation and
constrained conformation, which mimic their native structures.
[00159]         Moreover, an added advantage of using an antigen-Ig chimera is that either
the variable or the Fc region of the antigen-Ig chimera can be used for targeting professional
antigen-presenting cells (APCs). To date, recombinant Igs have been generated in which
the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the heavy chain variable gene (VH) are
replaced with various antigenic peptides recognized by B or T cells. Such antigen-Ig
chimeras have been used to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. (See Bona
et al., Immunol. Today 19:126-33 (1998)).
[00160]         Chimeras with specific epitopes engrafted into the CDR3 loop have been
used to induce humoral responses to either HIV-1 gp120 V3-loop or the first extracellular
domain (D1) of human CD4 receptor. (See Lanza et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
90:11683-87 (1993); Zaghouani et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:631-35 (1995)). The
immune sera were able to prevent infection of CD4 SupT 1 cells by HIV- 1MN (anti-gp 120
V3C) or inhibit syncytia formation (anti-CD4-D 1). The CDR2 and CDR3 can be replaced
with peptide epitopes simultaneously, and the length of peptide inserted can be up to 19
amino acids long.
[001611         Alternatively, one group has developed a "troybody" strategy in which
peptide antigens are presented in the loops of the Ig constant (C) region and the variable
region of the chimera can be used to target IgD on the surface of B-cells or MHC class II
molecules on professional APCs including B-cells, dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages.
(See Lunde et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans. 30:500-6 (2002)).
[00162]         An antigen-Ig chimera can also be made by directly fusing the antigen with
the Fc portion of an IgG molecule. You et al., Cancer Res. 61:3704-11 (2001) were able to
obtain all arms of specific immune response, including very high levels of antibodies to
hepatitis B virus core antigen using this method.
[001631         DNA vaccination
[00164]         DNA vaccines are stable, can provide the antigen an opportunity to be
naturally processed, and can induce a longer-lasting response. Although a very attractive
immunization strategy, DNA vaccines often have very limited potency to induce immune
responses. Poor uptake of injected DNA by professional APCs, such as dendritic cells
(DCs), may be the main cause of such limitation. Combined with the antigen-Ig chimera
vaccines, a promising new DNA vaccine strategy based on the enhancement of APC antigen
presentation has been reported (see Casares, et al., Viral Immunol. 10:129-36 (1997);
                                               37

Gerloni et al., Nat. Biotech. 15:876-81 (1997); Gerloni et al., DNA Cell Biol. 16:611-25
(1997); You et al., Cancer Res. 61:3704-11 (2001)), which takes advantage of the presence
of Fc receptors (FcyRs) on the surface of DCs.
[00165]         It is possible to generate a DNA vaccine encoding an antigen (Ag)-Ig
chimera. Upon immunization, Ag-Ig fusion proteins will be expressed and secreted by the
cells taking up the DNA molecules. The secreted Ag-Ig fusion proteins, while inducing B
cell responses, can be captured and internalized by interaction of the Fc fragment with
FcyRs on DC surface, which will promote efficient antigen presentation and greatly enhance
antigen-specific immune responses. Applying the same principle, DNA encoding antigen-Ig
chimeras carrying a functional anti-MHC II specific scFv region gene can also target the
immunogens to all three types of APCs. The immune responses could be further boosted
with use of the same protein antigens generated in vitro (i.e.,"prime and boost"), if
necessary. Using this strategy, specific cellular and humoral immune responses against
infection of flavivirus were accomplished through intramuscular (i.m.) injection of a DNA
vaccine. (See Casares et al., Viral. Immunol. 10:129-36 (1997)).
[001661         Vaccine compositions
[00167]         Therapeutic or prophylactic compositions are provided herein, which
generally comprise mixtures of one or more monoclonal antibodies or ScFvs and
combinations thereof. The prophylactic vaccines can be used to prevent a flavivirus
infection and the therapeutic vaccines can be used to treat individuals following a flavivirus
infection. Prophylactic uses include the provision of increased antibody titer to a flavivirus
in a vaccination subject. In this manner, subjects at high risk of contracting flavivirus (i.e.,
in subtropical regions where viral-carrying mosquitos thrive) can be provided with passive
immunity to a flavivirus.
[001681         These vaccine compositions can be administered in conjunction with
ancillary immunoregulatory agents. For example, cytokines, lymphokines, and chemokines,
including, but not limited to, IL-2, modified IL-2 (Cys125 -> Ser125), GM-CSF, IL-12, y
interferon, IP-10, MIP13, and RANTES.
[001691         Methods of Immunization
[00170]         The vaccines of the present invention have superior immunoprotective and
immunotherapeutic properties over other anti-viral vaccines.
[00171]         The invention provides a method of immunization, e.g., inducing an immune
response, of a subject. A subject is immunized by administration to the subject a
                                               38

composition containing a membrane fusion protein of a pathogenic enveloped virus. The
fusion protein is coated or embedded in a biologically compatible matrix.
[00172]          The fusion protein is glycosylated, e.g. contains acarbohydrate moiety. The
carbohydrate moiety may be in the form of a monosaccharide, disaccharide(s).
oligosaccharide(s), polysaccharide(s), or their derivatives (e.g. sulfo- or phospho
substituted). The carbohydrate is linear or branched. The carbohydrate moiety is N-linked
or O-linked to a polypeptide. N-linked glycosylation is to the amide nitrogen of asparagine
side chains and O-linked glycosylation is to the hydroxy oxygen of serine and threonine
side chains.
[00173]          The carbohydrate moiety is endogenous to the subject being vaccinated.
Alternatively, the carbohydrate moiety is exogenous to the subject being vaccinated. The
carbohydrate moiety is a carbohydrate moieties that are not typically expressed on
polypeptides of the subject being vaccinated. For example, the carbohydrate moieties are
plant-specific carbohydrates. Plant specific carbohydrate moieties include for example N
linked glycan having a core bound al,3 fucose or a core bound       P 1,2 xylose. Alternatively,
the carbohydrate moiety are carbohydrate moieties that are expressed on polypeptides or
lipids of the subject being vaccinate. For example many host cells have been genetically
engineered to produce human proteins with human-like sugar attachments.
[00174]          For example, the fusion protein is a trimeric hemagglutinin protein.
Optionally, the hemagglutinin protein is produced in a non-mammalian cell such as a plant
cell.
[00175]          The subject is at risk of developing or suffering from a viral infection.
Flavivirus family members include, for example West Nile virus, Dengue virus (serotypes
 1-4), St. Louis encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, or Murray
Valley encephalitis virus. For example, the subject has traveled to regions or countries in
which other flaviviral infections have been reported.
[00176]          The methods described herein lead to a reduction in the severity or the
alleviation of one or more symptoms of a viral infection. Infections are diagnosed and or
monitored, typically by a physician using standard methodologies . A subject requiring
immunization is identified by methods know in the art. For example subjects are
immunized as outlined in the CDC's General Recommendation on Immunization
(51(RR02) pp l-36) Cancer is diagnosed for example by physical exam, biopsy, blood test,
or x-ray.
                                                 39

[001771         The subject is e.g., any mammal, e.g., a human, a primate, mouse, rat, dog,
cat, cow, horse, pig, a fish or a bird.
[00178]         The treatment is administered prior to diagnosis of the infection.
Alternatively, treatment is administered after diagnosis. Efficaciousness of treatment is
determined in association with any known method for diagnosing or treating the particular
disorder or infection. Alleviation of one or more symptoms of the disorder indicates that the
compound confers a clinical benefit.
[00179]         Methods of Treatment
[00180]         The invention provides for both prophylactic and therapeutic methods of
treating a subject at risk of (or susceptible to) a flavivirus-related disease or disorder. Such
diseases or disorders include but are not limited to, e.g., fever, meningitis, encephalitis,
yellow fever, dengue fever.
[00181]         Prophylactic Methods
[00182]         In one aspect, the invention provides methods for preventing a flavivirus
related disease or disorder in a subject by administering to the subject a monoclonal
antibody of the invention or an agent identified according to the methods of the invention.
For example, monoclonal antibody mAb- 11, mAb 11- LALA, and any variants thereof,
wherein the Fc region is modified thereby reducing or abrogating binding to the Fc-gamma
receptor, may be administered in therapeutically effective amounts. Optionally, two or
more anti-flaviviruses antibodies are co-administered.
[001831          Subjects at risk for a flavivirus-related diseases or disorders include patients
who have been exposed to the flavivirus from an infected arthropod (i.e., mosquito or tick).
For example, the subjects have traveled to regions or countries of the world in which other
flavivirus infections have been reported and confirmed. Administration of a prophylactic
agent can occur prior to the manifestation of symptoms characteristic of the flaviviru-related
disease or disorder, such that a disease or disorder is prevented or, alternatively, delayed in
its progression.
[00184]         The appropriate agent can be determined based on screening assays
described herein. Alternatively, or in addition, the agent to be administered is a monoclonal
antibody that neutralizes a flavivirus that has been identified according to the methods of
the invention. In some embodiments, the antibody of the present invention can be
administered with other antibodies or antibody fragments known to neutralize flaviviruses.
Administration of said antibodies can be sequential, concurrent, or alternating.
                                                  40

[001851          Therapeutic Methods
[00186]          Another aspect of the invention pertains to methods of treating a flavivirus
related disease or disorder in a patient. In one embodiment, the method involves
administering an agent (e.g., an agent identified by a screening assay described herein
and/or monoclonal antibody identified according to the methods of the invention), or
combination of agents that neutralize the flavivirus to a patient suffering from the disease or
disorder.
[00187]          Combinatory Methods
[001881          The invention provides treating a flavivirus-related disease or disorder, such
as West Nile fever, meningitis, Dengue fever, yellow fever or encephalitis, in a patient by
administering two or more antibodies, such as mAb 11 -LALA or a variant of mAb 11,
wherein the Fc region of said variant does not bind or has reduced binding to the Fc gamma
receptor, with other flavivirus neutralizing antibodies known in the art, such as mAb 11. In
another embodiment, the invention provides methods for treating a flavivirus-related disease
or disorder in a patient by administering an antibody of the present invention, such as
mAb 11 -LALA or a mAb 11 variant as described herein, with any anti-viral agent known in
the art. Anti-viral agents can be peptides, nucleic acids, small molecules, inhibitors, or
RNAi.
[001891          The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do
not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.
                                          EXAMPLES
[00190]          EXAMPLE 1: PROPHYLAXIS AGAINST LETHAL DENGUE-2 VIRUS INFECTION
IN MICE.
[00191]          Here is described a study examining the prophylactic effect of administration
of the mAb 11 antibody (both wild-type and the mutated form with modified Fc region) in
mice. Forty mice were assessed in this study, and were divided into 5 groups containing 8
mice each. In Group 1, the mice were administered an isotype control IgG control antibody.
Group 2 was administered 250ug/mouse (~-I2.5mg/kg) of wild-type mAb 11. Group 3 was
administered 5Oug/mouse (~2.5mg/kg) of wild-type mAb 11 (wt mAb). Group 4 was
administered 250ug/mouse (~-I2.5mg/kg) of mAb 11 with a LALA mutation in its Fc region
(mut mAb). Group 5 was administered 5Oug/mouse (~2.5mg/kg) of mAb 11 with a LALA
mutation in its Fc region (mut mAb).
                                                41

[001921          After a period of time after administration of the antibody treatment (control,
wildtype mAb 11 or mutant mAb 11), for example, 4 hours or 24 hours, the mice were
injected with a lethal dose of Dengue-2 virus. The mice were then observed daily over 10
days for a variety of factors, such as weight loss, morbidity, and clinical scores that include
appearance (coat and eye appearance), mobility, and attitude (and as illustrated in the table
below).

                                                    Completely unaware or in noticeable distress
Mice were euthanized if they scored at 5 or above and/or when they reached 20% weight
loss.
[001931          Study results were quantified and presented in Figure 3. Specifically, Figure
3A shows the Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating the survival rate of the different groups
of mice. The results show that control antibody and both dosages of wild-type mAb 11 were
not effective at protecting the mice from disease-related death/euthanization. In contrast, all
of the mice receiving either dosage of the mutant mAb 11 of the present invention survived
the lethal dose infection. These results demonstrate the mutant mAb 11 has prophylactic
efficacy for flaviviral infection, especially compared to the wild-type antibody.
[001941          When comparing percent weight loss from before infection (Figure 3B),
animals administered mutant mAb 11 lost less weight than animals administered control
                                                 42

antibody or wild-type mAb 11 lost weight over the course of the study. The clinical score
analysis combine other qualitative observations regarding the appearance and attitude of the
subjects to score the degree of observed health of the animals. As shown in Figure 3C, the
health of the animals receiving control or wild-type mAb 11 quickly declined (clinical score
numbers increased to above 4), while the animals that received the mutant mAb 11 remained
healthy, alert, and mobile even after 10 days of infection.
[00195]          Taken together, all of these results indicate that the mutant mAb 11
effectively prevented flaviviral infection-associated death, delayed progression of the
symptoms of the disease, and had an overall prophylactic effect on mice infected with
Dengue virus.
[00196]          EXAMPLE 2: COMPARISON BETWEEN ANTIBODIES DERIVED FROM
MAMMALIAN CELLS AND PLANT CELLS
[00197]          As described herein, the antibodies of the present invention can be produced
in transgenic plants. Other studies have shown that humanized antibodies suitable for
administration for treatment in humans have been successfully produced in plants.
Moreover, therapeutic antibody production in plants is an inexpensive and efficient
alternative to antibody production in mammalian cells, and moreover, lacks animal
pathogenic contaminants. To examine the efficacy of the mAb 11 antibody of the present
invention (containing the LALA mutation in the Fc region; mutAb) the antibodies produced
from mammalian expression system and from plant (tobacco plant) were compared in vivo.
[00198]          A129 mice were used for in this study. A129 mice lack IFN a/p receptors,
which are required for restricting viral replication in the central nervous system. A129 mice
represent the most stringent model in the field for recapitulating human disease with regard
to flaviviral infection. A129 mice infected with 1 PFU (plaque forming units) of Dengue
virus causes paralysis. (Prestwood et al., J. Virol, 2012,
[00199]          Forty-five mice were assessed in this study, and were divided into 5 groups
containing 9 mice each. In Group 1, the mice were administered a control IgG antibody.
The control antibody used was Z-MAB (Zero-binding monoclonal antibody; AB
Biosciences). Group 2 was administered 250ug/mouse (-12.5mg/kg) of mAb 11 with a
LALA mutation in its Fc region (mut mAb) produced in a mammalian expression system
(mutAb mammalian). Group 3 was administered 50ug/mouse (~2.5mg/kg) of mutant
mAb 11 produced in a mammalian expression system. Group 4 was administered
250ug/mouse (~12.5mg/kg) of mutant mAb produced in a plant expression system (mutAb
                                                43

plant). Group 5 was administered 5Oug/mouse (~2.5mg/kg) of mutant mAb 11 produced in a
plant expression system.
[00200]          Mice were administered in the dosages of antibody as described above, then
challenged with a lethal dose of Dengue virus. The mice were then observed daily over 20
days for a variety of factors, such as weight loss, morbidity, and clinical scores that include
appearance (coat and eye appearance), mobility, and attitude (as described in Table 1).
[00201]          The results of these studies are summarized in Figures 4, 5 and 6. Figure 5
shows the overall survival of mice. Both doses of mutant mAb 11 produced from
mammalian systems demonstrated protective effect against viral infection, compared to
control (Figure 4A). Similar to the results shown in Example 1 and Figure 3, all mice
administered the mutAb antibody survived beyond day 10 of the study. Both doses of
mutAb from plant also demonstrated protective effect, as shown in Figure B. Comparison
between the two mutAb from mammalian and plant is shown in Figure 3, which shows that
the mutAb from plants were just as effective, if not more so, in protecting the mice from
disease progression and death.
[00202]          Figure 5 shows the percent weight loss in animals over the course of the
study. Both mutAb mammalian and mutAb plant antibodies both protected mice from
weight loss in comparison to the control antibody (Figures 5B and 5C). Comparison
between mammalian and plant-derived mutAb showed no significant difference between
weight loss as a result of the antibody production method (Figure 5A).
[00203]          Figure 6 shows the clinical scores of the animals over the course of the study.
Administration of mutAb mammalian and mutAb plant antibodies protected mice from
progression or severity of symptoms compared to control antibody (Figures 6B and 6C).
Comparison between mammalian and plant-derived mutAb showed that the two antibodies
performed similarly, with the mice receiving the higher dosage of plant-derived mutAb
(250ug) showing slightly better overall health as measured by the clinical scores (Figure
6A).
  [00204]         Taken together, these results show that production of the mutant antibodies
    of the present invention were just as effective at protection and reducing severity of the
  disease as the antibodies produced by standard mammalian expression systems. For some
 of the measured parameters, particularly at high doses of the mutAb plant-derived antibody,
     the plant-derived antibodies showed to have a slightly increased therapeutic effect in
                                                 44

   comparison to the mammalian-derived antibodies. Thus, plant-derived antibodies of the
  present invention would be useful for the protection and treatment of flaviviral infection.
