                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [00021 The present invention is directed to the use of a mixture of Bacillus strain concentrates to
 inhibit the activities and growth of plant pathogens.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 [00031 The use of viable microorganisms as root-zone inoculants, particularly beneficial
bacteria, has expanded to include many food crops including fruits, vegetables, root crops and
grains. The emerging science, referred to as probiotics, is based in part on the observation that
certain soils, which contain specific cultures of microorganisms that aggressively colonize root
surfaces, suppress a variety of plant diseases. It is postulated that colonization of root surfaces
with deleterious microorganisms can be prevented by pre-colonization with probiotic
microorganisms, which is referred to as competitive exclusion (CE). Schroth, et al. (1982)
entitled "Disease-Suppressive Soil and Root-Colonizing Bacteria", Science, Vol. 216: 1376
 1381 (1982). In this review, gram-negative Pseudonionasbacterial species were discussed as
being the most effective in CE, and their ability to produce iron-binding compounds (called
"siderophores") was postulated as the potential mode-of-action.
[00041 U.S. Patent No. 5,503,651 discusses plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (referred to
therein as "PGPR"), and in a listing of 41 PGPR bacterial species, 37 of them are PseudomIonas
species and strains. Since strains of these same Pseudomonas species are plant pathogens, and
since plasmid transfer within a bacterial species is commonplace, there is a concern that there
could be transfer of genetic material from a pathogenic strain, to convert a previously harmless
strain into a pathogenic strain. Accordingly, it is preferred to use gram-positive bacteria, such as
Bacillus, and not gram-negative Pseudonionas,for probiotics.
[00051 U.S. Patent No. 4,877,738 discusses a seed inoculum for application to seeds to be
protected fi-om "damping off' fungal plant disease, and this patent also discusses a method of

       WO 2015/023662                                                          PCT/US2014/050710
                                                    2
 protecting growing plants from damping off and root rot fungal plant disease with a similar
 composition. The composition includes a carrier and an effective quantity of protective bacteria,
 including Bacillus cereus ATCC 53522, a mutant of Bacillus cereus ATCC 53522 retaining the
 capability to produce a plant protecting toxin effective against Phytophthora mnegasperma, a
 mixture of such mutants, and a mixture of Bacillus cereus ATCC 53522 and such mutants
 wherein the inoculum is substantially soil-free. There is no indication that testing of any other
 Bacillus species for such purposes had the same effect.
 [00061 U.S. Patent No. 4,952,229 discusses a microbial plant supplement and method for
 increasing plant productivity and quality, which includes a mixture of microbes with various in
 vivo properties. This patent also states that the microbes should be used with certain organic
 acids, and with trace metals and minerals.
 [00071 U.S. Patent No. 4,952,229 describes commercialization hurdles for mixtures of microbial
 strains, because it would be difficult and expensive to insure uniform end-products due to the
 difficulties associated with consistently combining a plurality of microorganisms. Without a
 consistent and uniform end-product, it would be difficult to obtain the regulatory permits
required for sales and marketing of such products. It is indicated to be preferable for a single
strain of a single species is the only active ingredient in a commercial product.
 [0008] U.S. Patent No. 5,441,735 discusses the use of the microorganism Erwina carotovora
subsp. carotovora (E234M403 strain) which has been modified by mutagenesis to eliminate its
soft rot pathology in rice. When applied to rice plants, this modified strain competitively
excludes pathogenic strains of the same species. The disadvantage with this strain is the same as
discussed above with Pseudomonas, i.e., a reversion to pathology is possible since this
microorganism is pathogenic prior to mutation. Also, it is clear that this microorganism is of no
benefit to rice that is not experiencing a soft rot infection.
[00091 U.S. Patent No. 5,157,207 discusses a method of inoculating bacteria into rice by
introducing a bacterial cell into the seed or plant, such bacteria belonging to the species
Calvibacterxyli. This creates a modified rice plant that demonstrates a slight yield improvement
(4.81 kg/ha treated vs. 4.66 kg/ha control). Microbial invasion into rice plant tissue is not
preferred, however, as it raises possible health and regulatory concerns.
[00101 There is a need for new enhancing yields in rice farming beyond those achieved with
modern "high yielding" rice varieties. From 1964 to 1990, irrigated rice field yields in Asia

       WO 2015/023662                                                          PCT/US2014/050710
                                                   3
 increased from 3.0 to 5.8 metric tons/ha. This was largely the result of the introduction of the
 higher yielding IR varieties of rice developed by the International Rice Research Institute in the
 Philippines, starting with IR-8 in 1966. At the time of introduction, IR-8 yielded 10 metric
 tons/ha in the Philippines and up to 14 metric tons/ha in certain temperate regions of China,
 where fewer overcast days resulted in enhanced photosynthesis. Yields from variety IR-8, as
 well as other IR varieties, have decreased at a rate of 0.2 metric tons/ha/yr. Pingali, et al., C.A.B.
 International & International Rice Research Institute (1997), "Asian rice bowls: The returning
 crisis?" New York: CAB International. Yields of 6 metric tons/ha are seldom achieved by Asian
 farmers. New rice varieties are being selected more for disease resistance, shorter photoperiod,
 and grain quality than for yield. It has become generally accepted within the industry that yield
 increases from advances in plant genetics have been effectively maximized, and further increases
can only be achieved by other means. A similar need exists for other crops due to pressures on
the environment and increased demand for food production.
 100111 Tomato-tone@ (plant fertilizer) made by Esporma comprises a fertilizer and Bacillus
species bacteria for use as an organic fertilizer. Serenade@ Garden Disease Control (anti-fungal
spray for plants) contains Bacillus subtilis, a soil-dwelling bacterium that controls leaf blight,
black mold, powdery mildew and many other diseases. However, both products contain
relatively low amounts of Bacillus and are designed for small-scale use.
[00121 Serenade@ (microbial control agent) is a microbial biological control agent comprising
Bacillus subtilis strain QST 713 which protects against fungal and bacterial plant pathogens.
Bacillus subtilis strain QST 713 is a naturally occurring widespread bacterium that can be used
to control plant diseases including blight, scab, gray mold, and several types of mildew.
SERENADE SOIL® (biofungicide) is a fungicide designed to protect young plants against the
effects of soil diseases like Pythiam, Rhizoctonia, Fusarium and Phytophthora.
[0013] Annual crop losses due to pre- and post-harvest fungal diseases exceed $260 Billion
annually. About 15,000 fungal species cause disease in plants. The majority of these fungal
plant pathogens belong to the Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. Gonzilez-Fernandez, et al.
Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology Vol. 2010, Article ID 932527, 26 pages, 2010. Plant
pathogens can have many devastating effects on a variety of commercial crops. Thus there exists
in the art a need for compositions and methods for controlling plant fungal pathogens.

                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 [00341 The current invention develops and applies a new model for biocontrol in which novel
 concentrates comprised of specific combinations of Bacillus strains are used to suppress the
activities and growth of an extremely wide spectrum of fungal plant pathogens while maintaining
compatibility with beneficial plant microbes such as Bradvrhizobium and Trichodernia.
Plant Fungal Pathogens
 [00351 There are five major fungal genera that cause significant losses across the commercial
cash crops. These include:
 [00361 Fusarium: Fusariun is extremely ubiquitous and can survive for long periods in the soil
increasing its ability to cause significant crop loss in corn, soy, wheat, and barley. Fusarium,
infects roots and seeds as well as seedlings and can act as a pathogen complex. The species
Fusariumoxysporum affects a wide variety of hosts of any age. Tomato, tobacco, legumes,
cucurbits, sweet potatoes and banana are a few of the most susceptible plants, but it will also
infect other herbaceous plants. Fusarium oxysporum generally produces symptoms such as
wilting, chlorosis, necrosis, premature leaf drop, browning of the vascular system, stunting, and
damping-off-the killing of newly emerged or emerging seedlings.
[00371 Pythium: Pythium also has a large host range including soy and corn. Pythiun infects
and rots seeds and seedlings and can cause the common crop disease root rot. This pathogen can

greenhouses.

 [0038] Phytophthora: Phytophthora much like Pythium can damage and kill plants throughout
 the growing season. Phytophthora is capable of causing enormous economic losses on crops
 worldwide. Members of the Phytophthora genus are mostly pathogens of dicotyledons, and are
 relatively host-specific parasites of considerable economic importance. Among the plants that
 are commonly infected by Phytophthora are soybeans, potatoes, strawberries, cucumbers, squash
 and oak and alder trees.
 [00391 Rhizoctonia: Rhizoctonia is common in many crops and does the most damage to plant
 seedlings, stunting plant growth leading to significant yield loss. Rhizoctonia solani causes a
 wide range of commercially significant plant diseases. It is one of the fungi responsible for
 Brown patch (a turf grass disease), damping off in seedlings, as well as black scurf of potatoes,
 bare patch of cereals, root rot of sugar beet, belly rot of cucumber, sheath blight of rice, and
 many other pathogenic conditions.
 [00401 Sclerotinia: Sclerotinia-"whitemold"-is commonly destructive in the upper Midwest.
 Lesions develop at stem nodes during or after flowering. Sclerotiniasclerotiorun can also be
known as cottony rot, watery soft rot, stem rot, drop, crown rot and blossom blight. The host
range is over 400 species including major agricultural and horticultural plants; among the most
susceptible hosts are soy, snap beans, and sunflowers.
 100411 Plant fungal pathogens are typically controlled by the application of chemical fungicides
either on the seed, into the soil or by foliar spray. A limited number of commercial biocontrol
agents are in use in the current market, but these are single strains of bacteria primarily targeted
toward a specific fungal pathogen. The approach thus far for developing biological products to
control plant fungal pathogens has been built on and is based on the chemical fungicide model.
The standard approach has been and continues to be to isolate and apply a single strain of
microbe which exhibits specific activity against a narrow list of target plant specific pathogens.
[00421 The present invention applies a new model for biocontrol in which novel concentrates
comprising specific combinations of bacterial strains are used to suppress the activities and
growth of an extremely wide spectrum of fungal plant pathogens, while maintaining
compatibility with beneficial plant microbes such as Bradyrhizobiunand Trichoderna.
[00431 The present invention provides compositions comprising mixtures of bacterial strain
concentrates selected to inhibit the activities and growth of a broad spectrum of plant pathogens
including but not limited to five fungal genera. The compositions of this invention have been

 successfully tested against thirteen fungal species and fifty-nine distinct fungal pathogen isolates,
all of which have been isolated from infected field sites.
 [00441 For the methods described herein, fungal genera and species representative of both the
Ascomycetes and Basidonycetes were used. See Table 1. From the Ascoiycetes the Fusarium
genus (5 species, 23 variant isolates) and the Sclerotinia genus (1 species, 4 variant isolates)
were used. From the Basidionycetes the Rhizoctonia genus (1 species, 15 variant isolates), the
Phytophthoragenus (2 species, 10 variant isolates) and the Pythiun genus (4 species, 7 variant
isolates) were used. These 5 genera comprised of 13 species encompassing 59 different variant
isolates is representative of fungal pathogens that infect essentially all plants of commercial
importance.
[00451 Another characteristic of this invention is that the selected antifungal strains all secrete
agar-diffusible anti-fungal metabolites, as demonstrated by a distinct no-growth zone
surrounding the Bacillus growth colony. No cell to cell contact of the Bacillus cells with the
pathogen is necessary for the suppression of the fungal pathogen activity or growth.
10046] The bacterial strains described herein may be used to inhibit the growth and/or activity of
fungal plant pathogens. For example, the Bacillus strain compositions may be used in methods
of inhibiting the growth and/or activity of Fusariumspecies, including but not limited to
Fusariunm graminearmn, Fusariumn oxysporumn, Fusarium solani, Fusarumn verticilliodes, and

 [0047] The bacterial strains of this invention show a high level of inhibition of a broad spectrum
of plant pathogens comprising five different fungal genera, thirteen different species and isolates
of these fifteen species of pathogenic fungi from fifty-nine different infected field sites. These
bacterial strains are combined in complementary ways such that substantially all of the selected
virulent plant pathogens are inhibited by the bacterial concentrate. The bacterial strains
described herein do not inhibit the growth of beneficial rhizosphere microbes such as
Bradyrhizobiun which is key to symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes and Trichoderma which
is a known endophytic beneficial soil fungus.
Benefits of Bradyrhizobium and Trichoderma to soil/plant health
[0048] Bradyrhizobium is a soil bacterium belonging to the larger bacterial group Rhizobia
which fixes nitrogen inside the root nodules of legumes such soy, peas, and beans. This
symbiotic relationship between bacteria and plant is critical because plants cannot readily utilize
atmospheric nitrogen and Rhizobia cannot fix nitrogen independently of a plant host. Adding
further importance to this relationship, Rhizobia are the only known nitrogen-fixing bacteria able
to establish a symbiotic relationship with legume nodules. Overall, the increased root nodules
and useable nitrogen source increase the total plant yield. Because the overuse of nitrogen
containing fertilizers poses a significant environmental threat, the need for nitrogen-fixing
Rhizobitn has become increasingly more important.

  [0049] Like Rhizobia, Trichoderma species are plant symbionts whose presence also increase
 total plant productivity. This increase in plant productivity is due, at least in part, to increased
 root growth and induced systemic resistance in the presence of Trichoderia. Harman, et al.

 Bacillus Microbes
  [00501 Rich, fertile, biologically active soil contains many diverse species of microorganisms
 which are essential to plant growth and vigor. Among the most common naturally occurring soil
 microbes are members of the Bacillus genus. Bacillus are a diverse group of bacteria which can
 grow aerobically (need air) or facultatively (can grow in presence or absence of air). Bacillus are
 all capable of entering a dormant state by sporulation (forming spores). Dormant spores can be
 thought of as "bacterial seeds" except that unlike plants, the Bacillus becomes the spore not as
 part of the regular succession of stages in their life cycle but rather in response to stress, which in
 the soil is most commonly due to nutrient limitation, drought, or temperature extremes.
 [00511 Compositions according to the present invention contain bacteria which are Gram
 positive, aerobic or facultatively aerobic, spore-forming rods. These bacteria will be referred to
 as, "Bacillus," although recent taxonomy has expanded the classification to identify some of the
 species as belonging to the genera Brevibacillusor Paenibacillus(See Table 2); however the
 term "Bacillus" as used in this application should be understood to include all three genera.
Bacillus, which are the subject of the present invention, are added to the soil as soil or seed
 inoculants. Bacillus spores are in essence encapsulated naturally. In addition to having a stable
shelf life in product form, the Bacillus spores will lie dormant in the soil or on the seed until
physical conditions (temperature, moisture, nutrient levels) become favorable to seed
germination, at which time the spores will also germinate and grow in the rhizosphere (the soil
surrounding the emerging plant roots).
 [00521 As the plant grows, Bacillus vegetative cells, which are progeny of the germinated
spores, will grow and propagate in the root zone, exerting their many unique properties in the
soil and in interaction with the plant roots. If adverse conditions arise in the soil, such as
drought, the Bacillus are capable of re-sporulation, followed by re-germination when conditions
return to favorable. This ensures that the spore-forming Bacillus will have an extended presence
in the root zone through the growing season. Non-spore forming soil microbes such as

                                                  14
 Actinomyces and Pseudomonas cannot form spores and thus may not survive transient adverse
 soil conditions. See also U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/004528.
 [00531 The Bacillus of the current invention can be used in combination with other beneficial
 soil microorganisms, including but not limited to symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria of the
 Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobiun genera, free living beneficial soil bacteria of the Actinomyces
 and Streptomyces genera, beneficial filamentous fungi of the Trichoderma genus, and
Micorrhizalfungi of the Glomus genus.
 [0054] The inventors surprisingly found that the use of a suitable mixture of Bacillus strains
 alone could produce anti-fungal activities and increased growth of plants in the absence of any
 chemical fertilizers.

[00581 A composition may comprise at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 x 1010 colony
forming units per mL (CFU/mL). A colony forming unit (CFU) is an estimation of the total
population of viable cells (bacterial or fungal) capable of growing and replicating giving rise to a
single colony. This estimation is based upon the assumption a single cell (or spore) gives rise to a
single colony-thus a colony forming unit. Because spores will germinate, grow, and replicate
on solid media, CFUs can be an estimate of viable cell or spores. CFUs in the total population
may be estimated by serially diluting the given culture or solution and evenly spreading a single
dilution on a solid complex medium such as Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) and incubating at 37'C
overnight. The number of colonies which grow overnight multiplied by the total dilution factor
will give the number of CFUs/mL, an estimate of the number of viable spores and/or cells/mL.
Spore estimates may be done in the same protocol with the added step of holding the dilution at
80'C for 5 minutes before spreading on solid media; this step ensures all vegetative cells are

 incubation. Where a composition comprises more than one Bacillus strain, the same protocol
 may be used, and the concentration of individual strains may be determined from their distinct
 and differentiable colony morphology.
 [0059] The CFU/ml of each Bacillus strain in the formulated Bacillus strain concentrates can
 vary from I x 103 CFU/ml up to 1 x       1012 CFU/ml. The dose of each Bacillus strain in the
Bacillus strain concentrates, when applied to soil or seed, should be such that the concentration
 in the Rhizosphere (root zone) near the seed is a minimum per Bacillus strain of 1 x 103
 CFU/gram of soil with a range of I      x 103 CFU/gram soil up to 1 x 101 /gram soil. For seed
coating applications the minimum dose of each Bacillus strain in the Bacillus strain concentrates
should be a minimum of I x 103 CFU/sced with a range of I         x 103 CFU/seed up to 1 x 1010
CFU/seed. The total number of CFU in the product, in the Rhizosphere, and/or on the seed will
be the sum of the CFU for each strain present.

 100641 The CFU/ml or gm of the formulated Bacillus strain concentrates can vary from I x 10
 CFU/ml or /gm up to 1 x    1012 CFU/ml or /gm. The dose of the Bacillus strain concentrates when
 applied to soil or seed should be such that the concentration in the Rhizosphere (root zone) near
 the seed is a minimum per Bacillus strain of I x 10 CFU/gm of soil with a range of 1 x 103
 CFU/gm soil up to I x 10"/gm soil.
 [00651 For seed coating applications the minimum dose of the Bacillus strain concentrates
should be a minimum of I x 103 CFU/seed with a range of I x 103 CFU/seed up to I x 1010
CFU/seed.
Preparing a Spore Suspension
 [00661 The CFUs in the compositions of this invention are obtainable by growing cells of the
respective Bacillus strains in liquid monoculture using well-known techniques for bacterial
culture. The cells are grown to high density to induce sporulation. Suitable microbiological
media for the cultivation of Bacillus strain spores include Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and
Schaeffer's Sporulation Medium, as discussed in Biology ofBacilli (Doi, et al. Butterworth
Heinemann, 1992). In one embodiment, the medium of choice is prepared in baffled Erlenmeyer
flasks and sterilized at 121 C under 15 psig for 30 minutes, or until rendered sterile. One may
under fill the Erlenmeyer flasks to optimize aeration during shaking; 200 ml of medium works

      WO 2015/023662                                                            PCT/US2014/050710
                                                   19
 well in a 4 liter Erlenmeyer flask. The flask may be fitted with a sterile filter cap that allows the
 contents to breadth without becoming contaminated. The sterile medium is inoculated from a
 slant culture on tryptic soy agar, preferably by having a slant medium with good colony growth
 melted and poured into the Erlenmeyer flask. The inoculated medium is then shaken on a rotary
 orbital shaker at 100-200 rpm and incubated at 320 C for 48 hours. Thus prepared, the Bacillus
 strains may be 90% sporulated by 48 hours. If vegetative cells are required, a sample thereof can
 be taken from the suspension at 18-24 hours after inoculation. Typically, when using TSB as the
 medium, a viable spore count of about 108/mL will be reached within 48 hours.
 [00671 The resulting spore suspension, without further preparation, can be applied to rice or
other grain plants. If the spore suspension is not used within one week of preparation, it may be
refrigerated at 5'C to preserve it for later use, such spore suspensions refrigerated at 5' C have a
half-life of about two months when prepared according the above procedure. The spores may be
isolated by spray drying. The dried spores may be stored at room temperature (e.g., about 25C).
Protocolfor generation of spores
 [0068] In an alternative embodiment, suitable microbiological media for the cultivation of
Bacillus spores include complex media supplemented with glucose (carbon source) and
glutamate (nitrogen source). In one embodiment, the medium of choice is prepared in baffled
Erlenmeyer flasks and sterilized at about 121PC under 15 psig for 30 minutes, or until rendered
sterile. One may under fill the Erlenmeyer flasks to optimize aeration during shaking; 1 liter of
medium in a 3 liter baffled Erlenmeyer flask works well. The flask may be fitted with a sterile
sponge cap that allows the contents to breathe without becoming contaminated. The sterile
medium is inoculated with a single, well isolated, typical colony from Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA), a
complex solid medium well suited for the propagation of a wide variety of bacteria and fungi.
The inoculated medium is then shaken on a rotary orbital shaker at about 190-250 rpm and
incubated at 37'C for about 24 to 48 hours. Thus prepared, the Bacillus strains may be about
85-95% sporulated by 24 to 48 hours. These spores may be recovered by centrifugation or more
commonly used as a "seed." This "seed" may be used to inoculate large scale production
fermentation vessels filled with similar media. The culture may be fermented under typical
conditions used for growing aerobic bacteria: incubate at 35-38 0 C with an air sparge rate of
0.75-1.50 VVM (volume of air/volume of liquid/minute), and constant agitation via an impeller.
The culture is fermented until the desired spore population is reached. The spore population will

 increase as the cells are starved for a carbon source such as glucose but the final population of
 spores attained is somewhat strain specific. For the present invention the culture is grown to a
 final spore concentration    x 109 to lx 1010 CFU/mL.
 [00691 The above spore suspension may be stabilized by dropping the pH to 4.2-4.5 by adding
 acid and then concentrated by centrifugation. The concentrated slurry may be spray-dried at
 which point the spores are stable for at least 12 months at room temperature. Because spores will
 germinate when proper conditions (temperature, nutrients) exist-in the soil, for example-they
 can be applied to crops directly or mixed with a nutrient solution to facilitate germination and
then applied. The freshly mixed spore suspension should be mixed thoroughly before application
 and should ideally be used within 48 hours.
 [00701 For quality assurance, all products, dry and liquid, are assayed for viable total population
using CFU/mL.
 [00711 The Bacillus strain spores may also be purified or concentrated using methods such as
ultra-filtration, centrifugation, spray-drying or freeze-drying to generate a packaged product.
Formulations
 [00721 The composition may be formulated to allow for storage, transport, and/or application to
soil and/or crops. The formulation of mixtures of the strains may be adjusted to optimize
stability and sporulation. CFUs as spores and/or viable cells should be presented at the
concentrations described herein.
100731 The spores may be present in a composition that includes water, or water and additives
and excipients that do not have a deleterious effect on the action of the spores, or water, additives
and excipients and other ingredients conventionally used in spore preparations, e.g., binders, dry
feeds, and the like. The composition may also include certain nutrient organic compounds and
trace minerals or vitamins, or growth factors and adjuvants, although it is unknown if all of these
additives act to increase crop yield. Vitamin additives may be selected, for example, from
pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, thiamin, 25-hydroxy vitamin A, and vitamins B12, C,
D, E, K, biotin, choline, folacin and niacin. Mineral additives may be selected, for example,
magnesium, potassium, sodium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese calcium, phosphorous,
selenium, chlorine and chromium pincolinate. The concentration of the vitamins and minerals
will depend upon the plant being treated but, in general, will be between about 0.01% and about
5% by weight of the dry matter.

                                                  21
 [00741 The Bacillus strains may also be combined with other bacterial species, including but not
 limited to Shroth's gram-negative Pseudononasspecies. This Pseudoionasspecies has been
 described as being effective in producing siderophores, which compounds are believed to be the
mode-of-action for a demonstrated increase in crop production by application of this
Pseudomonas species. However, since there are strains of Pseudoinonasspecies that are plant
pathogens, and since plasmid transfer within a bacterial species can be commonplace, there is a
concern such transfer could convert a previously harmless strain into a pathogenic strain.
Applying Bacillus Strains to Crops
 [00751 The Bacillus strain concentrates of this invention can be applied to the soil, to the seed or
as a foliar application in a variety of forms including liquids and solids of various formulations,
such as those described herein. The CFU/ml or gm of the formulated Bacillus strain concentrates
can vary from 1 x 103 CFU/ml or /gm up to I x 1012 CFU/ml or /gm. The dose of the Bacillus
strain concentrates when applied to soil or seed should be such that the concentration in the
Rhizosphere (root zone) near the seed is a minimum per Bacillus strain of 1 x 103 CFU/gm of
soil with a range of 1 x 103 CFU/gm soil up to I x 10" '/gm soil. For seed coating applications
the minimum dose of the Bacillus strain concentrates should be a minimum of 1 x 103 CFU/seed
with a range of I  x  103 CFU/seed up to I x 1010 CFU/seed.
[0076] The spores can be applied as an aqueous suspension obtained directly from the
fermentation process described above, or, if the spores are purified or concentrated using
methods such as ultra-filtration, centrifugation, spray-drying or freeze-drying, they should be re
suspended in water before application to crops. When the spores are applied as an aqueous
suspension taken directly from the fermentation broth, other substances present in the broth will
also be applied to the crops. These non-viable substances, such as bacterial metabolites or un
utilized microbial nutrients, will be applied to the plants in very small concentrations, such as
100 grams/ha or less. This level of non-viable substance will not deleteriously affect the crop.
[0077] Bacillus strains as described herein may be applied to any type of grain, and to both
conventional and hybrid varieties. During grow-out, applications of the spore suspension can be
made manually, by backpack sprayer or by a more sophisticated mode such as by helicopter
spraying or by any mechanical spraying device known for use in farming practice.
100781 The Bacillus strains spores can be applied to crops by direct application to the soil,
coating of the seeds prior to planting, spraying on the soil, spraying on crops after the seeds

 soil, to the plant foliage, to the plant seeds, during sowing of said plant seeds, or after said plants
 germinate. The composition may be applied after a period of rain or watering of said plants.
 The composition may be applied within 10 days of sowing of the plant seeds, optionally within
 3, 5, or 7 days of sowing the seeds. The composition may be applied before germination,
 optionally within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 days of sowing the seeds. The composition may
 be applied after germination, optionally 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 days after germination. The
 composition may be applied by spraying plants or mixing into soil. The composition may be
 applied to the root zone. The composition may be around the seed of the plant. The composition
may preferably be applied to a plant or soil when the air temperature is over 65 0 F. The
 composition may be admixed with a soil. The composition/soil mixture may be applied to the
plants, seeds, or seedlings. The composition may be applied at any temperature appropriate for
field work, because if the temperature is not suitable for germination, then the spores will lie
dormant until an adequate temperature occurs. The composition may be applied within 2 weeks
of plant emergence. The plants may be dipped into a liquid spore composition, optionally
comprising about 250x10 6 to 5x10      9 CFU/mL of the Bacillus strains described herein. The plants
may be dipped for about 1-30 seconds or 30 seconds and then planted. The plants may be
treated a second time, by spraying the plants about 14 days after treatment by dipping.
 [00791 The composition may be sprayed directly onto row crops as a foliar spray. The crops
may be a grain crop, optionally rice, corn, alfalfa, oats, wheat, barley, or hops. The crop may be
wheat, soybeans, cabbage, ornamental flowers, optionally geraniums, petunias, daffodils, or
trees, optionally poplar trees. New seedling fruit trees or bushes may be dipped into containers
comprising a liquid spore concentrate. Crops whose treatment is contemplated and suitable
application routes, are shown in Table 3

    of Bacillus strains. The Bacillus strain bacteria may be in spore form. The spores may be
    formulated in a suspension comprising water including but not limited to substantially chlorine
    free. The composition may further comprise nutrient organic compounds, trace minerals,
    vitamins, growth factors, or adjuvants. The Bacillus strain bacteria may be applied to the crops
    in a concentration of Ix10 3 to lxIO12 cells/mL or lx103 to IxI12 cells/gram of soil. The
    composition may be spray-dried or lyophilized. The spores may be obtained by ultra-filtration,
    centrifugation, spray-drying, freeze-drying, or combinations thereof. The spores will preferably
    germinate and colonize the soil.

                                    Screening for Fungal Inhibition
[00851 A standard agar-plate-based zone-of-inhibition method was used to screen select
members of the Bacillus, Brevibacillus, or Paenibacillusgenera comprising 9 different species
and a total of 11 different strains. The 11 strains of Bacillus, Brevibacillus, or Paenibacillusand
their identity are given in Table 2. The 13 species of fungal plant pathogens tested are listed in
Table 1.
[00861 The zone-of-inhibition screening methodology is given in Figure 1. Fungal pathogen
species were grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) except for Phytophthora which was grown
on V8 Agar. All fungi were stored at 4'C until used. Bacillus strains were subcultured in LB
broth overnight at 37'C with shaking at 200 rpm. The subculture (0.5 ml) was used to inoculate
50 ml LB broth and grown overnight at 37'C with shaking at 200 rpm. An 8 mm plug from the
center of an agar plate (TSA, 6.5 pH) was removed. An 8mm plug of pathogen was placed in the

 pathogen covered the plate. Pathogen inhibition zones were measured with calipers at 900 angle
 as shown in Figure 1. The mean of two zone measurements were reported and scored only
 measured if they were 1 mm or greater. Experiments were performed in duplicate.
 [00871 The mean inhibition zone sizes (in mm) of plant pathogens when grown in the presence
 of Bacillus strains are shown graphically in Figure 2. Each Bacillus strain shows a distinct profile
 in ability to inhibit fungal plant pathogens. While species such as Bacillus subtilis inhibits at
 least one member of every fungal genera, others such as Bacillus megaterumn and Paenibacillus
 chitinolyticus only inhibit one or two fungal genera.
 [0088] The percent of plant pathogen species inhibited when grown in the presence of Bacillus
 strains are shown graphically in Figure 3. Each Bacillus strain shows a distinct profile in ability
to inhibit fungal plant pathogens. While species such as Bacillus subtilis inhibit nearly all 59
pathogen isolates, others such as Bacillus megateriun and Paenibacilluschitinolyticus only
inhibit a couple of isolates.
 [00891 Figure 4 highlights the percent of fungal plant pathogen isolates inhibited by each
Bacillus strain. The combination of all data figures leads to the following novel combination of
Bacillus strain concentrates to control fungal plant pathogen activity and growth:
              o #1: Bacillus anyloliquefociens, Bacillus lichenijfirmis, Bacillus subtilis 10, and
                  Brevibacillus laterosporus(CM3 and/or CM 33)
              o #2: Bacillus licheniformis, Brevibacillus laterosporus(CM3 and/or CM 33), and
                  Bacillus mnojavensis
              o   #3: Bacillus amnyloliquefrciens, Brevibacillus laterosporus(CM3 and/or CM 33),

                  Bacilluspumilus and Paenibacilluspolynxa
10090] The initial screen for bacillus antifungal properties were completed on solid agar media
(TSA). Because there was no actual contact between the Bacillus and the fungus, the zone of
inhibition of fungal growth observed in the presence of Bacillus had to be due to an agar
diffusible compound produced and excreted by the Bacillus.
[00911 This test may be used to evaluate the antifungal activity of the compositions and methods
described herein. Combinations of strains/species may be selected based on their efficacy

  combinations of Bacillus to target multiple fungal pathogens. For example, a combination may
 be selected to combine different Bacillus species/strains that have antifungal activity to target a
  larger group of pathogens together than the Bacillus species/strains would individually. The
 inventors surprisingly discovered that combinations of Bacillus strains/species described herein
 shown unexpected improved antifungal properties as compared to single strains (or species).

          Compatibility of Bacillus Concentrates with Bradyrhizobium and Trichoderina
 [0092] Selected Bacillus concentrates and individual Bacillus cultures were tested for inhibition
 of two beneficial soil microbes Bradyrhizobiunm, a naturally occurring bacteria of critical
 importance in legume symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and Trichodernia,a naturally occurring
 beneficial soil fungus. Commercially available soil inoculant products were used as sources for
 the two microbes.
 [00931 For Bradvrhizobiun a cross streak assay was used in which a center streak of
Bradvrhizobium was made and then cross streaks of the Bacillus cultures to be tested were
 streaked perpendicular to and just touching the center Bradyrhizobium streak. Bacillus cross
 streaks were done at 0, 2, 4 and 6 days after the initial Bradyrhizobiun streak and the plates were
 incubated until good growth was obtained for both Bradyrhizobium and Bacillus.
 100941 From Figure 5 it is clear that there is no inhibition of growth of Bradyrhizobium by the
Bacillus cultures.
 [00951 Experiments were conducted by placing discs containing equal amount of each cultures
(0.05 ml) on agar plates as shown in Figure 6. The Trichoderma was added to the middle of
each Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) plate. The plate was the incubated at 37C for, and monitored
every 12-18 hours until fungus covered the entire plate. Additionally, another plate was
incubated at 37C for 3 days with the Bacillus strains alone. The Trichoderma was then added to
the middle of those plates and incubated again at 37"C. In neither case was there inhibition of
the Trichoderma by Bacillus.
[00961 From Figure 5 and 6 it is clear that these Bacillus strains do not inhibit either
Bradyrhizobium or Trichodernma.

 the greenhouse trials each set of 6 plants will be infected with a representative Fusarium,
 Phytophthora,Pythium, Rhizoctonia, or Sclerotinia in the presence and absence Bacillus strain
 concentrate. Total plant growth, root mass, and fungal population will be assessed for all sets of
 plants.

 [0098] In vitro results of Examples 1 and 2 were confirmed by in vivo greenhouse trials.
 Planting medium starter bricks were rehydrated with water at T= -5 days. On T = -3 days the
 hydrated planting medium was inoculated by direct mixing into the hydrated planting medium
 starter bricks with freshly prepared fungal inoculum (either a mix of 3 Pythium ultim umnisolates
 or a mix of 3 Rhizoctonia solani isolates), fungal pathogen and Bacillus Blend 1 (Brevibacillus
 laterosporus3 and 33, Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus mojavensis) or Bacillus Blend 2
 (Brevibacilluslaterosporus3 and 33, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis 10, and Bacillus
amyloliquefaciens), or equivalent volume of water as the control.
 [00991 On planting day (T=O) inoculated soil medium was separately distributed into several 24
well starter flats beginning with the control. Four pea seeds were planted into each well at the
depth of V2 inch and starter trays were placed onto an indoor growth light table with enclosing
cover and checked daily for germination. Temperature was maintained at a constant 3 IC.
Germination counts were recorded on day 7 post planting (T= +7 days) and the experiment
terminated at T= + 14 days.
100100]          Observations for growth were recorded at T=7 days. In both test cases, Pythium
and Rhizoctonia caused damping off, observed as low germination and stunted growth. Both
Bacillus Blend I and Bacillus Blend 2 were able to suppress the effects of the fungal pathogen
observed as higher germination numbers (Figures 12A and 12B) and larger, healthier plants
(Figure 1). Observations at T=14 days showed no increase of disease or seedling die-off other
than that observed at T=7 days.

 activity of Pythium and Rhizoctonia plant pathogens, leading to higher germination and larger,
 healthier plants. Accordingly, mixtures of Bacillus cells as described herein, including but not
 limited to the mixtures described in this Example, as well as Examples I and 2, may be expected
 to lead to higher germination and larger, healthier plants as described herein.

                    Formulation of a Liquid Concentrate of Six Bacillus Strains
 [01001 Spores from six (6) strains of Bacillus are grown in monoculture as described herein, and
 the liquid concentrates from the respective centrifugation steps are stabilized as described herein.
An amount from each of the six Bacillus strain liquid concentrates is mixed into a diluting liquid
with a standard multiple blade, flat blade impeller at a sufficient RPM such that the desired final
 concentration of each Bacillus strain was attained. The equipment for liquid mixing and blending
can be any liquid mixing equipment standard and known to one skilled in the art of liquid
formulation. Sufficient power per volume must be used to ensure good hydration of all solid
components and good mixing to attain a homogeneous blend. The final concentration of each of
the Bacillus strains can range from I x 103 CFU/ml final liquid up to 1 x 10" CFU/ml final
liquid but is more generally in the range of I x 108 CFU/ml of final liquid up to 1 x 1010 CFU/ml
of final liquid.
 [01011 The composition of the diluting liquid can be water, or water, additives and excipients
that do not have a deleterious effect on the action of the spores or water, additives and excipients
and other ingredients conventionally used in spore preparations, e.g., microbial stabilizers,
thickeners, hydrocolloids, pH buffers and the like. The composition may also include certain
nutrient organic compounds, trace minerals, vitamins and growth factors. The concentration of
these nutrient additives will depend on the type of additive and the plant and soil being treated
but, in general, will be between about 0.0 1% and about 5% by weight of final liquid formulation.
[0102] The CFU/ml of spores in the formulated liquid concentrate is determined by doing a total
spore count where the appropriate serial dilution is prepared by methods well known to those
skilled in the art, and the final dilution is then subjected to 80C for 5 minutes, quenched in an
ice bath, and then plated on standard Tryptic Soy Agar. After incubation at 37"C for 18 to 24
hours, the colonies per plate are counted, and the spore count is calculated by multiplying the

 [0103] Spores from six (6) strains of Bacillus are grown in monoculture as described herein and
 the respective liquid concentrates are spray dried as described herein. An amount from each of
 the six Bacillus strain dry powder concentrates is weighed into powder blending equipment
 along with an inert powder carrier/diluent, and blended using a V-blender such that the desired
 final concentration of each Bacillus strain is attained. The equipment for powder mixing and
blending can be any powder mixing equipment standard and known to one skilled in the art of
powder blending and formulation, including but not limited to rotating blenders such as a V
Blender or a ribbon blender. Sufficient component inter-mixing must be attained to ensure a
homogeneous blend. The final concentration for each of the Bacillus strain can range from I x
 106 CFU/gm final powder up to I x      1012 CFU/gm final powder but is more generally in the range
of I x 109 CFU/gm final powder up to I x 10" CFU/gm final powder.
 [01041 The composition of the powder/diluents can be any inert powdered diluent standard to
one skilled in the art of powder formulations, any inert powdered diluent, dry additives and dry
excipients that do not have a deleterious effect on the action of the spores, or any inert powdered
diluent, additives and excipients and other ingredients conventionally used in powered spore
preparations, e.g., anti-caking agents, flow agents, desiccants and the like. The composition may
also include certain powdered nutrient organic compounds, trace minerals, vitamins and growth
factors. The concentration of these nutrient additives will depend on the type of additive and the
plant and soil being treated but, in general, will be between about 0.0 1% and about 5% by dry
weight of final powder formulation.

  [01061 Solution of Bacillus spores in liquid form and containing four strains of Bacillus
 containing a minimum of 250 million CFU/ml is applied at the rate of 1 gallon per acre through
 mechanical spraying apparatus commonly found on U.S. farms. The liquid suspension may be
 sprayed onto any typical row crop seeds such as soybeans, corn, wheat, maize directly into the
 furrow of soil onto the seed as it is planted. Spore concentrate may be applied simultaneously as
 the seed is deposited into the furrow. Concentration of spores can be adjusted as high as 5
 billion CFU/mL, and dose applied to seeds at planting can be adjusted to as low as 32 fluid
 ounces per acre. Seeds treated in furrow should be conventional seeds with no additional
 materials added, such as pesticides, fertilizers and the like. Plants can be examined for evidence
 of fungal pathogens from time of germination through harvest. The pictures in Figures 7 and 8
 demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bacillus blend acting in synergy with naturally occurring
Rhizobiun at developing nitrogen nodules on soybeans. No additional Rhizobiun was added to
the field, and the only treatment was addition of the Bacillus at time of planting the seeds.

 methods as a coating and then dried to form a micro layer of dried Bacillus spores on the seed.
 Seeds are then planted per usual farming practices. Seed coating can be applied in a variety of
 ways including adding liquid spores to seed in a rotary drum type drying mechanism and rotated
 for 2-15 minutes to ensure adequate distribution; spores can be applied in a thin mist spray across
 a conveyor full of seeds and air dried to achieve coating effect or sprayed onto surface of seeds
 as one of multiple spray ports as seeds are passed through a rotating screw type conveyor. Final
spore concentrate on seeds may range from 0.1 ounce per 50 pounds up to 2 fluid ounce per 50
pounds.

                      Application of Bacillus to Row Crops by Foliar Spray
 [0109] At first onset of visible pathogen infestation, liquid Bacillus spore concentrate containing
5-11 strains (250 million CFU/ml up to 5 billion CFU/ml) can be sprayed directly onto row crops
as a foliar spray. Application rate can be varied to achieve a dose rate of anywhere from 1 gallon
to 1 quart per acre. Higher concentrations of spores can be diluted in water to achieve a more
uniform distribution. Concentrations of 50-100 billion CFU/ml can diluted in 50-250 gallons of
water prior to spraying. Spraying as foliar application can be applied to many row crops such as
soybeans, corn and wheat along with a wide variety of vegetable products such as tomatoes,
peppers, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, zucchini, and eggplant. Foliar spray can also
be applied to fruit shrubs and plants such as grapes, raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries.
[01101 Additionally, in cases of fruit trees such as apple, pear, peaches and the like, this same
liquid concentrate or diluted with water can be applied to young and mature trees to prevent
pathogen damage or to aid in the trees recovery from a pathogen infection

Example 4, 5 and 9 above is sprayed onto ornamental flowers (both annuals and perennials) such
as geraniums, petunias, daffodils, either at germination of seeds or as foliar spray within 3-5 days
of germination as preventive measure for pathogen occurrence. If pathogen infestation is
detected prior to spraying, treatments should be repeated every day by suspending the spore
concentrate into the nursery irrigation water so a low dose (100- 200,000 CFU/mI is delivered
each day through normal watering procedures. This treatment should continue for 7 days.
