   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
                   The present invention is related to processes for preparing chiral substituted
 5 pyrazolyl pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines and related synthetic intermediate compounds. The
   chiral substituted pyrazolyl pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines are useful as inhibitors of the Janus
   Kinase family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs) for treatment of inflammatory diseases,
   myeloproliferative disorders, and other diseases.
   BACKGROUND
10                 Protein kinases (PKs) are a group of enzymes that regulate diverse, important
   biological processes including cell growth, survival and differentiation, organ formation
   and morphogenesis, neovascularization, tissue repair and regeneration, among others.
   Protein kinases exert their physiological functions through catalyzing the phosphorylation
   of proteins (or substrates) and thereby modulating the cellular activities of the substrates in
15 various biological contexts. In addition to the functions in normal tissues/organs, many
   protein kinases also play more specialized roles in a host of human diseases including
   cancer. A subset of protein kinases (also referred to as oncogenic protein kinases), when
   dysregulated, can cause tumor formation and growth, and further contribute to tumor
   maintenance and progression (Blume-Jensen P et al, Nature 2001, 411(6835):355-365).
20 Thus far, oncogenic protein kinases represent one of the largest and most attractive groups
   of protein targets for cancer intervention and drug development.
                   Protein kinases can be categorized as receptor type and non-receptor type.
   Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have an extracellular portion, a transmembrane domain,
   and an intracellular portion, while non-receptor tyrosine kinases are entirely intracellular.
25 The Janus kinase family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs) belong to the non-receptor type
   of tyrosine kinases and include family members: JAKI (also known as Janus kinase-1),
   JAK2 (also known as Janus kinase-2), JAK3 (also known as Janus
                                                                     1

    WO 2010/083283                                                             PCT/US2010/021003
   kinase, leukocyte; JAKL; L-JAK and Janus kinase-3) and TYK2 (also known as protein
   tyrosine kinase 2).
             The pathway involving JAKs and Signal Transducers and Activators of
   Transcription (STATs) is engaged in the signaling of a wide range of cytokines.
 5 Cytokines are low-molecular weight polypeptides or glycoproteins that stimulate
   biological responses in virtually all cell types. Generally, cytokine receptors do not have
   intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and thus require receptor-associated kinases to
   propagate a phosphorylation cascade. JAKs fulfill this function. Cytokines bind to their
   receptors, causing receptor dimerization, and this enables JAKs to phosphorylate each
10 other as well as specific tyrosine motifs within the cytokine receptors. STATs that
   recognize these phosphotyrosine motifs are recruited to the receptor, and are then
   themselves activated by a JAK-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation event. Upon
   activation, STATs dissociate from the receptors, dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus
   to bind to specific DNA sites and alter transcription (Scott, M. J., C. J. Godshall, et al.
15 (2002). "Jaks, STATs, Cytokines, and Sepsis." Clin Diagn Lab Immunol 9(6): 1153-9).
            The JAK family plays a role in the cytokine-dependent regulation of proliferation
   and function of cells involved in immune response. The JAK/STAT pathway, and in
   particular all four members of the JAK family, are believed to play a role in the
   pathogenesis of the asthmatic response, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
20 bronchitis, and other related inflammatory diseases of the lower respiratory tract.
   Moreover, multiple cytokines that signal through JAK kinases have been linked to
   inflammatory diseases or conditions of the upper respiratory tract such as those affecting
   the nose and sinuses (e.g. rhinitis, sinusitis) whether classically allergic reactions or not.
   The JAK/STAT pathway has also been implicated to play a role in inflammatory
25 diseases/conditions of the eye including, but not limited to, iritis, uveitis, scleritis,
   conjunctivitis, as well as chronic allergic responses. Therefore, inhibition of JAK kinases
   may have a beneficial role in the therapeutic treatment of these diseases.
            Blocking signal transduction at the level of the JAK kinases holds promise for
   developing treatments for human cancers. Inhibition of the JAK kinases is also
30 envisioned to have therapeutic benefits in patients suffering from skin immune disorders
   such as psoriasis, and skin sensitization. Accordingly, inhibitors of Janus kinases or
                                                   2

     WO 2010/083283                                                               PCT/US2010/021003
    related kinases are widely sought and several publications report effective classes of
    compounds. For example, certain JAK inhibitors, including (R)-3-(4-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3
    d]pyrimidin-4-yl)- 1H-pyrazol- 1-yl)-3 -cyclopentylpropanenitrile, are reported in U.S. Pat.
    App. Pub. No. 2007/0135461, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
 5  reference.
            In view of the growing demand for compounds for the treatment of disorders
    related to the inhibition of kinases such as Janus kinases, new and more efficient routes to
    inhibitors such as chiral substituted pyrazolyl pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines and
    intermediates related thereto, are needed. The processes and compounds described herein
10  help meet these and other needs.

            The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the

10 advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from
   the claims.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
            At various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds of the
   invention are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the
15 invention include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such
   groups and ranges. For example, the term "C1 _6 alkyl" is specifically intended to
   individually disclose methyl, ethyl, C3 alkyl, C 4 alkyl, C5 alkyl, and C6 alkyl.
            It is further appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for
   clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, can also be provided in
20 combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which
   are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, can also be provided
   separately or in any suitable subcombination.
            The term "n-membered" where n is an integer typically describes the number of
   ring-forming atoms in a moiety where the number of ring-forming atoms is n. For
25 example, piperidinyl is an example of a 6-membered heterocycloalkyl ring and 1,2,3,4
   tetrahydro-naphthalene is an example of a 10-membered cycloalkyl group.
                                                      18

    WO 2010/083283                                                             PCT/US2010/021003
            For compounds of the invention in which a variable appears more than once, each
   variable can be a different moiety independently selected from the group defining the
   variable. For example, where a structure is described having two R groups that are
   simultaneously present on the same compound, the two R groups can represent different
 5 moieties independently selected from the group defined for R. In another example, when
   an optionally multiple substituent is designated in the form:
                                                  r_(CVH(R)p
                                           Q _/(GH 2 )n
   then it is understood that substituent R can occur p number of times on the ring, and R
   can be a different moiety at each occurrence. It is understood that each R group may
10 replace any hydrogen atom attached to a ring atom, including one or both of the (CH 2)n
   hydrogen atoms. Further, in the above example, should the variable        Q be  defined to
   include hydrogens, such as when     Q is the to be  CH 2, NH, etc., any floating substituent
   such as R in the above example, can replace a hydrogen of the       Q variable  as well as a
   hydrogen in any other non-variable component of the ring.
15          For compounds of the invention in which a variable appears more than once, each
   variable can be a different moiety independently selected from the group defining the
   variable. For example, where a structure is described having two R groups that are
   simultaneously present on the same compound, the two R groups can represent different
   moieties independently selected from the group defined for R.
20          As used herein, the phrase "optionally substituted" means unsubstituted or
   substituted. As used herein, the term "substituted" means that a hydrogen atom is
   removed and replaced by a substitutent. As used herein, the phrase "substituted with
   oxo" means that two hydrogen atoms are removed from a carbon atom and replaced by
   an oxygen bound by a double bond to the carbon atom. It is understood that substitution
25 at a given atom is limited by valency.
            As used herein, the term "alkyl", employed alone or in combination with other
   terms, refers to a saturated hydrocarbon group that may be straight-chain or branched. In
   some embodiments, the alkyl group contains 1 to 12, 1 to 8, or 1 to 6 carbon atoms.
   Examples of alkyl moieties include, but are not limited to, chemical groups such as

   homologs such as 2-methyl-1-butyl, n-pentyl, 3-pentyl, n-hexyl, 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl, n

   chromatography include HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography), SFC
   (Supercritical Fluid Chromatography), both in batch mode and in continuous mode, e.g
   SMB (Simulated Moving Bed), and related techniques. The process of the present
   invention can utilize any chromatographic method for separating racemic compounds to
 5 produce the optically pure desired enantiomer. Such methods include, but are not limited
   to, traditional single column batch chromatography, continuous chromatography, or a
   steady state, sequential injection process (as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No.
   5,630,943 and PCT Publ. No. WO 98/51391). Continuous chromatographic methods
   include, but are not limited to multicolumn continuous chromatographic processes,
10 including such countercurrent chromatographic processes as SMB (as described in, for
   example U.S. Pat. Nos 2,985,589, 4,402,832 and 4,498,991), or a non-steady state
   continuous chromatographic method known as the "Varicol T M " Process (as described in,
   for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,136,198; 6,375,839; 6,413,419; and 6,712,973).
            In the separation of enantiomers these methods involve the use of a chiral

   which an interacting agent is coated or immobilized.
            As used herein, the term "chiral stationary phase" relates to stationary phases in
   which the interacting agent is an enantiomerically enriched resolving agent, for instance
20 immobilized by coating, by chemically binding or by insolubilizing via cross-linking on
   an inert carrier material. A suitable inert carrier material is preferably macroporous, e.g
   crosslinked polystyrene, polyacrylamide, polyacrylate, alumina, kieselgur
   (diatomaceous), quartz, kaolin, magnesium oxide or titanium dioxide. In some
   embodiments, the inert carrier material comprises silica gel. The average particle
25 diameter of the packing material varies depending on the volume flow rate of the solvent
   flowing in the chromatographic system In some embodiments, it is 1 to 300 pm, 2 to 100
   pm, 5 to 75 pm or 10 to 30 pm. Appropriate selection of the average particle diameter of
   the packing material will help to adjust the pressure drop in the chromatographic process
   and the efficiency of the packing material. Examples of stationary phases containing an
30 enantiomerically enriched resolving agent are, for instance, phases based on either
   synthetic or naturally occurring chiral polymers, macrocyclic phases, ligand-exchange

   one sugar derivative, and in particular is a derivatized polysaccharide that is selected
   from the amylosic, cellulosic, chitosan, xylan, curdlan, dextran, and inulan class of
 5 polysaccharides. In certain embodiments, the chiral stationary phase is a member of the
   the amylosic or cellulosic class of polysaccharides. Esters and carbamates of these
   materials in particular are suitable. In additional embodiments, the chiral stationary phase
   is selected from cellulose phenyl carbamate derivatives, such as cellulose tris(3,5
   dimethylphenyl)carbamate (available from Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Daicel) as
10 "Chiralcel@ OD" or "Chiralpak@ IB", wherein the carbamate derivative is bonded to the

   solvents that are known to be used in analytical chromatography. In liquid
25 chromatography usually, non-polar, polar protic or aprotic solvents or mixture thereof are
   used. In supercritical chromatography preferably mixtures of carbon dioxide and polar
   protic solvents are used. Suitable non polar solvents are for example hydrocarbons, for
   instance, n-pentane, n-hexane, hexanes, n-heptane, heptanes, cyclohexane, and
   methylcyclohexane. Suitable protic or aprotic solvents are for example alcohols, in

           I.      Catalytic Hydrogenation Methods (Includin2 Asymmetric
   Hydro2enation Methods)
           Compounds of Formula III can be formed by catalytic hydrogenation of a
   compound of Formula II to form a compound of Formula I, which can then be converted
25 to a compound of Formula III through functional group transformation and/or
   deprotection steps. In some embodiments, the processes form a compound of Formula I
   as the racemate, while in more preferred embodiments, the processes produce an
   enantiomeric excess of the (S)- or (R)-enantiomer of the compound of Formula I. One
   step of the process involves the hydrogenation of a,p-unsatuated compounds of Formula
30 II as shown below.

   palladium-on-carbon.
            In further embodiments, the process produces a composition comprising an
   enantiomeric excess of a (R)- or (S)-enantiomer of the compound of Formula I. In
 5 general, when an enantiomeric excess of the compound of Formula I is desired, an
   asymmetric hydrogenation catalyst is utilized. In some embodiments, the hydrogenation
   catalyst is a ruthenium or rhodium catalyst having LI; wherein L1 is a chiral ligand.
   Many suitable catalysts are known in the art. In some embodiments, a chiral phosphine
   ligands are used. The active catalyst systems (metal, ligand, and additives) can be
10 generated in situ during the reaction or generated prior to the reaction.
            In some embodiments, the catalyst can be first screened by carrying out the
   catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation experiments using a relatively high catalyst loading.
   Once the catalyst systems are selected, the experimental conditions including the catalyst
   loading, hydrogen pressure, reaction solvent or solvent system, reaction temperature, and
15 reaction time can be further optimized to improve the chemical conversion and
   enentioselectivity. In some embodiments, the catalyst loading is from about 0.005 to
   about 0.1 mole %based on the compound of Formula II.
            In some embodiments, it will be known which enantiomer of the compound of
   Formula I will be produced by a particular chiral ligand. In some embodiments, the
20 chiral ligand in the asymmetric hydrogenation catalyst can be screened to determine
   which enantiomer of the compound of Formula I is produced by the process. The desired
   chiral ligand can then be selected so as to provide the desired enantiomer of the
   compound of Formula I. For example, in some embodiments, the process further
   comprises, prior the reacting, the steps of:
25          (i)     reacting the compound of Formula II with hydrogen gas in the presence of
   a ruthenium or rhodium catalyst having L2 ; and analyzing the resultant composition to
   determine whether the (R)- or (S)-enantiomer is in excess; wherein L2 is a chiral ligand;
            (ii)    reacting the compound of Formula II with hydrogen gas in the presence of
   a ruthenium or rhodium catalyst having L3 ; and analyzing the resultant composition to
30 determine whether the (R)- or (S)-enantiomer is in excess; wherein L3 is the same chiral
   ligand as L2 having the opposite stereochemistry; and

   example, in some embodiments, the Pi group is removed by treating with fluoride ion
 5 (e.g., treating with tetrabutylammonium fluoride), hydrochloric acid, pyridinium p
   toluenesulfonic acid (PPTS), or a Lewis acid (e.g., lithium tetrafluoroborate)). In some
   embodiments, the treating comprises treating with lithium tetrafluoroborate, followed by
   treating with ammonium hydroxide (e.g., when Pi is 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl). In
   some embodiments, the treating comprises treating with base (e.g., Pi is N
10 pivaloyloxymethyl). In some embodiments, the base is an alkali metal hydroxide. In
   some embodiments, the base is sodium hydroxide. In some embodiments, the treating
   comprises treating with sodium hydroxide or ammonia in a solvent such as methanol or
   water.
            In some embodiments, to deprotect the SEM-protection group, a mild, two stage
15 protocol is employed. The SEM-protected substrate of Formula Ic is treated with lithium
   tetrafluoroborate (LiBF 4) in aqueous acetonitrile at elevated temperature, such as 80 0 C
   for ten to twenty hours. The resulting corresponding hydroxymethyl intermediate is then
   subsequently treated with aqueous ammonium hydroxide (NH4 0H) at room temperature
   to provide the compound of Formula III.
20          In some embodiments, for the POM-deprotection, an aqueous sodium hydroxide
   solution (NaOH) is used. Thus, a suspension of the POM-protected compound of
   Formula Ic, is treated with a 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature
   for two to three hours. The desired product of Formula III can be obtained after the
   typical acid-base work-up. In some embodiments, the deprotecting conditions comprise
25 treating with lithium tetrafluoroborate, followed by treating with aqueous ammonium
   hydroxide.

           While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the mechanism of these
   chiral amine catalyzed aza-Michael conjugate addition of N-heterocyclic compounds to
   a,p-unsaturated aldehydes is understood to involve the following pathways. First, the
25 a, P-unsaturated  aldehyde of Formula V reacts with the protonated catalyst formed from
   the combination of the chiral amine and the organic acid and forms an iminium ion with
                                                  49

    WO 2010/083283                                                           PCT/US2010/021003
   loss of water. Owing to the chirality of the catalyst, two different iminium ions that have
   E and Z configurations can be formed. The corresponding E configuration is expected to
   be the major intermediate present in which the Si face is shielded by the chiral group in
   the catalyst, leaving Re face available for the approach of the N-heterocyclic compounds.
 5 Second, the addition of substituted pyrazole to the iminium ion gives the enamine
   intermediate, which bears a positive charge on the protonated pyrazole ring. This proton
   is then transferred from the nitrogen atom in the pyrazole ring to the enamine carbon
   atom to form iminium intermediate. Third, the hydrolysis of the iminium ion leads to
   regeneration of the catalyst and product. Based on the understanding of reaction
10 mechanism, the reaction conditions for this organocatalyzed aza-Michael reaction were
   defined.
            In some embodiments, the compound of Formula V is present in excess amounts
   (e.g., from about 1.5 to about 5 equivalents). In some embodiments, the chiral amine is
   present in about 0.02 to about 0.15 equivalents, or about 0.05 to about 0.10 equivalents.
15          In some embodiments of either asymmetric aza-Michael addition process, the
   organic acid is p-toluenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid or 4-nitrobenzoic acid. In some
   embodiments, the organic acid is benzoic acid. In some embodiments, organic acid is
   present in about 0.05 to about 0.10 equivalents.
            In some embodiments, the reacting is conducted in an organic solvent selected
20 from chloroform (CHCl 3 ) or toluene. In some embodiments, the reacting is at a
   temperature of about room temperature, or from about 0 to about 5 0 C. In some
   embodiments, the reaction is complete in about 10 to about 24 hours. In some
   embodiments, the reaction conversion reaches over 95% with the isolated yield to about
   80 to about 90%. Chiral HPLC methods have been developed to determine the chiral
25 purity of each aza-Michael adduct or its derivative.

           III.    Synthesis and Racemic Resolution of Pyrazole Intermediates
           Chiral compounds of Formula III can be produced by chiral column separation
10 (such as by chiral preparative chromatography) of a racemate of a protected pyrazole
   borate derivative of Formula IX, followed by a Suzuki coupling reaction of the chiral
   intermediate of IX with a unprotected pyrrolo[2,3-d] pyrimidine of Formula XI (Scheme
   5). Alternatively, the chiral intermediate of Formula (S)-IX or (R)-IX can be reacted
   under Suzuki coupling conditions with a protected pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine of Formula
15 X, followed by deprotection to remove the P1 protecting group to give a chiral compound
   of Formula III (Scheme 5). The racemic substituted pyrazole borate derivatives of
   Formula IX can be produced via the Michael addition reaction between pyrazole boronic
   derivative of Formula XV and a Michael acceptor of Formula D-1 (Scheme 5).

10
            i)     Higher Yield Routes to Intermediate Compounds of Formula IV
            Compounds of Formula IV are important intermediates in the various synthetic
   routes for the compounds of Formula III described supra. These compounds are
   generally formed by Suzuki coupling processes. Suzuki coupling of protected protected
15 7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivative of Formula X with a unprotected pyrazole borate
   derivative of Formula XV using a palladium catalyst result in a lower yield (Scheme 10).
   Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the lower yields
   result from interference of unprotected amine functionality in the Suzuki coupling
   reaction.

           Accordingly, a new process for preparing the compound of Formula IV was
   developed involving the use of protected pyrazole borate derivative of Formula XIII
   (Scheme 11). Accordingly, the compound of Formula XIII can be generated and then
   reacted with the the protected 7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivative of Formula X to
 5 form a compound of Formula XII, followed by deprotection to give the compound of
   Formula IV. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula XIII can be formed by in
   situ protection of pyrazole pinacol borate. For example, when P2 is 1-(ethoxy)ethyl, a
   pyrazol-4-yl pinacol borate can be reacted with vinyl ether in-situ to generate the
   protected compound of Formula XIII. The Suzuki coupling reaction between the
10 protected pyrazole pinacol borate of Formula XIII and the compound of Formula X then
   proceeds smoothly under the typical Suzuki reaction conditions to generate the
   compound of Formula IV in higher yield after the acidic work-up of the corresponding
   coupling intermediate of Formula XII.
           In other embodiments, the compound of Formula XIII is the isolated and fully
15 characterized compound. For example, the use of isolated, fully characterized compound
   of Formula XIII, wherein P 2 is 1-(ethoxy)ethyl and the borate moiety is a pinacol group,
   afforded the product of Formula XII, and subsequently the compound of Formula IV in
   better yield and purity.

           In other embodiments, the compound of Formula X can be in-situ generated from
   a compound of Formula XI and then subsequently reacted with the compound of Formula
25 XIII. This eliminates the necessity of having to isolate and purify the compound of
   Formula X during large-scale production. For example, when Pi is SEM, the compound
   of Formula XI can be reacted with sodium hydride and SEM chloride to generate the
   compound of Formula X in situ (Scheme 12).

15         The compounds of XVI can be produced by the methods shown in Scheme 14.
   First, pyrazole is reacted with a halogenating agent to give the monohalo or dihalo
   pyrazole of Formula XIX (wherein X3 is iodo or bromo and m is 1 or 2). The compound
   of Formula XIX is then protected to give the protected monohalo or dihalo pyrazole of
   Formula XVIII. The compound of Formula XVIII can then be treated with an alkyl
20 Grignard or alkyllithium reagent, followed by treatment with a 2-alkoxy-4,4,5,5
   tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane reagent of Formula XVII, to form the desired pinacol
   borate of Formula XVI. In some embodiments, the P3 protecting group is one which is
   stable to an aqueous workup of the Grignard or lithium reaction (e.g., wherein P3 is 1
   (ethoxy)ethyl). In other cases, P 3 is a protecting group is not stable to the aqueous
25 workup of the Grignard or alkyllithium reaction. In this case, an additional protecting
   step will be needed to add the protecting group, P3 . In some embodiments, P 3 will be
   selected from the groups listed supra for P2 , for ease of processing.

   in DME via large bore canula over 30 min at 5 - 12 0C. The resulting reaction mixture
   was heterogeneous. Following the addition, the cold bath was removed and the mixture
   was gradually warmed to room temperature and allowed to stir at room temperature for 1
   hour before being cooled to 0 - 5 0C. Chloromethyl pivalate (pivaloyloxymethyl chloride,

15 down to 0 - 3 0 C before triethylamine (TEA, 61.9 mL, 0.442 mol, 2.1 equiv) was added
   dropwise via syringe over 25 min. The addition of triethylamine to reaction mixture was
   mildly exothermic and the reaction temperature went up to as high as 15 0C. After
   addition of triethylamine, the reaction mixture became a white slurry which was stirred
   vigorously at 0 0C for 2 h at 5 - 15 C. When the reaction was deemed complete as
20 confirmed by TLC and LCMS, the reaction mixture was diluted with pentane (150 mL,

   washed with diethyl ether and pentane (1 to I by volume, 200 ML). The filtrate was then
   concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the majority of the solvent, and the
   residue, which contains the crude cyanatobenzene (6), was directly used in the

10         Methyl 3-cyclopentylpropiolate (18). To a stirred solution of
   cyclopentylacetylene (7, 17.49 mL, 150.0 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, 200
   mL, 2466 mmol) at -78 0 C was added 2.50 M of n-butyllithium in hexane (66.0 mL, 165
   mmol, 1.1 equiv). The resulting milky suspension was stirred at -78 0 C for 30 min.
   Methyl chloroformate (17.6 mL, 225 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was then added. The reaction
15 mixture became a clear solution. The cooling bath was then removed, and the reaction
   mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred at room temperature for 1
   h. The reaction mixture became a suspension again. When TLC (5% EtOAc/hexane,
   KMnO4 stain) showed the reaction was deemed complete, the reaction mixture was
   quenched with saturated aqueous NH 4 Cl solution (150 mL) and extracted with diethyl
20 ether (Et 20, 2 x 200 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with saturated
   aqueous NaCl solution, dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4), filtered and concentrated
   under the reduced pressure. The residue was distilled under vacuum (99 - 101 'C/16
   mbar) to afford methyl 3-cyclopentylpropiolate (18, 21.856 g, 22.83 g theoretical, 96%

            The racemic mixture was processed on an SMB unit equipped with 8 columns.
20 The separation was performed at various scales using various conditions presented in the
   examples below. The purity of each enantiomer was monitored by a chiral HPLC method
   using the same mobile phase and the same stationary phase used for the separation to
   allow rapid determination of the purity. In each case both enantiomers were recoevered
   as concentrated solutions by evaporation under vacuum, either using a rotary evaporator
25 or falling film evaporators. In examples 1 to 3 the desired enantiomer is recovered as the
   raffinate. In example 4 the desired enantiomer is recovered as the extract. The chiral
   purity and yield reported are data measured after the SMB unit has been operated for at
   least 10 to 15 cycles to ensure steady state operations. Various operating conditions were
   tested to ensure high purity and high product yield. In examples 1 to 3, the separation
30 using the same stationary phase and mobile phase is tested on various SMB units with
   various column diameters. In example 4 the SMB is operated at two different operating

   -1-yllpropionitrile ((R)-12, free base). Method A. To a solution of (3R)-cyclopentyl-3
    {4-[7-(2-trimethylsilanylethoxymethyl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl]pyrazol-1
   yl}proprionitrile ((R)-10, 463 g, 1.06 mol, 98.6% ee) in acetonitrile (4.5 L) was added
   water (400 mL) followed immediately by lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF 4, 987.9 g, 10.5
 5 mol, 10.0 equiv) at room temperature. The reaction temperature was observed to decrease
   from ambient to 12 'C upon addition of the water and then increase to 33 'C during the
   addition of lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF4). The resulting reaction mixture was heated
   to reflux (about 80 'C) for overnight. An aliquot was quenched into ethyl acetate/water
   and checked by LCMS and TLC (95 : 5 ethyl acetate/methanol, v/v). When LCMS and
10 TLC analyses showed both the hydroxyl methyl intermediate ((R)-11) and fully de
   protected material ((R)-12, free base) produced but no starting material ((R)-10) left, the
   reaction mixture was cooled gradually to < 5 'C before a 20% aqueous solution of
   ammonium hydroxide (NH 40H, 450 mL) was added gradually to adjust the pH of the
   reaction mixture to 9 (checked with pH strips). The cold bath was removed and the
15 reaction mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred at room
   temperature for overnight. An aliquot was quenched into ethyl acetate/water and checked
   by LCMS and TLC (95 : 5 ethyl acetate/methanol, v/v) to confirm complete de
   protection. When LCMS and TLC showed the reaction was deemed complete, the
   reaction mixture was filtered and the solids were washed with acetonitrile (1 L). The
20 combined filtrates were then concentrated under reduce pressure, and the residue was
   partitioned between ethyl acetate (6 L) and half-saturated brine (3 L). The two layers
   were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 L). The
   combined organic layers were washed with half-saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ,
   3 L) and brine (3 L), dried over sodium sulfate (Na2 SO 4 ), and concentrated under reduced
25 pressure to give the crude product as an orange oil. The crude material was then purified
   by flash column chromatography (SiO 2 , 40 to 100% ethyl acetate/heptane gradient
   elution) to afford (3R)-cyclopentyl-3-[4-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)pyrazol-1

   mL), powder potassium carbonate (K2C0 3 , 23.56 g, 170.5 mmol, 2.6 equiv), 1-(1
   ethoxyethyl)-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole (14, 18.60 g,
   69.89 mmol, 1.06 equiv) at room temperature. The resulting mixture was degassed four
   times backfilling with nitrogen gas each time before being treated with
10 tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (244.2 mg, 0.21 mmol, 0.003 equiv) at room
   temperature. The resulting reaction mixture was degassed four times backfilling with
   nitrogen gas each time before being warmed to 80 'C for 4 - 8 h. When TLC and HPLC
   showed that the reaction was deemed complete, the reaction mixture was gradually
   cooled to room temperature and filtered through a short bed of Celite (10 g). The Celite
15 bed was washed with ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 20 mL). The two layers of the filtrate were
   separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 30 mL). The
   combined organic extracts were washed with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (20 mL),
   dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4), and concentrated under reduced pressure. The
   residue, which contains the crude desired Suzuki coupling product (15), was then
20 transferred to a 500 mL round bottom flask with THF (22 mL) for subsequent de
   protection reaction without further purification.
           A solution of crude Suzuki coupling product (15) in THF (22 mL) was treated
   with water (108 mL) and a solution of 10% aqueous HCl prepared by mixing 19.6 mL of
   concentrated HCl with 64 mL of H2 0 at room temperature. The resulting reaction
25 mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 - 6 h. When TLC and HPLC showed the
   de-protection reaction was deemed complete, a 30% aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
   solution prepared by dissolving 10.4 g of NaOH in 21.0 mL of H2 0 was added slowly to
   the reaction mixture while maintaining the temperature below 25 'C. The solid gradually
   dissolved and re-precipitated after 10 min. The mixture was stirred at room temperature
30 for 1 - 2 h before the solids were collected by filtration and washed with H2 0 (50 mL).
   The wet cake was transferred to a 250 mL three-necked flask and treated with acetonitrile

   in DME via large bore canula over 30 minutes at 5 - 12 0C. The resulting reaction
   mixture was heterogeneous. Following the addition, the cold bath was removed and the
   mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature and allowed to stir at room
   temperature for 1 hour before being cooled to 0 - 5 0C. Chloromethyl pivalate
10 (pivaloyloxymethyl chloride, POM-Cl, 112 ml, 0.752 mol, 1.1 equiv) was added
   dropwise into the reaction mixture over 30 minutes with stirring at 0 - 5 0 C. The addition
   of chloromethyl pivalate was mildly exothermic and the reaction temperature went up to
   as high as 14 0C. After addition of chloromethyl pivalate, the cooling bath was removed
   and the reaction mixture was allowed to return to room temperature and stirred at room
15 temperature for 90 min. When the reaction was deemed complete after confirmed by
   HPLC, the reaction was carefully quenched with water (100 mL). And this quenched
   reaction mixture, which contains crude POM-protected chlorodeazapurine (3f), was used
   in the subsequent Suzuki coupling reaction without further work-up and purification.
           To the quenched reaction mixture, which contains crude POM-protected
20 chlorodeazapurine (3f) made as described above was added 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2
   dioxaborolan-2-yl) -1H-pyrazole (14, 200 g, 0.75 mol, 1.10 equiv) and potassium
   carbonate (K 2 CO 3 , 189 g, 1.37 mol, 2.0 equiv) at room temperature. The resulting

   before being treated with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) (7.9 g, 0.68 mmol,
25 0.01 equiv) and the resulting reaction mixture was heated at reflux (about 82 0 C) for 10
   hours. When the reaction was deemed complete by TLC (1:1 hexanes/ethyl acetate) and
   LCMS,     the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with ethyl acetate
   (2 L) and water (1 L). The two layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was
   extracted with ethyl acetate (500 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with
30 water (2 x 1 L) and brine (1 L) before being concentrated under reduced pressure to

   with a IM aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (2 L). The mixture was
   concentrated under reduced pressure to remove most of THF and the resulting suspension

            A chiral HPLC method was developed for chiral purity evaluation of both
   enantiomers of SEM-protected compound ((R)-29 and (S)-29) using a Chiralcel *OD-H
   column (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 gm), purchased from Chiral Technologies, Inc.. The two
15 enantiomers of SEM-protected compound are separated with a resolution greater than 4.0
   by using a mobile phase of 15% ethanol and 85% hexanes at room temperature with a
   flow rate of 1 mL/min. The UV detection wavelength is 220 nm. The retention times for
   (S)-enantiomer ((S)-29) and (R)-enantiomer ((R)-29) are 9.4 minutes and 12.4 minutes,
   respectively.

   in ethyl cyanoacetate(2, 1.55 Kg, 13.75mol, 5.0 equiv). Upon addition of the aldehyde to
   the reaction mixture, the resulting solution turned yellow. The reaction mixture was
   slowly heated to 140-150 0C collecting the volatile material in a Dean Stark trap. This
   material was discarded. Fairly vigorous gas evolution was observed to begin at 140 C.
10 The reaction was monitored by G.C. and was observed to be near completion at 90
   minutes. Heating was continued for an additional 45 minutes when gas evolution was
   observed to have ceased. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and
   partitioned between 4 L water and 2 L methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The layers were
   separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with an additional 2 L of MTBE. The
15 aqueous layer was checked for product by G.C. then discarded. The organic layers were
   dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuum. The crude product was

   0.5 hr) crystallization occurred and the reaction temperature was increased from 0 to 10
   'C. Addition was stopped and the mixture was allowed to recool to ~2 'C. The remaining
   DMF was added over 2.5 hr at < 8'C. The suspension became very thick making stirring
 5 difficult. When addition of DMF was complete, the mixture was stirred 0.5 hr at 3-5 'C.
   4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (8, 250 g, 2.232 mol) was added portion wise as a solid. After
   about one third of 4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine was added the reaction mixture became more
   mobile and a slow exothermic phenomena occurred with the reaction temperature
   increasing to ~12 'C over 0.5 hr. The remaining 4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine was added
10 portion wise over 0.25 hr with the reaction temperature increasing from 12 to 27 'C. The
   reaction temperature was maintained at 25-27 'C with intermittent cooling during which
   time the yellow suspension became thinner, then thicker once again. After the exothermic
   phenomenon subsided in about 1 hr, the reaction mixture was heated slowly. At about 55
   'C the reaction mixture became extremely thick and the second mild exothermic
15 phenomenon was occurred. The heating mantle was removed while the reaction
   temperature continued to increase to about 63 'C and remained at this temperature for
   several minutes before dropping. Heating of the mixture was resumed until gentle reflux
   (about 100 C) was attained. At about 95 'C a steady, fairly rapid evolution of HCl began
   and the reaction mixture gradually thinned and darkened. After about 0.5 hr a clear,
20 brown solution developed with the reflux temperature slowly increasing to 115 'C over
   1.25 hr. After a total of 2.5 hr at reflux, the reaction mixture was cooled to room
   temperature and stirred overnight. Excess POCl 3 (as much as possible) was removed

   poured very slowly into cold H20 (5 L) in a 20 L separation funnel, adding ice as needed
25 to maintain the aqueous mixture near room temperature. The aqueous mixture was
   extracted with EtOAc (2 x 3 L, 1 x 2 L). The combined EtOAc extracts were washed with

   reaction temperature slowly increased from 20 to 26 'C and a yellow suspension formed.
   Mild cooling was applied to maintain the reaction temperature at < 26 'C. The suspension
15 was stirred 3.5 hr at room temperature before the solids were collected by filtration. The
   solids were washed with EtOAc (1 L). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced

 5 reaction temperature increased from -3 to 13 'C and a brown color developed. When the
   reaction temperature dropped to 10 'C, the cooling bath was removed and the reaction
   mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred 42 hr. The reaction
   mixture was cooled to -2 'C before being quenched by the slow addition of saturated

   remove insoluble material. The filtrate was cooled in an ice/brine bath, adjusted to pH 8
15 with a 6N aqueous NaOH solution and extracted with EtOAc (3 x 1 L). The combined
   EtOAc extracts were washed with brine (1 L), dried over Na 2 SO 4 , stirred with charcoal
   (10 g) and silica gel (10 g) for 1 hr. The mixture was filtered through Celite, washing the
   Celite pad with EtOAc (1 L). The filtrate was concentrated, co-evaporating residual
   EtOAc with heptane (500 mL). The resulting tan solid was pumped under high vacuum
20 for 2 hr to afford crude 6-chloro-5-(2-methoxyvinyl)pyrimidin-4-ylamine (12, 72.3 g,
   136.2 g theoretical, 53. 1%). The crude 12 was used in the following reaction without
