                                           ABSTRACT
The invention relates to inhibition of wild-type and certain mutant forms of human histone
methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex which catalyzes the
mono- through tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27). In one embodiment the
inhibition is selective for the mutant form of the EZH2, such that trimethylation of H3- K27,
which is associated with certain cancers, is inhibited. The methods can be used to treat
cancers including follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Also
provided are methods for identifying small molecule selective inhibitors of the mutant forms
of EZH2 and also methods for determining responsiveness to an EZH2 inhibitor in a subject.

                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         This invention relates to inhibition of wild-type and certain mutant forms of human
histone methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex which catalyzes
the mono- through tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27), methods for treating
cancers including follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and
methods for determining responsiveness to an EZH2 inhibitor in a subject.
                                         BACKGROUND
         In eukaryotic cells DNA is packaged with histones to form chromatin.
Approximately 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped twice around an octamer of histones (two
each of histones 2A, 2B, 3 and 4) to form a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin.
Changes in the ordered structure of chromatin can lead to alterations in transcription of
associated genes. This process is highly controlled because changes in gene expression
patterns can profoundly affect fundamental cellular processes, such as differentiation,
proliferation and apoptosis. Control of changes in chromatin structure (and hence of
transcription) is mediated by covalent modifications to histones, most notably of their N
 terminal tails. These modifications are often referred to as epigenetic because they can lead
 to heritable changes in gene expression, but they do not affect the sequence of the DNA itself.
 Covalent modifications (for example, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and
 ubiquitination) of the side chains of amino acids are enzymatically mediated.
         The selective addition of methyl groups to specific amino acid sites on histones is
 controlled by the action of a unique family of enzymes known as histone methyltransferases
 (HMTs). The level of expression of a particular gene is influenced by the presence or
 absence of one or more methyl groups at a relevant histone site. The specific effect of a
                                                   1

    WO 2012/034132                                                           PCT/US2011/051258
methyl group at a particular histone site persists until the methyl group is removed by a
histone demethylase, or until the modified histone is replaced through nucleosome turnover.
In a like manner, other enzyme classes can decorate DNA and histones with other chemical
species, and still other enzymes can remove these species to provide control of gene
expression.
        The orchestrated collection of biochemical systems behind transcriptional regulation
must be tightly controlled in order for cell growth and differentiation to proceed optimally.
Disease states result when these controls are disrupted by aberrant expression and/or activity
of the enzymes responsible for DNA and histone modification. In human cancers, for
example, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that dysregulated epigenetic enzyme
activity contributes to the uncontrolled cell proliferation associated with cancer as well as
other cancer-relevant phenotypes such as enhanced cell migration and invasion. Beyond
cancer, there is growing evidence for a role of epigenetic enzymes in a number of other
human diseases, including metabolic diseases (such as diabetes), inflammatory diseases (such
as Crohn's disease), neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease), and
cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, selectively modulating the aberrant action of epigenetic
enzymes holds great promise for the treatment of a range of diseases.
Histone Methyltransferase EZH2
        Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins are known to be part of the
cellular memory system. Francis et al. (2001) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2:409-2 1; Simon et al.
(2002) Curr Opin Genet Dev 12:210-8. Both groups of proteins are involved in maintaining
the spatial patterns of homeotic box (Hox) gene expression, which are established early in
embryonic development by transiently expressed segmentation genes. In general, PcG
proteins are transcriptional repressors that maintain the "off state," and trxG proteins are
transcriptional activators that maintain the "on state." Because members of PcG and trxG
proteins contain intrinsic histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity, PcG and trxG proteins
may participate in cellular memory through methylation of core histones. Beisel et al. (2002)

proteins function in at least two distinct protein complexes, the Polycomb repressive complex
1 (PRC1) and the ESC-E(Z) complex (also known as Polycomb repressive complex 2
(PRC2)), although the compositions of the complexes may be dynamic. Otte et al. (2003)
Curr Opin Genet Dev 13:448-54. Studies in Drosophila (Czermin et al. (supra); Muller et al.
(supra)) and mammalian cells (Cao et al. (supra); Kuzmichev et al. (supra)) have
demonstrated that the ESC-E(Z)/EED-EZH2 (i.e., PRC2) complexes have intrinsic histone
methyltransferase activity. Although the compositions of the complexes isolated by different
groups are slightly different, they generally contain EED, EZH2, SUZ12, and RbAp48 or
Drosophilahomologs thereof. However, a reconstituted complex comprising only EED,
EZH2, and SUZ12 retains histone methyltransferase activity for lysine 27 of histone H3. US
Patent 7,563,589 (incorporated by reference).
         Of the various proteins making up PRC2 complexes, EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste
Homolog 2) is the catalytic subunit. The catalytic site of EZH2 in turn is present within a
SET domain, a highly conserved sequence motif (named after Su(var)3-9, Enhancer of Zeste,
Trithorax) that is found in several chromatin-associated proteins, including members of both
the Trithorax group and Polycomb group. SET domain is characteristic of all known histone
lysine methyltransferases except the H3-K79 methyltransferase DOT1.
         In addition to Hox gene silencing, PRC2-mediated histone H3-K27 methylation has
been shown to participate in X-inactivation. Plath et al. (2003) Science 300:131-5; Silva et
al. (2003) Dev Cell 4:481-95. Recruitment of the PRC2 complex to Xi and subsequent
trimethylation on histone H3-K27 occurs during the initiation stage of X-inactivation and is
dependent on Xist RNA. Furthermore, EZH2 and its associated histone H3-K27
methyltransferase activity was found to mark differentially the pluripotent epiblast cells and
the differentiated trophectoderm. Erhardt et al. (2003) Development 130:4235-48).
         Consistent with a role of EZH2 in maintaining the epigenetic modification patterns of
pluripotent epiblast cells, Cre-mediated deletion of EZH2 results in loss of histone H3-K27
methylation in the cells. Erhardt et al. (supra). Further, studies in prostate and breast cancer
cell lines and tissues have revealed a strong correlation between the levels of EZH2 and
SUZ12 and the invasiveness of these cancers (Bracken et al. (2003) EMBO J22:5323-35;
Kirmizis et al. (2003) Mol Cancer Ther 2:113-21; Kleer et al. (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA
100:11606-11; Varambally et al. (2002) Nature 419:624-9), indicating that dysfunction of the
PRC2 complex may contribute to cancer.

        Recently, somatic mutations of tyrosine 641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S and Y641H) of
EZH2 were reported to be associated with follicular lymphoma (FL) and the germinal center
B cell-like (GCB) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Morin et al. (2010)
Nat Genet 42:181-5. In all cases, occurrence of the mutant EZH2 gene was found to be
heterozygous, and expression of both wild-type and mutant alleles was detected in the mutant
samples profiled by transcriptome sequencing. It was also demonstrated that all of the
mutant forms of EZH2 could be incorporated into the multi-protein PRC2 complex, but that
the resulting complexes lacked the ability to catalyze methylation of the H3-K27 equivalent
residue of a peptidic substrate. Hence, it was concluded that the disease-associated changes
at Tyr641 of EZH2 resulted in loss of function with respect to EZH2-catalyzed H3-K27
methylation.
                             SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
        One aspect of the present invention relates to modulating the activity of the wild-type
and mutant histone methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex
which catalyzes the mono- through tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27). For
example, the present invention relates to inhibiting the activity of certain mutant forms of
EZH2. The mutant forms of EZH2 include a substitution of another amino acid residue for
tyrosine 641 (Y641, also Tyr641) of wild-type EZH2.
        Another aspect of the present invention relates to determining a patient's
responsiveness to an EZH2 inhibitor according to the dimethylated H3-K27me2 level, or
preferably according to the levels of dimethylated H3-K27me2 and trimethylated H3
K27me3. For example, cells with low or undetectable level of dimethylated H3-K27me2 or
cells with low ratio of H3-K27me2/me3 are much more responsive to the anti-proliferative
effect of an EZH2 inhibitor than cells with the more typical higher H3-K27me2/me3 ratio.
        An aspect of the invention is a method of inhibiting in a subject conversion of H3
K27 to trimethylated H3-K27. The method comprises the step of administering to a subject
expressing a Y641 mutant of EZH2 a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of
EZH2, wherein the inhibitor inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of EZH2, thereby
inhibiting conversion of H3-K27 to trimethylated H3-K27 in the subject.
        In this and other aspects of the invention, in one embodiment the inhibitor inhibits
histone methyltransferase activity of the Y641 mutant of EZH2.

                           BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
         Figure 1 is two graphs establishing that B-cell lymphoma-associated mutants of
EZH2 are active histone methyltransferases. In vitro methyltransferase activity of PRC2
                                                      10

    WO 2012/034132                                                          PCT/US2011/051258
complexes containing wild-type and various Y641 mutants of EZH2 was measured as (A)
methyl transfer reactions using a peptide (H3 21-44) as substrate, and (B) methyl transfer
reactions using avian nucleosomes as substrate. Symbols: wild-type (e), Y641F (o), Y641H
(o), Y641N (m), and Y641S (A). CPM is counts per minute, referring to scintillation
counting as a result of 3H radiation.
         Figure 2 is four graphs establishing that PRC2 complexes containing mutant EZH2
preferentially catalyze di- and tri-methylation of histone H3-K27. (A) Methyltransferase
activity of mutant and wild-type (WT) complexes on unmethylated peptide (open bars),
monomethylated peptide (hashed bars), and dimethylated peptide (closed bars). (B) Affinity
for peptide substrates as judged by K1 /2 is similar across all peptide methylation states for
PRC2 complexes containing wild-type (o),Y641F (.), Y641H (o), Y641N (i), and Y641S
(A)  EZH2. Note that the variation in K1 /2 values across all substrates and all enzyme forms is
less than 3.5-fold. For any particular methylation state of substrate the variation in K1 / 2 value
is less than 2-fold. (C) Enzyme turnover number (kcat) varies with substrate methylation
status in opposing ways for WT and Y641 mutants of EZH2. The kcat decreases with
increasing K27 methylation states for wild-type (o), but increases for Y641F (.), Y641H (w),
Y641N (m), and Y641S (A) mutants of EZH2. (D) Catalytic efficiency (kcat/K        12 ) decreases
with increasing K27 methylation states for wild-type (o), but increases for Y641F (e), Y641H
(o), Y641N (m), and Y641S (A) mutants of EZH2. In panels B-D, the lines drawn to connect
the data points are not intended to imply any mathematical relationship; rather, they are
merely intended to serve as visual aides.
         Figure 3A is a trio of graphs depicting predicted relative levels of H3-K27me3 (top
panel), H3-K27me2 (middle panel), and H3-K27mel (bottom panel) for cells containing
different EZH2 mutants. Simulations were performed using a coupled enzyme steady state
velocity equation and the steady state kinetic parameters shown in Table 1. All values are
relative to the homozygous WT EZH2-containing cells and assume saturating concentrations
of intracellular SAM, relative to Km and intracellular nucleosome concentrations similar to
Km.
         Figure 3B is a series of Western blot analyses of relative patterns of H3-K27
methylation status for lymphoma cell lines homozygous for WT EZH2, or heterozygous for
the indicated EZH2 Y641 mutation. Panels from top to bottom depict the results of probing
with antibodies specific for the following: total EZH2; H3-K27me3; H3-K27me2; H3

    WO 2012/034132                                                        PCT/US2011/051258
K27mel; and total histone H3 as loading control.
        Figure 4 depicts selected proposed mechanisms leading to aberrantly high levels of
trimethylation on histone H3-K27 in cancer. These include: a) mutation of Y641 in EZH2
resulting in a change in substrate preference from the nonmethylated to the mono- and di
methylated histone H3-K27; b) overexpression of EZH2; c) mutations in UTX that inactivate
enzyme function, causing a decrease in demethylation of H3-K27me3; and d) overexpression
of the PRC2 complex subunit PHF19/PCL3 that leads to increases in recruitment of the PRC2
complex to specific genes and an increase in histone H3-K27 trimethylation. In all four
models the alteration leads to aberrant histone H3-K27 trimethylation in the proximal
promoter regions of genes resulting in transcriptional repression of key genes in cancer.
        Figure 5 depicts a SDS-PAGE gel showing that the expression levels of each of the
five-component PRC2 complexes are similar with mutant and wild-type EZH2.
        Figure 6 is a pair of tables showing that mutant and wild-type (WT) PRC2 complexes
display strong substrate preference for H3-K27-containing peptides. Each enzyme was tested
against a panel of overlapping 15-mer peptides covering all of H3 and H4. Activity was
measured as velocity (CPM per minute), and the reported value represents the mean of two
independent determinations for each reaction. For all the complexes the most favored peptide
was H3:16-30. WT complex had greater than 6-fold more activity against this peptide than
any of the mutant complexes.
        Figure 7 is a graph depicting inhibitory potency of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
(SAH) against EZH2 WT and Y641 mutants of EZH2. The X axis shows log concentration
of SAH; theY axis shows percent inhibition.
        Figure 8 is a graph depicting inhibitory potency of Compound 75 against EZH2 WT
and Y641 mutants of EZH2. The X axis shows log concentration of Compound 75; the Y
axis shows percent inhibition.
        Figure 9 depicts a Western Blot analysis of relative levels of H3-K27mel, me2 and
me3 in a cell line pane, including multiple DLBCL lines expressing WT or Y641 mutatnt
EZH2. a) Histones were extracted from the cell lines shown, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on
a 4-20% gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies to Histone
H3, H3-K27mel, me2, or me3. EZH2 levels were determined by preparing whole cell lysates
from the cell lines shown, treating as above and probing with an antibody to EZH2; b)
Histones were extracted from the cell lines shown and treated as above, except EZH2 levels

were not determined.
        Figure 10 depicts an immunocytochemistry analysis of H3 and H3-K27me3 levels in
a panel of WT and Y641 mutant lymphoma cell lines. Cell pellets from the indicated cell
lines were fixed and embedded in paraffin. Slides were prepared and levels of H3 and H3
K27me3 were evaluated by immunocytochemistry using antibodies to histone H3, or H3
K27me3.
        Figure 11 depicts an immunocytochemistry analysis of H3 and H3-K27me2 levels in
a panel of WT and Y641 mutant lymphoma cell lines. Cell pellets from the indicated cell
lines were fixed and embedded in paraffin. Slides were prepared and levels of H3 and H3
K27me2 were evaluated by immunocytochemistry using antibodies to histone H3, or H3
K27me2.
        Figure 12 is a graph depicting the inhibition of global H3-K27me3 levels by EZH2
inhibitor treatment in Y641 mutant WSU-DLCL2 cells. WSU-DLCL2 cells were treated for 4
days with the indicated concentrations of EZH2 inhibitor A or B. Following compound
treatment, histones were extracted, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 4-20% gel, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies to Histone H3, or H3-K27me3.
        Figure 13 is a graph showing that the EZH2 inhibitors can block proliferation of a
Y641 mutant WSU-DLCL2 cells, but has little effect on non Y641 mutant OCI-LY19 cells.
Cells were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of EZH2 inhibitor A or B
for eleven days. Vehicle treated (DMSO) cells were included as controls. Cell number and
viability was determined using the Guava Viacount assay in a Guava EasyCyte Plus
instrument. Cells were split and media and compound was replenished every 3-4 days.
        Figure 14 is a graph showing the presence of an EZH2 (Y641) mutation and/or high
H3-K27me3 and low H3-K27me2 levels predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors. Cell lines
were maintained in the presence of increasing concentrations of one EZH2 inhibitor up to 25
pM. Viable cells counts were used to derive IC90 values after 11 days of treatment. Results
are plotted with cell lines segregated according to EZH2 mutational status (A), or segregated
according to H3-K27me2 and H3-K27me3 levels (B). In both plots, the line shows the
average IC90 values from the indicated cell line group.

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        Chromatin structure is important in gene regulation and epigenetic inheritance. Post
translational modifications of histones are involved in the establishment and maintenance of
higher-order chromatin structure; for example, the tails of certain core histones are modified
by acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ribosylation and/or ubiquitination.
        EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that is the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex
which catalyzes the mono- through tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27).
Histone H3-K27 trimethylation is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific
genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification. This trimethylation is known to
be a cancer marker with altered expression in cancer, such as prostate cancer (see, e.g., U.S.
Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0175736; incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety). EZH2 belongs to the Polycomb group protein family (PcG). The polycomb group
proteins help in maintaining cellular identity by transcriptional repression of target genes.

Varambally et al. (2002) Nature 419(6907):624-9. EZH2 is up-regulated in aggressive breast
tumors and is a mediator of a pro-invasive phenotype. Kleer et al. (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci
USA 100(20):11606-11.      Overexpression of EZH2 in immortalized human mammary
epithelial cell lines promotes anchorage-independent growth and cell invasion. Kleer et al.
(supra). EZH2-mediated cell invasion required an intact SET domain and histone
deacetylase activity. Previous studies provided evidence for a functional link between
dysregulated EZH2 expression, transcriptional repression, and neoplastic transformation.

        An aspect of the present invention relates to inhibiting the activity of EZH2, including
certain mutant forms of EZH2. In one embodiment the present invention relates to inhibiting
selectively the activity of certain mutant forms of EZH2.
        Point mutations of the EZH2 gene at a single amino acid residue (Tyr64 1, herein
referred to as Y641) of EZH2 have been reported to be linked to subsets of human B-cell
lymphoma. Morin et al. (2010) Nat Genet 42(2):181-5. In particular, Morin et al. reported
that somatic mutations of tyrosine 641 (Y641F, Y641H, Y641N, and Y641S) of EZH2 were
associated with follicular lymphoma (FL) and the germinal center B cell-like (GCB) subtype
                                                14

    WO 2012/034132                                                         PCT/US2011/051258
of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The mutant allele is always found associated
with a wild-type allele (heterozygous) in disease cells, and the mutations were reported to
ablate the enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex for methylating an unmodified peptide
substrate.
         It has now been unexpectedly discovered that the wild-type (WT) EZH2 enzyme
displays greatest catalytic efficiency (kcat/K) for the zero- to mono-methylation reaction of
H3-K27 and lesser efficiency for subsequent (mono- to di- and di- to tri-methylation)
reactions; whereas, in stark contrast, the disease-associated Y641 mutations display very
limited ability to perform the first methylation reaction but have enhanced catalytic efficiency
for the subsequent reactions relative to wild-type enzyme. These results imply that the
malignant phenotype of disease exploits the combined activities of a H3-K27 mono
methylating enzyme (PRC2 containing WT EZH2 or EZH1) together with PRC2 containing
mutant EZH2 for augmented conversion of H3-K27 to the tri-methylated form (H3-K27me3).
         While not intending to be bound by any one theory, it is hypothesized that the
mutation of Y641 to phenylalanine (F), histidine (H), asparagine (N), or serine (S) in EZH2
may facilitate multiple rounds of H3-K27 methylation by impacting the H-bonding pattern
and/or steric crowding in the active site of the enzyme-bisubstrate ternary complex, affecting
the formation of a proper water channel for deprotonation of the reacting lysine. Zhang et al.
(2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:5728-32. This inference is drawn by analogy to the
crystallographic and molecular dynamic simulation results seen for tyrosine mutation in the
related protein lysine methyltransferases LSMT, Dim-5 and SET7/9.
         For example, when tyrosine 245 of recombinant SET7/9 was mutated to alanine a
change in substrate specificity was observed. Dillon et al. (2005) Genome Biol 6:227. The
ability of the Y245A mutant SET7/9 to methylate an unmodified 20-residue peptide,
representing the sequence surrounding H3-K4, was reduced to ca. 20% of WT enzyme. Xiao
et al. (2003) Nature 421:652-6. At the same time, the ability of the Y245A mutant to further
methylate H3-K4mel and H3-K4me2 peptides was greatly augmented (ca. 7-fold and 5-fold,
respectively) relative to WT enzyme. In contrast to the instant disclosure in respect of
mutations of Y641 of EZH2, however, mutation of SET7/9 Y245 to phenylalanine did not
enhance mono-to-di nor di-to-tri methylation of the peptide; rather, the Y245F mutant of
SET7/9 displayed minimal catalytic activity for all peptidic substrates. Similarly, the wild
type enzyme G9a can dimethylate H3-K9 but is unable to perform the di-to-tri methylation
reaction. Yet, when tyrosine 1067 of G9a (analogous to Y641 of EZH2) is mutated to
                                                15

phenylalanine, the enzyme now gains the ability to trimethylate H3-K9. Wu, H. et al. (2010)

        The tolerance for multiple Y641 mutations in EZH2 suggests that a release of steric
crowding may allow greater access for proper alignment of the larger dimethyl lysine as the
substrate for the di-to-tri methylation reaction. Crystallographic analysis of the protein
                                                21

    WO 2012/034132                                                          PCT/US2011/051258
methyltransferases SET7/9 and G9a reveals that the side chain hydroxyls of the active site
tyrosine residues are involved in H-bonding interactions directly with the amine of the
methyl-accepting lysine, or indirectly through an intervening water molecule. While the
larger active site of the Y641 mutants is favorable for di- and tri-methylation, the loss of the
tyrosine hydroxyl hydrogen bond acceptor may result in an unfavorable orientation of the
active site for initial methyl transfer to the lysine amine.
        The implications of the present results for human disease are made clear by the data
summarized in Table 1 (see below). Cells heterozygous for EZH2 would be expected to
display a malignant phenotype due to the efficient formation of H3-K27me l by the WT
enzyme and the efficient, subsequent transition of this progenitor species to H3-K27me2,
and, especially, H3-K27me3, by the mutant enzyme form(s).
        It has been reported that H3-K27mel formation is not exclusively dependent on WT
EZH2 catalysis. Knockout studies of EZH2 and of another PRC2 subunit, EED, have
demonstrated H3-K27me l formation can be catalyzed by PRC2 complexes containing either
EZH2 or the related protein EZH1 as the catalytic subunit. Shen, X. et al. (2008) Mol Cell
32:491-502. Hence, catalytic coupling between the mutant EZH2 species and PRC2
complexes containing either WT-EZH2 or WT-EZH1 would suffice to augment H3
K27me2/3 formation, and thus produce the attendant malignant phenotype. The data
therefore suggest that the malignant phenotype of follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)of the germinal center B cell (GCB) subtype, associated with
expression of mutant forms of EZH2, is the result of an overall gain of function with respect
to formation of the trimethylated form of H3-K27. This interpretation of the data also helps
to reconcile the existence of cancer-associated overexpression of EZH2 or PRC2 associated
proteins (e.g., PHF19/PCL3) and also loss-of-function genotypes for the histone H3-K27
demethylase UTX. Loss of UTX activity would be enzymatically equivalent to a gain of
function for EZH2, in either situation resulting in greater steady state levels of tri-methylated
H3-K27 in cancer cells (Figure 4).
        The mono-, di-, and tri- methylation states of histone H3-K27 are associated with
different functions in transcriptional control. Histone H3-K27 monomethylation is associated

(2007) Genes Dev 18:1592-1605; Bernstein et al. (2006) Cell 125:315-26. Taken together,
alterations in the PRC2 complex activity reported in cancer, including the Y641 mutation of
EZH2, are predicted to result in an increase in the trimethylated state of histone H3-K27 and
thus to result in transcriptional repression.
         Another discovery of the present invention is that cells expressing Y641 mutant EZH2
are, in general, more sensitive to small molecule EZH2 inhibitors than cells expressing WT
EZH2. Specifically, cells expressing Y641 mutant EZH2 show reduced growing, dividing or
proliferation, or even undergo apoptosis or necrosis after the treatment of EZH2 inhibitors.
In contrast, cells expressing WT EZH2 are not responsive to the anti-proliferative effect of
the EZH2 inhibitors (Figures 13 and 14). Another surprising discovery of the present
invention is that it is possible for cells expressing WT EZH2 to display a similar methylation
status of histone H3-K27 as cells expressing Y641 EZH2, and that this methylation status can
also correlate with sensitivity to an EZH2 inhibitor independently of EZH2 mutational status.
In general, global H3-K27me3 levels are similar or higher in Y641 mutant containing cell
lines than in cell lines expressing WT EZH2; however levels of H3-K27me2 are dramatically
lower in EZH2 Y641 mutant cell lines and certain wild type cell lines, such as the Pfeiffer
cell line than in other wild type cell lines (Figures 9, 10 and 11). Thus the ratio of H3
K27me2/me3 signal in Y641 mutant lines and the Pfeiffer cell line is much lower than that
observed in other WT lines. The present data further demonstrate that cell lines with low H3
K27me2 signal and similar or higher H3-K27me3 signal relative to typical WT EZH2
expressing cells lines are more sensitive to small molecule EZH2 inhibitors. Specifically,
cells with a lowH3-K27me2signal and a normal or high H3K27me3 signal stop dividing or
even die after treatment with EZH2 inhibitors (Figures 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14). In contrast,
cells with a higher ratio of H3-K27me2/me3 signal are not responsive to the anti-proliferative
effect of the EZH2 inhibitors (Figures 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14). The instant invention provides
previously unknown and unexpected results that identifying EZH2 Y641 mutations in patient
tumors and/or detecting low levels of H3-K27me2 and normal or high levels of H3-K27me3
relative to a control, through use of techniques such as western blot, MS or IHC in a patient
can be used to identify which patient will respond to an EZH2 inhibitor treatment.
         EZH2 and other protein methyltransferases have been suggested to be attractive
targets for drug discovery. Copeland et al. (2009) Nat Rev Drug Discov 8:724-32; Copeland
et al. (2010) Curr Opin Chem Biol 14(4):505-10; Pollock et al. (2010) DrugDiscovery
Today: Therapeutic Strategies 6(1):71-9. The present data also suggest an experimental

strategy for development of FL and GCB lymphoma-specific drugs. As the differences in
substrate recognition between the WT and disease-associated mutants derive from transition
state interactions, small molecule inhibitors that selectively mimic the transition state of the
mutant EZH2 over that of the WT enzyme should prove to be effective in blocking H3-K27
methylation in mutation-bearing cells. Inhibitors of this type would be expected to display a
large therapeutic index, as target-mediated toxicity would be minimal for any cells bearing
only the WT enzyme. Transition state mimicry has proved to be an effective strategy for
drug design in many disease areas. See, for example, Copeland, R. A. Enzymes: A Practical
Introduction to Structure, Mechanism and Data Analysis. 2nd ed, (Wiley, 2000).
         The present results point to a previously unrecognized, surprising dependency on
enzymatic coupling between enzymes that perform H3-K27 mono-methylation and certain
mutant forms of EZH2 for pathogenesis in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma. While not intending to be bound by any one theory, it is believed the data
constitute the first example of a human disease that is dependent on such coupling of catalytic
activity between normal (WT) and disease-associated mutant (Y641) enzymes.
         An aspect of the invention is a method for inhibiting in a subject conversion of H3
K27 to trimethylated H3-K27. The inhibition can involve inhibiting in a subject conversion
of unmethylated H3-K27 to monomethylated H3-K27, conversion of monomethylated H3
K27 to dimethylated H3-K27, conversion of dimethylated H3-K27 to trimethylated H3-K27,
or any combination thereof, including, for example, conversion of monomethylated H3-K27
to dimethylated H3-K27 and conversion of dimethylated H3-K27 to trimethylated H3-K27.
As used herein, unmethylated H3-K27 refers to histone H3 with no methyl group covalently
linked to the amino group of lysine 27. As used herein, monomethylated H3-K27 refers to
histone H3 with a single methyl group covalently linked to the amino group of lysine 27.
Monomethylated H3-K27 is also referred to herein as H3-K27mel. As used herein,
dimethylated H3-K27 refers to histone H3 with two methyl groups covalently linked to the
amino group of lysine 27. Dimethylated H3-K27 is also referred to herein as H3-K27me2.
As used herein, trimethylated H3-K27 refers to histone H3 with three methyl groups
covalently linked to the amino group of lysine 27. Trimethylated H3-K27 is also referred to
herein as H3-K27me3.
         Histone H3 is a 136 amino acid long protein, the sequence of which is known. See,
for example, GenBank Accession No. CAB02546, the contents of which is incorporated
herein by reference. As disclosed further herein, in addition to full-length histone H3,

    WO 2012/034132                                                          PCT/US2011/051258
peptide fragments of histone H3 comprising the lysine residue corresponding to K27 of full
length histone H3 can be used as substrate for EZH2 (and likewise for mutant forms of
EZH2) to assess conversion of H3-K27ml to H3-K27m2 and conversion of H3-K27m2 to
H3-K27m3. In one embodiment, such peptide fragment corresponds to amino acid residues
21-44 of histone H3. Such peptide fragment has the amino acid sequence
LATKAARKSAPATGGVKKPHRYRP (SEQ ID NO: 13).
        The method involves administering to a subject expressing a Y641 mutant of EZH2 a
therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of EZH2, wherein the inhibitor inhibits
histone methyltransferase activity of EZH2, thereby inhibiting conversion of H3-K27 to
trimethylated H3-K27 in the subject. In one embodiment a subject expressing a Y641 mutant
of EZH2 refers to a subject having a detectable amount of a Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide.
In one embodiment a subject expressing a Y641 mutant of EZH2 refers to a subject having a
detectable amount of a nucleic acid encoding a Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide.
        A Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide can be detected using any suitable method. For
example, a Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide can be detected using an antibody that binds
specifically to the Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide or to a peptide fragment that is
characteristic of the Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide. A peptide fragment that is
characteristic of the Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide may include, for example, a SET
domain as provided in SEQ ID NO: 6, except for substitution of Y641 by an amino acid
residue other than tyrosine. In another embodiment, a peptide fragment that is characteristic
of the Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide may include, for example, a 10-113 amino acid
fragment of the SET domain as provided in SEQ ID NO: 6, except for substitution of Y641
by an amino acid residue other than tyrosine, provided that the fragment includes the amino
acid residue corresponding to Y64 1. It is expected that the epitope for such antibody includes
the amino acid residue corresponding to Y641 of wild-type EZH2. An antibody is considered
to bind specifically to the Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide or to a peptide fragment that is
characteristic of the Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide if it binds to that mutant EZH2
polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof but not to the corresponding wild-type EZH2
polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof. In one embodiment, such antibody is considered to
bind specifically to the Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide or to a peptide fragment that is
characteristic of the Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide if it binds to that mutant EZH2
polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof with an affinity that is at least ca. 100-fold greater
than for the corresponding wild-type EZH2 polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof. In one
                                               25

    WO 2012/034132                                                          PCT/US2011/051258
embodiment, such antibody is considered to bind specifically to the Y641 mutant EZH2
polypeptide or to a peptide fragment that is characteristic of the Y641 mutant EZH2
polypeptide if it binds to that mutant EZH2 polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof with an
affinity that is at least ca. 1000-fold greater than for the corresponding wild-type EZH2
polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof. The antibody can be used, for example, in an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or Western blot assay.
        In one embodiment the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody
can be prepared according to conventional methods well known in the art. See, for example,
K6hler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256 (5517):495-7.
        As another example, a Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide can be detected using mass
spectrometry (MS), e.g., electrospray ionization coupled with time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) or
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization coupled with time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). Such
methods are well known in the art. The analysis will involve identification of one or more
peptide fragments comprising the mutation of interest, for example, a peptide 12 to 24 amino
acids long comprising a sequence spanning the amino acid corresponding to Y641 in wild
type EZH2.
        A nucleic acid encoding a Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide or a peptide fragment that
is characteristic of the Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide can be detected using any suitable
method. For example, a nucleic acid encoding a Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide can be
detected using whole-genome resequencing or target region resequencing (the latter also
known as targeted resequencing) using suitably selected sources of DNA and polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) primers in accordance with methods well known in the art. See, for
example, Bentley (2006) Curr Opin Genet Dev. 16:545-52, and Li et al. (2009) Genome Res
19:1124-32. The method typically and generally entails the steps of genomic DNA
purification, PCR amplification to amplify the region of interest, cycle sequencing,
sequencing reaction cleanup, capillary electrophoresis, and data analysis. High quality PCR
primers to cover region of interest are designed using in silico primer design tools. Cycle
sequencing is a simple method in which successive rounds of denaturation, annealing, and
extension in a thermal cycler result in linear amplification of extension products. The
products are typically terminated with a fluorescent tag that identifies the terminal nucleotide
base as G, A, T, or C. Unincorporated dye terminators and salts that may compete for
capillary eletrophoretic injection are removed by washing. During capillary electrophoresis,
the products of the cycle sequencing reaction migrate through capillaries filled with polymer.

    WO 2012/034132                                                         PCT/US2011/051258
The negatively charged DNA fragments are separated by size as they move through the
capillaries toward the positive electrode. After electrophoresis, data collection software
creates a sample file of the raw data. Using downstream software applications, further data
analysis is performed to translate the collected color data images into the corresponding
nucleotide bases. Alternatively or in addition, the method may include the use of microarray
based targeted region genomic DNA capture and/or sequencing. Kits, reagents, and methods
for selecting appropriate PCR primers and performing resequencing are commercially
available, for example, from Applied Biosystems, Agilent, and NimbleGen (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH). Methods such as these have been used to detect JAK2 and
myeloproliferative leukemia gene (MPL) mutations and to diagnose polycythemia vera,
essential thrombocythemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis. For use in the instant invention,
PCR primers may be selected so as to amplify, for example, at least a relevant portion of SEQ
ID NO: 7 (above).
        Alternatively or in addition, a nucleic acid encoding a Y641 mutant EZH2
polypeptide may be detected using a Southern blot in accordance with methods well known
in the art. In one embodiment a DNA sequence encoding a Y641 mutant EZH2 polypeptide
is detected using nucleic acid hybridization performed under highly stringent conditions. A
nucleic acid probe is selected such that its sequence is complementary to a target nucleic acid
sequence that includes a codon for the mutant amino acid corresponding to Y641 of wild-type
EZH2.
        A sequence-specific probe is combined with a sample to be tested under highly
stringent conditions. The term "highly stringent conditions" as used herein refers to
parameters with which the art is familiar. Nucleic acid hybridization parameters may be
found in references that compile such methods, e.g., J. Sambrook, et al., eds., Molecular
Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold
Spring Harbor, New York, 1989, or F. M. Ausubel, et al., eds., CurrentProtocolsin
Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. More specifically, highly stringent
conditions, as used herein, refers, for example, to hybridization at 650 C in hybridization
buffer (3.5 x SSC, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin
(BSA), 2.5 mM NaH 2PO 4 (pH 7), 0.5% SDS, 2mM EDTA). SSC is 0.15 M sodium
chloride/0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7; SDS is sodium dodecyl sulphate; and EDTA is
ethylenediaminetetracetic acid. After hybridization, the membrane upon which the DNA is

transferred is washed, for example, in 2 x SSC at room temperature and then at 0.1-0.5 x
SSC/O.1 x SDS at temperatures up to 680 C.
         There are other conditions, reagents, and so forth that can be used, which result in a
similar degree of stringency. The skilled artisan will be familiar with such conditions, and
thus they are not given here. It will be understood, however, that the skilled artisan will be
able to manipulate the conditions in a manner to permit the clear identification of EZH2
associated nucleic acids of the invention, including, in particular, nucleic acids encoding
Y641 mutants of EZH2 (e.g., by using lower stringency conditions). The skilled artisan also
is familiar with the methodology for screening cells and libraries for expression of such
molecules, which then are routinely isolated, followed by isolation of the pertinent nucleic
acid molecule and sequencing.
         The subject is administered a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of
EZH2. As used herein, an inhibitor of EZH2 refers, generally, to a small molecule, i.e., a
molecule of molecular weight less than about 1.5 kilodaltons (kDa), which is capable of
interfering with the histone methyltransferase enzymatic activity of EZH2.
         In one embodiment the inhibitor of EZH2 inhibits histone methyltransferase activity
of wild-type EZH2. In one embodiment the inhibitor of EZH2 inhibits histone
methyltransferase activity of the Y641 mutant of EZH2. In one embodiment the inhibitor of
EZH2 inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of wild-type EZH2 and histone
methyltransferase activity of the Y641 mutant of EZH2. In one embodiment the inhibitor of
EZH2 selectively inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of the Y641 mutant of EZH2.
         As disclosed herein, certain Y641 mutants of EZH2 are relatively poor catalysts for
conversion of unmethylated H3-K27 to H3-K27mel and yet unexpectedly effective catalysts
for conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3. Conversely, wild-type EZH2 is a relatively
effective catalyst for conversion of unmethylated H3-K27 to H3-K27mel and yet
unexpectedly ineffective catalyst for conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3. This is
important because mono-, di- and tri-methylated states of H3-K27 exhibit different functions
in transcriptional control. For example, H3-K27mel is associated with active transcription of
genes that are poised for transcription, while H3-K27me3 is associated with transcriptionally
repressed genes or genes that are poised for transcription when H3-K4 trimethylation is in
cis. Thus, selective inhibition of histone methyltransferase activity of the Y641 mutant of
EZH2 effects selective inhibition of production of the trimethylated form of H3-K27, thereby

favoring transcription associated with H3-K27mel and disfavoring repression of transcription
associated with H3-K27me3.
        An inhibitor of EZH2 "selectively inhibits" histone methyltransferase activity of the
Y641 mutant of EZH2 when it inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of the Y641 mutant
of EZH2 more effectively than it inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of wild-type
EZH2. For example, in one embodiment the selective inhibitor has an IC50 for the Y641
mutant of EZH2 that is at least 40 percent lower than the IC50 for wild-type EZH2. In one
embodiment the selective inhibitor has an IC50 for the Y641 mutant of EZH2 that is at least
50 percent lower than the IC50 for wild-type EZH2. In one embodiment the selective
inhibitor has an IC50 for the Y641 mutant of EZH2 that is at least 60 percent lower than the
IC50 for wild-type EZH2. In one embodiment the selective inhibitor has an IC50 for the
Y641 mutant of EZH2 that is at least 70 percent lower than the IC50 for wild-type EZH2. In
one embodiment the selective inhibitor has an IC50 for the Y641 mutant of EZH2 that is at
least 80 percent lower than the IC50 for wild-type EZH2. In one embodiment the selective
inhibitor has an IC50 for the Y641 mutant of EZH2 that is at least 90 percent lower than the
IC50 for wild-type EZH2.
        In one embodiment, the selective inhibitor of a Y641 mutant of EZH2 exerts
essentially no inhibitory effect on wild-type EZH2.
        The inhibitor inhibits conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3. In one embodiment
the inhibitor is said to inhibit trimethylation of H3-K27. Since conversion of H3-K27mel to
H3-K27me2 precedes conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3, an inhibitor of conversion
of H3-K27mel to H3-K27me2 naturally also inhibits conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3
K27me3, i.e., it inhibits trimethylation of H3-K27. It is also possible to inhibit conversion of
H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3 without inhibition of conversion of H3-K27mel to H3-K27me2.
Inhibition of this type would also result in inhibition of trimethylation of H3-K27, albeit
without inhibition of dimethylation of H3-K27.
        In one embodiment the inhibitor inhibits conversion of H3-K27mel to H3-K27me2
and the conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3. Such inhibitor may directly inhibit the
conversion of H3-K27me l to H3-K27me2 alone. Alternatively, such inhibitor may directly
inhibit both the conversion of H3-K27mel to H3-K27me2 and the conversion of H3-K27me2
to H3-K27me3.

        The inhibitor inhibits histone methylase activity. Inhibition of histone methylase
activity can be detected using any suitable method. The inhibition can be measured, for
example, either in terms of rate of histone methylase activity or as product of histone
methylase activity. Methods suitable for either of these readouts are included in the
Examples below.
        The inhibition is a measurable inhibition compared to a suitable negative control. In
one embodiment, inhibition is at least 10 percent inhibition compared to a suitable negative
control. That is, the rate of enzymatic activity or the amount of product with the inhibitor is
less than or equal to 90 percent of the corresponding rate or amount made without the
inhibitor. In various other embodiments, inhibition is at least 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75,
80, 90, or 95 percent inhibition compared to a suitable negative control. In one embodiment,
inhibition is at least 99 percent inhibition compared to a suitable negative control. That is,
the rate of enzymatic activity or the amount of product with the inhibitor is less than or equal
to 1 percent of the corresponding rate or amount made without the inhibitor.
        In one embodiment, the inhibitor is S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). SAH has the
structural formula

        In certain embodiments the invention comprises the step of performing an assay to
detect a Y641 mutant of EZH2 in a sample from a subject. Assays of this type are described
above. As used herein, a "sample from a subject" refers to any suitable sample containing
cells or components of cells obtained or derived from a subject. In one embodiment the
sample includes cells suspected to express Y641 mutant of EZH2, e.g., cancer cells. In one
embodiment the sample is a blood sample. In one embodiment the sample is a biopsy sample
obtained from, for example, a lymphatic tissue (e.g., lymph node) or bone marrow. In one
embodiment the sample is a biopsy sample obtained from a tissue other than or in addition to
a lymphatic tissue (e.g., lymph node) or bone marrow. For example, in one embodiment the
sample is a biopsy from a cancer, e.g., a tumor composed of cancer cells. Cells in the sample
can be isolated from other components of the sample. For example, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be isolated as a buffy coat from a blood sample that has
been centrifuged in accordance with methods familiar to those of skill in the art.
        When the result of the assay on a sample from a subject indicates that a Y641 mutant
of EZH2 is present in the sample, the subject is said to express the Y641 mutant of EZH2.
Indeed, in one embodiment, when the result of the assay on a sample from a subject indicates
that a Y641 mutant of EZH2 is present in the sample, the subject is identified as a candidate
for treatment with an inhibitor of EZH2, wherein the inhibitor selectively inhibits histone
methyltransferase activity of the Y641 mutant of EZH2.
        When the result of the assay on a sample from a cancer indicates that a Y641 mutant
of EZH2 is present in the cancer, the cancer is said to express the Y641 mutant of EZH2.
         Similarly, when the result of the assay on a sample comprising cancer cells from a
subject having a cancer indicates that a Y641 mutant of EZH2 is present in the sample, the
subject is said to express the Y641 mutant of EZH2.

    WO 2012/034132                                                          PCT/US2011/051258
         The present invention also provides a previously unrecognized, surprising correlation
of a patient's responsiveness to an EZH2 inhibitor with the H3-K27me2 level or preferably
with the levels of H3-K27me and H3-K27me3. For example, cells with a low H3-K27me2
and normal or high me3 levels relative to a control are much more responsive to the anti
proliferative effect of an EZH2 inhibitor than cells with a normal H3-K27 me2 and me3
levels.
         An aspect of the invention is a method for determining responsiveness to an EZH2
inhibitor in a subject. In one embodiment the method includes isolating a tissue sample from
the subject; detecting a dimethylation (me2) level of H3-K27 in the tissue sample; comparing
the dimethylation (me2) level to a control dimethylation (me2) level; and identifying the
subject is responsive to said EZH2 inhibitor when the dimethylation (me2) level is absent or
lower than the control dimethylation (me2) level. In one embodiment, the method further
includes detecting a trimethylation (me3) level of H3-K27 in the tissue sample; comparing
the trimethylation (me3) level to a control trimethylation (me3) level and the dimethylation
(me2) level to a control dimethylation (me2) level; and identifying said subject is responsive
to the EZH2 inhibitor when the trimethylation (me3) level is same as or higher than the
control trimethylation (me3) level and the dimethylation (me2) level is absent or lower than
the control dimethylation (me2) level. In another embodiment, the method further includes
obtaining a ratio of the dimethylation (me2) level to the trimethylation (me3) level of H3-K27
in the tissue sample; obtaining a control ratio of the control dimethylation (me2) level to the
control trimethylation (me3) level; comparing the ratio to the control ratio; and identifying
the subject is responsive to said EZH2 inhibitor when said ratio is lower than said control
ratio. In a preferred embodiment, the subject has cancer. In one embodiment, the cancer is a
follicular lymphoma. Alternatively, the cancer is a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
In another preferred embodiment, the subject expresses a Y641 mutant EZH2. In a preferred
embodiment, the Y641 mutant is Y641F, Y641H, Y641N or Y641S.
         Detection of dimethylated H3-K27 or trimethlated H3-K27 can be accomplished
using any suitable method in the art. In one embodiment, the methylation level is detected
using antibodies specific for dimethylated H3-K27 or trimethlated H3-K27. For example, the
isolated tissue is formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin blocks for long term preservation.
The blocks can be used to prepare slides for immunohistochemical staining or fluorescent
staining with antibodies against methylated H3-K27. Alternatively, whole cell lysates or
histone extracts can be prepared from the isolated tissue sample and subsequently used for
immunohistochemical staining, western blot analysis or fluorescent staining. In another

embodiment the methylation level is detected using a polypeptide or an aptamer specific for
dimethylated H3-K27 or trimethlated H3-K27. In another embodiment, the methylation level
is detected using mass spectrometry (MS).
        A control dimethylated H3-K27 or a control trimethlated H3-K27 can be established
from a control sample, e.g., an adjacent non-tumor tissue isolated from the subject or a
healthy tissue from a healthy subject. Alternatively, the control methylation level of H3
K27me2 or H3-K27me3 can be established by a pathologist with known methods in the art.
SCREENING METHODS
        An aspect of the invention is a method for identifying a test compound as an inhibitor
of a Y641 mutant of EZH2. In one embodiment the method includes combining an isolated
Y641 mutant of EZH2 with a histone substrate, a methyl group donor (such as S-adenosyl
methionine (SAM)), and a test compound, wherein the histone substrate comprises a form of
H3-K27 selected from the group consisting of unmethylated H3-K27, monomethylated H3
K27, dimethylated H3-K27, and any combination thereof; and performing an assay to detect
methylation of H3-K27 in the histone substrate, thereby identifying the test compound as an
inhibitor of the Y641 mutant of EZH2 when methylation of H3-K27 in the presence of the
test compound is less than methylation of H3-K27 in the absence of the test compound. The
assay to detect methylation of H3-K27 can be selected to measure the rate of methylation, the
extent of methylation, or both the rate and extent of methylation.
        The Y641 mutant of EZH2 is isolated as a PRC2 complex or functional equivalent
thereof. As used herein, the term "isolated" means substantially separated from other
components with which the complex may be found as it occurs in nature. A compound can
be isolated without necessarily being purified. In one embodiment the mutant of EZH2 is
isolated as a complex of a Y641 mutant of EZH2 together with EED and SUZ12. In another
embodiment the mutant of EZH2 is isolated as a complex of a Y641 mutant of EZH2 together
with EED, SUZ12, and RbAp48. Under appropriate conditions, a PRC2 complex or
functional equivalent thereof exhibits histone methyltransferase activity for H3-K27. In one
embodiment the complex is composed of recombinantly expressed component polypeptides,
e.g., EZH2, EED, SUZ12, with or without RbAp48.
        The isolated Y641 mutant of EZH2 is combined with a histone substrate. A histone
substrate includes any suitable source of histone polypeptides or fragments thereof that can
                                               33

    WO 2012/034132                                                        PCT/US2011/051258
serve as substrate for EZH2. In one embodiment the histone substrate includes histones
isolated from a subject. The histones can be isolated from cells of a subject using any
suitable method; such methods are well known to persons skilled in the art and need not be
further specified here. See, for example, Fang et al. (2004) Methods Enzymol 377:213-26. In
accordance with the Examples below, in one embodiment the histone substrate is provided as
nucleosomes. In accordance with the Examples below, in one embodiment the histone
substrate is provided as avian (chicken) erythrocyte nucleosomes.
        Histone substrate so provided may include an admixture of states of histone
modification, including various states of H3-K27 methylation as judged by Western blotting
with H3-K27 methylation state-specific antibodies. In one embodiment the histone substrate
may be provided as purified full-length histone H3. Such purified full-length histone H3 may
be provided as a homogeneous preparation in respect of states of H3-K27 methylation, or as
an admixture of various states of H3-K27 methylation. Homogeneous preparations of
isolated histone H3 in respect of states of H3-K27 methylation may be prepared in part by
passage over an immunoaffinity column loaded with suitable H3-K27 methylation state
specific antibodies or by immunoprecipitation using magnetic beads coated with suitable H3
K27 methylation state-specific antibodies. Alternatively or in addition, the methylation state
of H3-K27 can be characterized as part of performing the assay. For example, the starting
material histone substrate might be characterized as containing 50 percent unmethylated H3
K27, 40 percent monomethylated H3-K27, 10 percent dimethylated H3-K27, and 0 percent
trimethylated H3-K27.
        In one embodiment the histone substrate includes a peptide library or a suitable
peptide comprising one or more amino acid sequences related to histone H3, including, in
particular, a sequence that encompasses H3-K27. For example, in one embodiment, the
histone substrate is a peptide fragment that corresponds to amino acid residues 21-44 of
histone H3. Such peptide fragment has the amino acid sequence
LATKAARKSAPATGGVKKPHRYRP               (SEQ ID NO: 13). The peptide library or peptide can be
prepared by peptide synthesis according to techniques well known in the art and optionally
modified so as to incorporate any desired degree of methylation of lysine corresponding to
H3-K27. As described in the Examples below, such peptides can also be modified to
incorporate a label, such as biotin, useful in performing downstream assays. In one
embodiment the label is appended to the amino (N)-terminus of the peptide(s). In one
embodiment the label is appended to the carboxy (C)-terminus of the peptide(s).

    WO 2012/034132                                                        PCT/US2011/051258
         H3-K27 methylation-specific antibodies are available from a variety of commercial
sources, including, for example, Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) and Active Motif
(Carlsbad, CA).
         The isolated Y641 mutant of EZH2 is combined with a test compound. As used
herein, a "test compound" refers to a small organic molecule having a molecular weight of
less than about 1.5 kDa. In one embodiment a test compound is a known compound. In one
embodiment a test compound is a novel compound. In one embodiment, a test compound can
be provided as part of a library of such compounds, wherein the library includes, for example,
tens, hundreds, thousands, or even more compounds. A library of compounds may
advantageously be screened in a high throughput screening assay, for example, using arrays
of test compounds and robotic manipulation in accordance with general techniques well
known in the art.
         In certain embodiments a test compound is a compound that is a derivative of SAH or
a derivative of Compound 75.
         Detection of methylation of H3-K27 can be accomplished using any suitable method.
In one embodiment, the source of donor methyl groups includes methyl groups that are
labeled with a detectable label. The detectable label in one embodiment is an isotopic label,
e.g., tritium. Other types of labels may include, for example, fluorescent labels.
         Detection of formation of trimethylated H3-K27 can be accomplished using any
suitable method. For example, detection of formation of trimethylated H3-K27 can be
accomplished using an assay to detect incorporation of labeled methyl groups, such as
described above, optionally combined with a chromatographic or other method to separate
labeled products by size, e.g., polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), capillary
electrophoresis (CE), or high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Alternatively or in
addition, detection of formation of trimethylated H3-K27 can be accomplished using
antibodies that are specific for trimethylated H3-K27.
         Detection of conversion of monomethylated H3-K27 to dimethylated H3-K27 can be
accomplished using any suitable method. In one embodiment the conversion is measured
using antibodies specific for monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27. For
example, starting amounts or concentrations of monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated
H3-K27 may be determined using appropriate antibodies specific for monomethylated H3
K27 and dimethylated H3-K27. Following the combination of enzyme, substrate, methyl

group donor, and test compound, resulting amounts or concentrations of monomethylated
H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27 may then be determined using appropriate antibodies
specific for monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27. The beginning and
resulting amounts or concentrations of monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3
K27can then be compared. Alternatively or in addition, beginning and resulting amounts or
concentrations of monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27 can then be compared
to corresponding amounts of concentrations from a negative control. A negative control
reaction, in which no test agent is included in the assay, can be run in parallel or as a
historical control. Results of such control reaction can optionally be subtracted from
corresponding results of the experimental reaction prior to or in conjunction with making the
comparison mentioned above.
        Because the dimethylated form of H3-K27 may be further methylated in the same
assay, a reduction in the amount or concentration of monomethylated H3-K27 may not
appear to correspond directly to an increase in dimethylated H3-K27. In this instance, it may
be presumed, however, that a reduction in the amount or concentration of monomethylated
H3-K27 is, by itself, reflective of conversion of monomethylated H3-K27 to dimethylated
H3-K27.
        Detection of conversion of dimethylated H3-K27 to trimethylated H3-K27 can be
accomplished using any suitable method. In one embodiment the conversion is measured
using antibodies specific for dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated H3-K27. For example,
starting amounts or concentrations of dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated H3-K27 may
be determined using appropriate antibodies specific for dimethylated H3-K27 and
trimethylated H3-K27. Following the combination of enzyme, substrate, and test compound,
resulting amounts or concentrations of dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated H3-K27 may
then be determined using appropriate antibodies specific for dimethylated H3-K27 and
trimethylated H3-K27. The beginning and resulting amounts or concentrations of
dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated H3-K27can then be compared. Alternatively or in
addition, beginning and resulting amounts or concentrations of dimethylated H3-K27 and
trimethylated H3-K27 can then be compared to corresponding amounts of concentrations
from a negative control. A negative control reaction, in which no test agent is included in the
assay, can be run in parallel or as a historical control. Results of such control reaction can
optionally be subtracted from corresponding results of the experimental reaction prior to or in
conjunction with making the comparison mentioned above.

         A test agent is identified as an inhibitor of the Y641 mutant of EZH2 when
methylation of H3-K27 with the test compound is less than methylation of H3-K27 without
the test compound. In one embodiment, a test agent is identified as an inhibitor of the Y641
mutant of EZH2 when formation of trimethylated H3-K27 in the presence of the test
compound is less than formation of trimethylated H3-K27 in the absence of the test
compound.
         An aspect of the invention is a method for identifying a selective inhibitor of a Y641
mutant of EZH2. In one embodiment the method includes combining an isolated Y641
mutant of EZH2 with a histone substrate, a methyl group donor (e.g., SAM), and a test
compound, wherein the histone substrate comprises a form of H3-K27 selected from the
group consisting of monomethylated H3-K27, dimethylated H3-K27, and a combination of
monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27, thereby forming a test mixture;
combining an isolated wild-type EZH2 with a histone substrate, a methyl group donor (e.g.,
SAM), and a test compound, wherein the histone substrate comprises a form of H3-K27
selected from the group consisting of monomethylated H3-K27, dimethylated H3-K27, and a
combination of monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27, thereby forming a
control mixture; performing an assay to detect trimethylation of the histone substrate in each
of the test mixture and the control mixture; calculating the ratio of (a) trimethylation with the
Y641 mutant of EZH2 and the test compound (M+) to (b) trimethylation with the Y641
mutant of EZH2 without the test compound (M-); calculating the ratio of (c) trimethylation
with wild-type EZH2 and the test compound (WT+) to (d) trimethylation with wild-type
EZH2 without the test compound (WT-); comparing the ratio (a)/(b) with the ratio (c)/(d);
and identifying the test compound as a selective inhibitor of the Y641 mutant of EZH2 when
the ratio (a)/(b) is less than the ratio (c)/(d). In one embodiment the method further includes
taking into account a negative control without test compound for either or both of the test
mixture and the control mixture.
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS
         One or more EZH2 antagonists can be administered alone to a human patient or in
pharmaceutical compositions where they are mixed with suitable carriers or excipient(s) at
doses to treat or ameliorate a disease or condition as described herein. Mixtures of these
EZH2 antagonists can also be administered to the patient as a simple mixture or in suitable
formulated pharmaceutical compositions. For example, one aspect of the invention relates to
pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective dose of an EZH2
                                                   37

antagonist, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, enantiomer or stereoisomer
thereof; and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.
        Techniques for formulation and administration of EZH2 antagonists may be found in
references well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as Remington's "The Science
and Practice of Pharmacy," 21st ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 2005.
         Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal, or intestinal
administration; parenteral delivery, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,
subcutaneous, or intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, or
intraocular injections; topical delivery, including eyedrop and transdermal; and intranasal and
other transmucosal delivery.
        Alternatively, one may administer an EZH2 antagonist in a local rather than a
systemic manner, for example, via injection of the EZH2 antagonist directly into an
edematous site, often in a depot or sustained release formulation.
        In one embodiment, an EZH2 antagonist is administered by direct injection into a
tumor or lymph node.
        Furthermore, one may administer an EZH2 antagonist in a targeted drug delivery
system, for example, in a liposome coated with cancer cell-specific antibody.
        The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured, e.g.,
by conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying,
encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes.
        Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus
may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable
carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active EZH2
antagonists into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is
dependent upon the route of administration chosen.
        For injection, the agents of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions,
preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution,
or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants are used in the
formulation appropriate to the barrier to be permeated. Such penetrants are generally known
in the art.
        For oral administration, the EZH2 antagonists can be formulated readily by

combining the active EZH2 antagonists with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well
known in the art. Such carriers enable the EZH2 antagonists of the invention to be
formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and
the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use
can be obtained by combining the active EZH2 antagonist with a solid excipient, optionally
grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable
auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include fillers
such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such
as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum
tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium
carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents
may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt
thereof such as sodium alginate.
         Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated
sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl
pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions,
and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the
tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active
EZH2 antagonist doses.
         Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made
of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol
or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler
such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate
and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active EZH2 antagonists may be dissolved or
suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene
glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added.
         For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges
formulated in conventional manner.
         For administration by inhalation, the EZH2 antagonists for use according to the
present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation
from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.,
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide

or other suitable gas. In the case of pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by
providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g., gelatin for
use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the EZH2
antagonist and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.
        The EZH2 antagonists can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection,
e.g., bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in
unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.
The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or
aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or
dispersing agents.
        Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions
of the active EZH2 antagonists in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active
EZH2 antagonists may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable
lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid
esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may
contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium
carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain
suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the EZH2 antagonists to allow
for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.
        Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution before
use with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water.
        The EZH2 antagonists may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as
suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases, such as
cocoa butter or other glycerides.
        In addition to the formulations described previously, the EZH2 antagonists may also
be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by
implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly or by intramuscular injection).
Thus, for example, the EZH2 antagonists may be formulated with suitable polymeric or
hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange
resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives (for example, as a sparingly soluble salt).
        Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical EZH2
antagonists may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are examples of delivery vehicles

or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethysulfoxide also
may be employed. Additionally, the EZH2 antagonists may be delivered using a sustained
release system, such as semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing
the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well
known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their
chemical nature, release the EZH2 antagonists for a few weeks up to over 100 days.
Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent,

        The pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise suitable solid or gel phase
carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to

and polymers, such as polyethylene glycols.
METHODS OF TREATMENT
        Provided herein are methods of treating or preventing conditions and diseases the
course of which can be influenced by modulating the methylation status of histones or other
proteins, wherein said methylation status is mediated at least in part by the activity of EZH2.
Modulation of the methylation status of histones can in turn influence the level of expression
of target genes activated by methylation, and/or target genes suppressed by methylation.
        For example, one aspect of the invention relates to a method for treating cancer. The
method comprises the step of administering to a subject having a cancer expressing a Y641
mutant of EZH2 a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of EZH2, wherein the
inhibitor inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of EZH2, thereby treating the cancer. In
one embodiment the inhibitor inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of the Y641 mutant
of EZH2. In one embodiment the inhibitor selectively inhibits histone methyltransferase
activity of the Y641 mutant of EZH2. In one embodiment the cancer is a follicular
lymphoma. In one embodiment the cancer is a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
        An aspect of the invention relates to a method for treating cancer. The method
comprises the steps of performing an assay to detect a Y641 mutant of EZH2 in a sample
comprising cancer cells from a subject having a cancer; and administering to a subject
expressing a Y641 mutant of EZH2 a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of
EZH2, wherein the inhibitor inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of EZH2, thereby
treating the cancer. In one embodiment the inhibitor inhibits histone methyltransferase

activity of the Y641 mutant of EZH2. In one embodiment the inhibitor selectively inhibits
histone methyltransferase activity of the Y641 mutant of EZH2. In one embodiment the
cancer is a follicular lymphoma. In one embodiment the cancer is a diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL).
         Diseases such as cancers and neurological disease can be treated by administration of
modulators of protein (e.g., histone) methylation, e.g., modulators of histone
methyltransferase, or histone demethylase enzyme activity. Histone methylation has been
reported to be involved in aberrant expression of certain genes in cancers, and in silencing of
neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells. Modulators described herein can be used to treat such
diseases, i.e., to inhibit methylation of histones in affected cells.
         Based at least on the fact that increased histone methylation has been found to be
associated with certain cancers, a method for treating cancer in a subject comprises
administering to the subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound
that inhibits methylation or restores methylation to roughly its level in counterpart normal
cells. In one embodiment a method for treating cancer in a subject comprises administering
to the subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that inhibits
conversion of unmethylated H3-K27 to monomethylated H3-K27 (H3-K27mel). In one
embodiment a method for treating cancer in a subject comprises administering to the subject
in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that inhibits conversion of
monomethylated H3-K27 (H3-K27mel) to dimethylated H3-K27 (H3-K27me2). In one
embodiment a method for treating cancer in a subject comprises administering to the subject
in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that inhibits conversion of
H3-K27me2 to trimethylated H3-K27 (H3-K27me3). In one embodiment a method for
treating cancer in a subject comprises administering to the subject in need thereof a
therapeutically effective amount of a compound that inhibits both conversion of H3-K27mel
to H3-K27me2 and conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3. It is important to note that
disease-specific increase in methylation can occur at chromatin in key genomic loci in the
absence of a global increase in cellular levels of histone or protein methylation. For example,
it is possible for aberrant hypermethylation at key disease-relevant genes to occur against a
backdrop of global histone or protein hypomethylation.
         Modulators of methylation can be used for modulating cell proliferation, generally.
For example, in some cases excessive proliferation may be reduced with agents that decrease
methylation, whereas insufficient proliferation may be stimulated with agents that increase
                                                 42

such as benign cell growth and malignant cell growth (cancer).

Alternatively, the cancer is a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In another preferred
embodiment, the subject expresses a Y641 mutant EZH2. In a preferred embodiment, the
Y641 mutant is Y641F, Y641H, Y641N or Y641S.
COMBINATION THERAPY
        In one aspect of the invention, an EZH2 antagonist, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof, can be used in combination with another therapeutic agent to treat diseases such
as cancer and/or neurological disorders. For example, the additional agent can be a
therapeutic agent that is art-recognized as being useful to treat the disease or condition being
treated by the compound of the present invention. The additional agent also can be an agent
that imparts a beneficial attribute to the therapeutic composition (e.g., an agent that affects
the viscosity of the composition).
        The combination therapy contemplated by the invention includes, for example,
administration of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,
and additional agent(s) in a single pharmaceutical formulation as well as administration of a
compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and additional
agent(s) in separate pharmaceutical formulations. In other words, co-administration shall
mean the administration of at least two agents to a subject so as to provide the beneficial
effects of the combination of both agents. For example, the agents may be administered
simultaneously or sequentially over a period of time.
        The agents set forth below are for illustrative purposes and not intended to be
limiting. The combinations, which are part of this invention, can be the compounds of the
present invention and at least one additional agent selected from the lists below. The
combination can also include more than one additional agent, e.g., two or three additional
agents if the combination is such that the formed composition can perform its intended

        For example, one aspect of the invention relates to the use of an EZH2 antagonist in
combination with another agent for the treatment of cancer and/or a neurological disorder. In
one embodiment, an additional agent is an anticancer agent that is a compound that affects

DOSAGE
        As used herein, a "therapeutically effective amount" or "therapeutically effective
dose" is an amount of an EZH2 antagonist or a combination of two or more such compounds,
which inhibits, totally or partially, the progression of the condition or alleviates, at least
partially, one or more symptoms of the condition. A therapeutically effective amount can
also be an amount which is prophylactically effective. The amount which is therapeutically
effective will depend upon the patient's size and gender, the condition to be treated, the
severity of the condition and the result sought. In one embodiment, a therapeutically

    WO 2012/034132                                                           PCT/US2011/051258
effective dose refers to that amount of the EZH2 antagonists that results in amelioration of
symptoms in a patient. For a given patient, a therapeutically effective amount may be
determined by methods known to those of skill in the art.
         Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of EZH2 antagonists can be determined by standard
pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the ED50 (effective dose for 50% maximal response).
The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be
expressed as the ratio between MTD and ED 5o. The data obtained from these cell culture
assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans.
Dosage may also be guided by monitoring the EZH2 antagonist's effect on pharmacodynamic
markers of enzyme inhibition (e.g., histone methylation or target gene expression) in diseased
or surrogate tissue. Cell culture or animal experiments can be used to determine the
relationship between doses required for changes in pharmacodynamic markers and doses
required for therapeutic efficacy can be determined in cell culture or animal experiments or
early stage clinical trials. The dosage of such EZH2 antagonists lies preferably within a
range of circulating concentrations that include the ED 5o with little or no toxicity. The
dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route
of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be
chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. In the treatment of
crises, the administration of an acute bolus or an infusion approaching the MTD may be
required to obtain a rapid response.
         Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of
the active moiety which are sufficient to maintain the methyltransferase modulating effects,
or minimal effective concentration (MEC) for the required period of time to achieve
therapeutic efficacy. The MEC will vary for each EZH2 antagonist but can be estimated
from in vitro data and animal experiments. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will
depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. However, high pressure
liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma
concentrations.
         Dosage intervals can also be determined using the MEC value. In certain
embodiments, EZH2 antagonists should be administered using a regimen which maintains
plasma levels above the MEC for 10-90% of the time, preferably between 30-90% and most
preferably between 50-90% until the desired amelioration of symptoms is achieved. In other
                                                47

embodiments, different MEC plasma levels will be maintained for differing amounts of time.
In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the
drug may not be related to plasma concentration.
        One of skill in the art can select from a variety of administration regimens and the
amount of EZH2 antagonist administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being
treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration
and the judgment of the prescribing physician.

         An EZH2 antagonist and optionally other therapeutics can be administered per se
(neat) or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. When used in medicine the salts
should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts can
conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
         Compounds useful in accordance with the invention may be provided as salts with
pharmaceutically compatible counterions (i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable salts). A
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means any non-toxic salt that, upon administration to a
recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound or a prodrug of a
compound useful in accordance with this invention. A "pharmaceutically acceptable
counterion" is an ionic portion of a salt that is not toxic when released from the salt upon
administration to a subject. Pharmaceutically compatible salts may be formed with many
acids, including but not limited to hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, and
succinic acids. Salts tend to be more soluble in water or other protic solvents than their
corresponding free base forms. The present invention includes the use of such salts.
         Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those formed with mineral
acids such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, and also those formed with organic
acids such as maleic acid. For example, acids commonly employed to form pharmaceutically
acceptable salts include inorganic acids such as hydrogen bisulfide, hydrochloric,
hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid, as well as organic acids such as para
toluenesulfonic, salicylic, tartaric, bitartaric, ascorbic, maleic, besylic, fumaric, gluconic,
glucuronic, formic, glutamic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, lactic,
oxalic, para-bromophenylsulfonic, carbonic, succinic, citric, benzoic and acetic acid, and
related inorganic and organic acids. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include
sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate,

hydroxyethyl)amine; N-methyl-D-glucamine; and amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and
the like.
         Certain compounds useful in accordance with the invention and their salts may exist
in more than one crystalline form (i.e., polymorph); the present invention includes the use of
each of the crystal forms and mixtures thereof.
         Certain compounds useful in accordance with the invention may contain one or more
chiral centers, and exist in different optically active forms. When compounds useful in
accordance with the invention contain one chiral center, the compounds exist in two
enantiomeric forms and the present invention includes the use of both enantiomers and
mixtures of enantiomers, such as racemic mixtures thereof. The enantiomers may be
resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art; for example, enantiomers may be
resolved by formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated, for example, by
crystallization; formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives or complexes which may be
separated, for example, by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective
reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example, via enzymatic
esterification; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example,
on a chiral support (e.g., silica with a bound chiral ligand) or in the presence of a chiral
solvent. Where the desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of
the separation procedures described above, a further step may be used to liberate the desired
purified enantiomer. Alternatively, specific enantiomers may be synthesized by asymmetric
synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting
one enantiomer into the other by asymmetric transformation.
         When a compound useful in accordance with the invention contains more than one
chiral center, it may exist in diastereoisomeric forms. The diastereoisomeric compounds may
be separated by methods known to those skilled in the art (for example, chromatography or

present invention includes the use of various diastereoisomers of compounds useful in
accordance with the invention, and mixtures thereof. Compounds useful in accordance with
the invention may exist in different tautomeric forms or as different geometric isomers, and
the present invention includes the use of each tautomer and/or geometric isomer of
compounds useful in accordance with the invention, and mixtures thereof. Compounds
useful in accordance with the invention may exist in zwitterionic form. The present invention
includes the use of each zwitterionic form of compounds useful in accordance with the
invention, and mixtures thereof.

DEFINITIONS
        For convenience, certain terms employed in the specification, examples, and
appended claims are collected here. All definitions, as defined and used herein, supersede
dictionary definitions, definitions in documents incorporated by reference, and/or ordinary
meanings of the defined terms.
                                                51

    WO 2012/034132                                                             PCT/US2011/051258
         The articles "a" and "an" are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at
least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, "an element" means
one element or more than one element.
         The phrase "and/or," as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be
understood to mean "either or both" of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are
conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple
elements listed with "and/or" should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., "one or more" of
the elements so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements
specifically identified by the "and/or" clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements
specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to "A and/or B", when
used in conjunction with open-ended language such as "comprising" can refer, in one
embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment,
to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A
and B (optionally including other elements); etc.
         As used herein in the specification and in the claims, "or" should be understood to
have the same meaning as "and/or" as defined above. For example, when separating items in
a list, "or" or "and/or" shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least
one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally,
additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as "only one of'
or "exactly one of," or, when used in the claims, "consisting of," will refer to the inclusion of
exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general, the term "or" as used herein
shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e., "one or the other but not
both") when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as "either," "one of," "only one of," or
"exactly one of." "Consisting essentially of," when used in the claims, shall have its ordinary
meaning as used in the field of patent law.
         As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase "at least one," in
reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element
selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily
including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements
and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also
allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified
within the list of elements to which the phrase "at least one" refers, whether related or
unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, "at least
                                                 52

    WO 2012/034132                                                            PCT/US2011/051258
one of A and B" (or, equivalently, "at least one of A or B," or, equivalently "at least one of A
and/or B") can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one,
A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another
embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and
optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one,
optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one,
B (and optionally including other elements); etc.
        It should also be understood that, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, in any
methods claimed herein that include more than one step or act, the order of the steps or acts
of the method is not necessarily limited to the order in which the steps or acts of the method
are recited.
        In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as
"comprising," "including," "carrying," "having," "containing," "involving," "holding,"
"composed of," and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including
but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases "consisting of' and "consisting essentially
of' shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United
States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03.
        The terms "co-administration" and "co-administering" refer to both concurrent
administration (administration of two or more therapeutic agents at the same time) and time
varied administration (administration of one or more therapeutic agents at a time different
from that of the administration of an additional therapeutic agent or agents), as long as the
therapeutic agents are present in the patient to some extent at the same time.
        The term "treating" as used herein refers to alleviate of at least one symptom of the
disease, disorder or condition. The term encompasses the administration and/or application
of one or more compounds described herein, to a subject, for the purpose of providing
management of, or remedy for a condition. "Treatment" for the purposes of this disclosure,
may, but does not have to, provide a cure; rather, "treatment" may be in the form of
management of the condition. When the compounds described herein are used to treat
unwanted proliferating cells, including cancers, "treatment" includes partial or total
destruction of the undesirable proliferating cells with minimal destructive effects on normal
cells. A desired mechanism of treatment of unwanted rapidly proliferating cells, including
cancer cells, at the cellular level is apoptosis.

        The term "preventing" as used herein includes either preventing or slowing the onset
of a clinically evident disease progression altogether or preventing or slowing the onset of a
preclinically evident stage of a disease in individuals at risk. This includes prophylactic
treatment of those at risk of developing a disease.
        The term "subject" as used herein for purposes of treatment includes any human
subject who has been diagnosed with, has symptoms of, or is at risk of developing a disorder.
For methods of prevention the subject is any human subject. To illustrate, for purposes of
prevention, a subject may be a human subject who is at risk of or is genetically predisposed to
obtaining a disorder characterized by unwanted, rapid cell proliferation, such as cancer. The
subject may be at risk due to exposure to carcinogenic agents, being genetically predisposed
to disorders characterized by unwanted, rapid cell proliferation, and so on.
        Except as otherwise indicated, standard methods can be used for the production of
recombinant and synthetic polypeptides, fusion proteins, antibodies or antigen-binding
fragments thereof, manipulation of nucleic acid sequences, production of transformed cells,
and the like. Such techniques are known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al.,
Molecular Cloning:A LaboratoryManual, 3rd Ed. (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2001); F.M.
Ausubel et al. CurrentProtocolsin Molecular Biology (Green Publishing Associates, Inc.
and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York).
        The term "EZH2 polypeptide" encompasses functional fragments of the full-length
polypeptides and functional equivalents of either of the foregoing that have substantially
similar or substantially identical amino acid sequences (at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%,
95% 98% or more amino acid sequence similarity or identity), where the functional fragment
or functional equivalent retains one or more of the functional properties of the native
polypeptide.
        By "functional" it is meant that the polypeptide (or nucleic acid) has the same or
substantially similar activity with respect to one or more of the biological properties of the
native polypeptide (or nucleic acid), e.g., at least about 50%, 75%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98% or
more of the activity of the native polypeptide (or nucleic acid).
        The term "modulate" (and grammatical equivalents) refers to an increase or decrease
in activity. In particular embodiments, the term "increase" or "enhance" (and grammatical
equivalents) means an elevation by at least about 25 %, 50%,     7 5 %, 2-fold, 3-fold, 5-fold, 10
fold, 15-fold, 20-fold or more. In particular embodiments, the terms "decrease" or "reduce"

(and grammatical equivalents) means a diminishment by at least about 25%, 40%, 50%, 60%,
75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or more. In some embodiments, the indicated activity,
substance or other parameter is not detectable. Specifically provided are antagonists of
EZH2.
        The term "pharmacodynamic marker" refers to a molecular marker of drug response
that can be measured in patients receiving the drug. The marker should be a direct measure
of modulation of the drug target and be able to show quantitative changes in response to dose.
A potential pharmacodynamic marker for EZH2 antagonists could be levels of histone H3
K27 methylation in disease or surrogate tissue.
        As used herein, the term "responsiveness" is interchangeable with terms "responsive",
"sensitive", and "sensitivity", and it is meant that a subject showing therapeutic response
when administered an EZH inhibitor, e.g., tumor cells or tumor tissues of the subject undergo
apoptosis and/or necrosis, and/or display reduced growing, dividing, or proliferation..
        The term "control" or "reference" refers to methylation levels (e.g., monomethylation
level, dimethylation level or trimethylation level) detected in an adjacent non-tumor tissue
isolated from the subject, detected in a healthy tissue from a healthy subject, or established by
a pathologist with standard methods in the art.
        By "sample" it means any biological sample derived from the subject, includes but is
not limited to, cells, tissues samples and body fluids (including, but not limited to, mucus,
blood, plasma, serum, urine, saliva, and semen).
                                           EXAMPLES
        The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by
reference to the following examples, which are included merely for purposes of illustration of
certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the
invention.
Example 1 -- Recombinant Five-Component PRC2 Complex
        Wild-type EZH2 (GenBank Accession No. NM_004456) or Tyr641 mutants were co
expressed with wild-type AEBP2 (GenBank Accession No. NM_153207), EED (GenBank
Accession No. NM_003797), SUZ12 (GenBank Accession No. NM_015355) and RbAp48
(GenBank Accession No. NM_005610) in Spodopterafrugiperda(Sf9) cells using a
                                                 55

    WO 2012/034132                                                        PCT/US2011/051258
baculovirus expression system. An N-terminal FLAG tag on the EED was used to purify
active PRC2 complex from cell lysates (BPS Bioscience, catalog number 51004). The purity
of the final PRC2 preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining.
Example 2 -- H3, H4 Peptide Panel
        A library consisting of 44 peptides of 15 amino acids each was synthesized by 21st
Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA). This peptide panel encompassed all of the amino
acids of human histones H3 and H4 with 5 residue overlaps between consecutive peptide
sequences. The N-terminus of each peptide was appended with biotin, and the C-termini
were represented as the amide. Purity (> 95%) and identity were confirmed by liquid
chromatography/mass spectral analysis.
        For study of the H3-K27 methylation status dependence of enzyme activity, peptides
were synthesized representing the amino acid sequence of human H3 from residues 21-44
(H3:21-44) with lysine 27 represented as the unmodified, mono-methylated, di-methylated or
tri-methylated side chain amine. These peptides were purchased from New England Peptide
(Gardner, MA) with biotin appended to the C-terminus of each peptide.
Example 3 - Evaluation of H3-K27 Methylation Status in Cells
        The cell lines OCI-LY19 (ACC 528), KARPAS-422 (ACC 32), and WSU-DLCL2
(ACC 575) were obtained from DSMZ. The cell lines DB (CRL-2289) and SU-DHL2 (CRL
2959) were obtained from ATCC. OCI-LY19, WSU-DLCL2, and DB cell lines were grown
in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, and KARPAS-422 and SU-DHL2 cell lines were grown in
RPMI-1640 plus 20% FBS. Cells were grown to a density of 1.5-2 x106 cells/mL and 1 x 107
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 264 x g, washed in ice cold PBS and lysed by
resuspension in a lOX pellet volume of RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 15
0mM NaCl, 0.25% DOC, 1% NP-40, and 1 mM EDTA (Millipore #20-188), plus 0. 1% SDS
and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche # 1836153). Lysates were sonicated by 2 rounds of 10
1-second bursts at setting 3 with a Misonix XL-2000 to ensure efficient histone extraction,
and cleared by centrifugation at 4' C using a bench top centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10
minutes. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Four micrograms of
each lysate was fractionated on 4-20% Tris-Glycine gel (Invitrogen), transferred to PVDF,
and probed with the following antibodies in Odyssey blocking buffer: mouse anti-EZH2
(CST 3147; 1:2000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3-K27me3 (CST 9733; 1:10000 dilution), rabbit
anti-H3-K27me2 (CST 9755; 1:5000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3-K27mel (Active Motif 39377;

secondary Ab and imaged using the LiCOR Odyssey system.
Example 4 -- Enzymology
         As noted above, it had previously been concluded that the disease-associated changes
at Tyr641 resulted in loss of function with respect to EZH2-catalyzed H3-K27 methylation.
However, a presumptive reduction in the rate of H3-K27 methylation due to enzyme
heterozygosity was difficult to rationalize as the basis for a malignant phenotype, especially
in light of previous data indicating that overexpression of EZH2, loss-of-function mutations
in the corresponding H3-K27 demethylase UTX, or overexpression of components of the
PRC2, such as PHF19/PCL3, involved in increased H3-K27 trimethylation, all result in
malignant phenotypes in specific human cancers. Morin et al. (2010) Nat Genet 42:181-5;

28:1862-72; and Sarma et al. (2008) Mol Cell Biol 28:2718-3 1). Therefore, the enzymology
of these mutations was explored in greater detail.
         Recombinant PRC2 complexes were prepared with WT and Tyr641 mutant versions
of human EZH2 (see Example 1 above; Cao et al. (2004) Mol Cell 15:57-67). Equal
concentrations (nominally 8 nM, based on protein determinations) of each complex were
initially tested for the ability to catalyze 3H-methyl transfer from labeled S-adenosyl
methionine (SAM) to an unmodified peptide representing the amino acid sequence
surrounding H3-K27 (H3:21-44) or to native avian erythrocyte oligonucleosomes. As
previously reported (Morin et al. (2010) Nat Genet 42:181-5), it was found that the WT
enzyme displayed robust activity for methyl transfer to this unmethylated peptidic substrate,
but that none of the mutant enzymes displayed significant methyltransferase activity (Figure
1A). In contrast to the previously reported data and that in Fig. 1A, it was found that all of
the mutant EZH2 constructs were active methyltransferases against the avian nucleosome
substrate (Figure 1B). The nucleosomes isolated from the avian natural source represent an
admixture of states of histone modification, including various states of H3-K27 methylation
as judged by Western blotting with H3-K27 methylation-specific antibodies.

    WO 2012/034132                                                           PCT/US2011/051258
        There are several potential explanations for the discordant activity of the mutant
PRC2 complexes on peptide and nucleosome substrates. One possibility is that substrate
recognition sites distal to the enzyme active site (i.e., exosites) are important determinants of
substrate binding and turnover; these sites would engage complementary recognition
elements on the nucleosome that are not available on small peptidic substrates. However,
when E. coli-expressed, recombinant human histone H3 was tested as a substrate for the WT
and mutant PRC2 complexes, the resulting pattern of activity was identical to that seen for
the peptide substrate; that is, the WT enzyme demonstrated robust methyltransferase activity
against the H3 substrate, the Y64 1F mutant showed 7% the activity of WT complex, and all
other mutants displayed < 1% the activity of WT complex. Hence, exosite engagement
seems an unlikely explanation for the current results. The nucleosome presents many lysine
residues beyond H3-K27 as potential sites of methylation that would not be present in the
small peptidic substrate. Thus, another possibility is that mutation of Y641 alters the
substrate specificity of EZH2 to result in methylation of lysine residues other than H3-K27.
This possibility is unlikely given the excellent agreement between mutant activity on small
peptide and recombinant H3 protein substrates.
        The apparent discordance between the present results and those previously reported
was resolved when the enzymatic activity of the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes were
tested against a panel of peptidic substrates that represent all possible lysine (K) residues of
histone H3 and histone H4 (see Example 2 above). All of the enzyme forms showed
significant activity only against peptides containing the equivalent of residue H3-K27. The
specific activity of the mutants, however, was greatly reduced relative to WT in the order WT
>> Y641F > Y641S ~ Y641H > Y641N, again consistent with previous reported findings.
Example 5 -- Enzymology
        To understand further the enzymatic activity of these mutants, and to reconcile the
apparent discrepancy between activity against peptidic and nucleosome substrates, the ability
of the enzyme forms to catalyze further methylation of various H3-K27 methylation states in
the context of the H3:21-44 peptide was studied. As stated above, it was found that all of the
mutant enzymes were deficient catalysts of unmodified H3-K27 peptide methylation, relative
to the WT enzyme. Remarkably, however, all of the mutant enzymes were found to be
superior to WT enzyme in catalyzing further methylation of the mono- and especially the di
methylated H3-K27 peptides (Figure 2). Thus, the data suggest that the WT enzyme is most
efficient in catalyzing the zero- to mono-methylation reaction. The mutant enzymes are

defective in catalyzing this initial step, but are more efficient than the WT enzyme in
catalyzing the subsequent steps leading from mono-methyl to di- and tri-methyl H3-K27.
        The origins of the differential substrate specificities of WT and mutant EZH2 were
explored through steady state enzyme kinetics. As summarized in Table 1, the mutations
have minimal effects on ground-state substrate recognition, as demonstrated by the similar
values of Km for nucleosome and of K1 /2 for peptide substrates. In all cases the peptidic
substrates displayed sigmoidal binding behavior; hence the concentration of peptide resulting
in half-maximal velocity is reported here as K1 / 2 instead of the more common Michaelis
constant, Km. Copeland (2005) Evaluation of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug Discovery: A Guide
to Medicinal Chemists and Pharmacologists,Wiley. The SAM Km likewise displayed
minimal variation among the enzyme forms, ranging from 208  50 to 304  64 nM. Instead,
the differences in substrate utilization appear to have their origin in transition state
recognition, as demonstrated by differences in kcat values among the enzymes for various
substrates (Table 1). As a result, the catalytic efficiency, quantified as the ratio kcat/K (where
K is either Km or K1/ 2 , depending on substrate identity; vide supra), varies between the WT
and mutant enzymes for different states of H3-K27 methylation (Table 1).

Example 6 - Enzymology
         The steady state kinetic parameters listed in Table 1 made it possible to calculate the
expected levels of different H3-K27 methylation states for cells heterozygous for the various
mutant EZH2 forms, relative to cells homozygous for the WT enzyme. To perform these
simulations, a number of simplifying assumptions were made: (1) that steady state enzyme
kinetics are relevant to PRC2-catalyzed H3-K27 methylation in the cellular context and that
all measurements are made at the same time point in cell growth; (2) that the mutant and WT
enzyme are expressed at equal levels in heterozygous cells and that the total EZH2 level is
equal in all cells; (3) that the cellular concentration of SAM, relative to its Km is saturating
and does not change among the cells; (4) that the cellular concentration of nucleosome, is
similar to its Km and likewise does not change among cells; (5) that EZH1 catalyzed
methylation of H3-K27 was insignificant and constant among the cells; and (6) that any H3
K27 demethylase activity was also constant among the cells.
         With these assumptions in place, the predictions illustrated in Figure 3A were
obtained for relative levels of H3-K27me3 (top panel), H3-K27me2 (middle panel) and H3
K27mel (bottom panel). A clear pattern emerges from these simulations. The level of H3
K27me3 increases relative to WT cells for all mutant-harboring cells, ranging from a 30%
increase for the Y641H mutant to > 400% for the Y641N mutant. At the same time, the
levels of H3-K27me2 decreases to < 50% of WT for all of the mutants, and the levels of H3
K27mel are reduced by approximately half for all mutants, relative to WT.
         The relative levels of the H3-K27 methylation states in B-cell lymphoma cell lines
that are known to be homozygous for WT EZH2 (OCI-LY 19) or heterozygous for EZH2
Y641N (DB, KARPAS 422, and SU-DHL-6) or EZH2 Y641F (WSU-DLCL2) were then
measured by Western blotting (Figure 3B). The pattern of relative H3-K27 methylation
states seen in Figure 3b is in excellent agreement with the results of the simulations based on
in vitro steady state kinetic parameters, despite the assumptions used in the simulations and
the use of a non-physiological peptide surrogate as substrate.

         Thus, increased H3-K27me3 was observed for all Y641 mutant-harboring cells
relative to WT, decreased H3-K27me2 was observed for all Y641 mutant-harboring cells
relative to WT, and decreased H3-K27mel was observed for at least two of the four mutant
cell lines. The near-comparable levels of H3-K27mel in WT and KARPAS 422 and SU
DHL-6 cells may reflect different expression levels of WT and mutant EZH2, different
contributions of EZH 1, or other factors not accounted for in the simulations. Nevertheless,
the concordance between the predicted and experimental patterns of H3-K27 methylation
status is remarkable and supports the view that enzymatic coupling between WT and mutant
EZH2 leads to increased H3-K27me3, thus resulting in the malignant phenotype of cells that
are heterozygous for these mutants.
Example 7 -- In Vitro Assays of PRC2 Methyltransferase Activity
         Flashplateassay with peptide substrate. For initial comparison of WT and Y641
mutants of EZH2, biotinylated histone H3:21-44 peptide containing unmethylated K27 (New
England Peptide), monomethylated K27 (Millipore) or dimethylated K27 (Millipore) at a
concentration of 800 nM was combined with a mixture of S-adenosylmethionine-Cl (SAM) at
1,700 nM, and 300 nM tritiated SAM (Perkin Elmer). This substrate combination was then
added to the PRC2 in assay buffer (20 mM BICINE, 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween 20, 0.005%
bovine skin gelatin (BSG), pH 7.6). Reactions were allowed to proceed for the indicated time
interval and then quenched by addition of excess cold SAM (600 tM final concentration).
Quenched reaction mixtures were transferred to a streptavidin-coated Flashplate (Perkin
Elmer, catalog number SMP4 10), allowed to bind for one hour, and then detected on a
TopCount NXT HTS scintillation and luminescence counter (Perkin Elmer). Each time point
represented the average of six individual reactions. Steady state kinetic parameters were
determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of peptide or
SAM was varied, while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted
as a function of varied substrate concentration and the data were fitted to the untransformed
version of the Michaelis-Menten equation or the untransformed version of a sigmoidal kinetic
equation to calculate values of K and kcat. Standard errors of fitted parameters are listed in
Table 1 and were used to construct the error bars illustrated in Figure 2 panels B and C.
Error associated with kcat/K (Table 1) were calculated according to standard methods of error
propagation; the fractional error of kcat/K was determined as:

Nucleosomes were combined with a mixture of SAM and tritiated SAM, and added to PRC2
in assay buffer (20 mM BICINE, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween 20, 0.005%

transferred to a glass fiber filterplate (Millipore, catalog number MSFBN6B) and washed
three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to dry. Microscint Zero (30 tL) was
added and tritium incorporation was detected on a TopCount scintillation and luminescence
counter. Steady state parameters were determined under identical reaction conditions except
that the concentration of nucleosome or SAM was varied while at saturating conditions of the
other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and
fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis-Menten equation to derive the values of
Km and kcat as described above.

standard) contained 1 tL of DMSO. SAH was then incubated for 30 minutes with 40 tL per
well of EZH2 wild-type and mutants at 8 nM in pH 7.6 assay buffer (20 mM BICINE, 100
mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween 20, 0.005% BSG). A substrate mix at 10 tL per well
was added which contained S-adenosylmethionine-Cl (SAM) at 150 nM and tritiated SAM at
100 nM, and biotinylated oligonucleosome at 150 nM in pH 7.6 assay buffer. Quenched

Example 11 - H3-K27me2/me3 ratios predict sensitivity to an EZH2 inhibitor
        Tumor cell lines heterozygous for the EZH2 (Y641) mutation display increased levels
of H3-K27me3, the methylation state of H3-K27 thought to be important in tumorigenesis.
Levels of the mono (H3-K27me l), di (H3-K27me2), or trimethylated (H3-K27me3) forms of
H3-K27 in a panel of cell lines that were WT for EZH2, or heterozygous for EZH2 (Y641)
mutations were evaluated. Cell lines used are listed in Table 4. The majority of lines are B
cell lymphoma lines, however two melanoma lines were also included. IGRI is a melanoma
line that has recently been found to contain a Y641N mutation in EZH2, and A375 cells were
included as a WT EZH2 melanoma control line. Figures 9A and B show the results of
western blot analysis of histones isolated from this cell line panel probed with antibodies
recognizing H3-K27mel, H3-K27me2, or H3-K27me3. In general, global H3-K27me3 levels
are higher in Y641 mutant containing cell lines than in cell lines expressing WT EZH2
exclusively. Two exceptions are Farage and Pfeiffer cells, where H3-K27me3 levels were
similar to those in WT lines. More striking are the dramatically lower levels of H3-K27me2
in EZH2 Y641 mutant cell lines relative to wild type cell lines. Little or no H3-K27me2
signal was observed in western blot of histones extracted from Y641 mutant cell lines,
whereas the signal observed with the same antibody in WT cell lines was more intense than
that observed with the antibody specific for H3-K27me3. Overall, in WT cell lines the
western blot signal with an HK27me2 antibody was higher than the signal observed with the
H3-K27me3 antibody, whereas the opposite was true in Y641 mutant cell lines. Thus the
ratio of H3-K27me3/me2 signal in Y641 lines is higher than that observed in WT lines. The
one exception to this is the Pfeiffer cell line, which does not contain a Y641 EZH2 mutation,
                                                  66

    WO 2012/034132                                                         PCT/US2011/051258
but has high H3-K27me3 signal, and little or no H3-K27me2 signal. Pfeiffer cells therefore
have a H3-K27me3/me2 ratio similar to Y641 mutant cell lines.
        The H3-K27 methylation state can also be examined by Mass spectrometry (MS), an
independent method that does not rely on antibody reagents. The MS analysis demonstrated
that H3-K27me3 levels are higher in Y641 mutant and Pfeiffer lines than in the other WT
lines, whereas the opposite is true for H3-K27me2 levels. In the Y641 mutant and Pfeiffer
lines, H3-K27me3 levels were higher than H3-K27me2 levels, whereas the opposite was true
in the other WT lines. These results are consistent with those observed by western blot
analysis in Figure 9A and B.
        The differences in H3-K27 methylation state was also detected by
immunocytochemistry using antibodies to H3-K27me2 or H3-K27me3. This
immunohistochemistry assay is used for detecting aberrant H3-K27me2/3 ratios associated
with Y641 mutant EZH2 in formalin fixed paraffin embedded patient tumor tissue samples. A
panel of five WT and five Y641 mutant lymphoma cell line pellets were fixed and embedded
in paraffin blocks and stained with anti-H3-K27me2 or H3-K27me3 antibodies. An antibody
to histone H3 was included as a positive control, since all cells should contain nuclear histone
H3. Figure 10 shows that all cell lines were positive in 100% of cells for both H3-K27me3
and H3 staining. Under these conditions, no clear difference in H3-K27me3 staining intensity
was observed between WT and Y641 mutant cell lines. This may reflect the limited dynamic
range of chromogenic immunocytochemistry staining compared to other methods of
detection. However, as shown in Figure 11, cell lines could be clearly segregated into those
staining positive or negative for H3-K27me2. All WT cell lines, with the exception of
Pfeiffer cells, stained positive for H3-K27me2, whereas all Y641 mutant cell lines and
Pfeiffer cells showed no staining with the H3-K27me2 antibody. These results are consistent
with those obtained by western and MS analysis.
        Without wishing to be bound by theory, the increased levels of H3-K27me3
associated with the gain of function EZH2 (Y64 1) mutations may render cells bearing EZH2
mutations more sensitive to small molecule EZH2 inhibitors. To evaluate whether the
increased H3-K27me3 and/or decreased H3-K27me2 levels observed in Pfeiffer cells in the
absence of an EZH2 Y641 mutation would also correlate with sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors,
two compounds that demonstrate potent inhibition of EZH2 in biochemical assays with IC50s
of 85 and 16 nM respectively were tested. Treatment of WSU-DLCL2 cells with either
                                               67

    WO 2012/034132                                                          PCT/US2011/051258
compound led to inhibition of global H3-K27me3 levels, confirming their ability to enter
cells and inhibit cellular EZH2 methyltransferase activity (Figure 12).
         The sensitivity of a panel of WT and Y641 mutant cell lines to each compound was
evaluated in proliferation assays. Because the anti-proliferative activity of EZH2 inhibitors
takes several days to manifest, compounds were assessed in 11-day proliferation assays.
Figure 13 shows representative growth curves for WT (OCI-LY 19), or Y641 mutant (WSU
DLCL2) cell lines treated with the test compounds. Both compounds demonstrated anti
proliferative activity against WSU-DLCL2 cells, but little activity against OCI-LY19 cells.
Inhibitor A was a more potent inhibitor of WSU-DLCL2 proliferation than Inhibitor B and
this is consistent with Inhibitor A being a more potent inhibitor of EZH2 in biochemical
assays. Proliferation assays were performed in a panel of WT and Y641 mutant lymphoma
cell lines, with Inhibitor B, and day 11 IC90 values were derived. Figure 14A shows IC90
values of lymphoma cell lines grouped by EZH2 Y641 status. Overall, Y641 mutant cell lines
demonstrated increased sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors relative to WT cell lines, although RL
and SUDHL4 cells were significantly less sensitive than other mutant lines. Pfeiffer cells are
an exception, since they are WT, but are highly sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of
both compounds with IC90s in the low or sub-nanomolar range. Pfeiffer cells demonstrate
high H3-K27me3 and low H3-K27me2 levels, and so grouping cell lines according to high
H3-K27me3 and low H3-K27me2 gives better discrimination of EZH2 inhibitor sensitivity as
shown for Inhibitor B in Figure 14B. Thus, high H3-K27me3 and low H3-K27me2 levels can
be used to predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors, independent of knowledge of mutational
status. The aberrant methylation ratio observed in Pfeiffer cells occurs by a separate
mechanism that confers dependence upon EZH2 activity.
         These results demonstrates that identifying EZH2 Y641 mutations in patient tumors
and/or detecting low levels of H3-K27me2 relative to H3-K27me3 through use of techniques
such as western blot, MS or IHC in a patient can be used to identify which patient will
respond to EZH2 inhibitor treatment.

24. A method, comprising
    combining an isolated Y641 mutant of a EZH2 polypeptide with a histone substrate, a
    methyl group donor, and a test compound, wherein the histone substrate comprises a form
    of H3-K27 selected from the group consisting of unmethylated H3-K27, monomethylated
    H3-K27, dimethylated H3-K27, and any combination of thereof to form a test mixture;
    and
    detecting methylation of H3-K27 in the histone substrate, thereby identifying the test
    compound as an inhibitor of the Y641 mutant of EZH2 when methylation of H3-K27 in

    the presence of the test compound is less than methylation of H3-K27 in the absence of
    the test compound.
25. The method of claim 24 further comprising
    detecting formation of trimethylated H3-K27 in the histone substrate, thereby identifying
    the test compound as an inhibitor of the Y641 mutant of EZH2 when formation of
    trimethylated H3-K27 in the presence of the test compound is less than formation of
    trimethylated H3-K27 in the absence of the test compound.
26. The method of claim 25, further comprising
    combining an isolated wild-type EZH2 with a histone substrate, a methyl group donor,
    and a test compound, wherein the histone substrate comprises a form of H3-K27 selected
    from the group consisting of monomethylated H3-K27, dimethylated H3-K27, and a
    combination of monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27, thereby forming a
    control mixture;
    detecting trimethylation of the histone substrate in each of the test mixture and the control
    mixture;
    calculating the ratio of (a) trimethylation with the Y641 mutant of EZH2 and the test
    compound (M+) to (b) trimethylation with the Y641 mutant of EZH2 without the test
    compound (M-);
    calculating the ratio of (c) trimethylation with wild-type EZH2 and the test compound
    (WT+) to (d) trimethylation with wild-type EZH2 without the test compound (WT-);
    comparing the ratio (a)/(b) with the ratio (c)/(d); and
    identifying the test compound as a selective inhibitor of the Y641 mutant of EZH2 when
    the ratio (a)/(b) is less than the ratio (c)/(d).
27. The method of any one of claims 24-26, wherein the Y641 mutant of the EZH2
    polypeptide has a mutation selected from the group consisting of Y64 IF, Y641H, Y64 IN,
    and Y641S.
