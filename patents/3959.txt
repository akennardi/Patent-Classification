            This application claims the benefit of priority to United States Provisional
   Patent Application serial number 61/562,497, filed November 22, 2011.
                                     Background of the Invention
10          Cancer is America's second leading cause of death. Approved anticancer
   agents, both chemotherapeutic and targeted agents, are limited by toxicity and are
   ultimately ineffective against solid tumors, e.g.: lung, colorectal, breast, pancreatic,
   and prostate cancers, which account for more than 85% of cancer deaths. To kill
   tumors using the body's immune system, the failure of which has allowed the cancer
15 to emerge, has long been the goal of cancer research. Val-boroPro, also known as
   PT-100 or talabostat, is a dipeptide boronic acid that showed remarkable efficacy in
   shrinking tumors in mice through immune activation. However, in Fast Track Phase
   III clinical trials, it did not meet its objectives, due to dose-limiting toxicity.
            The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first cancer vaccine,
20 Provenge for prostate cancer, on April 29, 2010. Provenge is a dendritic cell therapy
   (DCT); one of several exciting new immunotherapies sometimes called "cancer
   vaccines". By supercharging the immune system, such vaccines can, in principle, find
   and remove the very last cancer cell, no matter where it hides, thus precluding mere
   remission after a course of treatment. Although the concept is now proven, cancer
25 vaccines, including DCTs other than Provenge, have failed to achieve the desired
   efficacy in clinical trials, indicating the need to add immune stimulators, or adjuvants.
   However, less toxic adjuvants are needed to develop this approach clinically.

                                   Brief Description of the Drawings
           Figure 1 shows that Ala-boroPro (A-bP) and Val-boroPro (V-bP) both inhibit prolyl
   oligoproteases, but Ala-boroPro does not stimulate the immune system. Val-boroPro is a
   potent immune stimulator.
20         Figure 2 shows that PT-100 produces complete regression of early stage tumors but
   not of established tumors.
           Figure 3 shows that PT-100 + Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccine produces regression of
   established tumors.
           Figure 4 shows that Val-boroPro (2054 in the figure), but not Ala-boroPro (2054 in
25 the figure), stimulates G-CSF and CXCL1/KC in BALB/c mice. G-CSF and CXL1/KC are
   markers of anti-cancer immune enhancing activity. The experimental setup and results are
   discussed in Example 3.
           Figure 5 shows that Ari-4175 (4175-2 in the figure) is a very potent inducer of
   cytokines in vivo. The experimental setup and results are discussed in Example 3.
30         Figure 6 shows that ARI-4175 (4175-2) is much more potent than PT-100 (2054) at
   inducing G-CSF and CXCL1 cytokines, which are markers of anti-cancer immune
   enhancing activity. The experimental setup and results are discussed in Example 3.
                                                  3

           Figure 7 shows that ARI-4175 establishes immunity to tumor rechallenge in the
   M3-9-M RMS model. The experimental setup and results are discussed in Example 4.
           Figures 8 A and B show that ARI-4175 increases potency of a DC vaccine in a
   rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) model to inhibit growth of established RMS and increase mouse
 5 survival.  C57BL/6 mice were injected intramuscularly with RMS cells on day 0. Mice
   received a single subcutaneous vaccination on day 10 followed by daily gavage of 10
   mg/kg (5 days) and 5 mg/kg (10 days) ARI-4175, 1 mg/kg PT-100 (15 days), or vehicle as
   described in Example 1.
           Figure 9 shows tumor growth in individual mice in the experiment described in
10 Experiment 1.
           Figure 10 shows that ARI-4175 (4175) does not exhibit significant in vitro activity
   against colorectal cancer cell lines. There is also no activity when 4175 is combined with
   cetuximab (CTX). This is expected, since the antitumor effects of ARI-4175 and cetuximab
   are thought to be mediated through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
15         Figure 11 shows that CD 16 expression is upregulated on NK cells taken from nude
   mice treated with ARI-4175.
           Figure 12 shows that LAMP-1 (CD107) expression is upregulated on NK cells
   taken from nude mice treated with ARI-4175.
           Figures 13 A and B show the in vivo inhibition by ARI-4175 of colon cancer
20 xenografts. A shows the inhibition of DLD1 xenografts by ARI-4175 alone or in
   combination with cetuximab (CTX). B shows the inhibition of HCT-116 by ARI-4175
   alone or in combination with cetuximab (CTX).
           Figure 14 shows that cytotoxicity of splenocytes from C57BI/6 non-tumor-bearing
   mice treated with ARI-4175 and/or cetuximab (CTX) is enhanced against HCT 116 tumor
25 cells.
           Figure 15 shows that ARI-4175 induces CD69 on human NK cells. The results
   shown are with cultured human PBLs from two healthy donors after a 1 day incubation.
           Figure 16 shows that ARI-4175 is as effective as PT-100 but less toxic at a high
   dose.
30         Figures 17 A and B show that as adjuvant to tumor-primed T cell transfer, ARI
   4175 induces tumor regression in late treatment RMS M3-9-M model.
           Figures 18 A and B show that combination treatment with ARI-4175 and adoptive
   T cell transfer in Ragl-/- recipients significantly reduces RMS M3-9-M volume. (A)
                                              4

   Female Rag1-- mice received naive or RMS-primed T cells one day after tumor challenge.
   (B) By day 10, ARI-4175 treated mice had significantly smaller tumors than saline treated
   mice (naive: n=5, p=0.0159; primed: n=5, p=0.0079).
   Ragl-/- mice treated with tumor-primed T cells in combination with ARI-4175 had the
 5 smallest tumors overall.
           Figure 19 ARI-4175 is a potent adjuvant to DC vaccination as evidenced by
   significantly improved survival and reduced RMS M3-9-M volume.
           Figure 20 shows the results of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) study using SD
   rats with the data taken 30 minutes post-dose.
10         Figure 21 shows a dose-plasma response curve for PT-100 and ARI-4175.
           Figure 22 shows pharmacokinetic data for the open vs. closed forms of ARI-4175.
   Under acidic conditions, ARI-4175 exists in an open, or linear, form; under neutral or basic
   conditions, a closed, cyclized form is highly favored.
           Figure 23 shows tumor growth in individual mice in the RMS model.

           The term "DASH serine protease" means dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) IV activity
 5 and/or structural homologues thereof. These proteins are enzymes that are united by their
   common post-proline-cleaving serine dipeptidase mechanism.           For example, DPP-VII,
   originally named quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (QPP), is a DASH serine protease.
           Val-boroPro, also known as PT-100 or talabostat, appears to stimulate immunity via
   the activation of caspase-1 and induction of IL-1           in macrophages, which in turn
10 upregulates cytokine and chemokine expression in macrophages and stromal fibroblasts.
   Intracellular DPP 8 and/or 9 activity appears to be the relevant target for PT-100 in
   macrophages. This mechanism of action indicates a hitherto unforeseen regulatory role for
   intracellular DPPs in the immune system.
           ARI-4175, tertiary-butyl (abbreviated t-butyl) Gly-boroPro, is a dipeptide boronic
15 acid that potently inhibits all six members of the prolyl peptidase family of serine proteases
   as an adjuvant for dendritic cell vaccines for the treatment of cancer. Similarly to PT-100,
   ARI-4175 inhibits DPP8/9 activity. Other dipeptide boronic acids, preferably with a bulky,
   hydrophobic side chain such as isoleucine-boroPro, butylglycine-boroPro, phenylalanine
   boroPro (Phe-boroPro), and cyclohexylglycine-boroPro (Cyg-boroPro) are expected to
20 perform in a similar way. Routine experimentation by one skilled in the art could determine
   which compounds that inhibit a plurality of mammalian DASH serine proteases (e.g.,
   compounds of Formula I) could be used successfully in the claimed methods.
           PT-100 activates tumor immunity in mice via cytokine/chemokine upregulation in
   tumors and draining lymph nodes. The use of cytokines as cancer vaccine adjuvants is not
25 new: e.g., GM-CSF for sipuleucel-T and GM-CSF or IL-2 and IFN-y for vaccines in
   development.     However, in comparison to these applications, the orally active DPP8/9
   inhibitors, PT-100 and ARI-4175, have the advantage of stimulating tumor-associated
   macrophages and stromal cells to produce a combination of cytokines and chemokines that
   can cooperate to activate tumor-specific effector T cells.        Among the cytokines and
30 chemokines upregulated by PT-100, IL-1 , CXCL9 and CXCL10 are particularly
   noteworthy. IL-1     produced by tumor-associated macrophages plays a pivotal role in
   activating proinflammatory responses and in promoting development of Thl7 cells in the
   tumor microenvironment.
                                              12

            Based on strong preclinical antitumor activity and a novel mechanism of action, PT
   100 was advanced into human trials in cancer and granted fast-track designation by the
   FDA. However, despite some signals of clinical activity in non-randomized Phase II studies
   of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer
 5 (NSCLC), PT-100 ultimately failed to meet its goals in pivotal Phase III trials in NSCLC.
   Two factors are likely to have contributed to this failure. Most importantly, preclinical
   studies indicated that for optimal antitumor activity of PT-100 in mice, an endogenous
   immune response to the tumor is required. It was unlikely that any such underlying tumor
   immunity remained in the late-stage NSCLC patients studied in Phase III. Secondly, dose
10 limiting toxicity in cancer patients appeared to prevent administration of high enough PT
   100 doses for consistent immune stimulation patient to patient. The studies by Fry et al.
   suggest that PT-100's mechanism of action should be most effective clinically when
   employed to boost cancer vaccines. It is possible that PT-100 might be clinically successful
   when used with an appropriate vaccine that can prime tumor-specific T cells; but it is the
15 goal of the present invention to identify an analog with lower toxicity that will achieve
   clinical success in humans.
            ARI-4175 or other compounds that inhibit a plurality of mammalian DASH serine
   proteases (e.g., compounds of Formula I), alone or in combination with dendritic cell
   therapy (DCT), trastuzamab, cetuximab, ipilimumab, vemurafenib, sorafenib, or other
20 cancer immunotherapies, have a significant advantage over other cancer immunotherapies
   because they are orally active small molecules. They elicit immune activation similar to
   difficult and expensive DCT or antibody treatments, but can be administered much more
   easily. ARI-4175 and compounds that inhibit a plurality of mammalian DASH serine
   proteases (e.g., compounds of Formula I) are the first "orally active tumor antigens" of their
25 kind.
            Many patients do not respond to cetuximab, or develop resistance after initial
   response to therapy. This is due to the cancer developing resistance to the immune system
   of the patient. The immune response is still present, but is either no longer strong enough to
   kill the tumor or the tumor becomes invisible to the immune system. One example is the
30 KRAS mutation found in approximately 40% of malignant colorectal cancers. A recent
   clinical trial (Lievre et al., Cancer Res. 2006, 66 (8), 3992) found that KRAS mutations
   were correlated with resistance to cetuximab, while all of the patients who responded to
   cetuximab lacked the KRAS mutation. Although the molecular mechanisms by which
                                              13

   cetuximab produces a clinical response remain unknown, re-activation of the immune
   response with ARI-4175 may, alone or in combination with cetuximab or other
   immunotherapies, improve clinical outcomes in patients whose immune response is
   insufficient to kill the tumor or who have a refractory cancer.
 5         ARI-4175 or other compounds that inhibit a plurality of mammalian DASH serine
   proteases (e.g., compounds of Formula I) may also be used in combination with T cell
   adoptive transfer therapies. This treatment method uses T-cell-based cytotoxic responses to
   attack cancer cells. The adjuvant properties of ARI-4175 would allow it to be used as a pre
   treatment before administration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TIL, or as a post
10 treatment after administration of adoptive cell transfer.
           The low toxicity of ARI-4175 (or other compounds that inhibit a plurality of
   mammalian DASH serine proteases (e.g., compounds of Formula I) allows it to be used as
   an adjuvant in cancer patients whose cancer is currently in remission. Such patients would
   benefit from an increased anti-tumor immune response to avoid relapse.
15         It is expected that ARI-4175 and other compounds that inhibit a plurality of
   mammalian DASH serine proteases (e.g., compounds of Formula I) would perform
   synergistically with CTLA4 inhibitors, such as ipilimumab (Yervoy@), which is a receptor
   antagonist that increases immune activity. The CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4),
   also known as CD152, is a protein receptor that downregulates the immune system. ARI
20 4175 or other compounds that inhibit a plurality of mammalian DASH serine proteases
   (e.g., compounds of Formula I) in combination with CD28 receptor agonists would work in
   a similar way to increase the activity of T cells.

           The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by
25 reference to the following examples which are included merely for purposes of illustration
   of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit
   the invention.

 5 Synthesis of PT-100. PT-100 was synthesized as previously described in sufficient
   quantities for the studies described in the following examples.
             ARI-4175 is a nanomolar inhibitor of the DPP-IV-like serine proteases, including
   DPPs 8 and 9 (Table 1), which are the putative targets in PT-100's immune mechanism of
   action. Inhibition of DPP-IV and FAP activity may also contribute to the antitumor effect of
10 PT-100 because selective abrogation of DPP-IV or FAP activity appears to slow tumor
   growth.

             C57BL/6 mice bearing established RMS were vaccinated intramuscularly in a hind
15 limb with RMS DC vaccine on day 10 after tumor inoculation.                   ARI-4175, PT-100 or
   vehicle was administered by daily gavage from day 10 onwards for 3 cycles of 5 days each
   as described herein: ARI-4175, 10 mg/kg, cycle 1 and 5 mg/kg cycles 2 and 3; PT-100, 1
   mg/kg cycles 1 to 3. Another group of mice received vaccine but no compounds and groups
   of unvaccinated mice received compounds or vehicle. 8 replicate mice were treated in each
20 regimen.
             As shown in Figure 8, administration of ARI-4175 by itself significantly slowed
   tumor growth (Fig. 8A) and produced tumor regression in 3/8 mice by day 25 (Fig. 9). In
                                                    15

   combination with vaccine, ARI-4175 produced regression in 6/8 mice (Fig. 9) and
   increased mouse survival significantly (P        =  0.0045; Fig 1B).    In contrast, PT-100
   administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg, either with or without DC vaccination, failed to produce
   tumor regression (Fig. 2) by day 25 or significant inhibition of tumor growth (Fig. 8A), and
 5 tumor growth was only reduced in 2 out of 6 mice treated with PT-100 and the vaccine
   (Fig. 9). The 1 mg/kg dose of PT-100 was previously shown to be optimal for activation of
   tumor immunity in C57BL/6 mice, and the dose cannot be increased much higher because
   the MTD for PT-100 is ~2 mg/kg in C57BL/6 mice. Therefore, the significant vaccine
   adjuvant effect of a 10/5-mg/kg dose of ARI-4175 suggests that ARI-4175 is less toxic than
10 PT-100, and that it is possible to increase the dose of ARI-4175 to achieve greater tumor
   regression and mouse survival than is possible with PT-100 at tolerated doses in the RMS
   mouse model.
                                              Example 2
                  Effectiveness of ARI-4175 in the RMS DC tumor vaccine model
15          Figure 17 A shows the experimental setup for priming of T cell donors and T cell
   recipients. Figure 17 B shows the tumor volume curve (mean ± standard deviation) and
   survival curve. Mice receiving ARI-4175 alone had significantly smaller tumors compared
   to saline (n=10, p=0.0019). Though ARI-4175 + primed T cell recipients had smaller
   tumors, the difference was not significant when compared to ARI-4175 + naYve T cell
20 recipients (n=10, p=0.0755). Eight of ten ARI-4175 + primed T cell recipients survived to
   day 80, however this was not significant compared to the 40% survival of ARI-4175 +
   naYve T cell recipients (n=10, p=0.0658).
            Figures 18 A and B show that combination treatment with ARI-4175 and adoptive T
   cell transfer in Ragl-/- recipients significantly reduces RMS M3-9-M volume. (A) Female
25 Rag1-/- mice received naYve or RMS-primed T cells one day after tumor challenge. (B) By
   day 10, ARI-4175 treated mice had significantly smaller tumors than saline treated mice
   (naYve: n=5, p=0.0159; primed: n=5, p=0.0079). Ragl-/- mice treated with tumor-primed T
   cells in combination with ARI-4175 had the smallest tumors overall.
            ARI-4175 is a potent adjuvant to DC vaccination as evidenced by significantly
30 improved survival and reduced RMS M3-9-M volume (Figure 19). Figure 19 A shows a
   late treatment model for DC vaccination and ARI-4175 treatment. Figure 19 B shows the
   tumor volume curve (mean ± s.d.) and survival curve. Both groups treated with ARI-4175
   had significantly improved survival compared to controls (sham vaccine: n=7, p<0.001, DC
                                               16

   vaccine: n=7, p<0.001). Mice treated with a combination therapy using ARI-4175 and DC
   vaccine had significantly smaller tumors compared to mice treated with ARI-4175 alone
   (n=7, p=O.048 1).
           The RMS cell line was derived from Ink4a/Arf- mice transgenic for hepatocyte
 5 growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) that develop malignant RMS with high penetrance.
   DC vaccine will be prepared by incubating bone marrow derived DCs with apoptotic bodies
   generated from RMS cells as previously described. Tumor growth was monitored by caliper
   measurement every 2 days.

10                Induction of IL-1I3 and upregulation of cytokine and chemokine
                  expression in tumors and draining lymph nodes by Ala-boroPro
                 (2243), Val-boroPro (PT-100, 2054), and t-BuGly-boroPro (ARI
                                                4175)
           Method for Cytokine Assay in BALB/c Mice. Female BALB/c mice were treated
15 with various doses of PT-100 or ARI-4175 by oral gavage (PO) or intraperitoneal (IP)
   injection and serum was analyzed for chemokines (Figures 4, 5, and 6). Blood was
   collected by cardiac puncture at various times post-dose and serum was prepared for
   analysis by ELISA. The samples were assayed for mouse mouse cytokines G-CSF and
   mouse CXCL1 using ELISA kits from R&D Systems (Cat. No. MCSOO and MKCOOB
20 respectively). All measurements were made in duplicate. Serum samples were diluted as
   necessary to obtain values within the range of the assays. Optimal dilutions required varied
   depending on the test agent and can range from no dilution for control samples or test
   agents with no activity to 1:1000 dilution for very high samples. For agents that produce a
   positive response the strongest signal was observed at 2 hrs post-dose for CXCL1 and at 6
25 hours post-dose for G-CSF. The dose response varies with test agent but 20 gg/mouse dose
   is an acceptable baseline dose for response assessment. Typically 6 animals are measured
   for each agent at each time point.
           Figure 4 demonstrates that Val-boroPro (2054), but not Ala-boroPro (2243),
   stimulates G-CSF and CXCL1/KC in BALB/c mice. G-CSF and CXL1/KC are markers of
30 anti-cancer immune enhancing activity.
           ARI-4175 (4175-2 in Figures 5 and 6) is a very potent inducer of cytokines.
   Stimulation of G-CSF increased until 6 h after administration; CXCL1 was rapidly induced
   at 3 h after administration but had disappeared by 6 h (Figure 5). ARI-4175 (4175-2) is at
                                              17

   least 5 times more potent than PT-100 (2054) at inducing G-CSF and CXCL1 cytokines
   (Figure 6). Serum from ARI-4175 treated mice also had increased IL-18, IL-10 and IFN-y
   compared to vehicle but at much lower levels than G-CSF and CXCL 1.
           PT-100 stimulates expression of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNA 2
 5 hours after oral administration to tumor-bearing mice. The PT-100 response is characterized
   by upregulation of IL- 10, G-CSF, IL-6, CXCL1, CXCL9 and CXCL10 in tumor and lymph
   node tissue. ARI-4175 was recently found to stimulate development of IL-17 producing
   Th17 cells in vitro (V. Kuchroo, unpublished data).      Th-17  cells appear to contribute to
   effective antitumor immunity in certain cancers; therefore, IL-17 will be included with the
10 cytokine/chemokine panel characterizing the response to PT-100 that we will investigate
   after administration of ARI-4175 and PT-100 to RMS-DC vaccinated mice. RNA
   expression will be assayed in RMS tumor and draining lymph node tissues 2 hours after
   compound administration at optimal doses. We will use the RT-PCR procedure used
   previously to analyze the upregulation of cytokines and chemokines by PT-100 in mice
15 bearing A549 lung carcinoma xenografts. cDNA will be synthesized with an iScript kit
   (Biorad, Hercules, CA) from total RNA extracted by Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA),
   diluted 1:10 in water, and amplified for 40 cycles in a thermal cycler (cDNA denaturing, 95
   'C/15 s; annealing and extension, 60 'C/30 s) using 10-gM unlabeled primer pairs in a 2X
   iQ Sybergreen Supermix (Biorad). Reactions will use Taqman probes 5'-labeled with HEX,
20 FAM or Texas Red and 3'-labeled with black hole quenchers (Biosearch Technologies,
   Novato, CA). Cytokine/chemokine         target mRNA and        18s RNA reference      control
   forward/reverse primer pairs and Taqman probes will be designed using Beacon Designer
   software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA). mRNA copy numbers will be
   calculated from cycle threshold values using standard curves with size-characterized
25 reference cDNA, which will be synthesized and amplified from mouse tissue RNA, purified
   by electrophoresis and a gel purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and quantified by
   PicoGreen (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
           As shown in Figures 11 and 12, treatment of mice with ARI-4175 also increased
   NK cell expression of the FcyRIII receptor, CD16 and the degranulation marker LAMP-1.
30 In vitro treatment of human NK cells also increased the activation marker, CD69 (Figure
   15). The therapeutic effect of ARI-4175 might partially be due to the augmentation of
   ADCC through elevating expression of CD16 (FcyRIIIA) and activating NK cells (based on
   CD69 upregulation).

                   Immunological memory by tumor rechallenge of vaccinated
                       mice in which tumor regression and rejection occurs
           An effective vaccine for cancer would have the advantage of establishing
 5 immunological memory that can protect against disseminated metastasis or tumor regrowth
   following clinical response to initial treatment. Mice in which intramuscular RMS tumors
   are rejected after RMS DC vaccination followed by ARI-4175 or PT-100 treatment in
   Example 1 were rechallenged by intramuscular injection of 10 x 106 RMS cells at least 20
   30 days after rejection of primary tumors. Mice were monitored for secondary tumor
10 growth for a further 20-30 days without any additional therapeutic treatment. In order to
   demonstrate immunological specificity of protection, mice will also be challenged with the
   C57BL/6 tumor cell line, EL4 (ATCC, TIB-39). Groups of 4 mice were tested for
   immunological    memory. Similar experiments demonstrating          tumor-specific memory
   following PT-100 treatment have been described.
15         As shown in Figure 7, female C57BL/6 mice were challenged intramuscularly with
   1x106 RMS M3-9-M on day 0. Mice were orally gavaged with 200 pig ARI-4175 on days 3
                                                                                             5
   7, 17-21, 24-28, and 31-35. Tumor-free survivors were rechallenged on day 56 with 5x10
   RMS M3-9-M and monitored with no additional 4175 treatment. Following rechallenge,
   RMS M3-9-M showed initial growth followed by rejection in all mice (n=7, p=0.0175).

   nodes and spleens of RMS tumor-bearing mice receiving the RMS DC vaccine and ARI
   4175 or PT-100 treatments described in Example 1. The assay will be performed as
25 previously described for the measurement of tumor-specific CTL responses stimulated by
   PT-100 in EL4 tumor-inoculated C57BL/6 mice. Specificity of CTLs will be investigated
   by comparing cytotoxicity against RMS versus EL4 cells.

                        MTDs of ARI-4175 and PT-100 in C57BL/6 mice
30         Previously, in C57BL/6 mice administered PT-100 at doses above the MTD (~2
   mg/kg/day), no obvious signs of toxicity were observed prior to death; therefore, the end
   point for determination of MTD was mortality in this experiment. In order to gain insight
   into the causes of toxicity, histopathology was investigated to determine the dose response
                                              19

   of plasma cytokine and chemokine levels. The cytokine/chemokine assay was used to
   determine whether toxicity is related to PT-100's putative mechanism of action.
   Preliminary experiments indicated that blockade of cytokine/chemokine responses with the
   IL-IR antagonist, anakinra, does not alter the toxicity of PT-100 in rats, suggesting that the
 5 toxicity of PT- 100 may not be due to systemic cytokine/chemokine production.
            Summary of Rat Toxicity. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) study was
   undertaken to compare the MTD for ARI-4175 (t-BuGly-boroPro) and PT-100 (Val
   boroPro, ARI-2054) in Sprague Dawley rats. Animals were dosed by either subcutaneous
   injection (SQ) or oral gavage (PO). Six animals were used at each dose. A blood sample
10 was drawn from the tail at 30 minutes post-dose which was used to measure plasma drug
   concentrations.   The starting dose for both compounds was 0.05 mg/kg body weight and
   then the dose was adjusted up or down for each drug to determine the maximum dose at
   which there was 100% survival. At the starting dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight SQ, both
   ARI-4175 and PT-100 treatment resulted in at least one animal death within the first 24
15 hours. A 0.01 mg/kg body weight dose, SQ, did not result in any deaths and no adverse
   effects were observed for 48 hours post-dose. A third experiment was done at a dose of
   0.025 mg/kg body weight which resulted in one death in the ARI-4175 group but no deaths
   in the PT-100 group. The study was repeated with oral dosing starting again at 0.05 mg/kg
   body weight. Both drugs were apparently more tolerated by the oral dose as there were no
20 adverse effects in this experiment at 0.05 mg/kg PO. Increasing the dose to 0.1 mg/kg PO
   resulted in 2 deaths in the PT-100 group but no adverse effects with ARI-4175. At 0.25
   mg/kg ARI-4175 PO there was one death. Therefore the MTD observed for SQ was 0.025
   mg/kg for PT-100 and 0.01 mg/kg for ARI-4175.          By the oral route the MTD was 0.05
   mg/kg for PT-100 and 0.1 mg/kg for ARI-4175.               Evaluation of the plasma drug
25 concentrations suggests toxicity results at equivalent plasma drug concentrations regardless
   of the route of administration. Toxicity is observed for the dose of drug that results in
   plasma drug concentration of 100 +/-50 nM. This data is summarized in Figure 20.
            Mouse Toxicity Plasma vs. Dose Figures. C57BL/6 mice were treated by oral
   gavage at various doses up to 40 mg/kg of ARI-4175 and up to 10 mg/kg of PT-100 (ARI
30 2054) daily for 5 days. On the 5th day blood was drawn pre-dose and at 30 minutes post
   dose and plasma drug concentrations were measured by LCMS. Oral availability of PT-100
   is 3-4 times greater than that of ARI-4175 as evidenced by the plasma concentrations at the
   10 mg/kg dose.     Plasma concentrations are approximately proportional to dose over the
                                             20

   range tested.  Survival was 100% in this experiment but all groups showed significant
   weight loss over the 5 day treatment period. The results are shown in Figure 21.
           PK for 4175 in Mice. Pharmacokinetics of ARI-4175 was measured in normal
   BALB/c mice in both the open (linear) and closed (cyclic) forms of the drug by oral gavage
 5 (PO) and by, intraperitoneal (IP), subcutaneous (SQ) and intravenous (IV) injection. The
   open form of the drug was prepared by incubation of the drug at room temperature
   overnight at pH 2. The closed form was prepared by incubation overnight at pH 7.4 (in
   PBS). The open (linear) samples were neutralized by dilution into PBS immediately before
   administration. The treatment groups are listed below (Table 2).

   made in the tail vein and therefore blood was collected from a distant site (submandibular

20 was measured by LC-MS. The results are shown in Figure 22.

   Investigation of histopathology in mice receiving escalating doses of ARI-4175 and PT-100
           Groups of 3 mice will be inoculated intramuscularly with RMS cells and
   administered PT-100 and ARI-4175 by gavage at doses increasing from the MED
25 determined in Example 1 up to the MTD determined in Example 6. One 5-day cycle of each
   compound will be given from day 10 to day 14 after tumor inoculation, and on day 18,
   specimens of tumor, draining lymph node, spleen, liver, lung and kidney tissue will be fixed
   in formalin and embedded in paraffin. H&E stained tissue sections from test mice will be
   compared histologically with sections from control mice. PT-100 has been shown to
30 stimulate leukocytic infiltration of solid tumors. The tumor infiltrates are characterized by
   neutrophils concentrated at the borders of tumor and stromal tissue. Comparison of tumor
   sections from ARI-4175 treated mice versus sections from PT-100 treated mice will
   determine whether ARI-4175 also promotes tumor infiltration.          It is possible that the
                                              21

   toxicity of PT-100 results from leukocytic infiltration of non-tumor tissues leading to
   inflammatory responses that cause organ failure. Therefore, we will examine the non-tumor
   tissue samples for the presence of leukocytes in mice treated with PT- 100 and ARI-4175.

           Cytokine/chemokine responses to PT-100 are abrogated in IL-IRI                  deficient
   B6.129S7-Illr1'm"m"/J mice (Jackson Laboratory); therefore, if toxicity is due to activity of
   systemic cytokines/chemokines, MTD should be significantly increased in IL-Ri mutant
10 mice relative to congenic C57BL/6 mice. Therefore, the dose responses of serum G-CSF
   and CXCL 1 cytokines will be compared by ELISA (R&D Systems) and the MTDs of ARI
   4175 and PT-100 in B6.129S7-Illrl''"m'/J versus C57BL/6 control mice. MTDs will be
   determined in groups of 3 mice treated at increasing dose levels. G-CSF and CXCL-1 levels
   will be determined in serum sampled at 3 and 8 hours after compound administration. If
15 IL-IRI deficient mice are resistance to toxicity, and if histopathology in Experiment 6
   reveals leukocytic infiltration of non-tumor tissue, IL-IRI deficient and sufficient mice will
   be compared histologically to determine if toxicity is related to inflammatory disruption of
   organ function.

20             Potential anti-tumor and immunologic effects of ARI-4175 in KRAS
             mutated colorectal cancer cell lines; co-administration of ARI-4175 with
                                                cetuximab
           Cetuximab (CTX) is an effective therapeutic agent in a number of malignancies.
   Current data indicate that about 40% of colorectal cancer patients bearing mutated K-ras do
25 not benefit from this agent. A possible mechanism of the antitumor effect of cetuximab is
   mediated through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).                This study
   investigated the potential of activity of ARI-4175, in the treatment of K-ras mutant
   colorectal cancer xenografts as a single agent or in combination with cetuximab.
           The effect of ARI-4175 alone or in combination with cetuximab was evaluated both
30 in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the proliferation of K-ras mutant colon cancer cell lines DLD-I
   and HCT- 116 was detected after three days of culture in the medium containing various
   concentrations of ARI-4175 or cetuximab (Figure 10). ARI-4175 (10 nM-200 gM) alone
   or in combination with cetuximab did not show significant cytotoxicity on either DLD- 1 or
                                                 22

   HCT- 116 in cell culture (Figure 10). In vivo, nude mice bearing DLD-1 or HCT-116
   xenograft   tumors were randomly divided into four groups, control, ARI-4175 alone,
   cetuximab alone and ARI-4175 plus cetuximab. ARI-4175 was administered orally at 100
   gg, q.d or b.i.d and cetuximab was injected intraperitoneally at 200 gg per week.
 5 Tumor measurements were conducted twice a week. In mice growth of both DLD-1 and
   HCT-116 tumors were significantly blocked by the application of ARI-4175 in a dose
   dependent manner (Figure 13 A and B). The combination of ARI-4175 with cetuximab led
   to a further decrease in tumor size although not statistically significant, probably due to
   lower number of animals. Cetuximab alone did not show any therapeutic effect on HCT
10 116 xenograft but did have moderate efficacy on DLD-1 tumors.

                       4175; other differences between the two compounds
           As shown in Figure 16, female C57BL/6 mice were challenged subcutaneously with
15 1x10 6 MB49. Mice were orally gavaged on days 3-7 and 10-14. Tumor volume was
   monitored by caliper measurements. At a 20 gg dose, both PT-100 and ARI-4175 induce
   anti-tumor activity. ARI-4175 dosing at 200 gg induced full regression in 5 of 5 mice
   whereas PT-100 was toxic at the same dose.
           Despite the small differences in chemical structure between PT-100 and ARI-4175,
20 there are unexpectedly large differences in the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the two
   compounds. In particular, the toxicity of ARI-4175 is much lower.
