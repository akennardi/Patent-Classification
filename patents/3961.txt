                                             ABSTRACT
A drive system for a paddle belt conveyor comprises a drive shaft and a drive roller rotationally
driven by the drive shaft about a first axis. The drive roller exerts traction on a belt of the belt
conveyor. The belt comprises a plurality of paddles. The drive system includes a pinch roller
mounted rotationally about a second axis parallel to the first axis. The pinch roller pinches the
belt between the pinch roller and the drive roller to augment the traction of the drive roller on
the belt. Either the drive roller or the pinch roller is a bobbin roller to accommodate the paddles
on the belt. The drive system may further include a take-up roller rotatable about a third axis
parallel to the first axis, and first and second idler rollers rotatable about fourth and fifth axes
parallel to the first axis.

                     DRIVE SYSTEM FOR PADDLE BELT CONVEYOR
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The present invention relates generally to agricultural conveyors for conveying grain or
other particulate matter and, more particularly, to belt conveyors.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Various types of agricultural machinery employ belt conveyors to move particulate
material such as grain or seeds from one location to another. A paddle belt conveyor has a
plurality of paddles attached at intervals on one side of a conveyor belt.
[0003] The belt conveyor, whether it has paddles or not, may be powered by a power takeoff
(PTO) from a tractor or other work vehicle, a gas engine or an electric motor coupled to belts and
pulleys, chains and sprockets, or gear drives. A hydraulic drive may alternatively be used to
drive the conveyor. The conveyor may run upwardly through a tubular enclosure from a hopper
designed to receive the particulate material to a spout that is designed to discharge the material.
Alternatively, the conveyor may be a flat-pan conveyor in which the conveyor runs upwardly
through a rectangular enclosure. The belt conveyor typically includes a support frame, a hitch
and wheels for towing although, in other cases, the conveyor may be rigidly mounted and thus
requires no frame or wheels. These types of belt conveyor are commonly used in the agricultural
industry to convey grain, seed or other particulate matter from the hopper to the spout such as,
for example, in moving grain or seeds from or into a storage bin or to move seeds or grain from
or into a storage tank of a vehicle.
[0004] Traditionally, to convey particulate matter to greater heights requires longer conveyors.
Longer conveyors are usually more expensive, more difficult to maneuver and, when inclined,
take up more space in a loading area.        Belt slippage and tracking also tend to worsen with
increased conveyor length.
[0005] Another issue with conveyors is the size and location of the drive system. Conventional
drive systems for conveyors tend to be bulky and are designed to be connected to the conveyor at
                                                 -1 -

the hopper.
[0006] Typical paddle conveyors in use today are driven from the discharge end, by wrapping
the belt approximately 180 degrees around a head roller. The friction between the head roller
and the back surface of the belt provides the means of power transmission. Conveyors with this
type of drive system are limited in their length and /or elevation due to belt slippage.
[0007] S-shaped drive systems are used with smooth (non-paddle) belts to increase power
transmission by increasing the contact area between the belt and the drive roller (i.e. using a
larger drive roller and/or increased angle of belt wrap). An S-drive also allows for the placement
of the power source (PTO, gas motor, electric motor, etc.) at a more convenient operating
position than the elevated discharge end of the conveyor.
[0008] Applicant has recognized that it would be advantageous to provide an S-shaped drive
system for a paddle belt conveyor. Developing an S-shaped drive system for paddle belts proved
to be a significant technical challenge because a traditional S-shaped drive has rollers which
contact both sides of the belt. Accordingly, Applicant realized that a means had to be developed
to allow the paddles to pass through the drive, while still providing for sustained contact with
both top and bottom surfaces of the conveyor belt. In developing a design for a paddle belt S
drive, other ideas were first tried. One such concept tested by Applicant had a drive roller with
slotted openings. The slots were timed with the paddle spacing on the conveyor belt so that the
paddles could pass radially inwardly through the driving/contact surface of the drive roller. This
concept had limitations because if the belt slipped, or if the belt stretched, the timing would be
disrupted causing the paddles and driving surface of the roller to come in contact.
[0009] Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to provide an efficient and compact drive
system, whether having an S shape or not, for use with a paddle belt conveyor.
SUMMARY
[0010] The following presents a simplified summary of some aspects or embodiments of the
invention in order to provide a basic understanding of the invention. This summary is not an
extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the
invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some
                                                - 2-

embodiments of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description
that is presented later.
[0011] There are various inventive aspects of this disclosure. One main aspect is a drive system
for a paddled belt conveyor having a drive roller and a pinch roller, one of which is a bobbin
roller that includes an internal space to accommodate the paddles of the belt as the belt passes
over the bobbin roller. Specific aspects of the disclosure are now summarized below.
[0012] The present specification discloses an S-shaped drive system for a paddle belt conveyor
that has a plurality of paddles mounted to the belt.        Disclosed in this specification is a novel
mechanism enabling an S-shaped drive to drive a paddle belt thereby increasing power
transmission and enabling paddle belts to be used in longer conveyors and/or for increased
elevation.   This innovative solution also addressed the paddle timing issues noted above by
driving the belt with a traditional roller off the back surface of the belt and using bobbin rollers
on the paddle side of the belt. The S-shaped drive system provides excellent traction by virtue of
its pinching action between the pinching bobbin roller and the drive drum roller. This enables
the conveyor to operate at steeper than normal angles of inclination, thereby using less space in
the loading area. Moreover, the S-shaped drive system is both compact and connectable at any
location between the hopper and the spout.
[0013] One inventive aspect of the disclosure is a drive system for a paddle belt conveyor. The
drive system has a drive shaft and a driven drum roller rotationally driven by the drive shaft
about a first axis. The drive system includes a pinching bobbin roller mounted rotationally about
a second axis parallel to the first axis, the pinching bobbin roller pinching the conveyor belt
between the pinching bobbin roller and the driven drum roller. The drive system also includes a
first idler bobbin roller rotatable about a third axis parallel to the first axis and a take-up drum
roller rotatable about a fourth axis parallel to the first axis. The drive system includes a second
idler bobbin roller rotatable about a fifth axis parallel to the first axis.
[0014] Another inventive aspect of the disclosure is a paddle belt conveyor comprising a
conveyor belt, a plurality of paddles connected to the conveyor belt and an S-shaped drive
system. The drive system includes a drive shaft, a driven drum roller rotationally driven by the
drive shaft about a first axis, a pinching bobbin roller mounted rotationally about a second axis
                                                  -3 -

parallel to the first axis, the pinching bobbin roller pinching the conveyor between the pinching
bobbin roller and the driven drum roller, a first idler bobbin roller rotatable about a third axis
parallel to the first axis, a take-up drum roller rotatable about a fourth axis parallel to the first
axis and a second idler bobbin roller rotatable about a fifth axis parallel to the first axis.
[0015] Yet another inventive aspect of the disclosure is a method of conveying particulate matter
on a paddle belt conveyor. The method entails driving a drive shaft to rotate a driven drum roller
about a first axis to thereby move a conveyor belt of the paddle belt conveyor, the conveyor belt
thus causing rotation of a pinching bobbin roller about a second axis parallel to the first axis, the
pinching bobbin roller pinching the conveyor between the pinching bobbin roller and the driven
drum roller. The conveyor belt further causes rotation of a first idler bobbin roller about a third
axis parallel to the first axis. The conveyor belt further causes a take-up drum roller to rotate
about a fourth axis parallel to the first axis. The conveyor belt further causes a second idler
bobbin roller to rotate about a fifth axis parallel to the first axis.
[0016] A further inventive aspect of the disclosure is a drive system for a paddle belt conveyor
comprises a drive shaft and a drive roller rotationally driven by the drive shaft about a first axis.
The drive roller exerts traction on a belt of the belt conveyor. The belt comprises a plurality of
paddles.    The drive system includes a pinch roller mounted rotationally about a second axis
parallel to the first axis. The pinch roller pinches the belt between the pinch roller and the drive
roller to augment the traction of the drive roller on the belt. The drive system further includes a
take-up roller rotatable about a third axis parallel to the first axis, a first idler roller rotatable
about a fourth axis parallel to the first axis, and a second idler roller rotatable about a fifth axis
parallel to the first axis.
[0017] A further inventive aspect of the disclosure is a paddle belt conveyor comprising a
conveyor belt having a plurality of paddles and a drive system for driving the belt. The drive
system includes a drive shaft and a drive roller rotationally driven by the drive shaft about a first
axis, the drive roller exerting traction on a belt of the belt conveyor, wherein the belt comprises a
plurality of paddles.      The drive system includes a pinch roller mounted rotationally about a
second axis parallel to the first axis, the pinch roller pinching the belt between the pinch roller
and the drive roller to augment the traction of the drive roller on the belt. The drive system
                                                  -4-

includes a take-up roller rotatable about a third axis parallel to the first axis, a first idler roller
rotatable about a fourth axis parallel to the first axis and a second idler roller rotatable about a
fifth axis parallel to the first axis.
[0018] A further inventive aspect of the disclosure is a method of conveying particulate matter
on a paddle belt conveyor. The method comprises driving a drive shaft to rotate a drive roller
about a first axis to thereby move a conveyor belt of the paddle belt conveyor and pinching the
belt between the pinch roller and the drive roller to augment the traction of the drive roller on the
belt using a pinch roller mounted rotationally about a second axis parallel to the first axis. The
method further includes directing the belt using a take-up roller rotatable about a third axis
parallel to the first axis, a first idler roller rotatable about a fourth axis parallel to the first axis
and a second idler roller rotatable about a fifth axis parallel to the first axis.
[0019] Other inventive aspects of the disclosure may become apparent from the detailed
description and drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0049] The following detailed description contains, for the purposes of explanation, numerous
specific embodiments, implementations, examples and details in order to provide a thorough
understanding of the invention. It is apparent, however, that the embodiments may be practiced
without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, some well
known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily
obscuring the embodiments of the invention. The description should in no way be limited to the
illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary
designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the
scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.
[0050] CONVEYOR
[0051] An exemplary embodiment of the conveyor is depicted schematically in Figure 1. It
should be understood that this exemplary embodiment represents only one way of implementing
this technology. In other words, variations, modifications and refinements may be made to the
system presented herein without departing from the fundamental inventive concept or concepts
that are disclosed in this specification.
                                               - 7-

[0052] In the embodiment shown by way of example in Figure 1, a conveyor generally denoted
by reference numeral 10 includes a frame 12, a pair of wheels 14, an inclined tube 20, an intake
or hopper 30 and a discharge or spout 40. The conveyor includes a belt 50 to which are attached
a plurality of paddles 52. The belt may be made of canvas or other equivalent material. The
paddles are made of rubber or any other equivalent material. The paddles are spaced at regular
intervals on the belt.    The conveyor shown in Figure 1 may be driven by an S-shaped drive
system whose structure and functionality will now be described below.
[0053] S-SHAPED DRIVE SYSTEM
[0054] Shown by way of example in Figures 2 and 3 is an S-shaped drive system 60 in
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.          The drive system 60 has a drive
shaft 62 and a driven drum roller 64 rotationally driven by the drive shaft about a first axis 66.
The drive system 60 includes a pinching bobbin roller 70 having a shaft 72 mounted rotationally
about a second axis 76 parallel to the first axis, the pinching bobbin roller pinching the conveyor
between the pinching bobbin roller and the driven drum roller.          The drive system 60 also
includes a first idler bobbin roller 80 having a shaft 82 rotatable about a third axis 86 parallel to
the first axis. The drive system 60 further includes a take-up drum roller 90 having a shaft 92
rotatable about a fourth axis 96 parallel to the first axis. The drive system 60 further includes a
second idler bobbin roller 100 having a shaft 102 rotatable about a fifth axis 106 parallel to the
first axis. The drum rollers are cylindrical drums of constant diameter whereas the bobbins have
shafts supporting larger disk-like guides.     The structure of the bobbins will be described in
greater detail below.
[0055] The driven drum roller 64 is driven by the drive shaft 62 which may be connected to, for
example, to a prime mover such as a power takeoff (PTO) shaft of a tractor or work vehicle or an
output shaft of a standalone powerplant, such as gas engine, electric motor or hydraulic drive.
[0056] In operation, the back side (i.e. non-paddle side) of the belt 50 is pulled over the driven
drum roller 64 by friction. The pinching bobbin roller 70 pinches the belt 50 against the driven
drum roller 64 and forces additional belt wrap on the drum roller. The pinching of the rollers also
provides additional friction to help pull the belt 50. This drive system 60 gets significantly more
traction than a top or bottom drive due to the extra wrap and pinch. This significantly reduces
                                                 - 8 -

the amount of slippage between the driven drum roller 64 and the belt 50. This drive system
enables longer conveyors to operate at steeper angles than what is conventionally feasible.
[0057] In the illustrated embodiment, the pinching bobbin roller 70, the first idler bobbin roller
80 and the second idler bobbin roller 100 have a same diameter although in other embodiments
the diameters may be all different or in yet other embodiments only two of the three bobbin
rollers have the same diameter.    In the illustrated embodiment, as shown in Figure 3, the shafts
72, 82, 102 are aligned.       Since the diameters of the bobbin rollers are identical in this
embodiment, the span of belt between the pinching bobbin roller 70 and the first idler bobbin
roller 80 is in the same plane as the span of belt between the first idler bobbin roller 80 and the
second idler bobbin roller 100. It will be appreciated that the illustrated geometry may be varied
without departing from the inventive concept.
[0058] In the illustrated embodiment, the driven drum roller has a larger diameter than the
diameter of the pinching bobbin roller, the first idler bobbin roller and the second idler bobbin
roller.
[0059] In the illustrated embodiment, the take-up drum roller has a diameter smaller than the
diameter of the pinching bobbin roller, the first idler bobbin roller and the second idler bobbin
roller. The take-up drum roller may be adjustable in height to regulate the amount of tension in
the belt.
[0060] In another embodiment depicted in Figure 4, the drive system 60 is covered or
enshrouded by a box-like shroud 110 to support and protect the drive system.
[0061] As shown by way of example in Figure 5, when the drive system is viewed from the
front, the vertical distance between the drive shaft 62 of the driven drum roller 64 and the shaft
92 of the take-up drum roller 90 is less than the vertical distance between the drive shaft 62 and
the shaft 72 of the pinching bobbin roller 70.
[0062] Figures 6-8 depict how the paddle belt moves through the S-shaped drive system. The
geometry of the drive system is designed to permit the paddles to move through the drive system
without interfering with each other or with the rollers. In these figures, it is shown that the belt
wraps around the driven drum roller 64 with the paddles protruding radially outwardly. The belt
                                                 -9 -

wraps from the underside more than 180 degrees, as shown in Figure 7, such that a portion of the
belt is traveling in a reverse direction before it is pinched by the pinching bobbin roller 70 after
which the belt wraps more than 180 degrees around the pinching bobbin roller 70 to continue in
its original direction. The wrapping of the belt around the driven drum roller 64 and the pinching
bobbin roller 70 defines an S-shaped path, hence the name S-shaped drive system.         It is noted
that the paddles point radially inwardly when the belt travels over the pinching bobbin roller 70.
The paddles also point radially inwardly when the belt passes over the first idler bobbin roller 80.
The paddles of the belt point radially outwardly when the belt passes over the take-up drum
roller 90. Finally, the paddles of the belt point radially inwardly when the belt passes over the
second idler bobbin roller 100.
[0063] As shown by way of example in Figures 9-11, each bobbin roller comprises a respective
shaft, e.g. the shafts 72, 82, 102 referenced earlier. On each is a sleeve 75, 85, 105 of slightly
greater diameter defining an inner radius RI. Supported on each sleeve is a spaced-apart pair of
disk-like belt guides 74, 84, 104 defining an outer radius R2, such that a difference between the
outer radius R2 and the inner radius RI is equal to a height H of each of the paddles. In another
embodiment, the difference between R2 and RI is greater than the height H. In yet another
embodiment, if the paddles are sufficiently flexible or deformable, the difference between R2
and RI could even be slightly less than the height H. The pair of disk-like belt guides is spaced
apart by a distance slightly greater than the width of each of the paddles.
[0064] Figure 12 shows the drive system 60 inside the box-like shroud 110 disposed
approximately midway between the hopper 30 and the spout 40. The drive system 60 may be
attached to an underside of the tube 20 or to any other structure of the conveyor 10.     The drive
system 60 may be connected anywhere along the conveyor 10, and is not limited to being
connected at the hopper 30 or the spout 40.
[0065] Figure 13 shows the underside of the S-shaped drive system 60. This figure also shows
the compactness of the drive system 60, which is mainly due to the innovative use of bobbin
rollers in this context. Using a bobbin roller enables extra wrap on the drive roller 64. This
design allows for transition under high tension without the belt pulling into the roller. The three
rollers at the back of the drive system act as a vertical spring-loaded take-up. Two rollers are
                                                 -10-

bobbin type and one is a drum roller. This type of take-up mechanism can be moved anywhere
along the tube of the conveyor.
[0066] Figures 14-16 depict spaced-apart return rollers 120 for a return run of the conveyor.
The return rollers 120 interact with the paddle side of the belt 50. The return rollers 120 are
supported by roller supports 122 on a base or bracket 124. The return rollers 120 are spaced
apart by a distance greater than a width of each of each of the paddles 52. The return rollers 120
are spaced so as to help track the belt 50. The belt 50 cannot wander very far before the paddle
contacts one of the rollers 120. This design for the return run also helps make the conveyor
compact.
[0067] METHOD OF CONVEYING USING S-SHAPED DRIVE SYSTEM
[0068] Another inventive aspect of this disclosure is a novel method of conveying particulate
matter on a paddle belt conveyor. The method entails conveying particulate matter on a paddle
belt conveyor. The method entails driving a drive shaft to rotate a driven drum roller about a
first axis to thereby move a conveyor belt of the paddle belt conveyor, the conveyor belt thus
causing rotation of a pinching bobbin roller about a second axis parallel to the first axis, the
pinching bobbin roller pinching the conveyor between the pinching bobbin roller and the driven
drum roller. The conveyor belt further causes rotation of a first idler bobbin roller about a third
axis parallel to the first axis. The conveyor belt further causes a take-up drum roller to rotate
about a fourth axis parallel to the first axis. The conveyor belt further causes a second idler
bobbin roller to rotate about a fifth axis parallel to the first axis.
[0069] The method may be performed using an S-shaped drive system in which the pinching
bobbin roller, the first idler bobbin roller and the second idler bobbin roller have a same
diameter.    The method may be performed using an S-shaped drive system in which the driven
drum roller has a larger diameter than the diameter of the pinching bobbin roller, the first idler
bobbin roller and the second idler bobbin roller. The method may be performed using an S
shaped drive system in which the take-up drum roller has a diameter smaller than the diameter of
the pinching bobbin roller, the first idler bobbin roller and the second idler bobbin roller. The
method may be performed using an S-shaped drive system in which each bobbin roller comprises
a shaft supporting a sleeve defining an inner radius and a spaced-apart pair of disk-like belt
                                                  -11-

guides defining an outer radius, such that a difference between the outer radius and the inner
radius is equal to a height of each of the paddles.
[0070] In the foregoing methods, the drive shaft, driven drum roller, pinching bobbin roller,
first idler bobbin roller, second idler bobbin roller and take-up drum roller may together form a
drive system packaged inside a shroud and disposed between a hopper and a spout. The methods
may be used to convey grain, seed or any other particulate matter from the hopper to the spout.
The methods, though initially conceived for use in the agricultural industry, may also be used to
convey particulate matter in other industries.
[0071] MODIFIED DRIVE SYSTEM
[0072] A modified drive system for a paddle belt conveyor that is believed to provide even
better performance than the S-shaped drive system of Figures 1-16 is depicted by way of
example in Figures 17-25.       In the embodiments depicted in Figures 17-25, the modified drive
system 200 can be used to drive a conveyor belt 50 in a conveyor 10 such as the one depicted in
Figure 1. The drive system is intended to drive a paddle belt 50 having a plurality of paddles 52
as illustrated in the figures. In the embodiment depicted in Figures 17-22, the drive system 200
uses a bobbin-type drive roller 202 to drive the belt 50.      Note that the embodiment of Figures
 17-22 uses a bobbin-type drive roller (or simply "bobbin roller") instead of the drum roller of the
embodiment of Figure 1. In the embodiment of Figures 17-22, the bobbin-type drive roller 202
is driven by a drive shaft 204 that provides the torque to rotate the bobbin-type drive roller 202
about a drive shaft axis of rotation.       The drive shaft 204 would be directly or indirectly
connected, when in operation, to a power takeoff (PTO) output shaft of a tractor or another prime
mover (e.g. an internal combustion engine or electric motor) via a torque-transmission
mechanism (not shown because such mechanisms are well known in the art). The drive system
200 includes a pinch roller 206 having shaft or axle 207 that rotates about a pinch roller axis of
rotation parallel to the drive shaft axis of rotation.    The pinch roller 206 as its name implies
pinches the belt 50 between the pinch roller 206 and the drive roller 202 as the drive roller and
pinch roller are in rolling contact to enable the drive roller 202 to exert maximum traction on the
belt. The drive system 200 also includes a take-up drum roller 208 having shaft or axle 209
disposed generally beneath the pinch roller 206 to increase an angle of wrap, further augmenting
                                                 -12-

the traction of the drive roller on the belt. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 17-22, the
take-up drum roller 208 is vertically aligned with the pinch roller 206 and is of the same
diameter although in other embodiments the take-up drum roller may be vertically offset and/or
have a different diameter than the pinch roller.
[0073]     In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 17-22, the drive system 200 includes an idler
drum roller 210 having shaft or axle 211 and an idler bobbin roller 212 having shaft or axle 213.
The idler bobbin roller 212 has a larger diameter than the idler drum roller 210 in the illustrated
embodiment but in another embodiment the idler bobbin roller may be of the same size or
smaller. The drive system 200 may also include a guided bobbin roller (idler) 214 having shaft
or axle 215. The guided bobbin roller 214 optionally also has a belt-guiding collar 310 which
will be further described below. The axes of rotation of the rollers 210, 212, 214 are parallel to
each other. These axes of rotation are parallel to the axes of rotation of the other rollers 202,
206, 208. The drive system 200 provides significant traction on the belt due to the pinching
effect of the belt between the pinch roller and the drive roller as well as the increased wrap
(contact surface) of the belt on the drive roller. The increased wrap (contact surface between the
drive roller and the belt) is a result of the improved geometry of the rollers, as shown in Figures
 17-22, in particular the placement of a take-up roller beneath the pinch roller, which thus enables
the pinch roller to be higher (i.e. closer to the incoming belt). The take-up roller directs the belt
below the drive roller as shown the figures.
[0074] As depicted by way of example in Figure 18, the drive system 200 may be enclosed, or
partially enclosed, by an optional box-like shroud or cover 220.        The cover 220 has an open
front and an open rear through which the belt travels.
[0075]    The drive system 200 is attached to the belt 50 on the return run so that the paddles are
generally facing downwardly when the belt reaches the drive system.           The paddles are then
facing generally upwardly when conveying material on the delivery run. It will be appreciated
that the conveyor may also be angled and thus the paddles may be angled downwardly on the
return run and angled upwardly on the delivery run depending naturally on the orientation of the
conveyor.
[0076] In the embodiment depicted in Figures 17-22, the span of belt between the guided
                                                  -13-

bobbin roller 214 and the drive roller 202 is aligned in the same plane as the segment of belt
rolling off the idler bobbin roller 212. This plane may be called the "main belt plane" of the
return run since most of the belt is running along this plane during the return run except for some
portions of the belt that are passing through the drive system.        The span of belt between the
rollers 208, 210 is generally parallel to the aforementioned plane. The span of belt between
rollers 210 and 212 is generally orthogonal to this plane. The span of belt between rollers 206
and 208 is likewise orthogonal to this plane. It will be appreciated that the drive system may be
configured in other geometries.      The drive system 200 depicted by way of example in Figures
 17-22 is not only effective at providing traction to the belt but it is also a very compact design.
The compactness of the design is evident from the figures.           To achieve this highly compact
design, the rollers need not be arranged exactly as shown.               However, in the illustrated
embodiment of Figures 17-22, which is believed to be the best mode of implementing the
invention, the drive roller is larger in diameter than the other rollers.           In this particular
embodiment, the guided bobbin roller 214 and the idler bobbin roller 212 axles are spaced at the
same height relative to the drive shaft or frame of the conveyor and also have the same diameter.
Thus, in this embodiment, these two rollers 212, 214 support the belt in the same plane as noted
above.    In this embodiment, the rollers 207, 209 and 210 have the same diameter.                The
shafts/axles 207 and 209 are aligned in an orthogonal plane (i.e. orthogonal to the main belt
plane). The shafts/axles 209, 211 are aligned in a parallel plane (i.e. parallel to and spaced-apart
from the main belt plane). In this embodiment, the belt span between rollers 208 and 210 is
greater than the belt span between rollers 206 and 208.           In this embodiment, the belt span
between the rollers 208 and 210 is also greater than the belt span between rollers 210 and 212.
In this embodiment, the belt span between rollers 210 and 212 is greater than the belt span
between rollers 206 and 208. Although this geometry is highly compact and provides excellent
traction on the belt, it will be appreciated that variations on this geometry may be used to achieve
substantially similar results.
[0077] Figure 23 is a side view of a modified drive system of Figure 17 in which the
mechanism has been modified by including springs 230, 240 to increase the force on the take-up
and pinch rollers.
[0078] Figure 24 is a detailed view of a portion of the drive system 200 of Figures 17-22
                                                  -14-

showing the pinching and wrapping effect exerted by the drive system 200 on the belt 50. In the
embodiment of Figures 17-22, there is approximately 50 degrees more of wrap as compared with
the embodiment of Figure 1. This increased contact between the belt and drive roller results in
significantly more traction.
[0079] Figure 25 is an isometric view of a guided spool roller 300 for use in the drive system
200 of Figures 17-22, particularly in the bobbin rollers. The guided spool roller 300 includes
roller guides or belt-guiding collars 310 in the form of a washer-like collar that acts as an annular
shoulder to constrain the belt thus improving the tracking of the belt. Figure 25 also depicts a
belt tensioning mechanism 320 which may be user-adjustable to increase or decrease tension on
the belt. In the illustrated embodiments, the drum rollers are cylindrical. The respective shafts
or axles of each roller extends through a centerline of the cylindrical body of each roller. In the
illustrated embodiments, the bobbin rollers have a narrower cylindrical body with two disc-like
rings at each end. This geometry provides a space for the paddles to pass when the belt runs over
the bobbin roller. The width of the space formed between the disc-like rings at each end is
slightly greater than the width of the paddle. Likewise, the height of the space defined between
the outer radius of the narrower cylindrical body and the outer radius of the disc-like rings is
slightly larger than the height of the paddles.
[0080] Figure 26 is a side view of a drive system 200 for a belt conveyor in accordance with
another embodiment of the present invention.        In the embodiment depicted in Figure 26, the
drive system 200 has a different configuration of rollers as compared with the embodiment of
Figures 17-22. In the embodiment of Figure 26, the drive roller 202, pinch roller 206 and take
up roller 208 are disposed as in the embodiment of Figures 17-22.              However, unlike the
embodiment of Figure 17-22, the drive system 200 of Figure 26 has the idler drum roller 210 and
the idler bobbin roller 212 more vertically aligned. In the embodiment of Figures 17-22, the
most forward point of the drum roller 210 is substantially vertically aligned with the most
rearward point of the idler bobbin roller 212 such that the belt is substantially vertical between
those two rollers. In contrast, in the embodiment of Figure 26, the most rearward point of the
drum roller 210 is substantially vertically aligned (along imaginary vertical line 219) with the
most rearward point of the idler bobbin roller 212 such that the belt is angled rearwardly between
those two rollers.
                                                -15-

[0081] Figure 27 depicts another embodiment of the invention in which the drive system 200
has a drive roller 202 and a pinch roller 206.         The pinch roller 206 in this embodiment is a
bobbin roller that includes an internal space to accommodate the paddles 52 of the belt 50 as the
belt passes over the bobbin roller. Tension on the belt can be adjusted by a tension-adjustment
mechanism indicated by the two-headed arrow on the drive roller 202 in the figure.
[0082] Figure 28 depicts yet another embodiment of the invention in which the drive system
200 has a take-up roller mechanism that includes a take-up roller 208 in addition to the drive
roller 202 and the pinch roller 206. The take-up roller 206 in this embodiment is a drum roller.
The take-up roller 208 cooperates with two bobbin rollers 250, 252 that act as idlers in this
embodiment.
[0083] METHOD OF CONVEYING USING MODIFIED DRIVE SYSTEM
[0084] In accordance with a further inventive aspect of the disclosure, the drive system enables
the performance of a novel method of conveying particulate matter on a paddle belt conveyor.
The method comprises driving a drive shaft to rotate a drive roller about a first axis to thereby
move a conveyor belt of the paddle belt conveyor and pinching the belt between the pinch roller
and the drive roller to augment the traction of the drive roller on the belt using a pinch roller
mounted rotationally about a second axis parallel to the first axis. The method further includes
directing the belt using a take-up roller rotatable about a third axis parallel to the first axis, a first
idler roller rotatable about a fourth axis parallel to the first axis and a second idler roller rotatable
about a fifth axis parallel to the first axis. The method may be used to convey grain, seed or any
other particulate matter. The method may be performed, for example, to convey material from a
hopper to a spout. The method, though initially conceived for use in the agricultural industry,
may also be used to convey particulate matter in other industries. In one implementation of the
method, the drive roller is a bobbin roller. In one implementation, the method further comprises
guiding the belt toward the drive roller using a guided bobbin roller. In one implementation of ht
method, the first idler roller is a drum roller and the second idler roller is a bobbin roller. In one
implementation, the method further comprises exerting a force on the take-up roller using a
spring connected to the take-up roller. Belt-guiding collars on the guided bobbin roller may be
provided to improve belt tracking.        The method may be performed on a conveyor having a
                                                  -16-

hopper and a spout, wherein the drive system is disposed between the hopper and the spout.
