Background of the Invention
[0001]     Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art iswidely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0002]     This patent is directed to a spring assembly with a protected attachment site, a
vibratory apparatus including a spring assembly with a protected attachment site, and a
method for manufacturing a spring assembly with a protected attachment site.
[0003]     In a two-mass vibratory apparatus, a first mass (or exciter mass) is attached to
a second mass (e.g., trough) by one or more reactor springs. Often, these reactor
springs are in the form of coil springs having an end loop disposed at either end. A
washer is placed over one of the end loops, and a fastener (typically a bolt and nut pair)
is disposed through the washer and the end loop to secure the coil spring to the first
mass or to the second mass.
[0004]     While reactor springs are conventionally coated with a corrosion-resistant
and/or abrasion-resistant coating on the outer surface of the spring, such coatings can
become compromised at the contact areas between the spring, the washer, the
fasteners and the machinery. These compromised areas can lead to failure of the
spring.
[0005]     One solution has been to attach the reactor spring to the exciter and the
trough, and then apply an additional coating over all of the assembled pieces. This
additional coating is difficult and time-consuming to apply, and greatly increases the cost
of the springs. Infact, it may not be possible to obtain full coverage of the potentially
compromised areas, such that the additional coating does not prevent the failure of the
spring at these areas.

                                              2
[0006]     It would be advantageous to overcome or substantially ameliorate one or more
of the disadvantages of existing springs, or at least to provide a useful alternative.

Detailed Description of Various Embodiments
[0020]      A spring assembly 100 according to one or more embodiments of the present
disclosure is illustrated in Figs. 1-5. The spring assembly 100 according to the
embodiments illustrated in Figs. 1-5 may be included as a reactor spring in one or more
embodiments of a vibratory apparatus, such as the apparatus 200 illustrated in Fig. 6,
and may be used in the operation thereof as explained below. As noted below, the
spring assembly 100 may be used in other ways as well.
[0021]      As illustrated in Fig. 1, the spring assembly 100 according to one embodiment
includes a coil spring 102 having one or more helical coils 104 between two
longitudinally spaced ends 106, 108. An attachment site 110, used to attach the spring
assembly 100 to a vibratory apparatus such as, e.g., a classifier, conveyor, feeder or
drum, is disposed at at least one of the longitudinally spaced ends 106, 108. As
illustrated in Fig. 1, the attachment site 110 is disposed as the end 106.
[0022]      As seen in detail in the cross-section of Fig. 2, the attachment site 110
includes a casing 120, a washer 122, and a base 124. The casing 120 encloses the end
106 of the spring 102, and has a casing passage 126 therethrough between a first side
128 and a second side 130. The washer 122 is disposed on the first side 128 of the
casing 120, and has a washer passage 132 aligned with the casing passage 126. The
base 124 is disposed on the second side 130 of the casing 120, and has a base
passage 134 aligned with the casing passage 126.
[0023]      In this context, the washer 122 may be described as being disposed on the
first side 128 of the casing 120 without the two objects being in direct contact (whether

                                                5
over all or only a portion of their facing surfaces). For example, an adhesive or sealing
compound may be disposed between the facing surfaces of the casing 120 and washer
122, but the washer 122 may be described as disposed on the first side 128.
Alternatively, the washer 122 may abut a portion of the end 106 of the spring 102 over a
portion of its surface. The same is true relative to the base 124 and the second side
130.
[0024]      Further, the passages 126, 132, 134 may be described as aligned without all
three passages 126, 132, 134 having a common central axis. That is, each of the
passages 126, 132, 134 has a central axis that extends through the center of the
passage 126, 132, 134. Where all three passages 126, 132, 134 are generally
cylindrical in nature, that central axis may run through the center of the circular cross
section of the passage 126, 132, 134. In certain preferred embodiments, it may be
possible to arrange the passages 126, 132, 134 so that the central axes are the same.
According to other embodiments, the axes may be offset from each other, and yet the
passages may be referred to as aligned if they are arranged so that a fastener may be
disposed therethrough.
[0025]      In this regard, the spring assembly 100 may also include or may be used with
a fastener 140 (see Fig. 2). As illustrated, the fastener 140 includes a bolt 142 and a nut
144, but a rivet or clamp may be used instead. The fastener 140 is disposed through the
washer passage 132, the casing passage 126 and the base passage 134 at the
attachment site 110 to secure the washer 122, casing 120, spring 102 and base 124
together. This fastener 140 may also be used to attach or secure the spring assembly
100 to the vibratory apparatus.
[0026]      It will be recognized that the attachment site 110, and in particular the casing
120, washer 122 and base 124 form a multilayered shield that protects the end 106 of
the spring 102. This multilayered shield may surround the end 106 of the spring 102 to
limit or prevent materials in the surrounding environment, especially materials that would
corrode (e.g., moisture) or abrade (e.g. grit, sand) the spring 102, from contacting the
spring 102. According to preferred embodiments, the connection between the casing
120, the washer 122 and the base 124 may be fluid-tight (e.g., water-tight). In fact, the
shield may also limit or prevent contact between the fastener 140 and the end 106 of the

                                                6
coil spring 102, to prevent any interaction between the end 106 and the fastener 140 that
would cause abrasion or corrosion of the end 106. Moreover, certain embodiments of
the attachment site 110 provide this multilayered shield as a unitary (i.e., one-piece)
structure with the coil spring 102 to facilitate assembly of the spring assembly 100 with
the apparatus on which it is to be mounted. As such, the spring assembly 100 may
represent an economical alternative that may be reliably mass-produced and installed
quickly and easily.
[0027]     Having discussed the spring assembly 100 in general terms with reference to
Figs. 1 and 2, the details of the spring assembly 100 are now discussed in detail with
reference to Fig. 3.
[0028]     As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, the end 106 of the coil spring 102 includes a
loop 146. The loop 146 is similar in structure to the loop 148 at the other end 108 of the
spring 102. See, for example, Fig. 4. The fastener 140 may be received through the
loop 146 to secure the coil spring 102 to the remainder of the machine.
[0029]     The loop 146 is attached to the one or more helical coils 104, and is typically
formed from the same piece of metal (e.g., steel) as the helical coils 104. The loop 146
defines a loop passage 150 (see Fig. 2 or 3) between the opposing internal surfaces of
the loop 146 through which the fastener 140 is received. This passage 150 may also
define the casing passage 126 according to certain embodiments. According to other
embodiments, the casing 120 may be disposed (at least in part) in the loop passage
150, preferably with the portion of the casing 120 disposed in the loop passage 150
defining the casing passage 126 aligned with the loop passage 150.
[0030]     As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, by disposing the casing 120 in the loop 146 (i.e.,
the loop passage 150), the casing 120 may form a barrier between the fastener 140 and
the loop 146. Besides potentially limiting or preventing contact between the fastener 140
and the loop 146, the casing 120 potentially limits or prevents contact between the
fastener 140 and any materials that may be applied to an outer surface of the spring 102
to make the spring corrosion- resistant, for example. That is, the spring 102 may be
coated with a corrosion-resistant material such as zinc phosphate. Preventing contact

                                               7
prevents this material from being removed by the fastener 140 during installation, or with
relative motion of the parts during operation.
[0031]     To further ensure that the loop 146 is protected or shielded, the casing 120
may enclose (or encapsulate) the loop 146. That is, the casing 120 may be formed to
surround the loop 146 such that the casing 120 covers the substantial portion of the
outer surface of the loop 146. For the casing 120 to be considered to enclose the loop
146 (or the end 106), the casing 120 need not surround the entire outer surface of the
loop 146, as the washer 122 and the base 124 may be in direct contact (e.g., metal-to
metal contact) with at least a portion of the loop 146 according to certain embodiments.
In some embodiments, the casing 120 may be in the form of a solid disc of material
enclosing the loop 146. According to the illustrated embodiments, the casing 120 may
enclose not only the loop 146 at the end 106, but at least a portion of the one or more
helical coils 104 as well.
[0032]     A number of materials may be used for the casing 120. According to certain
embodiments, the casing 120 may be made of an elastomeric material. The casing 120
may be formed with the spring 102 by molding the casing 120 around the end 106 of the
spring 102, preferably after a layer or multiple layers of a corrosion-resistant material is
applied to the spring 102.
[0033]     According to some embodiments, including those illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3,
the casing 120 may have at least a recess 160. The washer 122 is received within the
recess 160. The recess 160 may assist in aligning the washer 122 with the loop 146,
and in aligning the washer passage 132 with the casing passage 126 (and the loop
passage 150). Alternatively, the recess 160 may be formed when the washer 122 is
molded in place in the casing 120.
[0034]     The recess 160 may depend or extend into the casing 120 a distance (or
depth) parallel to the casing passage axis. Preferably, the recess 160 depends
sufficiently into the casing 120 that the washer 122 abuts the outer surface of the loop
146. Where the washer 122 abuts or is in direct contact (e.g., metal-to-metal contact)
with the loop 146, the casing 120 may seal against the washer 122 to prevent infiltration
of materials along the casing 120/washer 122 interface (e.g., the parts may be

                                               8
adhesively bonded, or the washer 122 may be molded in place when the casing 120 is
formed). According to other embodiments, the recess 160 limits or even prevents
contact between the washer 122 and the outer surface of the loop 146. In fact, a portion
of the casing 120 may be received between the washer 122 and the loop 146 in some
embodiments.
[0035]      According to certain embodiments, the washer 122 is made of a corrosion
resistant material, such as stainless steel or titanium, or a corrosion-resistant and/or
abrasion-resistant material may be applied to an outer surface thereof. The washer 122
may be disposed in the recess 160, and the dimensions of the recess 160 and the
washer 122 may be such that the washer 122 is secured or attached to the casing 120
(for example, as a consequence of the elastomeric material used in the casing 120).
Alternatively or in addition, the washer 122 may be adhered to a surface on the first side
128 in the recess 160 of the casing 120 using an adhesive or as part of the
manufacturing process used to form the first side 128.
[0036]      On the opposite side 130 of the casing 120 is the base 124. As illustrated in
Figs. 1, 4, and 5, the base 124 may have dimensions in the plane perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the spring 102 (i.e., an axis that passes through both loops 146,148)
that are similar or comparable to an inner or outer diameter of the coils 104 of the spring
102 (i.e., the base may be in the form of a flat annulus, with the outer diameter of the
base 124 comparable to the outer diameter of the coils 104 of the spring 102). This
need not be the case according to all embodiments. For example, according to an
alternative embodiment, the base 124 may be much larger dimensionally than the spring
102 in the plane perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the spring 102, and may have a
rectangular or square shape instead of a circular shape.
[0037]      According to the illustrated embodiment, the base 124 is in the form of a plate,
substantially lying in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the spring 102. In
fact, according to certain embodiments, the base-plate 124 may be approximately 0.04
to 0.10 inches (1 to 2.5 mm) thick. Again, this need not be the case according to all
embodiments. For example, the base 124 may have a bend or curvature, such that the
base 124 is not two-dimensional, but three-dimensional. The base 124 may be slightly
larger in diameter than the casing 120 and may have a recess formed therein to receive

                                               9
the remainder of the spring assembly 100 (e.g., the casing 120), for example to better
ensure alignment of the remainder of the attachment site 110 and the base 124 to as to
better ensure alignment of the casing passage 126 and the base passage 134.
[0038]       Similar to the washer 122, the base 124 may abut or be in direct contact with
the loop 146. Where the base 124 abuts or is in direct contact (e.g., metal-to-metal
contact) with the loop 146, the casing 120 may seal against the base 124 to prevent
infiltration of materials along the casing 120/base 124 interface. According to other
embodiments, the casing 120 may fully surround the loop 146 such that a portion of the
casing 120 is disposed between the loop 146 and the base 124.
[0039]      The base 124 may be made of a corrosion-resistant material and/or abrasion
resistance material such as stainless steel or titanium, in a similar fashion as the washer
122. Alternatively, a corrosion-resistant and/or abrasion-resistant material may be
applied to an outer surface of the base 124. In addition, the base 124 may be adhered
to the second side 130 of the casing 120 to ensure that the attachment site 110 is a
single, or unitary, structure. To this end, an adhesive such as silicone or polyurethane
may be used, or the base 124 may be adhered (bonded) to the second side 130 during
manufacture of the casing 120, and in particular the second side 130.
[0040]      The spring assembly 100 may be attached to a spring seat 170. While the
spring seat 170 is represented as a relatively thin plate in Figs. 1, 4 and 5, the spring
seat 170 is typically much thicker than the base 124: for example, the spring seat 170
may be 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) thick (see Figs. 2 and 3). The spring seat 170 may
have a plurality of holes 172 formed therethrough. Each of the holes 172 may define a
passage that may be aligned with the passages in the attachment site 100 to permit the
fastener 140 to be disposed therethrough. Thus, a plurality of spring assemblies 100
may be attached to a single spring seat 170 using the plurality of holes 172.
[0041]      According to certain embodiments, more than one base 124 may be used.
That is, while an embodiment has been illustrated where a single base 124 is disposed
on the side 130 of the casing 120, it may be possible to dispose an additional base (or
sub-base) between the base 124 and the spring seat 170 to which it is attached. This
sub-base also preferably would be made of a corrosion-resistant and/or abrasion-

                                               10
resistant materials, or would have a corrosion-resistant and/or abrasion-resistant
material applied to an outer surface thereof.
[0042]      According to still further embodiments, an attachment site 110 may be
disposed at each of the longitudinally spaced ends 106, 108. In such a circumstance,
each of the attachment sites 110 would include a separate casing 120 enclosing one of
the ends 106, 108. The casing 120 may have a casing passage 126 therethrough
between a first side 128 and a second side 130. A washer 122 may be disposed on the
first side 128 and may have a washer passage 132 aligned with the casing passage 126.
Further, a base 124 may be disposed on the second side 130, and may have a base
passage 132 aligned with the casing passage 126. Fasteners 140 may be disposed
through the washer passages 132, the casing passages 126 and the base passages 132
at each attachment site 110 to secure the washer 122, casing 120, spring 102 and base
124 together.
[0043]      As mentioned above, the spring assembly 100 may be included as one of
more of the reactor springs of a vibratory apparatus, one embodiment of which is
illustrated in Fig. 6. In such an application, the vibratory apparatus may include a deck,
and an exciter assembly coupled to the deck. The exciter assembly may include at least
one eccentric mounted on a shaft, the shaft being coupled to the deck by one or more
spring assemblies. Each of the spring assemblies may include a coil spring having one
or more helical coils between two longitudinally spaced ends, and an attachment site
disposed at at least one of the longitudinally spaced ends. The attachment site may
include a casing enclosing the at least one of the longitudinally spaced ends, the casing
having a casing passage therethrough between a first side and a second side, a washer
disposed on the first side and having a washer passage aligned with the casing
passage, and a base disposed on the second side and having a base passage aligned
with the casing passage. A fastener may be disposed through the washer passage, the
casing passage and the base passage at the attachment site to secure the washer,
casing, spring and base together.
[0044]      Having thus described the spring assembly as part of a vibratory apparatus in
general terms, the structure of a vibratory apparatus and the integration of one or more

                                              11
spring assemblies in that vibratory apparatus are now discussed in detail in regard to the
embodiment of the vibratory apparatus and the spring apparatus illustrated in Fig. 6.
[0045]     Fig. 6 illustrates an embodiment of a vibratory apparatus 200, in the form of a
separator or classifier. This embodiment is intended to be a non-limiting example of the
possible apparatuses that may include a spring assembly 100 according to one or more
of the embodiments described herein. Embodiments of the vibratory apparatus may
vary, for example, as to the function of the apparatus (e.g., conveyor, feeder, drum, etc.),
the shape of the trough (e.g. linear trough, curved trough, cylindrical drum, etc.), the
structures that support the trough and the manner of operation and structure of the
exciter, as will be touched on briefly below.
[0046]     As noted in the preceding paragraph, the apparatus 200 may include a trough
202 that is supported above a surface by a plurality of resilient members 204. According
to certain embodiments (not illustrated), the resilient members 204 may be paired with
linkages. The resilient members 204 (which may be referred to as isolation springs in
this embodiment) may be attached at one end 206 to the trough 202 and at a second
end 208 to a surface or ground, typically via a support structure or frame 210 that may
be bolted or otherwise secured to the surface or ground. According to the illustrated
embodiment, the isolation springs 204 may be marshmallow-type springs.
[0047]     The trough 202 includes a deck 212, which deck 212 may be solid or may
have one or more passages therethrough to permit materials of a first size to move over
the deck 212 and of a second, smaller size to pass through the deck 212. The trough
202 may include a floor beneath the deck 212, or there may be an opening 214 in the
trough 202 beneath the deck 212, as illustrated. Further, the deck 212 may include one
or more deck sections 212-1, 212-2, which sections may be integrated with other
equipment, such as an air knife 216 as illustrated.
[0048]     The trough 202 may also include sidewalls 218 (one of which is illustrated)
disposed at either side of the deck 212 between an inlet end 220 and an outlet end 222.
The sidewalls 218 may be attached directly to the deck 212 at either side of the deck
212. According to certain embodiments, a hood 224 may be disposed above the deck
212 and attached to the sidewalls 218 to limit the amount of material that exits the

                                                12
apparatus 200 other than through the openings 214 below the deck 212 or out the outlet
end 222.
[0049]      An exciter 230 may be coupled to the trough 202 (e.g., by being connected or
attached to the sidewalls 218), and thus be coupled to the deck 212. The exciter 230
may include a motor 232 having a shaft 234 to which one or more eccentric weights 236
are attached, for example. According to other embodiments, the exciter 230 may
include pneumatic and/or hydraulic actuators instead of the motor 232. For that matter,
the shaft 234 and weights 236 may be attached to the trough 202, while the motor 232 is
coupled to the shaft 234, but not mounted on the apparatus 200.
[0050]      The motor 232, shaft 234 and weights 236 (or simply shaft 234 and weights
236) may be coupled to the trough 202 via one or more of the spring assemblies 100, as
illustrated, acting as reactor springs. The exciter 230 may cause motion of the trough
202 and associated deck 212, as well as motion of objects disposed on the deck 212.
The exciter 230 may cause the objects to move from the inlet end 220 to the outlet end
222 (e.g., in a series of gentle catches and throws along a linear deck or in a rolling,
tumbling motion along a curved deck), may cause the objects to move up and down
without significant lateral motion relative to either end, or some combination thereof.
[0051]      The operation of the exciter 230 may be controlled by a controller 238 that
may be coupled to the exciter 230, particularly to the motor 232. The controller 238 may
be programmable, and may vary the operation of the exciter 230.
[0052]      It will be recognized that while the vibratory apparatus 200 may move the
material from the inlet end 220 to the outlet end 222 according to the motion imparted to
the trough 202 by the exciter 230, the apparatus 200 may include other equipment for
moving or processing the material, as mentioned above. For example, the illustrated
embodiment of the apparatus 200 includes an air knife 216, which may be used to
separate the material as it moves from the inlet end 220 to the outlet end 222.
Consequently, while the apparatus 200 is referred to as a vibratory apparatus, this
should not be viewed as limiting the apparatus to the use of only vibratory action to
process materials.

                                               13
[0053]     While different embodiments of the vibratory apparatus may vary from the
illustrated embodiment of Fig. 6, it will be recognized that these embodiments still may
have features in common with the illustrated embodiment. For example, certain
vibratory apparatuses may have a trough with deck(s) and sidewalls, even if they have
no hood. Other apparatuses will include the exciter, even if it is disposed below the
trough instead of above. Still other apparatuses are supported from above, rather than
being mounted on isolation springs supported on a surface or ground. As such, it may
be possible to describe an embodiment of a vibratory apparatus that has fewer than all
of the elements described for the illustrated embodiment of Fig. 6, but that still falls
within the scope of this patent.
[0054]      It is possible for the spring assemblies 100 to be used in a vibratory apparatus
in other ways, instead of as reactor springs. For example, Fig. 7 illustrates a single
mass, or brute-force, apparatus (feeder) that utilizes a plurality of spring assemblies 100
in a different way: to support the deck of the apparatus on a surface or the ground, for
example by being coupled at one end to the deck and at another end to a support
structure, frame, or base that may be bolted or otherwise secured to the surface or the
ground.
[0055]     According to such an embodiment, the exemplary apparatus 300 may include
a trough 302 with a deck 304, which deck 304 may be solid or may have one or more
passages therethrough to permit materials of a first size to move over the deck 304 and
of a second, smaller size to pass through the deck 304. The trough 302 may include a
floor 306 beneath the deck 304, as illustrated. The deck 304 may be attached at either
side to side walls 308 (one of which is illustrated in Fig. 7), which side walls 308 may
also be attached to the floor 306.
[0056]     The trough 302, and in particular the deck 304, may be supported above a
surface or ground by a plurality of spring assemblies 100. The spring assemblies 100
(which may be referred to as isolation springs in this embodiment) may be attached at
one end 312 to the trough 302 and at a second end 314 to a base 316, which base 316
may be bolted or otherwise secured to the surface or ground.

                                                14
[0057]      An exciter 320 may be coupled to the trough 302, and thus be coupled to the
deck 304. The exciter 320 may include a motor 322 having a shaft 324 to which one or
more eccentric weights 326 are attached, for example. According to other
embodiments, the exciter 320 may include pneumatic and/or hydraulic actuators instead
of the motor 322. For that matter, the shaft 324 and weights 326 may be attached to the
trough 302, while the motor 322 is coupled to the shaft 324, but not mounted on the
apparatus 300. A controller 328 may be included and coupled to the motor 322 to
control operation of the motor 322.
[0058]      Again, while different embodiments of the vibratory apparatus may vary from
the illustrated embodiment of Fig. 7, it will be recognized that these embodiments still
may have features in common with the illustrated embodiment. For example, certain
vibratory apparatuses may have a trough with deck(s) and sidewalls, even if they have
no floor. Other apparatuses will include the exciter, even if it is disposed below the
trough instead of above. Still other apparatuses are supported using the spring
assemblies 100 in combination with links or rocker arms. As such, it may be possible to
describe an embodiment of a vibratory apparatus that has fewer than all of the elements
described for the illustrated embodiment of Fig. 7, but that still falls within the scope of
this patent.
[0059]      It will also be recognized that the spring assembly according to one of the
disclosed embodiments and/or a vibratory apparatus including one or more such spring
assemblies may provide one or more of the following advantages. By surrounding the
loop at the longitudinal end of the spring, contact between the loop and materials that
might abrade or corrode the spring is limited or prevented. Further, by surrounding the
loop at the longitudinal end of the spring, contact between the loop and materials that
might remove any layer of corrosion-resistant material that may have been applied to the
spring is limited or prevented. Moreover, where the casing entirely encloses or
encapsulates the loop, contact may be further limited. In addition, where the position of
the washer relative to the loop is ensured either by affixing the washer to the casing
and/or by providing the casing with a structure to positively align the washer, the
placement of the fastener through the spring loop may be simplified. In fact, where the
parts of the attachment site (washer, casing and base) are affixed to each other, the

                                                15
installation of the spring assembly with protected attachment site may be simplified.
Other advantages are also possible.
[0060]     Although the preceding text sets forth a detailed description of different
embodiments of the invention, it should be understood that the legal scope of the
invention is defined by the words of the claims set forth at the end of this patent. The
detailed description is to be construed as exemplary only and does not describe every
possible embodiment of the invention since describing every possible embodiment
would be impractical, if not impossible. Numerous alternative embodiments could be
implemented, using either current technology or technology developed after the filing
date of this patent, which would still fall within the scope of the claims defining the
invention.
[0061]      It should also be understood that, unless a term is expressly defined in this
patent using the sentence "As used herein, the term '             ' is hereby defined to
mean..." or a similar sentence, there is no intent to limit the meaning of that term, either
expressly or by implication, beyond its plain or ordinary meaning, and such term should
not be interpreted to be limited in scope based on any statement made in any section of
this patent (other than the language of the claims). To the extent that any term recited in
the claims at the end of this patent is referred to in this patent in a manner consistent
with a single meaning, that is done for sake of clarity only so as to not confuse the
reader, and it is not intended that such claim term be limited, by implication or otherwise,
to that single meaning. Finally, unless a claim element is defined by reciting the word
"means" and a function without the recital of any structure, it is not intended that the
scope of any claim element be interpreted based on the application of 35 U.S.C. §112(f).
