ABSTRACT
A pneumatic tool including a cylinder, a piston inside the cylinder and adapted to
reciprocate, and a piston rod connected to the piston. The piston has a first seal ring
and a second seal ring fixed thereto. The first seal ring and the second seal ring are
spaced apart along the cylinder axial direction and a storage space for storing
lubricating oil is defined between the first seal ring and the second seal ring. The
pneumatic tool in the disclosure may effectively avoid the problems that the frictional
force increases because of the lubricating oil depleting due to the use of the tool for a
long time, and even worse the pneumatic tool does not work effectively.

FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0001] The disclosure relates to a power tool, in particular to a pneumatic tool used to
drive a fastener using compressed air as a power source.
BACKGROUND
[0002] In daily life, nail guns are used in circumstances of woodworking or in-house
decoration. Nowadays, widely used nail guns are designed to be driven by air
pressures, and are configured with air compressors and a long trachea during usage.
However, existing nail guns often require frequent maintenance during use. For
example, nails supplied from the nail box are prone to jamming during firing, and this
often requires a very complicated disassembling process to open the barrel portions
and clean up the stuck nails. In addition, with the increase of the usage time, the
cylinder and the piston part inside the nail gun may easily result in more and more
friction, which reduces the performance of the nail gun and may even affects its
normal operation. Also, a gas spring structure used in the nail gun usually cannot be
adjusted for its output power, and therefore it may cause an excessive output power
for launching a shorter nail. Such excessive power will result in a reduction in the
usage life of the entire nail gun.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0003] Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosure provide an improved pneumatic
tool which overcomes all or at least a part of the above technical problems.
[0004] In a first aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a pneumatic tool including
a cylinder, a piston inside the cylinder which is adapted to reciprocate, and a piston
rod connected to the piston. The piston has a first seal ring and a second seal ring
fixed thereto. The first seal ring and the second seal ring are spaced apart along the
9763944_1 (GHMatters) P107479.AU

                                            -2
cylinder axial direction and a storage space for storing lubricating oil is defined
between the first seal ring and the second seal ring.
[0005] Preferably, the first seal ring and the second seal ring have different
dimensions in the axial direction.
[0006] In another aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a pneumatic tool
including a fastener box, a drive mechanism adapted to drive a fastener stored in a
fastener box to eject, and an ejection passage for the ejection of the fastener. The
pneumatic tool further includes a door member at least partially surrounding the
ejection passage, which may be opened and closed for accessing the interior of the
ejection passage.
[0007] Preferably, the door member automatically opens when a jam occurs in the
ejection passage.
[0008] More preferably, the door member is connected to a spring to hold the door
member in a closed state. When a jam occurs in the ejection passage, the spring
force of the spring is overcome, so that the door member is opened.
[0009] In another variant embodiment, the door member is connected to a
user-actuated locking device. The locking device controls the closing and opening of
the door member.
[0010] Preferably, the locking device is a latch including a bolt.
[0011] In another aspect of the disclosure, there is also provided a pneumatic tool
including a cylinder, a driving piston reciprocating within the cylinder, a housing, and a
high pressure gas chamber formed in the housing. An adjustable air hole device is
provided between the high pressure gas chamber and the cylinder, and the adjustable
air hole device is capable of varying the amount of air intake of the cylinder.
[0012] Preferably, the adjustable air hole device includes an air hole component and
9763944_1 (GHMatters) P107479.AU

                                            -3
a cover, and both of them may rotate with respect to each other. The air hole
component has air holes and the cover has vias. The air holes and the vias are
adapted for partial alignment or full alignment to achieve a change in the amount of
intake air.
[0013] More preferably, the number of the air holes and the number of the vias are
four respectively.
[0014] In a variant embodiment, the cover is connected to and rotates with a
user-actuated knob.
[0015] Thus, the pneumatic tools disclosed in the disclosure provide many
advantages over those in the art. For example, a storage space may be arranged in
the piston assembly which is defined by two seal rings together. Lubricating oil may be
stored in the storage space so that the lubricating oil may be continuously replenished
to the seal ring during use of the pneumatic tool. This allows the conditions in which
original lubricating oil dries out due to an increase of the usage time and an increase
in the frictional force to be avoided. In addition, by providing a side door in the ejection
passage of the nozzle which can be opened and closed, the user may easily maintain
the pneumatic tool without the use of an external tool in the case of a jam occurred in
the pneumatic tool. After cleaning the stuck nail(s), the nail gun may immediately
return back to its operational state. Finally, the adjustable air hole device is capable of
adjusting the amount of high pressure gas entering the cylinder in the high pressure
gas chamber of the pneumatic tool, and such adjustment may be conveniently
performed externally by the user operating the knob. By adjusting the amount of
intake air, the firing force and speed of the pneumatic tool may be effectively changed,
so as to avoid unnecessary wear and tear to the pneumatic tool in small working
conditions.

[0027] DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0028] Embodiments of the disclosure adopt an improved pneumatic tool structure,
thereby improving its operational performance and ease of maintenance. Other
different benefits and advantages provided by various embodiments of the disclosure
will be readily apparent from the following descriptions.
[0029] Firstly, refer to Figs.1a and 1b. In a first embodiment of the disclosure, a
piston portion of a pneumatic tool is disclosed. The pneumatic tool has a piston and
cylinder structure commonly known as a "gas spring." As being well known to those
skilled in the art, such pneumatic tools use high pressure gas as a power source to
drive fasteners, while high pressure gas may be provided by an air compressor
located external to the pneumatic tool. By regularly controlling a passage of high
pressure gas into the cylinder, the pressure difference between the high pressure gas
at both ends of the piston and the atmospheric pressure causes the piston to
reciprocate inside the cylinder. Therefore, the overall structure and working principles
of the nail gun described above will not be repeated here.
[0030] Figs.1a and 1b show a piston 20 adapted to move back and forth in the
cylinder (not shown). The piston has a generally cylindrical shape. A piston rod 28 is
attached to a rear end of the piston 20 and the piston rod 28 further connects to and
drives the nailing structure (not shown) of the nail gun. At the front end of the piston 20,
there are respectively a first seal ring 22 and a second seal ring 24. Here, Fig.1a
shows a schematic view of the first seal ring 22 and the second seal ring 24
disassembled from the piston 20, while Fig.1 b shows a schematic view of the first seal
ring 22 and the second seal ring 24 integrally formed with the piston 20. The front end
9763944_1 (GHMatters) P107479.AU

                                              -6
of the piston 20 shown in Fig.1a has a first annular groove 23, a second annular
groove 25, and a portion 21 therebetween with a smaller diameter, and the three parts
are defined by different partition walls 27. The first annular groove 23 and the second
annular groove 25 respectively have dimensions corresponding to the first seal ring
22 and the second seal ring 24, so as to be able to accommodate the two seal rings. It
can be seen in Fig. 1b that the first seal ring 22 and the second seal ring 24 are
spaced apart from each other in the length direction of the piston rod 28, i.e., in the
axial direction of the cylinder. Between the first seal ring 22 and the second seal ring
24, there is a storage space 26. The storage space is constituted by peripheries of the
first seal ring 22 and the second seal ring 24, a corresponding annular cylinder wall
and a portion of the piston 20 located at this position with a smaller diameter with
respect to the first seal ring 22 and the second seal ring 24 together.
[0031] In use, lubricating oil stored in the storage space 26 may gradually penetrate
to a peripheral position of the first seal ring 22 or the second seal ring 24 in contact
with the cylinder wall with the increase of the usage time, thereby providing effective
lubrication for the first seal ring 22 and the second seal ring 24. As a result, the
following problems may be effectively solved: using the pneumatic tool for a long time
resulting in the gradual volatilization of lubricants and increasing of the friction.
[0032] Refer now to Fig. 2 to Fig. 4b, another embodiment of the disclosure discloses
a nail gun having an improved staple cleaning device. Figs.2 and 3 show a partial
appearance of the nail gun and an exploded view of the components thereof,
respectively. Note that only a part of a head frame 32 of the nail gun is shown in Fig. 2,
so as to show a structure of the nailing passage inside it, whereas the head frame 32
is shown in its entirety in Fig. 3. In this activation tool, the head frame 32 is used to be
assembled into one body with other various components (as described in detail below)
and provides a passage to enable a drive mechanism of the nail gun to be in contact
with nails in the nail box 30 and eject them (not shown). A first cover 46 and a second
cover 36 are fixed to the head frame 32 over and under in a side-by-side manner in a
9763944_1 (GHMatters) P107479.AU

                                              -7
 position of the head frame 32 near the nozzle frame. Meanwhile on the back of the
first cover 46 and the second cover 36, a guide rail 50 provides an ejection passage
for the nails. The first cover 46 and the second cover 36 therefore serve to partially
cover the ejection passage of the guide rail 50. The first cover 46 and the second
cover 36 both are connected to the head frame 32 by two common bolts 44. The
second cover 36 is pivotally connected to the first cover 46 by a spindle 56. On the left
and right sides of the first cover 46, the second cover 36 and the guide rail 50, there
are respectively a left drive bracket 42 and a left door 40, and a right drive bracket 48
and a right door 52. The left drive bracket 42 and the right drive bracket 48 are fixedly
connected to the head frame 32, and the left door 40 and the right door 52 are
 pivotally connected to the left drive bracket 42 and the right drive bracket 48,
 respectively, Therefore, the first cover 46, the upper portion of the guide rail 50, and
the left drive bracket 42 and the right drive bracket 48 together define a portion of the
 nailing passage. Similarly, the second cover 36, the lower portion of the rail 50, and
the left door 40 and the right door 52 together define another portion of the nailing
 passage. The nailing passage is in communication with a nail receiving space in the
 nail box 30. The left door 40 and the right door 52 are connected to each other by a
spring 34. In the embodiment, the nail box and the nails stored therein are
 respectively a box of fastener nail and a fastener used by the pneumatic tool.
 [0033] In use, the left door 40 and the right door 52 serve to facilitate cleaning of the
 nails stuck in the gun. In particular, Fig. 4a shows the nozzle portion of the nail gun
without a jam. At this time, it can be seen that the spring 34 is now in its unstrained
state. At this time, the left door 40 and the right door (not shown) tightly fit to a side of
the second cover 36. At this time the nail gun is in a normal working condition. If a
jamming condition occurs in the nailing passage, the stuck nails 58 will generally
deflect from its normal orientation and extend to both sides of the nozzle and even
 being distorted. Such stuck nails 58 therefore rest against the left door 40 and/or the
 right door. Since the left door 40 and the right door are in fact pivotable with respect to
9763944_1 (GHMatters) P107479.AU

                                             -8
the nailing passage, the left door 40 is opened by the nail 58 in the situation shown in
Fig. 4b. At this time, the tension of the spring 34 is overcome, resulting in an increase
in its length and the spring is in tension. Because the left door 40 is open, the user
may conveniently remove the stuck nail 58 from the opening created in the left door
40 without removing any other portions of the nail gun. At the same time the
above-described jam cleaning device does not need to use additional tools for
carrying out the jam cleaning work. After the stuck nail 58 is cleaned, the left door
and/or the right door are automatically reset due to the tension of the spring 34 to
return to the state shown in Fig.4a.
[0034] In a third embodiment of the disclosure, the nail gun may also have another
type of jam cleaning device. Referring to Fig. 5 to Fig. 6b, the appearance of the
nailing portion of the nail gun shown here is substantially the same as in Fig. 2, and
therefore the same components will not be described in detail herein. However, in the
embodiment, opening and closing of the left door 140 and the right door (not shown)
are no longer controlled by a spring. In contrast, a nail gun has a locking pin 138 on
the outside of the second cover 36 with its head and tail end connected to a left drive
bracket 142 and a right drive bracket (not shown), respectively. Specifically, the
locking pin 138 passes through a connecting hole (not shown) on the left drive bracket
142 such that its head and the rest of it are respectively located on two sides of the
connecting hole. The tail end of the locking pin 138 has an external thread, and the
external thread may be screwed into a screw hole located on the right drive bracket.
The locking pin 138, the left drive bracket 142 and the right drive bracket thus form a
latch. In addition, unlike the mechanism shown in Fig.2 to Fig.4b, in this embodiment
the left drive bracket 142 and the right drive bracket may pivot with respect to the head
frame, while there is no relative pivoting between the left door 140 and the left drive
bracket 142, the right door and the right drive bracket, or only a limited relative
pivoting occurs. And, in order to facilitate the user to pull the left door 140 and the right
door, there are also a tab 160 fixed on the top of it.
9763944_1 (GHMatters) P107479.AU

                                              -9
[0035] In use, the left door 140 and the right door and those in Figs.2-4b also serve
to facilitate to clean the nails stuck in the gun. However, the left door 140 and the right
door do not open automatically in the embodiment. In contrast, the user needs to
manually unscrew the bolt 138 in the case of a staple, enabling the left drive bracket
142 and/or the right drive bracket 142 to pivot. Then, the user may dial a paddle 160
on the left door 140 or the right door using his finger to open the left door 140 or the
right door. When the left drive bracket 142 and/or the right drive bracket are pivoted,
the left door 140 or the right door is correspondingly rotated with the left drive bracket
14 or the right drive bracket as a whole, so as to open an interior of the nailing
passage to remove the stuck nail 158. Note that opening of the left door 140 or the
right door here only requires unscrewing the bolt 138 to whatever extent, even if it is
not completely separated from the right drive bracket. And although components such
as the right door and the right drive bracket on the right side of the nailing passage are
not shown here, they operate in exactly the same way as the equivalent components
on the left.
[0036] In a fourth embodiment of the disclosure, an adjustable air hole device for a
pneumatic tool is described. Figs. 7a to 8 show the structure of the adjustable air hole
device. In Fig. 8, a portion of the pneumatic tool is shown, including a housing 262. A
cylinder 264 formed by a cylinder wall 266 is centrally disposed in the interior of the
housing 262. There is a cylinder head 287 at the end of the cylinder 264. The drive
piston 220 is adapted to reciprocate in the cylinder 264,so as to drive a piston rod 228
connected with the drive piston 220 to further drive the firing mechanism (not shown)
to eject the fastener. On the other hand, the seal plug 268 is fixed in the interior of the
housing 262 and located between the exterior of the cylinder wall 266 and the interior
of the housing 262. The housing 262 and the seal plug 268 define a high pressure gas
chamber 270 for temporarily storing high pressure gas. The structure described above
is a structure of a pneumatic tool common in the art and therefore will not be further
described herein.
9763944_1 (GHMatters) P107479.AU

                                             - 10
[0037] The cylinder 264 may be in gaseous communication with the high pressure
gas chamber 270 under certain conditions, such that both sides of the drive piston 220
have a high pressure and a low pressure (i.e., atmospheric pressure), respectively,
creating a pressure difference and driving the piston. In the embodiment, the air
pressure within the cylinder 264 is adjustable, and it may be accomplished by the
adjustable air hole device described above. Specifically, at the bottom of the cylinder
264, an air hole member 274 and a cover member 276 fitted with the air hole member
274 are mounted. As shown in Figs. 7a and 7b, there are four air holes 280 arranged
symmetrically around the center on the air hole assembly 274, and four corresponding
vias 278 on the cover member 276. Four protruding locking posts 281 are on one
surface of the air hole member 274. As shown in FIG. 8, the air hole member 274 is
fixed on the cylinder head 287 by these locking posts 281, while a knob 284 is
connected to a cover member 272 via the hinge 282. That is, the air hole member 274
is stationary with respect to the housing 262, and the cover member 272 may rotate
with the knob 284.
[0038] In use, the user may manually rotate the knob 284 to adjust the amount of
high pressure gas entering the cylinder 264 from the high pressure gas chamber 270,
so as to control the output power of the pneumatic tool. Specifically, as the knob 284 is
rotated to produce a rotation with respect to the housing 262, it will rotate with the
cover 272. As shown in Figs.9a and 9b, at different rotational positions of the cover
272, different air intake effects will be resulted due to different alignments with the air
hole components 274. In the situation shown in Fig. 9a, the air hole 280 of the air hole
assembly 274 are not completely aligned with the vias 278 of the cover 276 located
below. That is, at this time, only a part of the cover 276 may be seen from the air hole
280 of the air hole member 274. At this time, high pressure gas entering above
cylinder 264 is not the most. However, if the cover 272 in Fig. 9a is rotated in the
clockwise direction, i.e., in the direction indicated by an arrow 283, then the positional
relationship shown in Fig. 9b will be achieved. It can be seen form Fig. 9b that the air
9763944_1 (GHMatters) P107479.AU

                                           - 11
hole 280 of the air hole assembly 274 and the via 278 of the cover member 276
located below are completely aligned. At this time, the high pressure gas entering the
cylinder 264 is the most. By rotating the cover 272 in the counterclockwise direction, it
is possible to return again from the configuration in Fig.9b to the configuration in
Fig.9a, or other air hole/via alignment relationship to obtain different air intake.
[0039] Therefore, after introducing several embodiments, those skilled in the art may
recognize that various modifications, additional structures, and equivalents may be
used without departing from the essence of the disclosure. Accordingly, the above
description should not be considered as a limitation to the scope of the disclosure as
defined by the following claims.
[0040] For example, while the pneumatic tool shown in some of the embodiments
above is a type of nail gun, those skilled in the art may recognize that other types of
pneumatic tools, such as those for driving other types of fasteners, may also use the
technical solution disclosed by this disclosure.
[0041] In addition, the number of vias or air holes included in the air hole assembly
and the cover member in the embodiment is four. However, those skilled in the art
may recognize that the number of vias or air holes may also vary according to other
variations of the disclosure, not limited to four.
[0042] In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention,
except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is
used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to
