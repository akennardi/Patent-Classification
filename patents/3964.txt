   various cooking devices in the sink.
          [Technical    Solution]
          In  order     to     achieve      the      above      objects,     the      present
 5 invention provides an automatic cooking device standardization
   system capable of automatically cooking dishes without requiring
   user's manual work, characterized in that the automatic cooking
   device is   standardized         by  installing          an ingredient       fridge    for
   storing   food   ingredients        used      for     each   cooking,    installing      a
10 kitchen   capable      of     cooking    dishes        according      to   the     cooking
   method,   order    and    time    during       the     cooking,    and   installing      a
   transfer line for         transferring food ingredients for each dish
   from the ingredient fridge to cooking containers in the kitchen
   according to a cooking order and time.
15       The automatic cooking device having the above configuration
   is  standardized      in    a   manner    that       can   cook   one   or  two     dishes
   depending    on   the     cooking      type,        the    standarized         automatic
   cooking   device    is    delivered       to    a    shop    or a   restaurant,       food
   ingredients    stored      in   an  ingredient           fridge   of   each    automatic
20 cooking device is       standarized by processing them to fit                     the size
   of  the material box          entering each material             compartment        of the
   ingredient    fridge, and the standarized product is delivered to
   a consumer,   a restaurant or a shop which has purchased the above
   mentioned automatic cooking device.
