PCT/US2015/047570. International Patent Application No. PCT/US2015/047570 claims priority
to United States Provisional Application Serial No. 62/044,178 which was filed on August 29,
2014. Australian Patent Application No. 2015308623 is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety.
                                         TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]     The following discussion generally relates to the delivery of digital video content, and
more particularly to the delivery of digital video content based upon excitement data.
                                           BACKGROUND
[0003]     Media streaming is becoming an increasingly popular way of delivering television,
movies and other media content to viewers.          Media streams are typically point-to-point or
broadcast transmissions of digitized content that can be sent over the Internet or a similar network.
Media streaming is often used to facilitate video on demand (VOD) services, local storage and/or
remote storage digital video recorder (LSDVR and/or RSDVR) services, Internet Protocol
television (IPTV) services, placeshifted media viewing and/or any number of other convenient
services. In many cases, the media stream is played back for the viewer in real time as the stream
continues to be delivered to the player. In other embodiments, the video is sideloaded or cached
at the player to permit faster than real time delivery of the video stream.
[0004]    In certain instances, a viewer may be interested in a certain program or program type or
genre (e.g., a sports game, such as a football game). The viewer may not, however, be interested
in watching each program of interest in its entirety, nor, in many instances, may the viewer be in
a position to view a program or programs of interest. Due to the volume of sports games or other
content of

interest, many viewers may prefer to view the highlights of multiple programs, or to
otherwise identify and view the most interesting content that is available.
[ooo5] At present, it can be a substantial challenge to identify the most interesting
content    that  is  available.    If multiple     sports  broadcasts  are  occurring
simultaneously, for example, it can be relatively difficult to know which broadcast is
most interesting at any given time without continually switching between the
different broadcasts.     Similar issues can arise while viewing movies, reality
programs, television dramas, action shows or any other programs of interest to any
number of different viewers.
                                BRIEF DESCRIPTION
[ooo6]The following discussion relates to various example implementations of
systems, devices and processes that record program highlights or exciting portions
of one or more media programs.        The concepts described herein may be used in
digital video recorders, remote storage video recorders, video on demand services,
set top boxes or other television receivers, placeshifting systems, and/or any other
applications as desired.
[0007] Some implementations provide digital video recorder ("DVR") or similar
storage system to manage storage of video content.            A DVR system suitably
comprises an interface configured to receive the video content, a disk drive
configured to store the video content on a spinning disk having an inner portion and
an outer portion, and a processor.       The processor is configured to control the
reception of the video content via the interface and to direct the storage of the
received video content on the disk drive. In various implementations, data retrieved
from a database of "excitement data" or the like can be used to identify the most
exciting programs currently being broadcast, or the most exciting portions of a
particular broadcast. The processor may make use of this excitement data to select
and record only the portions of one or more programs that particularly exciting, or
that are otherwise of particular interest to the viewer.
[ooo8] Other embodiments provide a computer-implemented process that suitably
comprises receiving and processing excitement data. Various embodiments of the
process further comprise displaying one or more programs and/or one or more
portions of one or more programs based upon the excitement data. The processes
may further comprise displaying an entire exciting portion of digital media content
                                            2

associated with a program based upon excitement data. In various embodiments,
the processes may further comprise displaying an excitement timeline.
[ooo9] Other embodiments provide a process executable by a set top box,
television receiver, digital video recorder, placeshifting device or other consumer
media device. The process suitably comprises: receiving        a    media    program
comprising video content at the consumer media device; receiving excitement data
at the consumer media device, the excitement data indicating a then-current level of
excitement of the video content; determining whether the video content is of
interest to a viewer based upon the excitement data; and, if the video content is of
interest to the viewer, selecting the video content for presentation to the viewer by
the consumer media device, and otherwise not selecting the video content for
presentation to the viewer.
[ooio] This process may further comprise receiving a selection from the viewer to
provide the entire media program or to provide only a portion of the media
program, wherein the selected portion of the media program comprises only those
portions of the media program during which the then-current excitement data is
greater than a threshold value.
[oo1] The process may additionally or alternately comprise deleting the complete
program in response to the viewer not selecting the option to view the complete
exciting portion of the program.
[0012]   Any of the preceding processes may modify the selecting to comprises
assembling a highlight reel that comprises only those portions of the media program
during which the then-current excitement data is greater than a threshold value.
[0013] This process may further comprise storing the highlight reel in a digital
video recorder for subsequent viewing by the viewer.
[0014] This process may further comprise providing a media stream of the
highlight reel to a media player for viewing of the highlight reel on the media player
by the viewer.
[0015] Any of the above processes may further consider user preference data in
determining whether the media program is of interest to the viewer.
[oo16] The above processes may further compare the then-current excitement data
for a plurality of programs to thereby identify the most exciting one of the plurality
of programs at a particular point in time.
                                           3

[0017] The above processes may further determine if the media program has
continued past a predicted timeslot based upon the excitement data.
[oo18] The above processes may further consider determining if the excitement
data remains above a predetermined threshold after the predicted timeslot has
ended.
[0019] The above processes may further generate an electronic program guide
image by the consumer media device, the electronic program guide image having a
plurality of cells each associated with one of a plurality of media programs, wherein
at least some of the cells are presented in a manner that indicates the then-current
excitement data for the media programs that are associated with the cells.
[0020]    Further processes may include updating the electronic program guide
image in real time as the excitement data changes for one or more of the plurality of
media programs.
[0021]   The above embodiments         may further comprise generating, by the
consumer media device, a timeline that represents the excitement data of the media
program throughout the duration of the media program, wherein the timeline is
displayed in a manner such that viewer is able to identify portions of the media
program on the timeline that are more exciting than other portions of the media
program.
[0022]    Other embodiments provide set top boxes, television receivers and/or other
consumer media devices for processing digital video content. Such devices suitably
comprise: a digital video recorder; an interface to receive media programs; and a
processor configured to: direct the interface to receive a media program comprising
video content at the consumer media device; receive       excitement   data   at  the
consumer media device, the excitement data indicating a then-current level of
excitement of the video content; determine whether the video content is of interest
to a viewer based upon the excitement data; and if the video content is of interest to
the viewer, select the video content for presentation to the viewer by the consumer
media device, and otherwise not selecting the video content for presentation to the
viewer.
[0023]   The device may be further configured to assemble a highlight reel of
received programs that comprises only those portions of the received media
programs during which the then-current excitement data is greater than a threshold
value, and/or to implement any of the processes described above.
                                           4

[0024]    Still other embodiments provide other processes, systems and devices for
utilizing excitement data to improve the recording and playback options available to
a digital media content viewer. The examples presented in this summary may be
modified, combined and/or augmented in any manner, and many additional
examples are described below.
                  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES
[0025]    Exemplary embodiments will hereinafter be described in conjunction with
the following drawing figures, wherein like numerals denote like elements, and
[0026]    FIG.   1 shows, in accordance with various embodiments, a system for
delivering complete digital video content based upon excitement data;
[0027]    FIG.   2 shows, in accordance with various embodiments, a process for
delivering complete digital video content based upon excitement data; and
[0028]    FIG. 3 shows, in accordance with various embodiments, a program timeline
that includes an visual indication associated with excitement data.
                              DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0029]   The following detailed description of the invention is merely exemplary in
nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented
in the preceding background or the following detailed description.
[0030]Various embodiments make use of excitement data to provide improved
media viewing experiences.       Excitement data can be used to identify the most
exciting programming in real time as the programs are being broadcast. Further
embodiments can additionally or alternately store the real time excitement data in
conjunction with timestamp or similar timing data to create "highlight reels" for
subsequent viewing. Other useful benefits and features could be provided in any
number of alternate embodiments.
[0031] As used herein, the phrase "excitement data" may refer to any data that
indicates that a program and/or a portion of a program (such as a broadcast of a
sports game, or any other media programming) and/or may be exciting or otherwise
of interest or potential interest to a viewer. Viewers may find programs and/or
portions of programs to be exciting based upon one or more viewer preferences,
based upon one or more predefined parameters, based upon subjective or objective
                                           5

criteria, and/or other factors as appropriate.      A program and/or a portion of a
program may, additionally or alternately, be exciting based upon an aggregation of
viewer input. For example, a viewer may attribute, over time and as the viewer
views a particular program or program genre, one or more qualities to a program
event. More particularly, a viewer may, in various embodiments, attribute a tag
(e.g., "funny," "sad," "suspenseful," and the like) to a particular program event. The
system may analyze a plurality of event tags to predict a viewer's reaction to a
particular program event.
[0032] Still other programs or portions of a program may be ranked as to their
then-current level of excitement based upon objective and/or subjective criteria. In
various embodiments, programs may be monitored in real time (or near real time)
and their then-current level of excitement may be numerically represented in any
manner. A program's then-current level of excitement may be assigned a number
between o-10, 1-10, 0-100 or 1-100, for example. Equivalent embodiments may use
any     other   numerical,    alphanumerical,     color-based,    symbolic   or   other
representation, as desired.     Levels of excitement may be assigned based upon
subjective human monitoring, objective factors (e.g., distance to the goal line,
third/fourth down, close score, near end of quarter/half/game, or other factors as
desired).     Thus, for example, a program and/or a portion of a program may be
exciting based upon a user preference for a particular sport (e.g., football) and/or a
particular event that may occur during such a program (e.g., a touchdown or other
goal). Further embodiments may adjust the excitement level throughout the
duration of a program to reflect more or less exciting portions of that particular
program. A sporting event, for example, maybe more exciting during times that the
score is close, or when a team is about to score, or during important defensive
stands, and/or at any other times as appropriate.        Other programs may be most
exciting during dramatic tension, during battle or action scenes, during appearances
by celebrities, during musical numbers, or during any other times that could be
objectively or subjectively considered to be exciting.
[0033] A variety of media monitoring services exist.           Many of these services
monitor one or more currently-broadcast programs simultaneously to provide, in
many instances, excitement data, as described above, about each of the monitored
programs. Excitement data may be generated based upon one or more predefined
parameters, such as, in the case of a sports program, a goal or a change in a game
                                            6

score, and the like. Similarly, as described herein, a media monitoring service may
provide excitement data unique to a particular viewer based, for example, upon a
user profile and/or bulk excitement data not associated with any particular viewer.
A user profile may include, by way of example, a preference for a particular sport
and/or a particular team or teams. One service that provides excitement ratings for
currently-broadcast sports programs is the THUUZ service available from Thuuz
Sports of Palo Alto, California, although other embodiments could use excitement
data from any source, including data generated by a user's set top box or other
home equipment.
[0034] In some embodiments, excitement data may be additionally and/or
alternatively generated or altered based upon any of a variety of other external
sources (outside of and/or including those provided by a media monitoring service),
such as, for example, social media trending data, a media rating as provided by a
media rating service and/or a plurality of media reviewer information, and/or any
other externally acquired data that may be used to asses excitement data about a
program. To illustrate, a program, such as a movie or film, may be associated with
one or more reviewer ratings, trending data, box office data or sales, reviewer or
viewer ratings and the like. These data sources may be aggregated, in various
embodiments, to generate an excitement rating for the program. Here, again,
excitement data may be provided to a viewer based upon a profile of the viewer
and/or any of a variety of predefined parameters, or the data may simply indicate
the then-current level of excitement relative to other portions of the program, or
relative to other programs as desired.
[0035] In various embodiments, programs may have a pre-broadcast excitement
level based upon social media data (e.g., the amount of marketing, and/or the
amount of media, social media and/or other "buzz" about the program), based upon
the number of viewers who have set DVR timers, based upon historical viewing
patterns, and/or based upon the nature of the program. A conference or divisional
championship, for example, may have a higher pre-broadcast excitement level than
a game with no championship implications, or a popular team (or a local team) may
have a higher excitement level than other teams. These initial pre-broadcast levels
of excitement can then be adapted in real time (or near real time) throughout the
course of the game to reflect periods of greater or lesser excitement, as appropriate.
                                           7

Again, excitement data may be received from a third party service, or generated in
any appropriate manner.
[0036] Accordingly, viewers may wish to select programs for viewing based upon
the level of excitement. Additionally or alternatively, viewers may wish to use the
excitement data to identify the most exciting/interesting portions of a particular
program, or of multiple programs.
[0037] In many instances, the viewer may be preoccupied or otherwise unable to
view a program of interest as it is broadcast. Moreover, where a viewer is interested
in viewing an exciting program and/or an exciting portion of a program, it is
typically the case that it is too late to begin recording the exciting portion of the
program (or the program from the start of the exciting portion) in response to the
reception of excitement data indicating that the program has become exciting.
[0038] Thus,     some embodiments could provide any number of systems or
techniques for delivering digital video content using excitement data. A number of
examples are described herein.
[0039] In one example, real-time indicia of a program's level of excitement can be
used to know the "most exciting" portions of particular programs, such as the most
interesting moments of a sporting event or other television broadcast.           This
information allows a set top box, video streaming device, placeshifting device,
network service or other computing system to gauge the relative excitement of two
or more simultaneously broadcast programs.             Storing this information in
conjunction with a program recorded in a DVR would allow a subsequent viewer to
automatically "jump" to the most exciting portions of the recorded content.
Further, the excitement data could be further averaged or otherwise processed
throughout the course of the program to determine an overall excitement rating for
the program; this post-broadcast overall rating could be compared to post
broadcast ratings of other programs stored on a DVR, available for streaming, or
otherwise available to the viewer to help the viewer select which programs to view.
[0040] In another example,         the excitement data is again associated with
timestamp data or other timing information during recording or streaming of a
program so that only the most interesting portions of the program are retained.
That is, only portions of a broadcast that are greater than a threshold level may be
stored (to conserve disk space), and/or provided as part of a live stream. In the
latter case, the viewer's media streaming source would select a program from
                                           8

available alternatives for streaming based upon the then-current level of streaming.
This could allow a viewer to watch one live stream that always contains the most
exciting content that is currently available.   In further embodiments, this highlight
reel concept could be expanded beyond live streaming so that content stored on a
DVR or the like for later viewing would retain only the most exciting portions of
various programs, or so that the most exciting portions of programs stored on the
DVR could be readily identified and compiled into a highlight reel, or simply made
available for convenient viewing. Various systems could record all or part of a
number of programs that may be of interest to a viewer (e.g., based upon a viewer's
profile and/or a viewer's explicit instruction to record a program) from the
beginning of each program. In response to the reception of excitement data, the
system can notify the viewer that a program of interest and/or potential interest has
become exciting. The viewer can, in response, elect to view the exciting portion
and/or the entire program. Programs that the viewer does not select for viewing
can be deleted as part of a background process, such that the viewer is unfettered by
their recordation and subsequent deletion. Other embodiments could implement
other features and/or operate in any other manner.
[0041] In yet another example, the excitement data associated with multiple
programs could be displayed within a "heat map" or similar interface of an
electronic program guide (EPG). In various implementations, cells that present
individual program broadcasts can be colored, shaded or otherwise modified based
upon the then-current excitement data.        This data could be updated in real time
throughout the broadcasts so that the viewer is able to readily identify exciting
programs and to discern between multiple programs that might be simultaneously
presented within the program guide. This display could be further modified based
upon manually-entered and/or automatically-determined viewer preferences.           A
baseball fan, for example, may see baseball games highlighted while a basketball fan
sees basketball games highlighted with excitement data.         This would allow the
programs that are of greatest interest to a user to standout from other programs,
and/or for more exciting programs to be readily discerned. Again, data could be
updated in real time so as the program becomes more interesting (e.g., scoring
opportunities, player of interest involved in game, action sequence, musical
number, etc.), the viewer is made aware of the current level of excitement shown in
the live broadcast.
                                            9

[0042] In still other examples, excitement data can be used to determine when a
sporting event, awards show or other broadcast extends beyond its predicted time.
Electronic program guides typically do not indicate when a program extends beyond
its regular timeslot, so viewers who attempt to record programs based upon EPG
data may find that the end of a program can be cut off. That is, if a ballgame goes
into overtime, extra innings or the like, the recording device does not typically know
that the program has extended beyond its predicted timeslot. Excitement data can
be used to extend recording in such cases.         To provide a simple example, the
recording system could identify when the end of a program recording is
approaching, and could monitor real-time excitement data for the program prior to
that time. If the excitement data increases (or at least does not decrease) toward the
end of the pre-allocated time, then the recording can be extended until such time as
the excitement level decreases, thereby indicating the end of the game. Various
embodiments could further verify that the excitement level remains lower for a time
frame (e.g., 2-10 minutes or so) so that commercial breaks, timeouts or other factors
do not produce a false positive indication for the end of the game.
[0043] Additional examples could use predicted excitement data to automatically
set recordings based upon viewer preferences or the like. If a viewer is manually or
automatically identified as a baseball fan (or a fan of a particular team), for
example, program guide data could be checked on a daily, weekly, hourly or other
periodic basis to identify programs that may be of interest to the viewer. Pre
broadcast predicted excitement data for any identified programs could be checked,
and if the predicted excitement data exceeds a threshold, then the program could be
automatically selected for recording on behalf of the viewer. If a viewer forgets to
set a recording timer for a big game, for example, this example would automatically
set a recording timer so that the viewer does not miss the game. Similar concepts
could be applied to movies, reality shows, daily or weekly television series, awards
shows and/or any other programming, as appropriate.
[0044] Various embodiments therefore use excitement data to identify complete
programs or a portions of programs that are likely to be of interest to the viewer.
Such capabilities may be implemented within any sort of computing machinery,
such as set top boxes (STBs) or other television receivers that are located in viewer's
homes, offices or other premises. Other embodiments may be partially or entirely
implemented within media players (including media player applications executing
                                            10

on general-purpose computer systems), placeshifting devices, network or "cloud"
servers, or any other computing hardware systems as appropriate.
[0045] Turning now to the drawing figures, FIG.       1  shows an example of a system
100  for delivering complete digital video or program content based upon excitement
data. The system 100 can include a DVR      102, an excitement data database 104, one
or more servers or guide servers 106, a network 108, and/or a media client    110.
[0046]A DVR        102, as described above, can comprise any system capable of
recording digital video content.    DVR   102  may be implemented within a STB or
other television receiver, or may be any sort of standalone device or network service.
DVR    102   will typically include conventional computing hardware found in
consumer electronic devices and/or network services, as appropriate, including one
or more processors, memory, storage, input/output interfaces and the like. To that
end, a DVR     102  can include a network connection, a computer-readable, non
transitory, storage medium (e.g., a solid state memory, a spinning hard drive,
and/or the like), a processor, and/or any other hardware and/or software for the
recordation of digital video content. Again, system     102 may also include hardware
and/or software capabilities for receiving and decoding terrestrial, satellite, cable,
network streams, and/or other media content in any format, as received from any
source.
[0047] An excitement data database 104 can comprise any computer-readable,
non-transitory, storage medium that stores or is configured to store excitement
data, as described above.     Excitement data can, as described above, issue from a
variety of data sources (e.g., a media monitoring service, any of a variety of social
networking data such as trending data, data specific to a particular program, such as
a goal or score in the case of a sports game, a media rating as provided by a media
rating service and/or a plurality of media reviewer information, and/or any other
externally acquired data that may be used to assess excitement data about a
program). Database    104  may be a common storage that includes program content,
EPG data, excitement data and/or any other data associated with stored content as
desired.
[0048] In various embodiments, the excitement data from database 104 may be
correlated to timestamp or similar time data so that even after a program is
broadcast, the level of excitement data can still be used to identify portions of the
stored program that are of greater or lesser interest.       Correlation of excitement
                                           11

data to timestamp data may occur within excitement database         104, within server
106, or within a separate service as desired. This historical excitement data may be
used to later extract the most interesting portions of programs, and/or to identify
the programs that are of greatest interest to the viewer.
[0049] To that end, one or more servers 106 can be communicatively coupled to
the excitement data database 106 and configured to process the excitement data in
any manner. In some embodiments, the excitement data is incorporated into an
electronic program guide (EPG) display        150 or the like for presentation to the
viewer as part of a placeshifting or remote access application.              In other
embodiments, excitement data can be used to deliver programs to the user that are
selected by comparing the excitement data to one or more user profiles and/or one
or more predefined parameters. The server(s) 1o6 is typically implemented with
conventional network server hardware that may comprise any of a plurality of
computer readable, non-transitory storage mediums (such as disk drives, solid state
memory, or other storage as desired), one or more processors, and/or any
appropriate interfaces, such as interfaces to input/output devices, interfaces to
network 1o8, and/or the like. Servers 1o6 may be equivalently implemented using
cloud-based computing services, as desired.
[oo50] Network 1o8 shown in FIG.            1  suitably comprises any conventional
computer network, such as the internet, a local area network, a wide area network, a
telephone network and/or the like. The server(s) 1o6 can be communicatively
coupled to the network 1o8 via a network interface card or other interfaces, as
appropriate.
[0051] One or more media clients 110 can comprise any device configured to
and/or capable of receiving digital media content. Thus, for example, a media client
110 can comprise any computing device, such as a television, a personal computer, a
smartphone, a tablet computing device, a video game player, a personal digital
assistant, and/or any other similar device as desired. The media client     110 can be
communicatively coupled to the network 108 and can receive, as described herein,
notifications in response to the excitement data processed by the server(s) 106. The
media client   110  can further receive, via the network 108 and in response to a
request by a viewer of the digital media content, digital video content stored by the
DVR 102.
                                           12

[0052] The     architecture shown in FIG.      1 could be used to implement several
different embodiments that make use of excitement data obtained from database
104.  In some embodiments, DVR 102 is programmed to create and store "highlight
reels" of the most interesting portions of one or more programs. To that end, the
DVR receives excitement data from database       104, from server 106 or from any other
source as the program content of interest is received.      The received programming
may be recorded or not recorded by the DVR depending upon its then-current level
of interest, as determined by the excitement data. DVR 102 could, for example,
record only those portions of a received program in which the level of excitement
exceeds a threshold level. The specific values used for this threshold may be set by
the viewer, by an administrator or programmer, or by any other source as desired.
A DVR could be programmed, for example, to record only the content that is of
highest excitement.
[0053] This concept may be expanded in many ways. DVR 102 could work with
multiple television tuners or network streams, for example, to create a "highlight
reel" that automatically integrates the most exciting portions of multiple programs
without express input from the user.       If a user's set top box was simultaneously
receiving two or more baseball games, for example, then a DVR or RSDVR
associated with that STB could automatically record only the portions of those
games that have the highest levels of excitement, and that are therefore deemed to
be of greatest interest.
[0054] Since this "highlight reel" is created using hardware that is associated with
a particular user (e.g., a home DVR or RSDVR that is associated with a particular
user), a customized recoding could be created that incorporates only the most
interesting portions of the specific programs of interest to the user. These programs
may be manually selected by the user, or automatically selected using preference
information and/or demographic information as described herein.              Note that
although DVR     102  in FIG. 1 is often described as a home-type device, equivalent
concepts could be readily implemented within a remote storage DVR implemented
on network server 106 or on another service, as desired. Excitement data could be
used to make best use of a limited resource (e.g., a single tuner could be switched
between two or more different programs to always capture the more exciting
program).     Alternately, multiple tuners or other resources could be used to
simultaneously receive and decode multiple programs, with the highlight reel
                                            13

containing the most exciting portions of all received programs. In this latter case, if
both programs simultaneously broadcast relatively exciting events, both could be
received and included within the highlight reel.
[0055] In other embodiments, DVR        102  (or an equivalent RSDVR) could store the
excitement data associated with program as the program is being recorded (or after
the program has been recorded).         If the excitement data is referenced to the
recorded program via a timestamp or similar indicia, then the user may be able to
automatically or manually skip to the most interesting portions during playback of
the recorded program. In an example implementation, the user might select a "skip
to next exciting portion" feature using a remote control or other interface.       This
instruction would direct the DVR to seek out the next portion of the recorded
program in which the excitement data exceeds an appropriate threshold. As with
the preceding embodiment, the threshold may be manually configured by the user
or another human, or the threshold may be selected and set by any process (e.g.,
trial and error, automatic adjustment based upon user behavior or aggregate user
data, or the like). By storing the excitement data for a recorded program along with
timestamp data that references the excitement data to the relevant portions of the
program, the "best" parts of the program can be readily and automatically accessed
by the DVR, leading to an improved user experience. In an equivalent embodiment,
excitement data need not be stored on the DVR          102 during live broadcasts, but
rather may be retrieved from server 1o6 or the like as it is needed. The highlight
reel created with excitement data may be stored on the DVR for subsequent
viewing, and/or it may be placeshifted or otherwise streamed to remote device       110
for immediate viewing, as desired.
[0056] Still other embodiments could retrieve           excitement data for multiple
programs simultaneously and could formulate a user interface         150  to an EPG or
other application that allows the user to conveniently select and view the programs
that are of greatest interest at that moment.       If an EPG display   150  is showing
multiple football games, for example, the entries for the different games could be
shaded to indicate their then-current level of excitement, thereby allowing the user
to readily select the more exciting games for immediate viewing.         If one game is
nearing a critical moment (i.e., is very exciting) while another game is on a
commercial break, for example, the EPG entry for the more exciting game could be
more brightly or more distinctly colored within the EPG grid to draw the viewer's
                                            14

attention toward that entry. Equivalent embodiments could use different typefaces,
different sizes of typeface, different grid sizes, flashing text or grid lines, or any
other interface elements to draw the viewer's attention toward the more exciting
content, as desired.
[0057] In the example shown in FIG. 1, interface 150 is shown to include a
conventional EPG grid    154  in which programs are organized according to channel
and broadcast time. Example interface       150 also includes a separate window    152
showing a live broadcast, and a bulletin window 156 that could include an
advertisement or other notice as desired. In various embodiments, the bulletin
shown in 156 could be related to the excitement data in any manner. A bulletin
could point out the most exciting program being currently broadcast, for example,
or the most exciting program that is currently visible in the EPG grid 154. Other
embodiments could provide specific messages that are related to the underlying
content (e.g., "Broncos are driving!" when the Broncos are within the red zone).
[oo58] In the example interface       150 of FIG.  1, the various live broadcasts are
shaded different colors to reflect their relative then-current levels of excitement
based upon received excitement data. If the excitement data indicates that channel
3 is most exciting, then this channel may be highlighted, shaded or otherwise
brought to the viewer's attention as desired. Grid entries showing other programs
may be shaded, colored or otherwise highlighted to indicate their then-current
excitement levels as well.    In various embodiments the highlighting in grid 154 is
updated in real time (accounting for delays inherent in processing, transmission
and the like) so that the most interesting programs stand out from the less
interesting programs even as different events occur during the program. Shading or
other highlights may be based solely upon received or generated excitement data in
some    implementations;     other implementations      may further consider      user
preferences, as appropriate so that the grid adapts to viewer preferences (e.g.,
favorite player coming up to bat) and/or excitement data as the live broadcast
progresses.    Such user preferences may be manually configured (e.g., via a user
interface where the viewer manually selects preferences) or automatically based
upon observed viewing behavior, demographic information and/or other factors as
desired.
[0059] The particular interface 150 shown in FIG. 1 could be modified in many
different ways. Windows    152   and/or 156 could be eliminated, for example, and/or
                                           15

grid   154  could be organized and presented in any other manner.              Still other
embodiments could present grid data or other excitement data for one or more
programs as an overlay, in a scrolling bar at the edge of the screen, as a "bug" or
other indicator superimposed on the viewer's image, and/or in any other manner.
As a viewer watches one program, for example, an overlay or bug could be
generated whenever excitement levels for a different program exceed a suitable
threshold as to deserve the viewer's attention. Many other equivalent embodiments
could be formulated in any number of other applications and settings.
[oo60]The example interface        150 shown in FIG.    1 could be generated at media
client  110   based upon data received from server 106.       This could be used, for
example, in a placeshifting or other media streaming application.                    Other
embodiments could additionally or alternately generate interface         150   using DVR
102,  or any sort of television receiver/STB for presentation on a locally-connected
television or other device, as desired.       Still other embodiments may provide
interfaces   150 for other types of media streaming, media viewing, media storage or
other applications as desired.
[oo61] Still other embodiments could use the excitement data to identify
commercials in a live or pre-recorded broadcast, and to take desired action in
response. In some implementations, commercials could be given their own
excitement rating, allowing commercial breaks to be readily identified. This could
allow a highlight reel to automatically skip commercials, if desired, or a DVR to
automatically skip commercials during playback. In other embodiments, the user
could simply identify that a particular program was currently on a commercial
break from data presented in an EPG or other interface, as desired.                  Other
embodiments could equivalently provide other benefits and features, as desired.
[oo62] An example process to improve media viewing through the use of
excitement data is presented in FIG.   2. With attention now to FIG.   2,  a process   200
for delivering or otherwise rendering digital video content based upon excitement
data is described.      Process  200   may be executed by any sort of computing
machinery having a processor and memory.            Process 200  may be executed, for
example, by a set top box, television receiver, DVR    102, media client  110,  server 106
and/or other computing device, as desired. Other embodiments could divide the
various processing functions between different client and server systems and/or
make use of cloud based or other processing hardware, as desired.
                                           16

[0063] In various embodiments, a database         104  can receive, e.g., from any of a
variety of sources, as described above, excitement data associated with a particular
program or programs (function      202).  A server or plurality of servers (e.g., a server
farm and/or a guide server/server farm) can receive and/or request and receive in
response the excitement data from the database     104.  For instance, the server(s) 1o6
can communicate with an application programming interface ("API") stored in or
communicatively coupled to the excitement data database. More particularly, in
various embodiments, the server(s) 1o6 can periodically query the API and receive,
in response, excitement data associated with a variety of programs. However, in
various embodiments, the server(s) may not query the excitement data database
1o6. Rather, the server(s) can receive, e.g., on a periodic basis and/or in response to
an exciting event, as determined, for example, by the media monitoring service, the
excitement data.
[oo64] As described above, a DVR, set top box and/or other consumer electronics
system   102  can receive, from a content provider, a variety of digital video content
associated with a variety of programs. Based upon the viewer profile (e.g., as stored
by the server(s) 1o6 and communicated over the network 1o8 to the system             102),
the DVR    102  can record any digital video content that the server(s) 1o6 associates
with the viewer profile and/or any digital video content that the viewer may
explicitly associate with the viewer's profile and/or request (function       204).   The
system   102  can record the digital video content associated with each program of
interest from the beginning of the program. System       102  may also store excitement
data with timing information that ties the levels of excitement to particular portions
of the received program to facilitate later processing or manipulation of the stored
content based upon the excitement data for that portion of the content. Thus, the
system   102  can have a complete record of each program of interest or potential
interest to a viewer.
[oo65] In some implementations, as excitement data is received with respect to
one or more programs (function      202), the server(s) 1o6 can generate a message, a
notification, an alert, and the like indicating that particular digital video content
associated with one or more programs of interest (or potential interest) to the
viewer have become exciting. This message can be communicated to the viewer's
media client   110 by the server(s) 1o6 via the network 1o8. In other embodiments,
                                            17

live notifications may not be provided, but system   102 may nevertheless process the
received programming based upon the excitement data as described herein.
[oo66] In some examples, the media client 110 can display an option to view the
exciting portion of the digital media content of the program and/or to delay for later
viewing the exciting portion (function 206a). Similarly, in various embodiments,
the media client 110 can display an option to view the digital media content of the
entire program and/or to delay for later viewing the digital media content of the
entire program (function 206b).       User inputs are received (function 208), and
processed as appropriate.      Processing may include, for example, recording the
exciting content, providing a media stream of the exciting content, or taking other
actions as directed by the viewer.   Content that is not selected by the viewer could
be deleted (function 210), eliminated from a highlight reel, or otherwise processed
as appropriate.
[0067] To that end, a DVR, STB or other consumer electronics system/device that
is associated with a television viewer or other customer can perform an automated
process   200   that uses excitement data to improve the viewer experience.       The
excitement data can be used to automatically create a recording timer for an
upcoming program; to select one or more programs for presentation, streaming
and/or recording; to identify the most exciting portions of one or more programs
for compilation into a highlight reel or highlight viewing stream; and/or for any
other purpose. As noted above, process       200   could additionally consider viewer
preference data in selecting the most exciting content. If a viewer is known to prefer
baseball over football, for example, then an excitement "boost" in the form of a
bonus could be added to excitement scores associated with baseball games. An
excitement "penalty" could be additionally or alternately subtracted from less
preferred content, as desired. These modified excitement scores could therefore be
used to select programming for viewing, recording, streaming and/or other
purposes.
[oo68] Moreover, as shown with general regard to FIG. 3, a media client 110 can
display a program timeline from beginning to end (e.g., as a bar representing a time
shift buffer or the like), and highlight exciting portions of the program.         For
example, as shown, a program may comprise a first exciting portion 304 at time
span 1 (ti), a second exciting portion 306 at time span     2 (t2), and third exciting
portion 308 at time span three (t3), and the like.
                                          18

[0069] Thus, in general terms, a program can be displayed along a timeline and
one or more visual cues or indicators may be displayed to alert a viewer to exciting
portions of the program. These indicators may be displayed in any style that is
suitable.   This would allow the user to readily identify the portions of the pre
recorded program that are of greatest interest. Such an interface may be generated
wholly or in part by DVR      102, by media client 110, by server  102, or by another
service as desired. This allows the viewer to navigate directly to the most exciting
portions of the program represented by the timeline. In some implementations, the
viewer may be able to select the highlighted portions (e.g., portions 304, 306, 308)
to navigate directly to those portions for immediate viewing of the more exciting
portions of the program.      Other embodiments could simply allow the viewer to
navigate through the timeline using fast forward/rewind type keys, similar to a
conventional time shift buffer, but with more exciting portions highlighted for easy
identification by the viewer.
[0070] As noted above, visual cues can be displayed in an EPG or similar display in
the style of a "heat map." That is, for example, an exciting portion of a program can
include an excitement rating or value, such that a viewer is provided additional
information about the excitement level or value of the program.
[0071] This excitement rating or value (based upon data from database 104) can
be represented according to a color, a type face, a typeface size, flashing or pulsing
type, by background shading or hatching, and/or by any other interface mechanism
that draws the viewer's attention toward the most exciting programs. In various
embodiments, an exciting portion can be associated with any of a variety of
excitement levels, and these can be displayed in any suitable manner, such as in
association with a variety of colors (e.g., green for not very exciting, yellow for
somewhat exciting, red for exciting, and the like). An excitement level or value can
be based upon received excitement data, as described herein, and/or a viewer
profile.   Thus, a first viewer may receive a first excitement timeline and/or
notification about a program, while a second viewer may receive a different
excitement timeline and/or notification about the program, each depending upon
the individual profile of each viewer.      Thus, a viewer may receive targeted or
tailored program content and/or excitement notifications based upon the profile of
the viewer. Stated another way, the content of greatest interest to the viewer can be
                                           19

highlighted based upon a comparison of user preference data and excitement data
received from server 106.
[0072] In an example placeshifting implementation, for example, a user operates a
media client application on device    110 that interacts with a server 106 on network
108. The server 106 suitably delivers EPG data and/or interfaces that allow imagery
to be generated on device      110 as described herein. In some embodiments, the
imagery could contain "heat map" or other data about available programming to
help the user select programs of greatest interest. Again, an example interface 150
is shown in FIG. 1, although other embodiments could generate different interfaces
as desired.     "Heat map" type interfaces could be generated for presentation on
media client    110  (e.g., as part of a placeshifting, IPTV, VOD or other media
application).    Equivalent embodiments could be implemented with television
receivers, STBs, DVRs or other home devices to generate interfaces such as interface
150  on a locally-connected television or the like.
[0073] Further embodiments could alternately or additionally present excitement
data in a recorded program as part of a time shift buffer indicator, as described
above. In such embodiments, a viewer can tap or select (e.g., in the instance that
the media client    110 of the viewer includes a touch screen display) a portion of a
program, such as portions 304, 306, and/or 308, each of which can be associated
with any of a variety of excitement levels. In response to such a selection, the media
client 110  can skip, in the media stream, to the selected program portion. Thus, a
viewer can view any of a variety of demarcated exciting portions 304, 306, 310, and
the like.
[0074] Further, in various embodiments, the viewer can select an option to view
the exciting portion of the digital media content of the program and/or to delay for
later viewing the exciting portion and/or to view the entire digital media content of
the program and/or to delay for later viewing the entire digital media content of the
program (function     208).  The DVR   102  can, in response to the viewer's selections,
store the selected digital media content for viewing and/or stream the selected
content to the viewer's media client   110.  The DVR    102 can, in addition, delete any
unselected digital media content in the background (e.g., without viewer
instruction), so that the viewer is unfettered by the necessity of deleting unwanted
content (function   210).
                                            20

[0075] In some embodiments, the system 100 can capture an exciting portion of a
program from the beginning of the exciting portion. In contrast, if the system  100
were to await notification of excitement data to begin recordation of the digital
media content associated with a program, the system would be hard pressed or
simply unable to capture the entire exciting portion, because recordation would not
begin until a delay between reception of the notification and the beginning of
recordation would occur.
[0076] The terms "exemplary" and "example" are used herein to represent one
example, instance or illustration that may have any number of alternates.       Any
implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as
preferred or advantageous over other implementations. While several exemplary
embodiments have been presented in the foregoing detailed description, it should
be appreciated that a vast number of alternate but equivalent variations exist, and
the examples presented herein are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or
configuration of the invention in any way. To the contrary, various changes may be
made in the function and arrangement of elements described without departing
from the scope of the claims and their legal equivalents.
