ABSTRACT
A pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM) actuator body can be formed from an
elastic material that includes an inflatable chamber and a restraining component,
such as flexible, but inextensible fibers, that causes the actuator to contract
when the chamber is inflated with fluid (e.g., air or water). The actuator body
can be cylindrical or flat. The actuator body can include a sensor layer formed
of an elastic material including a microchannel filled with a conductive fluid to
sense the expansion of the actuator body. The sensor layer can be configured to
expand when the actuator body is inflated causing the electrical resistance of the
conductive fluid to change. A sensor layer between the actuator body and
restraining component can be used to measure changes in the contraction force
of the actuator and a sensor layer outside of the restraining component can be
used to measure changes in the length of the actuator.

Technical Field of the Invention
[0005]          The present invention is directed to pneumatic artificial muscle actuators
including embedded sensors that enable control of the actuators in real time.
Description of the Prior Art
[0006]          Pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM) actuators are used to provide mechanical
actuation in various fields, such as, robotics. The actuator typically includes a cylindrical
tube extending along an axis, sealed at both ends, formed from an elastic material, such as
rubber or silicon. A pneumatic inlet is provided to enable a fluid, such as a gas or liquid to be
injected into the tube causing the tube to expand. The tube also includes flexible, but
inextensible fibers or other material that prevents the tube from expanding along the axis.
Typically, the fibers are fastened at each end of the tube. As a result, when air is injected into
                                               1

    WO 2014/113781                                                            PCT/US2014/012299
the inlet, the tube expands radially, in a direction transverse to the axis and contracts in length
along the axis. When the air is released, the tube contracts radially and extends axially. In
this way, the actuator can be used to cause a device, such as a robotic arm to move.
[0007]           One of the drawbacks of these pneumatic actuators is that they can be difficult
to control with respect to position (contraction length) and force (contraction force) due to
their inherent nonlinear behavior. Extrinsic sensors, for example, located on the joint or
elsewhere on the device, external to the actuator can be used. However, these extrinsic
sensors make the system bulky, heavy, and complex, outweighing any potential advantages
of using relatively small and light weight pneumatics for actuation.
                                           SUMMARY
[0008]           The present invention is directed to mechanical actuators that include
embedded sensors that enable control of the actuator in real-time. The actuators can include
pneumatic actuators that contract along a working axis in response to fluid being injected into
a chamber or cavity that can expand in a dimension transverse to the axis. The actuators can
include restraining elements, such as flexible but inextensible fibers, such as cables or Kevlar
fibers, that react to the expanding cavity to contract the actuator along the axis. These
actuators can be used as artificial muscles to actuate mechanical devices, such as robotics and
prosthetics.
[0009]           In accordance with various embodiments of the invention, the pneumatic
artificial muscle actuator can be provided with integrated sensing capabilities inspired by--
muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs---receptor organs that provide the means for elegant
control loops in biological systems. In accordance with the invention, the integrated sensors
can measure the change in length and the change in tension force of the PAM actuator.
[0010]           In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the pneumatic actuator
can be formed from an elastic material that includes a chamber extending along an axis from
a first end to a second end. The actuator can include an inlet connected to the chamber to
enable a fluid to be injected into the chamber. The actuator can include a plurality of flexible
fibers coupled to the first end and the second end that prevent the actuator for extending
along the axis. The actuator can also include a first sensor layer positioned along the actuator
between the first end and the second end and coupled to the actuator, whereby when a fluid is
injected into the chamber causing the chamber to expand, the first sensor layer is caused to
expand and wherein the first sensor layer includes a first microchannel containing a
conductive liquid extending along a portion of the actuator whereby expansion of the first

sensor layer causes a change in at least one dimension of the microchannel and a change in
electrical resistance of the conductive liquid in the first microchannel.

             DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0030]          The present invention is directed to an actuator that includes integrated
sensing and can provide real-time reporting of position and force to provide real-time control
of the actuator. The actuator can be provided in different embodiments according to the
application.
[0031]          Figures 1A and 1B show one embodiment of an integrated actuator 100
according to the invention. Figure 1A shows the integrated actuator 100 in a relaxed or
unpressurized state. Figure lB shows the integrated actuator 100 in a contracted or
pressurized state. In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the actuator 100
can include an actuator body 110 that extends between a first end 102 and a second end 104,
an includes an inlet 120 to enable a fluid, such as a gas or liquid to be injected into the central
cavity or chamber inside the actuator 100.

    WO 2014/113781                                                            PCT/US2014/012299
[00321          In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the actuator body 110
can be formed by one or more layers of an elastomer material that can expand when a fluid is
injected into the cavity of the actuator 100 and then return to the relaxed or unpressurized
state when the fluid is released and allowed to escape the cavity. In some embodiments, the
elastomer material can include a high elasticity silicone rubber such as Dragon Skin from
Smooth-on, Inc., Easton, PA. The elastomer material can be selected from a wide range of
elastomer materials, including rubber, silicon, polyurethane and PDMS.
[00331          In operation, the actuator 100 can extend and contract along an axis that
extends between the first end 102 and the second end 104. The first end 102 and second end
104 can include any known fastening element to allow the ends to be attached to a device to
be actuated. The ends 102 and 104 can, for example, include loops to allow them to be
bolted to an actuated device or include threaded posts that enable them to be connected to a
threaded hole or by use of a mating nut or other internally threaded element.
[0034]          In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, the actuator
body can include a restraining component that is adapted to cause the actuator to contract
along an axis in response to an expansion force applied transverse to the axis. The restraining
component, for example, can be constructed from fibers, cords, cables, sheets or mechanical
linkages or a combination of mechanical linkages and fibers, cords, cables or sheets.
[0035]          In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the actuator body 110
can include a restraining component that includes one or more flexible, but inextensible fibers
124 that are positioned along or parallel to the axis that extends between the first end 102 and
the second end 104. One or more of the fibers 124 can be connected, directly or indirectly to
each of the ends 102 and 104. The fiber 124 can be used to prevent the actuator 100 from
extending in length when fluid is injected into the cavity or chamber. However, the fibers
124 enable the actuator 100 to expand radially, transverse to the axis that extends between the
ends, causing the actuator to contract axially pulling the ends 102 and 104 together. The
fibers 124 can be embedded into the flexible material that forms the actuator body 110 or be
positioned outside of at least one layer of material that forms the actuator body 110. In
accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the fibers can be Kevlar TM fibers,
cord or cables, metal cables (e.g., steel cable), or other flexible, but substantially inextensible
materials. In addition to cables or fibers, the fiber materials can be woven into a fabric or
sheet configuration.
[00361          A fluid control system can be provided to control the flow of fluid into the
actuator 100. The inlet 120 can be provided in the form of an inlet tube 120 or connection for
                                               5

    WO 2014/113781                                                          PCT/US2014/012299
connecting a hose or other conduit that enables the fluid to be injected into the cavity inside
the actuator 100. A valve or other fluid flow control element can be coupled to the inlet to
control the flow of fluid into and out of the actuator 100. In accordance with some
embodiments, the fluid can be a gas, such as, air or a liquid, such as water or hydraulic fluids.
Other gases, such as inert gases, or liquids can be used depending on the environment.
[0037]          In operation, a fluid under pressure can be allowed to flow into the central
cavity or chamber of the actuator body 110 causing it to expand radially, transverse to the
axis of the body 110. The expansion causes the fibers to expand radially as well, shortening
the distance between the ends of the fibers, causing the body 110 to contract in length along
the axis as shown in Fig. 1B. When the fluid is released or allowed to escape the central
cavity or chamber of the actuator body 110, it extends along the axis and returns to its initial
state as shown in Fig. 1A. In accordance with the invention, the fluid can be any gas or
liquid, including, for example, air and water. The fluid selected for a given application can
be selected as a function of on the environment and forces required.
[00381          In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the actuator body 110
can include one or more sensing elements integrated into the actuator body material. The
sensing elements can be components that can be used to report a change in a physical
dimension of the actuator body 110.
[00391          In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the sensing elements
can include one or more microchannels 130 embedded in the actuator body 110 that includes
a conducting liquid that changes electrical resistance when the actuator body 110 expands.
Wires can be connected to the ends of the microchannels 130 to measure the change in
resistance as the actuator body 110 contracts and extends. In accordance with some
embodiments, the microchannel 130 can be formed in a spiral or helix that extends around at
least a portion of the actuator body 110 and axially along at least a portion of the actuator
body 110. In accordance with some embodiments, more than one microchannel 130 can be
provided and the microchannels can be provided in any of the layers of the actuator body
110.
[0040]          Figure 2 is a diagram depicting the layers that can be provided in an actuator
100 according to some embodiments of the invention. In these embodiments, the actuator
body 110 can be constructed from 3 or more layers of flexible material. The inner most
layer, layer 1 212 can enclose the air chamber 222 that can be connected to inlet 120. Layer
1 212 can be formed from an elastomer and include one or more microchannels, such as
microchannel 232 formed in a helix or spiral around the air chamber 222. In accordance with
                                               6

    WO 2014/113781                                                          PCT/US2014/012299
some embodiments, the microchannel 232 can be filled with a non-toxic conducting liquid,
e.g. eutectic Gallium-Indium (eGaIn) or eutectic Gallium-Indium-Tin (Galinstan). The
second or middle layer, layer 2 214, can include flexible, but inextensible fiber 224 that
extend parallel to the axis of the actuator and can be fixed at both ends 102, 104 of the
actuator body 110. The fibers 224 can be embedded in a flexible material as shown or can
simply be positioned between the inner layer, layer 1 212 and the outer layer, layer 3 216.
The outer layer, layer 3 216 can be formed from an elastomer and include one or more
microchannels, such as microchannel 234 formed in a helix or spiral around layer 2 214 or
the fibers 224. As with microchannel 232, the microchannel 234 can also be filled with a non
toxic conducting liquid, e.g. eutectic Gallium-Indium (eGaIn) or eutectic Gallium-Indium-Tin
(Galinstan). Wires, not shown, can be connected to each end of the microchannel and in
electrical contact with the conducting liquid to enable a control system to measure a change
in the electrical resistance of the conducting liquid as the actuator expands and relaxes.
[0041]           In operation, when the actuator contracts, microchannel 232 and microchannel
234 containing liquid metal in the both inner (layer 1 212) and outer layer (layers 3 216) are
stretched, as shown in Figure 3B, and the electrical resistance of the liquid conductor
increases. This resistance change can be used to determine the axial displacement of the
actuator (actuator contraction) by empirically determining the resistance at two or more
displacements and estimating or extrapolating intervening positions.
[0042]           The operation of the pneumatic actuator 100, 200 can be better understood by
evaluating the differential effect of compressed air (or fluid) on the behavior of the inner
microchannel 332 and outer microchannel 334. When the two ends of the actuator are fixed,
as compressed air enters the air chamber, the overall geometry of the muscle remains almost
the same, but the pressure of the air chamber increases. The result is that the inner layer
(Layer 1 312) is pushed out by the internal air pressure, but at the same time is compressed
by the fibers 324. The fibers 324 cover only certain areas of the inner microchannel 332.
Those areas of the inner microchannel 332 that are covered by (e.g. intersect) the fibers 324
are compressed and deformed, compare Fig. 3A with Fig. 3B. The overall effect is an
increase in electrical resistance of the inner microchannel 332 of the inner layer (Layer 1
312). However, the electrical resistance change of the outer microchannel 334 is little
because this microchannel is neither elongated nor compressed. If the load on the muscle is
very low impedance, the resistance increases in the two microchannels are almost the same,
but if the load is higher impedance then the two microchannels give different responses with
a larger resistance increase in the inner microchannel. Therefore, using these two
                                               7

    WO 2014/113781                                                          PCT/US2014/012299
microchannels, the system can determine the contraction length, the load and the contraction
force at the same time.
[0043]          In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the outer
microchannel 334 can be used for measuring the change in length of the actuator 100, and the
inner microchannel 332 can be used for measuring the change in contraction force of the
actuator 100. If the length and force change happen simultaneously, the sensor signal of the
outer microchannel 334 can be subtracted from that of the inner microchannel 332 to measure
contraction force because the inner microchannel is experiencing both elongation and
compression at the same time.
[0044]          In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the force and
displacement of the actuator 100 can determined empirically by placing the actuator 100 in a
fixture that measures the contraction force as air pressure is applied to the actuator 100. By
fixing the second end 104 and attaching the first end 102 to a scale, such as a spring scale, the
force and length of the actuator can be measured as different amounts of pressure is applied.
Using 2 or more data points, the force and displacement can be determined from the
empirical data.
[0045]          Figure 4 illustrates one example of the fabrication process for making helical
microchannels embedded in an elastomer actuator body 110, according to some embodiments
of the invention. The number of turns in the helix can be used to select the sensitivity, with
the more turns providing higher sensitivity. In accordance with this embodiment of the
invention, the channel can be formed within the elastomer by keeping a wrapped low-friction
fiber having a diameter or cross-sectional dimension of 125 micrometers (e.g., Dyneema or
Spectra) in place when the elastomer is in its liquid state, and then removing the fiber when
the elastomer is cured. In other embodiments, the low-friction fiber can have a diameter or
cross-sectional dimension of in the range from 50 to 1000 micrometers
[0046]          In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the microchannels
can be formed having a cross-section dimension in a range from 50 micrometers to 1000
micrometers. The dimensions of the microchannels 332 and 334 can be determined based on
the application, including the amount of force to be applied and dimensions of the actuator
itself. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a pattern that can be used as a
guide for the location of the low-friction fiber can be made in the outer mold shown in Figure
4 to make the location of the microchannel more consistent. The mold can include an inner
post and an outer mold as shown in step 4(a). The elastomer material, in liquid form, can be
poured or injected into the mold and allowed to cure as shown in step 4(b). The cured

elastomer layer can be removed from the mold as shown in figure 4(c). The helical
microchannel pattern in the outer mold provides the location on the cured inner tube for
insertion of a filler element or material, such as, a low-friction fiber or cord (e.g., Dyneema,
available from DSM Dyneema LLC, Stanley, NC or Spectra, available from Honeywell
International, Colonial Heights, VA), as shown in step 4(d). The cured inner tube with the
low-friction fiber is inserted into a larger outer mold at step 4(e) and an outer layer of
elastomer is applied at step 4(f). After the outer layer is cured, the completed layer is
removed from the outer mold (and the inner post is removed) at 4(g). The low-friction fiber
can be removed from the completed layer at step 4(h), leaving the complete layer with a
microchannel to be filled with a conductive liquid. The mold components can be formed, for
example, using a 3-D printer.
[0047]          Examples of an elastomer tube with embedded helical microchannels are
shown in Figures 5(a) - 5(d). Figure 5(a) shows, according to one embodiment of the
invention, an elastomer tube in a 3D printed mold with embedded Dyneema and Kevlar
fibers. Figure 5(b) shows the elastomer tube after removing Dyneema fibers. Figure 5(c)
shows the elastomer tube after removing the elastomer tube from the 3-D printed mold.
Figure 5(d) shows an example of an actuator according to an embodiment of the invention
having a pneumatic fitting, eGaIn conducting liquid injected in the helical microchannel and
wires connected to the eGaIn conducting liquid.
[0048]          The sensing actuator according to the invention can also be used to mimic the
function of natural muscles, without being limited by its cylindrical form. This embodiment
of the invention can be used in applications in which the muscle mimic can be embedded in
material that surrounds a portion of the body, for example, in active physical therapy and
active prosthetic applications. In accordance with the invention, the sensing actuator can be
formed, similar to a biological muscle, in a substantially two-dimensional or flat
configuration. The flat configuration remains substantially flat when in its relaxed state
providing a highly compact actuator that adds little additional volume so that it can be
incorporated in a brace or a suit worn on the body.
[0049]          Figures 6A and 6B show a pneumatic actuator 600 according to an alternative
embodiment of the invention. This embodiment is similar to the structure of the actuator
shown in Figure 1, except that it has a two-dimensional flat configuration with multiple
stacked layers that make-up the actuator body 610. Like the actuator shown in Figures 1A
and IB, the actuator body 610 extends along an axis from a first end 602 to a second end 604.
The ends 602 and 604 can include fastening or attachment elements (not shown) that enable
                                                9

    WO 2014/113781                                                           PCT/US2014/012299
the ends to be securely fastened to a device to be actuated.
[0050]           In accordance with some embodiments, the actuator body 610 can include one
or more layers of one or more flexible, but inextensible fibers 624 that are positioned along or
parallel to the axis that extends between the first end 602 and the second end 604. One or
more of the fibers 624 can be connected, directly or indirectly to each of the ends 602 and
604. The fibers 624 can be used to prevent the actuator 600 from extending in length when
fluid is injected into the cavity or chamber. However, the fibers 624 enable the actuator 600
to expand radially, transverse to the axis that extends between the ends 602 and 604, causing
the actuator to contract axially pulling the ends 602 and 604 together. The fibers 624 can be
embedded into one or more of the layers of flexible material that forms the actuator body 610
or be positioned outside of at least one layer of material that forms the chamber, layer 0 611
of the actuator body 610. As shown in Figure 6B, the fibers 624 can, for example, be
embedded into layer 2a 615 and layer 2b 614 of the actuator body 610. Alternatively, the
material that forms layer 2a 615 and layer 2b 614 can be omitted and the fibers 624 can be
bonded in-place when layer 3a 617 is bonded to layer la 613 and when layer 3b 616 is
bonded to layer lb 612.
[0051]           A fluid control system can be provided to control the flow of fluid into the
actuator 600. The inlet 620 can be provided in the form of an inlet tube or connection 620 for
connecting a hose or other conduit that enables the fluid to be injected into the cavity or
chamber inside the actuator 600. A valve or other fluid flow control element can be coupled
to the inlet 620 to control the flow of fluid into and out of the actuator 100.
[0052]           Figure 6B shows an exploded view of the pneumatic actuator 600 according to
an alternative embodiment of the invention. The inner most layers is layer 0 611 which
includes a zero-volume fluid chamber in the middle of the layer. Layer 0 611 can be formed
from two flat sheets of material that are bonded together with a specific area in the middle
that prevents the two layers from being bonded during the fabrication. Like a bladder that
has been pressed flat, this middle area has no volume when it is not inflated. However, it
inflates when a fluid, such as, compressed air, is injected inside, and the fixed length of the
fibers makes the muscle contract in the axial direction of the fibers, as shown in Figures 7A
and 7B. The zero-volume fluid chamber enables the actuator to be compact in its relaxed
state. It is not necessary that the fluid chamber in layer 0 be zero volume.
[0053]           In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the actuator body 610
can include layers above and below layer 0 611 that includes the fluid chamber. As shown in
Figure 6B, the actuator body 610 can include layer la 613, layer 2a 615 and layer 3a 617
                                               10

    WO 2014/113781                                                               PCT/US2014/012299
above layer 0 and layer lb 612, layer 2b 614 and layer 3b 616 below layer 0. In accordance
with some embodiments of the invention, some of these layers can be omitted depending
upon the application of the actuator.
[0054]           In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, one or more of the
layers of the pneumatic actuator 600 can include microchannels 630 that contain a conductive
liquid that changes electrical resistance as the layer stretches to enable position and force
sensing. The microchannel 630 embedded eGaIn or Galinstan sensing layers, inner (layer lb
612) and outer (layer 3a 617) of the actuator 600 can detect both the contraction length and
force changes of the muscle in the same way as described for the embodiment of Figures 1A,
1B and 2. In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the microchannels 630 are
formed in a flat material according to a pattern that results in a change in one or more
physical dimensions of the microchannel when the layer is stretched as fluid is injected into
the fluid chamber. Figures 6A and 6B show that the microchannel forms a "zig-zag" pattern
that can extend from proximate the first end 602 to proximate the second end 604, but
traverses back and forth across the surface, transverse to the axis of the actuator 600.
[0055]           Figures 7A and 7B show a cross-section of the actuator 600 of Figure 6 in the
relaxed state and the expanded state, respectively. As shown in Figure 7A, the actuator 700
can be substantially flat with each layer, extending substantially parallel to the next. As
shown in Figure 7B, when the fluid chamber is inflated, each of the layers expands transverse
to the axis of the actuator body 610 and causing the fibers 724 in layer 2b 614 to bear against
the microchannels 630 in layer lb 612, changing the electrical resistance differently than that
of microchannels 630 in layer 3a 617. This enables the microchannels 630 in layer lb 612 to
be used to measure the change in the contracting force and the microchannels 630 in layer 3a
617 to be used to measure the change in the length of the actuator. Where the length and force
change happen simultaneously, the sensor signal of the outer layer, layer 3a 617 can be subtracted
from that of the inner layer, layer lb 612 to measure contraction force because the microchannel in
inner layer, layer lb 612 is experiencing both elongation and compression at the same time.
[0056]           One example of the fabrication process for making a zero-volume fluid
chamber is shown in Figure 8. The fabrication process, shown in Figure 8, to make a zero
volume air chamber includes: (a) Prepare the bottom mold; (b) Pour the liquid elastomer and
allow it to cure; (c) Position the negative mask on the cured elastomer. (d) Spray the pattern
release material. A pattern release material is sprayed on the unmasked area to prevent the
bottom layer from becoming bonded to the top layer. (e) Remove the mask; (f) Place the
second top mold on the bottom mold; (g) Pour the liquid elastomer; and (h) Remove top and
                                                 11

    WO 2014/113781                                                            PCT/US2014/012299
bottom mold when the elastomer cures. The release material will prevent the top layer from
adhering to the bottom layer in area of the chamber. An inlet can either be fabricated into the
layer, e.g., using the release material, providing an inlet tube or cutting, drilling or boring into
the chamber. A cleaning fluid can be introduced into the chamber to remove the release
material, if necessary.
[0057]           An alternative fabrication method is shown in Figure 9. Instead of using
pattern release spray, a positive mask prevents the liquid elastomer from being coated. The
alternative fabrication process of Figure 9 to make a zero-volume fluid chamber includes: (a)
Prepare the bottom mold. (b) Pour the liquid elastomer and allow it to cure. (c) Place the
positive mask. (d) Spin coat a layer of liquid elastomer. (e) Remove mask. (f) Partial bake.
(g) Laminate a cured top layer onto the bottom layer. (f) Remove mold when the elastomer
layer cures. While the method of Figure 8 repeats pouring processes, the method of Figure 9
requires a bonding process of two cured layers. These fabrication methods for zero-volume
air chambers can be also used for making zero-volume microchannels for sensing as an
alternative to the molding and casting process.
Examples
[0058]           One example of an actuator according to the invention and its intermediate
fabrication stages are shown in Figures 10(a) and 10(b). Figure 10(a) shows the front and
back sides of the completed device. Figure 10(b) shows the fibers and a sensor layer bonded
in 3D printed mold. Detailed views of one completed prototype according to the invention
are shown in Figures 11(a) and 11(b). Figure 11(a) shows front side with the sensor layer
over the fiber layer. Figure 11(b) shows the back side with the fiber layer over the sensor
layer. The actuator shown in Figures 10(a), 10(b) and 11(a), 11(b) has a single unit zero
volume air chamber and embedded microchannels in multiple flat layers. By connecting or
fabricating the actuators in series along their axis, a group of multiple flat actuators can be
made, as shown in Figure 12. The example shown in Figure 12 has the capability of more
than 25% contraction. While a serial configuration of multiple muscles increases the
contraction length, a parallel configuration may be used to increase the contraction force.
[0059]           Figures 13(a) and 13(b) show an example of a characterization system and an
example of a resulting characterization of a multi-cell actuator according to one embodiment
of the invention. As shown in Figure 13(a), the characterization system can include a
commercial material stress/strain tester and the multi-cell actuator can be tested by injecting
compressed air into the actuator at predefined pressures (e.g., 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15 psi).

The contraction force and length can be measured for different air pressures using a
commercial materials tester. Figure 13(b) shows the characterization result including the
force and contraction curves for each air pressure value.
[00601          Figures 14A, 14B and 14C show a diagram of an alternative method for
forming the helical microchannels 1330 in the elastomer material according to some
embodiments of the invention. In this method, the helical channel can be produced in a
substantially straight and flat layer as shown in Fig. 13A. The microchannel can be formed
by molding a base layer with a microchannel and then bonding a layer over it or by molding
the layer using a low-friction fiber, such as the Dyneema, or Spectra fiber identified above.
After the microchannel layer has cured, it can be wrapped in a helical or other fashion around
an inner mold and inserted into an outer mold as shown in Fig. 14B. The inextensible fibers
1324 can be held in place in the mold as liquid elastomer is poured or injected into the mold
cavity forming a layer that includes both microchannels 1330 and inextensible fiber 1324.
After curing, shown in Fig. 14C, the resulting tubular component can be removed from the
mold and used to construct a pneumatic actuator according to the invention. An outer layer
providing a second microchannel 1330 can be added to resulting tubular component shown
Fig. 13C, by wrapping a second microchannel layer around the tubular component and
pouring or injecting liquid elastomer to form an outer layer similar to the method shown in
Fig. 14B.
