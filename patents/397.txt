   ABSTRACT
   AUTOMATIC RECONFIGURATION OF NETWORK DEVICES
 5 A  solution for automatic reconfiguration of network devices
   adapted to switch from the role of access point to the role of
   station and vice versa is described. In order to prepare a
   first network device       (AP, STAl,  STA2)  for automatic
   configuration in the network, a profile of a second network
10 device    (AP, STAl,  STA2)   connected to said first network device
    (AP, STA1,   STA2)  via a network is     received  (13, 22). The
   profile comprises access point credentials of the second
   network device     (AP, STAl,   STA2).  The received profile is
   compared    (23) with existing profiles stored in a memory        (43) of
15 said first network device        (AP, STAl,  STA2)  and is stored  (14,
   24)   in said memory    (43),  if necessary. In case at a later time
   a role change of the first network device          (AP) is determined
    (30),  the stored profile is      retrieved  (31)  from the memory   (43)
   and used for connecting       (32)  the first network device    (AP) to
20 the second network device        (AP(2)).

   AUTOMATIC RECONFIGURATION OF NETWORK DEVICES
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5 The invention relates to a solution for automatic
   reconfiguration of network devices adapted to operate in two
   different roles in a network. More specifically, the invention
   addresses a credential   recovery and auto-provisioning
   mechanism, which ensures that after a reconfiguration of the
10 network the network remains operational.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Today, especially due to the delivery of multimedia    services
15 over Wi-Fi, more and more equipment is being connected to the
   in house WLAN   (WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network).  However, a
   lot of devices do not yet have the necessary hardware "on
   board" to be able to connect to the WLAN, but simply connect on
   Ethernet. Hence there is a booming demand for Wi-Fi-to-Ethernet
20 boxes that allow easy connection of the Ethernet devices to the
   WLAN. One of the reasons that a lot of devices deliberately
   choose not to integrate WLAN hardware is because of the high
   pace with which the underlying   802.11 technology is evolving.
   While it took 802.11bg roughly ten years to get to a mature
25 market, 802.11n rose to popularity in three years only to be
   followed-up by 802.1lac in 2013.   Practically this means that
   devices embedding Wi-Fi technology have the chance to get
   obsolete or at least less popular quite fast. This puts a lot
   of pressure on the product cost, motivating stand-alone Wi-Fi
30 to-Ethernet boxes.
   From a production cost point of view, a device manufacturer is
   interested in building the most versatile product in order to
   spend as little as possible on hardware tooling, i.e.

    WO 2014/090622                                         PCT/EP2013/075248
                                        2
   production line, test       software, etc.,   and as little as possible
   on logistic costs,      e.g. caused by different product codes,
   different order numbers, software, required storage space, etc.
   Hence a single Wi-Fi-to-Ethernet device capable of being both
 5 AP and STA      (AP: Access  Point;   STA: Station) is often realized,
   keeping production and logistic costs         low. For ease of use,       all
   devices receive AP credentials, which guaranties strong
   security. End users do not have to come up with clever
   passphrases and, through using WPS-PBC         (WPS-PBC : Wi-Fi
10 Protected Setup -      2.Push Button Configuration),    do not even
   need to know the WPA       (WPA: Wi-Fi Protected Access) passphrase
   of the AP. This further removes the need for any user interface
   on the bridge devices, reducing the complexity and cost even
   further.
15
   Not having to perform a lot of networking functions, Wi-Fi-to
   Ethernet boxes are deployed as 802.1d compliant bridges,
   forwarding packets transparently between the devices connected
   to the AP and devices connected to the STA.
20
   The main problem to overcome with such Wi-Fi-to-Ethernet boxes
   is the configuration of the network credentials. Ideally, end
   users do not have to be troubled with the configuration of
   those devices and should be capable of using the devices right
25 out of the box. This implies        that the out-of-the-box    (OB)
   settings must allow deploying a WLAN, which is commonly
   realized via "pre-pairing" two or more devices in production.
   An alternative is      the usage of WPS-PBC configuration, which
   becomes applicable once the end user starts to expand his
30 current WLAN.
   However, problems arise when users start to physically alter
   the network. For example, when a user moves to a new home and
   does not know which box was        the AP and which one was    the STA.

     WO 2014/090622                                      PCT/EP2013/075248
                                       3
   This is     an issue as there is   an impact on the usable bandwidth
   and this could lead to not being able to connect to the WLAN
   anymore.
 5 This is     illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 using a Wi-Fi LAN device
   as an example. In the example of Fig. 1 two STA devices STAl
   and STA2 are connected to an AP, which in turn is connected to
   a central gateway or port of a broadband network. STAl and STA2
   have the credentials of the AP and hence are allowed on the
10 WLAN. Because the two STA devices share the WLAN bandwidth
   using CSMA-CA       (CSMA-CA: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with
   Collision Avoidance),       each STA device roughly gets 50%    of the
   available air-time, provided each is using the same PHY rate
    (PHY rate:      Physical Layer rate).
15
   When the end user decides to physically move the devices, the
   scenario can change as indicated in Fig. 2. As all the devices
   are generic, they all look the same. As a result the end user
   may unknowingly connect the devices in an incorrect way. Now
20 the STA2 device is       connected to the central gateway or port of
   the broadband network instead of the AP. This connection error
   cuts the available bandwidth to 33% per STA device. The reason
   of this bandwidth drop is the IEEE 802.11       infrastructure mode,
   which does not allow STA devices to exchange data directly with
25 each other. Instead, all packets must go through the AP.
   Thanks to the pairing or pre-pairing the Wi-Fi       link will still
   work, but there is       a substantial bandwidth loss. Note that the
   example given still considers equal PHY rate between the
30 clients and the AP. If this starts to change due to external
   influences, e.g. fading, shadowing, interference, etc.,          the
   impact becomes a lot worse.

      WO 2014/090622                                     PCT/EP2013/075248
                                      4
    From the scenario in Fig. 2 it is      apparent that a functional
    role change is required. Functional role change here means that
    an AP becomes an STA or an STA becomes an AP. This is        needed in
    order to restore the air-time ratio and hence the total
  5 throughput towards a client.
    A role change is by preference dynamic, e.g. using a discovery
    mechanism such as LLDP     (LLDP: Link Layer Discovery Protocol),
    SSDP   (SSDP: Simple Service Discovery Protocol) or even DHCP
10   (DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol),     so that an end
    user is not troubled with a full, manual reconfiguration. A
    solution for determining a role change of network devices is
    described, for example, in US 7,380,025.
15  Fig. 3 illustrates what happens when a role change is
    performed. STA2 becomes a new access point AP(2) using its own
    set of credentials, i.e. BSSID      (BSSID: Basic Service Set
    Identification) and WPA passphrase. The other devices can
    reconnect to the network, as they have been pre-paired.
20  However, if the devices were not pre-paired, e.g. because the
    end user bought two separate devices, or a third device was
    added, or a device was    replaced, the scenario of the role swap
    would lead to a disaster, as the other devices would not be
    able to reconnect to the network.

    SUMMARY    OF THE INVENTION
    It  is an object of the present invention to propose a reliable
    solution for automatic reconfiguration of network devices.
30
    According to the invention, a method for preparing a first
    network device for automatic configuration in a network,
    wherein the first network device      (AP, STA1, STA2)  is  adapted to
    switch from the role of access point to the role of station and

     WO 2014/090622                                    PCT/EP2013/075248
                                     5
   vice versa, comprises the steps of:
   -  receiving a profile of a second network device connected to
   said first network device via a network, wherein the profile of
   the second network device comprises access point credentials of
 5 the second network device;
   -  comparing the received profile with existing profiles stored
   in a memory of said first network device; and
   -  storing the profile of the second network device in the
   memory in case the profile is not yet stored in the memory.
10
   Accordingly, a network device adapted to switch from the role
   of access point to the role of station and vice versa
   comprises:
   -  an input for receiving a profile of a second network device
15 connected to said network device via a network, wherein the
   profile of the second network device comprises access point
   credentials of the second network device;
   -  a memory for storing the profile of the second network device
   in case the profile is not yet stored in the memory;       and
20 -  a comparator for comparing the received profile with existing
   profiles stored in the memory of said network device.
   The invention proposes a credential recovery and auto
   provisioning mechanism, which is preferably implemented as a
25 software module included in the software running on the
   different network devices, namely the access point and the
   stations. Advantageously, the devices are provided with an auto
   role detection, meaning they figure out what their functional
   role is     in the WLAN. Once this has been established, the WLAN
30 can be set up through usage of WPS-PBC. If the WLAN is
   operational, loss of credentials will be countered by a
   software application that will retrieve the profiles, which
   comprise the access point credentials, of all the nodes of the
   network, i.e.     the access point and all stations in the network.

     WO 2014/090622                                 PCT/EP2013/075248
                                  6
   The access point and/or the stations broadcast this   info to all
   the nodes in the network. In this way all nodes are provided
   with the access point  security credentials of all other nodes.
   This ensures that the WLAN can be restored once the devices are
 5 powered up again in a different configuration. The auto
   provision of the network credentials functions without
   interference of the end user. At the same time  it is   a much
   less costly and time consuming process than pre pairing the
   devices in production.
10
   Advantageously, the access point requests each newly
   encountered station to send its profile. This ensures that also
   the access point  security credentials of stations joining the
   network at a later time are available to all nodes.
15
   Preferably, the profiles stored in the memory are broadcast
   into the network with a predetermined delay between subsequent
   profiles. In this way the different stations have sufficient
   time to process the each received profile. Otherwise further
20 profiles might be missed by a station that is still busy with
   storing a previous profile.
   Favorably, the step of broadcasting the profiles stored in the
   memory into the network is repeated after a predetermined time.
25 In this way the profiles are also made available to a device
   that joined the network at a later time.
   In order to reconfigure a network device after powering up
   again in a different configuration, a method for automatically
30 configuring a first network device, which is adapted to switch
   from the role of access point to the role of station and vice
   versa, comprises the steps of:
   -  determining a role change of the first network device;

     WO 2014/090622                                    PCT/EP2013/075248
                                     7
   -  retrieving a profile of a second network device from a
   memory, wherein the profile of the second network device
   comprises access point credentials of the second network
   device;     and
 5 -  connecting the first network device to the second network
   device using the retrieved profile.
   Accordingly, a network device adapted to switch from the role
   of access point to the role of station and vice versa
10 comprises:
   -  a role detector for determining a role change of the network
   device;
   -  a memory access unit for retrieving a profile of a second
   network device from a memory, wherein the profile of the second
15 network device comprises access point credentials of the second
   network device;     and
   -  a network connector for connecting the network device to the
   second network device using the retrieved profile.
20 When after powering up a role change is determined, i.e. the
   former access point determines that it now needs to operate as
   a station, this station retrieves the access point security
   credentials of the former station that now operates as an
   access point from its memory. Using these credentials, the
25 station is able to connect to the new access point.
   For a better understanding the invention shall now be explained
   in more detail in the following description with reference to
   the figures.     It is understood that the invention is not limited
30 to this exemplary embodiment and that specified features can
   also expediently be combined and/or modified without departing
   from the scope of the present invention as defined in the
   appended claims.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERED EMBODIMENTS
30 In the following a solution according to the invention for a
   credential recovery and auto-provisioning mechanism is
   described.

    WO 2014/090622                                       PCT/EP2013/075248
                                      9
   Considering Fig.     1 again, the scenario illustrated in this
   figure is the "factory default"      scenario. An end user has
   either received three devices that can be connected in every
   possible way, because they have been pre-paired, or the end
 5 user has    connected the devices in a random order and has
   correctly established the WLAN. For example, the WLAN may have
   been set up using the WPS-PBC method twice, i.e.        once for each
   station STA1,     STA2.
10 In Figs. 4 and 5 methods according to the invention for
   credential retrieval and auto-provisioning performed by an
   access point and a station, respectively, are schematically
   illustrated. Fig. 6 shows the data exchange performed for
   credential retrieval and auto-provisioning in more detail. Once
15 a link between the access point AP and a station STA1,          STA2 is
   established 10,     an application is  launched 11 that queries 12
   the access point credentials of the client STA1,        STA2 that has
   connected to the access point AP. Preferably, the application
   uses either layer 2, i.e.      the MAC-layer  (MAC: Media Access
20 Control),     or layer 3,  in the present example the IP-layer       (IP:
   Internet Protocol),      to communicate with the client STA1,      STA2.
   At least layer 2 communication must be supported, because in a
   pure bridged network the access point AP and station devices
   STA1,  STA2 do not need to receive an IP address. They need to
25 have an IP address for WPS to work, but it does not need to be
   assigned by DHCP      (DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
   The access point AP queries 12 the credentials from each
   connected station STA1,      STA2 and, after receiving 13    the
30 credentials, creates 14 station profiles, if such profiles are
   not yet available, and "broadcasts" 15 the credentials back
   into the network. Preferably, for the distribution of the
   credentials no real broadcast traffic will be used, as Wi-Fi
   does not guarantee reception of broadcast/multicast packets.

    WO 2014/090622                                     PCT/EP2013/075248
                                   10
   Instead, the application sends a broadcast frame, but the Wi-Fi
   MAC layer will convert it to a unicast frame that is directed
   to all stations STA1,   STA2 that are present in the connection
   list of the access point AP.
 5
   Each time a new station connects to the access point AP, the
   access point AP queries 12 the station for its security
   credentials. After receiving 20 a query the station must reply
   21 with a data frame containing a credential structure
10 containing the BSSID and the WPA-PSK value     (WPA-PSK: Wi-Fi
   Protected Access - Pre-shared key) or the WPA-key, should there
   be one. For this purpose a comma separated list is preferably
   used. The access point AP receiving 13 this info creates 14 a
   station profile containing the newly received information. An
15 example of such a profile is a TR-181 / TR98 "endpoint":

   Once the access point AP has at least two station profiles, it
   starts informing the WLAN of the existing security credentials.
20 The access point AP periodically sends 15 a profile, in a
   unicast data frame, to each associated device. In order to do
   that the access point AP is advantageously configured with two

   periodical inform parameters "InterProfilePeriod" and
   "ProfileBroadcastPeriod".    InterProfilePeriod controls the time
   in between the broadcast of two different profiles, e.g. two
   seconds.    ProfileBroadcastPeriod controls the time between two
 5 subsequent broadcast cycles,    e.g. one minute.
   Upon reception 22    of a STA profile each station STA1,   STA2
   compares 23 the information with the existing information in
   its own data model and decides to add 24 a profile or discard
10 25 the info.
   Once all nodes AP, STA1,    STA2 of the WLAN have each other's
   credentials stored in their respective data models an end user
   is safely allowed to disconnect the devices AP, STA1,      STA2 and
15 reconnect them in a random order. The auto role detection will
   guarantee that the access point AP remains connected to the
   gateway and that the WLAN can be set up as all nodes have the
   correct security credentials. A method for reconfiguring the
   network using the retrieved credentials is    illustrated in
20 Fig. 7. When a role change of the access pointe AP is
   determined 30,    the profile of the new access point AP(2)     is
   retrieved 31    from a memory. Using the credentials stored in
   this profile, the former access point, which no functions as a
   station, can connect 32    to the new access point AP(2).
