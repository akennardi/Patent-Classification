                             INDOOR UNIT OF AIR CONDITIONER
   This application claims priority from Japanese Application No. 2016-232896 filed on 30
 5 November 2016, the contents of which are to be taken as incorporated herein by this
   reference.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Field of the Invention
10           [0001]
             The present invention relates to an indoor unit of an air conditioner and a
   method of assembling an indoor unit of an air conditioner.
   Description of Related Art
15           [0002]
             In the related art, there is known an air conditioner on which an inlet panel that
   covers a suction port of an air-conditioning main body of an indoor unit so as to be
   openable and closable is mounted.        For example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent
   Application, First Publication No. 2008-267777, a structure, which automatically opens a
20 suction port during operation of an air conditioner by operating an inlet panel rotatably
   mounted on an air-conditioning main body by a link mechanism of a driving device of
   the air-conditioning main body with a lower portion of the air-conditioning main body as
   a fulcrum.
25                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   Technical Problem

                                                  2
             [0003]
             However, in the air conditioner of the related art, in which the inlet panel is
   mounted on the air-conditioning main body so as to be openable and closable, and is
   driven to open and close via the link mechanism, the inlet panel is assembled to the
 5 air-conditioning main body by connecting the inlet panel to the link mechanism which is
   provided in the air-conditioning main body in advance.       In this case, it is necessary to
   connect the link mechanism to the inlet panel in a gap between the inlet panel and the
   air-conditioning main body.     Particularly, if the gap between the inlet panel and the
   air-conditioning main body is narrowed, it is very difficult to perform the connecting
10 operation in the narrow gap, and there is a problem in workability during assembly.
             [0004]
             An object of the invention is to provide an indoor unit of an air conditioner and a
   method of assembling an indoor unit of an air conditioner capable of easily assembling
   an inlet panel, which covers a suction port so as to be openable and closable, to an
15 air-conditioning main body.
   Solution to Problem
             [0005]
             An indoor unit of an air conditioner of a first aspect of the invention includes an
   air-conditioning main body; an inlet base that is provided on a front surface of the
20 air-conditioning main body to form a suction port of air and is a member separated from
   the air-conditioning main body; an inlet panel that is provided on a front surface of the
   inlet base to cover the suction port; an opening and closing link mechanism that connects
   the inlet base and the inlet panel to each other to allow the suction port to be openable
   and closable by the inlet panel; a link case that is capable of attaching to the inlet base in
25 a state where the opening and closing link mechanism is accommodated in or attached to

                                                   3
   the link case, and the opening and closing link mechanism is connected to the inlet panel;
   and a driving mechanism that is provided in the air-conditioning main body to operate
   the link mechanism.
             [0006]
 5           According to such an indoor unit, the opening and closing link mechanism that
   is accommodated in or attached to the link case is connected to the inlet panel in advance,
   each link case in which the opening and closing link mechanism is accommodated or
   attached is attached to the inlet base, and then the inlet panel, the opening and closing
   link mechanism, and the inlet base can be integrally assembled to the air-conditioning
10 main body. Therefore, when the inlet panel is assembled to the air-conditioning main
   body, it is not necessary to connect the opening and closing link mechanism to the inlet
   panel.    Therefore, it is possible to easily assemble the inlet panel to the air-conditioning
   main body.
             [0007]
15           In addition, in the indoor unit according to a second aspect of the invention, in
   the first aspect, locking portions that lock and fix the link case and the inlet base to each
   other may be provided in the link case and the inlet base.      As described above, if the
   locking portions for locking the link case and the inlet base are provided, it is possible to
   easily attach and fix the link case to the inlet base, and to further easily perform an
20 operation of assembling the opening and closing link mechanism connected to the inlet
   panel, to the air-conditioning main body via the inlet base.
              [0008]
             In addition, in the indoor unit according to a third aspect of the invention, in the
   first aspect, the opening and closing link mechanism may include a slide rail that is
25 provided in the link case so as to extend in an upward and downward direction, a slider

                                                      4
   that is slidably mounted on the slide rail, an upper link that is connected to the inlet panel
   and the link case so as to rotate in the upward and downward direction, a lower link that
   is disposed below the upper link and is connected to the slider and the inlet panel so as to
   rotate in the upward and downward direction, and an intermediate link that is connected
 5 to the slider and an intermediate position of the upper link so as to rotate in the upward
   and downward direction.         The driving mechanism may be capable of moving the slider
   in the upward and downward direction.
              [0009]
              Such an opening and closing link mechanism is provided.            Therefore, when the
10 slider is first moved upward by the driving mechanism, the intermediate link is moved
   upward and a connecting position of the upper link and the inlet panel is moved upward.
   Therefore, it is possible to separate an upper portion of the inlet panel from the inlet base
   and the suction port while lifting the inlet panel.       At the same time, the lower link is
   moved upward by the slider, a lower portion of the inlet panel is pulled in a direction
15 close to the inlet base.     Therefore, it is possible to lift the inlet panel.
              [0010]
              In this case, the upper portion and the lower portion of the inlet panel
   appropriately adjust a position and a length of each link, or the like.         Therefore, it is
   possible to determine a lifting amount and a separating amount of the inlet panel with
20 respect to the inlet base.     It is possible to easily incline the inlet panel with respect to the
   inlet base and the air-conditioning main body by adjusting the position and the length of
   each link.     Therefore, it is possible to obliquely and largely open and close the suction
   port at the upper portion by a simple structure such as moving the slider up and down.
              [0011]
25            In addition, in the indoor unit according to a fourth aspect of the invention, in

                                                  5
   the first aspect, hook portions, which are always locked to each other so as to be
   displaceable, may be provided in the inlet base and the inlet panel.     As described above,
   if the inlet base and the inlet panel are always locked to each other so as to be
   displaceable at the hook portions, it is possible to support a load of the inlet panel on the
 5 inlet base via the hook portions.    Therefore, it is possible to reduce a load applied from
   the inlet panel to the opening and closing link mechanism, to easily and smoothly operate
   the inlet panel, and the durability can be easily ensured.    Furthermore, when the inlet
   panel to which the opening and closing link mechanism is connected is attached to the
   inlet base, it is possible to perform an attaching operation while positioning the inlet base
10 and the inlet panel by the hook portions, which leads to improvement of workability.
             [0012]
             In addition, in a method of assembling an indoor unit of an air conditioner
   according to any one of the first to fourth aspects, the method includes a connecting step
   of connecting the opening and closing link mechanism to the inlet panel; a link attaching
15 step of overlapping the inlet base and the inlet panel and thereby attaching the link case
   to the inlet base after the connecting step; and an assembling step of assembling the inlet
   base and the inlet panel to the air-conditioning main body after the link attaching step.
             [0013]
             In such a method of assembling the indoor unit, the opening and closing link
20 mechanism that is accommodated in the link case is connected to the inlet panel in
   advance, each link case in which the opening and closing link mechanism is
   accommodated or attached is attached to the inlet base, and then the inlet panel, the
   opening and closing link mechanism, and the inlet base can be integrally assembled to
   the air-conditioning main body.      Therefore, when the inlet panel is assembled to the
25 air-conditioning main body, it is not necessary to connect the opening and closing link

                                                   6
   mechanism.     Therefore, it is possible to easily assemble the inlet panel to the
   air-conditioning main body.

   lower link 42.    Both ends of the intermediate link 43 are respectively connected to a
   movable pivot portion 47b provided in the slider 38 and adjacent above the movable
 5 pivot portion 47a, and an intermediate pivot portion 49 provided at an intermediate
   position of the upper link 41 so as to rotate around the axis extending in the lateral
   direction D1.
             [0035]
            The driving mechanism 12 is provided on the air-conditioning main body 11
10 side and slidably moves the slider 38 with respect to the slide rail 34.     The driving
   mechanism 12 includes a pinion gear 52 provided so as to mesh with the rack gear 51 of
   the slider 38 and a driving source such as a motor (not shown) that drives the pinion gear
   52 to rotate.
             [0036]
15          As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, in the opening and closing link mechanism 24, as
   the pinion gear 52 is rotated by the driving mechanism 12, the slider 38 is slidably moved
   upward with respect to the link case 23 and pushes up the intermediate link 43.        Then,
   in the upper pivot portion 46, the upper link 41 lifts the upper portion of the inlet panel
   22 while rotating with respect to the inlet panel 22 and separates the inlet panel 22
20 forward from the suction port 17.
             [0037]
            At the same time, the lower link 42 is also moved upward by the movement of
   the slider 38 upward.    In this case, the inlet panel 22 lifts while the lower portion of the
   inlet panel 22 is pulled in a direction closing the inlet base 21.    Therefore, the suction
25 port 17 of the air-conditioning main body 11 is in the open state.

                                                  13
             [0038]
             On the other hand, as the pinion gear 52 is rotated in the reverse direction and
   the slider 38 is moved downward, the suction port 17 of the air-conditioning main body
   11 is in the closed state by operating each of the links 41, 42, and 43, and moving the
 5 inlet panel 22 in a direction opposite to the above description.     In the closed state, each
   of the links 41, 42, and 43 is disposed to extend in the upward and downward direction
   D3 and is completely accommodated in the groove 33 of the link case 23.
             [0039]
             Here, it is possible to appropriately set a lifting amount and an inclination angle
10 of the inlet panel 22 with respect to the inlet base 21 by appropriately setting a moving
   amount of the slider 38 and the position and the length of each of the links 41, 42, and 43,
   and the like.
             [0040]
             A method of assembling the indoor unit 10 by assembling the inlet opening and
15 closing mechanism 20 to the air-conditioning main body 11 which is preliminarily
   manufactured will be described with reference to FIGS. 6 to 10.        First an opening and
   closing link assembling step SI is executed.      In the opening and closing link assembling
   step Sl, as shown in FIG. 6, one end side of the lower link 42 and the intermediate link
   43 is connected to the movable pivot portions 47a and 47b of the slider 38.        Thereafter,
20 the slider 38 is mounted on the slide rail 34 of the link case 23, and the intermediate link
   43 and the lower link 42 are inserted into the bottom portion of the groove 33 of the link
   case 23 so as to be disposed to extend to the opening side of the groove 33.
             [0041]
             As shown in FIG. 7, one end side of the upper link 41 is connected to the fixed
25 pivot portion 44 of the link case 23.    In addition, the other end side of the intermediate

                                                  14
   link 43 connected to the slider 38 is connected to the intermediate pivot portion 49 of the
   upper link 41.
             [0042]
             Thereafter, a connecting step S2 is executed.     That is, as shown in FIG. 8, the
 5 upper link 41 and the lower link 42 connected to the link case 23 or the slider 38 are
   respectively connected to the upper pivot portion 46 and the lower pivot portion 48 of the
   inlet panel 22.    As described above, first, the opening and closing link mechanism 24
   which is accommodated in or attached to the link case 23 is connected to the inlet panel
   22 so as to rotate.
10           [0043]
             Thereafter, a link attaching step S3 is executed.   That is, as shown in FIG. 9, the
   inlet base 21 and the inlet panel 22 are overlapped, the hooking hook 32 of the inlet panel
   22 is inserted into the hook receiving portion 31 of the inlet base 21 to be positioned, and
   the link case 23 is inserted into the attaching hole 27 of the inlet base 21.   The flange 36
15 of the link case 23 abuts against the surface of the inlet base 21.     Furthermore, the link
   case 23 is attached and fixed to the inlet base 21 by locking the locking claw 28 provided
   in the attaching hole 27 to the locking hole 37 of the link case 23.
             [0044]
             Finally, an assembling step S4 is executed.    That is, in a state where the inlet
20 panel 22 and the inlet base 21 connected by the opening and closing link mechanism 24
   and the link case 23 are overlapped, the inlet base 21 is connected to the air-conditioning
   main body 11 by the hinge portion 29, and the pinion gear 52 is meshed with the rack
   gear 51 to assemble the inlet base 21 to the air-conditioning main body 11.
             [0045]
25           According to the indoor unit 10 and the method of assembling thereof of the

                                                    15
   embodiment described above, the opening and closing link mechanism 24, which is
   accommodated in or attached to the link case 23, is connected to the inlet panel 22 in
   advance and the opening and closing link mechanism 24 can be attached to the inlet base
   21 together with the link case 23.      In addition, thereafter, the inlet panel 22, the opening
 5 and closing link mechanism 24, and the inlet base 21 can be integrally assembled to the
   air-conditioning main body 11.
             [0046]
             Therefore, when the inlet panel 22 is assembled to the air-conditioning main
   body 11, an operation of connecting the opening and closing link mechanism 24 may not
10 be performed.     That is, it is not necessary to perform an operation such as inserting a
   tool or the hand into a narrow gap between the inlet panel 22 and the air-conditioning
   main body 11 to connect the opening and closing link mechanism 24 to the inlet panel 22.
   Therefore, the inlet panel 22 that covers the suction port 17 so as to be openable and
   closable can be easily assembled to the air-conditioning main body 11, which leads to an
15 improvement of workability.
             [0047]
             In addition, in the indoor unit 10 of the embodiment, the locking claw 28 and the
   locking hole 37 for locking the link case 23 and the inlet base 21 are provided.
   Therefore, it is possible to easily attach and fix the link case 23 to the inlet base 21 and it
20 is possible to further easily assemble the opening and closing link mechanism 24 to the
   air-conditioning main body 11 via the inlet base 21.
             [0048]
             In addition, in the embodiment, a driving force from the driving mechanism 12
   is transmitted to the inlet panel 22 by the upper link 41, the intermediate link 43, and the
25 lower link 42 via the slider 38 having the rack gear 51 mounted on the slide rail 34.

                                                  16
            [0049]
            Therefore, the intermediate link 43 and the upper link 41 are rotated by moving
   the slider 38 upward and thereby the upper portion of the inlet panel 22 can be separated
   from the suction port 17 to the outside to be lifted.    In this case, the lower portion of the
 5 inlet panel 22 is not largely separated from the air-conditioning main body 11 by the
   lower link 42.    Therefore, in a state where only the upper portion of the inlet panel 22 is
   separated from the air-conditioning main body 11 and is inclined with respect to the
   air-conditioning main body 11, it is possible to obliquely and largely open and close the
   suction port 17 of the air-conditioning main body 11 at the upper portion.
10           [0050]
            In the indoor unit 10 of the embodiment, the inlet base 21 and the inlet panel 22
   are always locked to each other by the hook receiving portion 31 and the hooking hook
   32 so as to be displaceable.    Therefore, it is possible to support the load of the inlet
   panel 22 by the inlet base 21 via the hook receiving portion 31 and the hooking hook 32.
15 Therefore, a burden of the load from the inlet panel 22 to the opening and closing link
   mechanism 24 can be reduced, the inlet panel 22 can be smoothly and easily operated,
   and the durability of the link mechanism 24 can be easily secured.
            [0051]
            Furthermore, when the opening and closing link mechanism 24 and the link case
20 23 which are connected to the inlet panel 22 in advance are attached to the inlet base 21,
   the hook receiving portion 31 and the hooking hook 32 can play a role of positioning.
   Therefore, the assembly of the indoor unit 10 can be further facilitated.
            [0052]
            Above, although the embodiment of the invention is described in detail above, it
25 is possible to make some design changes within a range not departing from the technical

                                                  17
   idea of the invention.    For example, in the embodiment, the configuration of the
   opening and closing link mechanism 24 may use another link mechanism as long as the
   operation capable of opening and closing the suction port 17 by the inlet panel 22 is
   obtained by the inlet panel 22.     For example, although the slider 38 is driven by the rack
 5 gear 51 and the pinion gear 52, if the slider 38 can slide along the slide rail 34, the slider
   38 may be driven by another driving mechanism.          In addition, instead of the mechanism
   of the rack and pinion, a mechanism having a cylinder may be used.
             [0053]
             In addition, the inlet panel 22 is not limited to covering the entire front surface
10 of the air-conditioning main body 11 and may be provided at another position such as the
   upper surface.    Furthermore, the opening and closing direction of the inlet panel 22 is
   not limited to the above-described case and the opening and closing direction may be set
   according to the shape and the position of the suction port 17.
             [0054]
15           In the above description, the inlet base 21 and the inlet panel 22 have the same
   contour as the front surface of the air-conditioning main body 11, but may have a shape
   different from the front surface of the air-conditioning main body 11.
             [0055]
             In addition, contrary to the above case, the hook receiving portion 31 may be
20 provided in the inlet panel 22 and the hooking hook 32 may be provided in the inlet base
   21.
             While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described and shown
   above, it should be understood that these are exemplary of the invention and are not to be
   considered as limiting.     Additions, omissions, substitutions, and other modifications can
25 be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.

                                                18
   Accordingly, the invention is not to be considered as being limited by the foregoing
   description, and is only limited by the scope of the appended claims.
