2014250034, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                                         FIELD
       [002]              The invention relates to materials used in medical implants. More
particularly, the invention relates to a biocompatible material suitable for use in high
cycle flexural applications including artificial heart valves.
                                                      BACKGROUND
       [003]              Artificial heart valves preferably should last at least ten years in vivo. To
last that long, artificial heart valves should exhibit sufficient durability for at least four
hundred million cycles or more. The valves, and more specifically heart valve leaflets,
must resist structural degradation including the formation of holes, tears, and the like as
well as adverse biological consequences including calcification and thrombosis.
       [004]              A variety of polymeric materials has previously been employed as
prosthetic heart valve leaflets. Failure of these leaflets due to stiffening and hole
formation occurred within two years of implant. Efforts to improve leaflet durability by
thickening the leaflets resulted in unacceptable hemodynamic performance of the
valves, that is, the pressure drop across the open valve was too high.
       [005]              As such, it remains desirable to provide a biocompatible artificial heart
valve design that lasts beyond ten years in vivo by exhibiting sufficient durability for at
least about four hundred million cycles of flexure or more.

                                              DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        [0055]             References will now be made to embodiments illustrated in the drawings
and specific language which will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be
understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such
alterations and further modifications in the illustrated methods and apparatus, as such
further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein as being
contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention
relates.
        [0056]             Definitions for some terms used herein are provided below in the
Appendix.
        [0057]             The present disclosure addresses a long-felt need for a material that
meets the durability and biocompatibility requirements of high-cycle flexural implant
applications, such as heart valve leaflets. It has been observed that heart valve leaflets
formed from porous fluoropolymer materials or, more particularly, from ePTFE
containing no elastomer suffer from stiffening in high-cycle flex testing and animal
implantation.
        [0058]             In one embodiment, described in greater detail below, the flexural
durability of porous polymer heart valve leaflets was significantly increased by adding a
relatively high-percentage of relatively lower strength elastomer to the pores. Optionally,
additional layers of the elastomer may be added between the composite layers.
Surprisingly, in embodiments wherein porous polymer membranes are imbibed with
elastomer the presence of the elastomer increased overall thickness of the leaflet, the
resulting increased thickness of the polymer members due to the addition of the
elastomer did not hinder or diminish flexural durability. Further, after reaching a
minimum percent by weight of elastomer, it was found that fluoropolymer members
performed better with increasing percentages of elastomer resulting in significantly
                                                           8

increased cycle lives exceeding 40 million cycles in vitro, as well as by showing no signs
of calcification under certain controlled laboratory conditions.
        [0059]             A material according to one embodiment includes a composite material
comprising an expanded fluoropolymer membrane and an elastomeric material. It
should be readily appreciated that multiple types of fluoropolymer membranes and
multiple types of elastomeric materials can be combined while within the spirit of the
present invention. It should also be readily appreciated that the elastomeric material
can include multiple elastomers, multiple types of non-elastomeric components, such as
inorganic fillers, therapeutic agents, radiopaque markers, and the like while within the
spirit of the present invention.
        [0060]             In some embodiments, the composite material includes an expanded
fluoropolymer material made from porous ePTFE membrane, for instance as generally
described in U.S. Patent No. 7,306,729. In some other embodiments, the composite
material includes a polyethylene material made from porous polyethylene membrane.
        [0061]             The expandable fluoropolymer, used to form the expanded fluoropolymer
material described in embodiments, may comprise PTFE homopolymer. In alternative
embodiments, blends of PTFE, expandable modified PTFE and/or expanded
copolymers of PTFE may be used. Non-limiting examples of suitable fluoropolymer
materials are described in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,708,044, to Branca, U.S.
Patent No. 6,541,589, to Baillie, U.S. Patent No. 7,531,611, to Sabol et al., U.S. Patent
Application No. 11/906,877, to Ford, and U.S. Patent Application No. 12/410,050, to Xu
et al.
        [0062]             The expanded fluoropolymer in accordance with some embodiments, may
comprise any suitable microstructure for achieving the desired leaflet performance. In
one embodiment, the expanded fluoropolymer may comprise a microstructure of nodes
interconnected by fibrils, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,953,566 to Gore. In
one embodiment, the microstructure of an expanded fluoropolymer membrane
comprises nodes interconnected by fibrils as shown in the scanning electron micrograph
image in Figure 7A. The fibrils extend from the nodes in a plurality of directions, and the
membrane has a generally homogeneous structure. Membranes having this
microstructure may exhibit a ratio of matrix tensile strength in two orthogonal directions
of less than about 2, and possibly less than about 1.5.

   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

        [0063]             In another embodiment, the expanded fluoropolymer may have a
microstructure of substantially only fibrils, such as, for example, depicted in Figure 7B
and 7C, as is generally taught by U.S. Patent No. 7,306,729, to Bacino. Figure 7C is a
higher magnification of the expanded fluoropolymer membrane shown in Figure 7B, and
more clearly shows the homogeneous microstructure having substantially only fibrils.
The expanded fluoropolymer membrane having substantially only fibrils as depicted in
Figures 7B and 7C, may possess a high surface area, such as greater than about
20m 2/g, or greater than about 25m 2/g, and in some embodiments may provide a highly
balanced strength material having a product of matrix tensile strengths in two orthogonal
directions of at least 1.5 x 105 MPa 2, and/or a ratio of matrix tensile strengths in two
orthogonal directions of less than about 2, and possibly less than about 1.5. It is
anticipated that expanded fluoropolymer membrane may have a mean flow pore sizes of
less than about 5 pm, less than about 1 pm, and less than about 0.10 pm, in
accordance with embodiments.
        [0064]             The expanded fluoropolymer in accordance with some embodiments may
be tailored to have any suitable thickness and mass to achieve the desired leaflet
performance. In some cases, it may be desirable to use a very thin expanded
fluoropolymer membrane having a thickness less than about 1.0 pm. In other
embodiments, it may be desirable to use an expanded fluoropolymer membrane having
a thickness greater than about 0.1 pm and less than about 20 pm. The expanded
fluoropolymer membranes can possess a specific mass less than about 1g/m 2 to greater
than about 50g/m 2.
        [0065]             Membranes comprising expanded fluoropolymer according to an
embodiment can have matrix tensile strengths ranging from about 50 MPa to about 400
MPa or greater, based on a density of about 2.2 g/cm 3 for PTFE.
        [0066]             Additional materials may be incorporated into the pores or within the
material of the membranes or in between the layers of the membranes to enhance
desired properties of the leaflet. Composites according to one embodiment can include
fluoropolymer membranes having thicknesses ranging from about 500 pm to less than
about 0.3 pm.
        [0067]             Embodiments of expanded fluoropolymer membrane combined with
elastomer provides performance attributes required for use in high-cycle flexural implant
applications, such as heart valve leaflets, in at least several significant ways. For
                                                         10

example, the addition of the elastomer improves the fatigue performance of the leaflet
by eliminating or reducing the stiffening observed with ePTFE-only materials. In
addition, it reduces the likelihood that the material will undergo permanent set
deformation, such as wrinkling or creasing, that could result in compromised
performance. In one embodiment, the elastomer occupies substantially all of the pore
volume or space within the porous structure of the expanded fluoropolymer membrane.
In another embodiment the elastomer is present in substantially all of the pores of the at
least one fluoropolymer layer. Having elastomer filling the pore volume or present in
substantially all of the pores reduces the space in which foreign materials can be
undesirably incorporated into the composite. An example of such foreign material is
calcium. If calcium becomes incorporated into the composite material, as used in a
heart valve leaflet, for example, mechanical damage can occur during cycling, thus
leading to the formation of holes in the leaflet and degradation in hemodynamics.
        [0068]             In one embodiment, the elastomer that is combined with the ePTFE is a
thermoplastic copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and perfluoromethyl vinyl ether
(PMVE), such as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,462,675. As discussed above, the
elastomer is combined with the expanded fluoropolymer membrane such that the
elastomer occupies substantially all of the void space or pores within the expanded
fluoropolymer membrane. This filling of the pores of the expanded fluoropolymer
membrane with elastomer can be performed by a variety of methods. In one
embodiment, a method of filling the pores of the expanded fluoropolymer membrane
includes the steps of dissolving the elastomer in a solvent suitable to create a solution
with a viscosity and surface tension that is appropriate to partially or fully flow into the
pores of the expanded fluoropolymer membrane and allow the solvent to evaporate,
leaving the filler behind.
        [0069]             In another embodiment, a method of filling the pores of the expanded
fluoropolymer membrane includes the steps of delivering the filler via a dispersion to
partially or fully fill the pores of the expanded fluoropolymer membrane;
        [0070]             In another embodiment, a method of filling the pores of the expanded
fluoropolymer membrane includes the steps of bringing the porous expanded
fluoropolymer membrane into contact with a sheet of the elastomer under conditions of
heat and/or pressure that allow elastomer to flow into the pores of the expanded
fluoropolymer membrane.
                                                        11
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

        [0071]             In another embodiment, a method of filling the pores of the expanded
fluoropolymer membrane includes the steps of polymerizing the elastomer within the
pores of the expanded fluoropolymer membrane by first filling the pores with a
prepolymer of the elastomer and then at least partially curing the elastomer.
        [0072]             After reaching a minimum percent by weight of elastomer, the leaflets
constructed from fluoropolymer materials or ePTFE generally performed better with
increasing percentages of elastomer resulting in significantly increased cycle lives. In
one embodiment, the elastomer combined with the ePTFE is a thermoplastic copolymer
of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoromethyl vinyl ether, such as described in U.S. Patent
No. 7,462,675, and other references that would be known to those of skill in the art. For
instance, in another embodiment shown in Example 1, a leaflet was formed from a
composite of 53% by weight of elastomer to ePTFE and was subjected to cycle testing.
Some stiffening was observed by around 200 million test cycles, though with only
modest effect on hydrodynamics. When the weight percent of elastomer was raised to
about 83% by weight, as in the embodiment of Example 2, no stiffening or negative
changes in hydrodynamics were observed at about 200 million cycles. In contrast, with
non-composite leaflets, i.e. all ePTFE with no elastomer, as in the Comparative
Example B, severe stiffening was apparent by 40 million test cycles. As demonstrated
by these examples, the durability of porous fluoropolymer members can be significantly
increased by adding a relatively high-percentage of relatively lower strength elastomer
to the pores of the fluoropolymer members. The high material strength of the
fluoropolymer membranes also permits specific configurations to be very thin.
        [0073]             Other biocompatible polymers which may be suitable for use may include,
but not be limited to, the groups of urethanes, silicones (organopolysiloxanes),
copolymers of silicon-urethane, styrene/isobutylene copolymers, polyisobutylene,
polyethylene-co-poly (vinyl acetate), polyester copolymers, nylon copolymers,
fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers and copolymers or mixtures of each of the foregoing.
        [0074]             In addition to expanded fluoropolymer, other biocompatible synthetic
polymers may be suitable for use as a porous membrane. As provided below,
embodiments comprising microporous polyethylene are provided as a biocompatible
polymer suitable for the particular purpose.
        [0075]             An embodiment of a microporous polyethylene membrane includes a
sheet of material comprising substantially all fibers having a diameter of less than about

1 pm. In another embodiment of a microporous polyethylene membrane includes a
sheet of non-woven material comprising substantially all fibers having a diameter of less
than about 1 pm. In some cases, it may be desirable to use a very thin microporous
polyethylene membrane having a thickness less than about 10.0 pm. In other
embodiments, it may be desirable to use a microporous polyethylene membrane having
a thickness less than about 0.6 pm.
        [0076]             It is appreciated that the structure of the microporous membranes
disclosed in embodiments provided herein, may be differentiated from other structures
such as fabrics, knits and fiber windings, by looking at the specific surface area of the
material. Embodiments of microporous membranes provided herein have a specific
surface area of greater than about 4.0 m2 /cc. In accordance with other embodiments of
microporous membranes provided herein have a specific surface area of greater than
about 10.0 m2 /cc. The embodiments provided herein appreciate that a membrane
having a specific surface area of greater than about 4.0 to more than about 60 m2 /cc
provide a significant improvement to, at least, but not limited to, the durability and
lifetime of the heart valve when used as leaflet material.
        [0077]             It is appreciated that microporous membranes disclosed in embodiments
provided herein may alternatively be differentiated from other structures such as fabrics,
knits and fiber windings, by looking at the fiber diameter of the material. Embodiments
of microporous membranes provided herein contain a majority of fibers having a
diameter that is less than about 1 pm. Other embodiments of microporous membranes
provided herein contain a majority of fibers having a diameter that is less than about 0.1
pm. The embodiments provided herein recognize that a membrane comprising fibers
the majority of which are less than about 1 to beyond less than about 0.1 pm provide a
significant improvement to, at least, but not limited to, the durability and lifetime of the
heart valve when used as leaflet material.
        [0078]             The microporous polymer membranes of embodiments may comprise any
suitable microstructure and polymer for achieving the desired leaflet performance. In
some embodiments, the microporous polymer membrane is porous polyethylene that
has a microstructure of substantially only fibers, such as, for example, depicted in Figure
30A and 30B for the material included in Example 4 and Figure 31A and 31 B for the
material included in Example 5. Figure 30 shows a substantially homogeneous
microstructure of the porous polyethylene membrane having substantially only fibers
                                                            13

having a diameter of less than about 1 pm. The porous polyethylene membrane had a
thickness of 0.010 mm, a porosity of 31.7%, a mass/area of 6.42 g/m2 , and a specific
surface area of 28. 7m 2 /cc.
        [0079]             Figure 31A and 31B, a surface and cross-sectional view, respectively, is
the same porous polyethylene membrane shown in Figure 30A and 30B, a surface and
cross-sectional view, respectively, that has been stretched in accordance with a process
described below for Example 5. The stretched polyethylene membrane retains a
substantially homogeneous microstructure having substantially only fibers having a
diameter of less than about 1 pm. The stretched polyethylene membrane had a
thickness of 0.006 mm, a porosity of 44.3%, a mass/area of 3.14 g/m2 , and a specific
surface area of 18.3m 2 /cc. It is anticipated that microporous polyethylene membrane
may have a mean flow pore sizes of less than about 5 pm, less than about 1 pm, and
less than about 0.10 pm, in accordance with embodiments.
        [0080]             The following non-limiting examples are provided to further illustrate
various embodiments.
Example 1
        [0081]             In accordance with an embodiment, heart valve leaflets were formed from
a composite material having an expanded fluoropolymer membrane and an elastomeric
material and joined to a metallic balloon expandable stent, as described by the following
embodiment of a process:
        [0082]             A thick, sacrificial tooling cushion pad or layer was formed by folding a
ePTFE layer over upon itself to create a total of four layers. The ePTFE layer was about
5 cm (2") wide, about 0.5mm (0.02") thick and had a high degree of compressibility,
forming a cushion pad. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the cushion pad 200 was then
stretched (Figure 2) onto a leaflet tool, generally indicated at 100. The leaflet tool 100
has a leaflet portion 102, a body portion 104 and a bottom end 106. The leaflet portion
102 of the leaflet tool 100 has an end surface 103 that is generally arcuate, convex
shape. The cushion pad 200 was stretched and smoothed over the end surface 103 of
the leaflet portion 102 of the leaflet tool 100 by forcing the leaflet tool 100 in the direction
depicted by the arrow (Figure 2A). A peripheral edge 202 of the cushion pad 200 was
stretched over the bottom end 106 of the leaflet tool 100 and twisted to hold the cushion
pad 200 in place (Figure 2B).
                                                             14
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

       [0083]             Referring to Figure 2B, a release layer 204 was then stretched over the
leaflet portion 102 of the leaflet tool 100 which in the previous step was covered with the
cushion pad 200. In one embodiment, the release layer 204 was made from a
substantially nonporous ePTFE having a layer of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP)
disposed along an outer surface or side thereof. The release layer 204 was stretched
over the leaflet tool 100 such that the FEP layer faced toward the cushion pad 200 and
the substantially nonporous ePTFE faced outwardly or away from the cushion pad 200.
The release layer was about 25 pm thick and of sufficient length and width to allow the
release layer 204 to be pulled over the bottom end 106 of the leaflet tool 100. As with
the cushion pad 200 in the previous step, a peripheral edge 206 of the release layer 204
was pulled toward the bottom end 106 of the leaflet tool 100 and then twisted onto the
bottom end 106 of the leaflet tool 100 to retain or hold the release layer 204 in place.
The FEP layer of the release layer 204 was then spot-melted and thereby fixedly
secured to the cushion pad 200, as required, by the use of a hot soldering iron.
       [0084]             The processes of Steps 1) and 2) were repeated to prepare three separate
leaflet tools, each having a cushion pad covered by a release layer.
       [0085]             A leaflet material according to one embodiment was formed from a
composite material comprising a membrane of ePTFE imbibed with a fluoroelastomer. A
piece of the composite material approximately 10 cm wide was wrapped onto a circular
mandrel to form a tube. The composite material was comprised of three layers: two
outer layers of ePTFE and an inner layer of a fluoroelastomer disposed therebetween.
The ePTFE membrane was manufactured according to the general teachings described
in U.S. Patent No. 7,306,729. The fluoroelastomer was formulated according to the
general teachings described in U.S. Patent No. 7,462,675. Additional fluoroelastomers
may be suitable and are described in U.S. Publication No. 2004/0024448.
       [0086]             The ePTFE membrane had the following properties: thickness = about 15
pm; MTS in the highest strength direction = about 400 MPa; MTS strength in the
orthogonal direction = about 250 MPa; Density = about 0.34 g/cm 3 ; IBP = about 660
KPa.
       [0087]             The copolymer consists essentially of between about 65 and 70 weight
percent perfluoromethyl vinyl ether and complementally about 35 and 30 weight percent
tetrafluoroethylene.
                                                          15
  10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

        [0088]             The percent weight of the fluoroelastomer relative to the ePTFE was about
53%.
        [0089]             The multi-layered composite had the following properties: thickness of
about 40 pm; density of about 1.2 g/cm 3; force to break/width in the highest strength
direction = about 0.953 kg/cm; tensile strength in the highest strength direction = about
23.5 MPa (3,400 psi); force to break/width in the orthogonal direction = about 0.87
kg/cm; tensile strength in the orthogonal direction = about 21.4 MPa (3100 psi), IPA
bubble point greater than about 12.3 MPa, Gurley Number greater than about 1,800
seconds, and mass/area = about 14 g/m2 .
        [0090]             The following test methods were used to characterize the ePTFE layers
and the multi-layered composite.
        [0091]             The thickness was measured with a Mutitoyo Snap Gage Absolute, 12.7
mm (0.50") diameter foot, Model ID-C112E, Serial # 10299, made in Japan. The density
was determined by a weight/volume calculation using an Analytical Balance Mettler
PM400 New Jersey, USA. The force to break and tensile strengths were measured
using an Instron Model #5500R Norwood, MA, load cell 50 kg, gage length = 25.4 cm,
crosshead speed = 25 mm/minute (strain rate = 100% per minute) with flat faced jaws.
The IPA Bubble Point was measured by an IPA bubble point tester, Pressure Regulator
Industrial Data Systems Model LG-APOK, Salt Lake City, UT, USA, with a Ramp Rate
of 1.38 KPa/s (0.2 psi/s), 3.14 cm2 test area. The Gurley Number was determined as the
time in seconds for 100 cm3 of air to flow through a 6.45 cm2 sample at 124 mm of water
pressure using a Gurley Tester, Model #4110, Troy, NY, USA.
        [0092]             Unless otherwise noted, these test methods were used to generate the
data in subsequent examples.
        [0093]             Layers of the composite material, each having two outer layers of ePTFE
and an inner layer of a fluoroelastomer disposed therebetween, was wrapped onto a
mandrel having a diameter of about 28 mm (1.1") such that the higher strength direction
of the membrane was oriented in the axial direction of the mandrel. In one embodiment,
four layers of the composite material were wrapped in a non-helical, generally
circumferential fashion onto the mandrel. The composite material had a slight degree of
tackiness that allowed the material to adhere to itself. While still on the mandrel, the
composite material was slit longitudinally generally along the mandrel long axis to form a
sheet about 10 cm (4") by about 90 mm (3.5").
                                                          16
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

        [0094]             The resulting sheet of leaflet material (or composite material from Step 4)
was then cut and wrapped onto the leaflet tool 100 having a cushion pad 200 covered
by a release layer 204. More specifically, as shown in Figures 3A - 3C, the leaflet
material 300 was placed onto a flat cutting surface. The leaflet tool 100 with the cushion
pad 200 and release layer 204 was then aligned onto the leaflet material 300
approximately as shown. Four slits 302, 304, 306, 308 were then formed in the leaflet
material 300 with a razor blade. One pair of slits 302, 304 extends from one side of the
leaflet tool 100 and terminates at one edge 300a of the leaflet material 300, and the
other pair of slits 306, 308 extends from an opposite side of the leaflet tool 100 and
terminates at an opposite edge 300b of the leaflet material 300. The slits 302, 304, 306,
308 were spaced apart from the leaflet portion 102 of the leaflet tool 100. The slits 302,
304, 306, 308 did not protrude under the leaflet tool 100. It should be appreciated that
the widths of the individual slits are shown not to scale. The slits 302, 304, 306, 308 in
the leaflet material 300 resulted in the formation of a folding portion 310, a pair of straps
312, 314 and excess material of leaflet material 315. The folding portions 310 were then
folded in the general direction indicated by the arrows 316 in Figure 3C and smoothed
over the leaflet tool 100, which was covered by the cushion pad 200 and the release
layer 204 in the previous steps.
        [0095]             The leaflet material 315 was then stretched and smoothed over the leaflet
portion 102, particularly the end surface 103 of the leaflet tool 100. The Steps 4) and 5)
were repeated to form three separate leaflet assemblies. The three leaflet assemblies
402, 404, 406 were then clamped together to form a tri-leaflet assembly 400, as shown
in Figure 4. Shown are the three separate leaflet assemblies 402, 404, 406, each having
an excess material of leaflet material 315 extending generally radially beyond the
periphery of the tri-leaflet assembly 400.
        [0096]             A base tool was then provided having cavities for engaging the end
surfaces of the leaflet tools of the tri-leaflet assembly and trimming the excess leaflet
area to form three leaflets. Referring to Figure 5A, the base tool is generally indicated at
500 and extends longitudinally between an end 501 and an opposite bottom end 503.
Three concave cavities 502, 504, 506 are formed in the end 501 of the base tool 500.
Each concave cavity 502, 504, 506 is formed to match fit or nestingly seat the end
surface 103 of one of the three leaflet assemblies 402, 404, 406. Three radially
extending elements 508, 510, 512 extend outwardly from the end of the base tool 500.
                                                           17
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

Each element 508, 510, 512 is disposed between an adjacent pair of concave cavities
502, 504, 506.
        [0097]             The base tool 500 was then prepared having a compression pad and a
release layer (not shown) similar to how the leaflet tool was prepared in Steps 1 and 2.
As described for each leaflet tool in Steps 1 and 2, the compression pad and the release
layer were similarly stretched and affixed to the base tool 500 to form a base tool
assembly.
        [0098]             Referring to Figure 5B, the base tool assembly (illustrated for convenience
as the base tool 500 without showing the cushion pad and the release layer) and the tri
leaflet assembly, generally indicated at 400, were then generally axially aligned together
so that the end surface (not shown) of each leaflet tool 100 was seated into one of the
concave cavities (not shown) in the end 501 of the base tool, generally indicated at 500,
to form a combined tool assembly.
        [0099]             A metallic balloon expandable stent was then fabricated. A tube of 316
stainless steel having a wall thickness of about 0.5mm (0.020") and a diameter of about
2.5cm (1.0") was laser cut. A pattern was cut into the tube to form an annular-shaped
cut stent frame or support structure, which is generally indicated at 600 and shown
illustratively in a flat, plane view in Figure 6a. The support structure 600, includes a
plurality of small closed cells 602, a plurality of large closed cells 604, and a plurality of
leaflet closed cells 606. Note that one of the plurality of leaflet closed cells 606 appears
as an open cell in Figure 6A due to the flat plane view. The small closed cells 602, large
closed cells 604, and leaflet closed cells 606 are generally arranged along rows forming
the annular shape of the support structure 600.
        [00100] Polymeric materials were then adhered to the laser cut stent frame. First, a
sacrificial compression layer of ePTFE membrane was wrapped without overlap onto a
mandrel (not shown) having a diameter of about 2.5 cm (1.0"). The sacrificial
compression layer of ePTFE membrane had a thickness of about 0.5 mm (0.02") and a
width of about 10 cm (4"), and was compliant and compressible to provide a soft,
sacrificial compression layer.
        [00101] Four layers of a substantially nonporous, ePTFE film were then wrapped
onto the mandrel on top of the compression layer membrane. The substantially
nonporous, ePTFE film had a thickness of about 25 pm (0.001"), was about 10 cm (4")
wide and had a layer of FEP on one side. The substantially nonporous, ePTFE film was
                                                          18
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

wrapped with the FEP facing away from the mandrel. The substantially nonporous,
ePTFE film had the properties of the release layer previously described in Step 2).
        [00102] A thin film of type 1 (ASTM D3368) FEP was constructed using melt
extrusion and stretching. An additional 10 layers of this type 1 (ASTM D3368) FEP film
was added to the mandrel, which was previously wrapped in the compression layer
membrane in Step 10 and the four layers of substantially nonporous, ePTFE film in Step
11. The type 1 (ASTM D3368) FEP film was about 40 pm (0.0016") thick and was about
7.7 cm (3") wide.
        [00103] The wrapped mandrel was then heat treated in an air convection oven at
about 320 0C for about 5 minutes and allowed to cool.
        [00104] The support structure (indicated at 600 in Figure 6A) was then placed onto
the heat treated and wrapped mandrel. Two additional layers of type 1 (ASTM D3368)
FEP film (provided in Step 12) were then wrapped onto the support structure, which was
previously placed on the wrapped mandrel.
        [00105] The wrapped mandrel and the support structure supported thereon were
then heat treated in an air convection oven at about 320 0C for about 10 minutes and
allowed to cool, forming a polymeric-coated support structure.
        [00106] The polymeric-coated support structure was then trimmed with a scalpel to
form a trimmed stent frame, which is generally indicated at 700 and shown illustratively
in a flat, plane view in Figure 6B. More specifically, in one manner, the polymeric
coating was trimmed about 2 mm (0.08") past the edges of the support structure (600,
Figure 6A) to form a variety of edge profiles 708. In another manner, the polymeric
coating was allowed to span entire cells to form a web in each cell. In either case, the
support structure 600 was fully encapsulated within a polymeric coating 702 to form the
trimmed stent frame 700. The trimmed stent frame 700 includes a plurality of leaflet
openings 704 corresponding in number and generally in shape to the plurality of leaflet
closed cells 606 (Figure 6A). Further, a slit 706 is formed in the polymeric coating 702
of each of the small closed cells as shown in Figure 6B. Specifically, each slit 706 is
linear and generally parallel to a longitudinal center axis (not shown) of the annular
shaped support structure 600.
        [00107] The trimmed stent frame was then placed onto the combined tool
assembly from Step 8. The leaflet portions (102) of the leaflet tools were aligned to the
leaflet openings (704 in Figure 6B) in the trimmed stent frame. The three excess leaflet
                                               19
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

material areas (315 in Figure 4) were pulled through the leaflet openings of the stent
frame. Each of the three pairs of straps (312, 314 in Figure 3A) was pulled through one
of the slits (706 in Figure 6B) and wrapped around the trimmed stent frame. Each pair
of straps were wrapped in opposing directions relative to each other. The six straps
were then heat tacked to the trimmed stent frame using a hot soldering iron.
        [00108] The combined tool assembly (Step 8) and the trimmed stent frame having
the wrapped and heat tacked straps were then mounted into a rotary chuck mechanism.
The rotary chuck mechanism was then adjusted to apply a light, longitudinal
compressive load. The excess leaflet material areas (315 in Figure 4) were then heat
tacked to the base tool (500 in Figure 5) using a hot soldering iron.
        [00109] The combined tools of Step 18 were then wrapped with an additional 2
layers of type 1 (ASTM D3368) FEP film (from Step 12). Three additional layers of the
composite (Step 4) were then overwrapped and tacked down to the trimmed stent
frame.
        [00110] In preparation for a final heat treat, release and sacrificial layers of a
compression tape and compression fiber were applied both circumferentially and
longitudinally to the assembly from Step 19. The compression tape/fiber contact and
compress the assembly both circumferentially and longitudinally during the subsequent
heat treat. A sacrificial layer of compression tape was circumferentially wrapped in a
helical fashion onto the assembly from Step 19. This compression tape had the
properties of the sacrificial compression layer of ePTFE previously described in Step 10.
An ePTFE compression fiber was then tightly wrapped onto the compression tape.
Approximately 100 turns of the compression fiber were circumferentially applied in a
closely spaced helical pattern. The ePTFE compression fiber was about 1 mm (0.04") in
diameter and was structured to shrink longitudinally when sufficiently heated. The
clamped assembly was then removed from the rotary chuck mechanism. Three layers of
sacrificial compression tape were then wrapped in a longitudinal fashion around the
assembly. Approximately 20 wraps of the compression fiber was then longitudinally
wrapped over the longitudinal compression tape.
        [00111] 21). The assembly from Step 20 was then heat treated in an air
convection oven at about 280 0C for about 90 minutes and then room temperature water
quenched. This heat treatment step facilitates the flow of the thermoplastic
                                                 20

fluoroelastomer into the pores of the ePTFE membrane used to create the leaflet
material described in step 4.
        [00112] The sacrificial compression tapes/fibers were then removed. The
polymeric materials were trimmed to allow the leaflet and base tools to be separated.
The stent polymeric layers were then trimmed to allow removal of the stent frame with
the attached leaflets. The leaflets were then trimmed, resulting in a valve assembly as
shown in Figure 8 and generally indicated at 800.
        [00113] The resulting valve assembly 800, according to one embodiment, includes
leaflets 802 formed from a composite material with at least one fluoropolymer layer
having a plurality of pores and an elastomer present in substantially all of the pores of
the at least one fluoropolymer layer. Each leaflet 802 is movable between a closed
position, shown illustratively in Figure 9A, in which blood is prevented from flowing
through the valve assembly, and an open position, shown illustratively in Figure 9B, in
which blood is allowed to flow through the valve assembly. Thus, the leaflets 802 of the
valve assembly 800 cycle between the closed and open positions generally to regulate
blood flow direction in a human patient,
        [00114] The performance of the valve leaflets in each valve assembly was
characterized on a real-time pulse duplicator that measured typical anatomical
pressures and flows across the valve, generating an initial or "zero fatigue" set of data
for that particular valve assembly. The valve assembly was then transferred to a high
rate fatigue tester and was subjected to approximately 207 million cycles. After each
block of about 100 million cycles, the valve was then returned to the real-time pulse
duplicator and the performance parameters re-measured.
        [00115] The flow performance was characterized by the following process:
        [00116] The valve assembly was potted into a silicone annular ring (support
structure) to allow the valve assembly to be subsequently evaluated in a real-time pulse
duplicator. The potting process was performed according to the recommendations of the
pulse duplicator manufacturer (ViVitro Laboratories Inc., Victoria BC, Canada)
        [00117] The potted valve assembly was then placed into a real-time left heart flow
pulse duplicator system. The flow pulse duplicator system included the following
components supplied by VSI Vivitro Systems Inc., Victoria BC, Canada: a Super Pump,
Servo Power Amplifier Part Number SPA 3891; a Super Pump Head, Part Number SPH
5891 B, 38.320 cm2 cylinder area; a valve station/fixture; a Wave Form Generator,
                                                21

Amplifier Component, Part Number AM 9991; and a Square Wave Electro Magnetic
Flow Meter, Carolina Medical Electronics Inc., East Bend, NC, USA.
        [00118] In general, the flow pulse duplicator system uses a fixed displacement,
piston pump to produce a desired fluid flow through the valve under test.
        [00119] The heart flow pulse duplicator system was adjusted to produce the
desired flow, mean pressure, and simulated pulse rate. The valve under test was then
cycled for about 5 to 20 minutes.
        [00120] Pressure and flow data were measured and collected during the test
period, including ventricular pressures, aortic pressures, flow rates, and pump piston
position. Figure 10 is a graph of data from the heart flow pulse duplicator system.
        [00121] Parameters used to characterize the valve and to compare to post-fatigue
values are pressure drop across the open valve during the positive pressure portion of
forward flow, effective orifice area, and regurgitant fraction.
        [00122] Following characterization, the valve assembly was then removed from the
flow pulse duplicator system and placed into a high-rate fatigue tester. A Six Position
Heart Valve Durability Tester, Part Number M6 was supplied by Dynatek, Galena, MO,
USA and was driven by a Dynatek Dalta DC 7000 Controller. This high rate fatigue
tester displaces fluid through a valve assembly with a cycle rate of about 780 cycles per
minute. During the test, the valve assembly can be visually examined using a tuned
strobe light. The pressure drop across the closed valve can also be monitored as
displayed in Figures 11A and 11 B. Shown in Figures 11A and 11B is a data set
verifying that the high-rate fatigue tester was producing consistent pressure waveforms.
        [00123] The valve assembly was continuously cycled and periodically monitored
for visual and pressure drop changes. After approximately 200 million cycles, the valve
assembly was removed from the high-rate tester and returned to the real-time pulse
duplicator. The pressure and flow data were collected and compared to the original
data collected.
        [00124] Shown in Figure 12A is a screen shot displaying measured data output
from the real-time heart flow pulse duplicator system. Shown are Ventricular Pressures,
Aortic Pressures and Flow Rate. The initial or zero fatigue data for a particular valve is
shown illustratively in Figure 12A. The same measurements were taken and data were
collected for the same particular valve after 207 million cycles. The 207 million cycle
                                                22

data for the particular valve is shown illustratively in Figure 12B. Both sets of
measurements were taken at 5 liters per minute flow rate and 70 cycles per minute rate.
Comparing Figures 12A and 12B, it should be readily appreciated that the waveforms
are substantially similar, indicating no substantial change in the valve leaflet
performance after about 207 million cycles. Pressure drop, effective orifice area (EOA),
and regurgitant fraction measured at zero and 207 million cycles are summarized in
Table 1 below.

        [00125] Generally, it was observed that the valve leaflets constructed according to
the embodiments described herein exhibited no physical or mechanical degradation,
such as tears, holes, permanent set and the like, after 207 million cycles. As a result,
there was also no observable change or degradation in the closed and open
configurations of the valve leaflets even after 207 million cycles.
Example 2
        [00126] An embodiment of a heart valve having polymeric leaflets joined to a rigid
metallic frame was constructed according to the following embodiment of a process:
        [00127] A mandrel 900 was machined from PTFE having a shape shown in Figure
14. The mandrel 900 has a first end 902 and an second end 904 that is opposite the
first end 902, and extends longitudinally therebetween. The mandrel 900 has an outer
surface 910 having three (two shown) generally arcuate, convex lobes 912, each
generally for forming leaflets (not shown) of a finished valve assembly (not shown). The
outer surface 910 also includes a frame seating area 920 for positioning a valve frame
(930 in Figure 15) relative to the convex lobes 912 prior to formation of leaflets onto the
valve frame.
        [00128] As shown in Figure 15, a valve frame 930 was laser cut from a length of
316 stainless steel tube with an outside diameter of about 25.4mm and a wall thickness
of about 0.5mm in the shape shown in Figure 15. In the embodiment shown, the valve
frame 930 extends axially between a bottom end 932 and an opposite top end defined
                                                    23
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

generally by a plurality of axially extending, generally spire shaped posts 934
corresponding to the number of leaflets in the intended finished valve assembly (not
shown). In the specific embodiment shown, three posts 934 are formed in the valve
frame 930.
        [00129] Two layers of an about 4 pm thick film of FEP (not shown) was wrapped
around the valve frame 930 and baked in an oven for about 30 minutes at about 270 0 C
and allowed to cool. The resulting covered valve frame (for clarity, shown uncovered
and indicated at 930) was then slid onto the mandrel 900 so that the complementary
features between the valve frame 930 and mandrel 900 are nested together, as shown
in Figure 16.
        [00130] A leaflet material was then prepared having a membrane of ePTFE
imbibed with a fluoroelastomer. More specifically, the membrane of ePTFE was
manufactured according to the general teachings described in U.S. Patent No.
7,306,729. The ePTFE membrane was tested in accordance with the methods
described in the Appendix. The ePTFE membrane had a mass per area of about 0.57
g/m2, a porosity of about 90.4%, a thickness of about 2.5 pm, a bubble point of about
458 KPa, a matrix tensile strength of about 339 MPa in the longitudinal direction and
about 257 MPa in the transverse direction. This membrane was imbibed with the same
fluoroelastomer as described in Example 1. The fluoroelastomer was dissolved in
Novec HFE7500, 3M, St Paul, MN, USA in an about 2.5% concentration. The solution
was coated using a mayer bar onto the ePTFE membrane (while being supported by a
polypropylene release film) and dried in a convection oven set to about 145 0C for about
30 seconds. After two coating steps, the resulting composite material of
ePTFE/fluoroelastomer had a mass per area of about 3.6 g/m2.
        [00131] The composite material (not shown) was then wound around the
assembled mandrel 900 and valve frame 930. In one embodiment, a total of 20 layers
of the ePTFE/fluoroelastomer composite was used. Any excess composite material that
extended beyond the ends of mandrel 900 were twisted and pressed lightly against the
first end 902 and second end 904 of the mandrel 900.
        [00132] The composite material wrapped mandrel was then mounted in a pressure
vessel so that a vent port 906 (Figure 14) in the base or second end 904 of the mandrel
900 was plumbed to atmosphere. The vent port 906 extends from the second end 904
axially through the mandrel 900 and communicates to a generally orthogonally
                                               24
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

extending vent port 908 that extends through the outer surface 910 of the mandrel 900.
The vent ports 906, 908, in addition to other vent ports which may be provided in the
mandrel as needed (not shown), allow trapped air between the composite material and
the mandrel to escape during the molding process.
       [00133] About 690 KPa (100 psi) of nitrogen pressure was applied to the pressure
vessel, forcing the ePTFE/fluoroelastomer composite against the mandrel 900 and the
valve frame 930. Heat was applied to the pressure vessel until the temperature inside
the vessel reached about 3000 C, about 3 hours later. The heater was turned off and
the pressure vessel was allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. This process
thermally bonded the layers of ePTFE/fluoroelastomer composite to each other and to
the FEP coating on the valve frame 930. The pressure was released and the mandrel
was removed from the pressure vessel.
       [00134] The ePTFE/fluoroelastomer composite was trimmed circumferentially in
two places: first, at the bottom end 932 of the valve frame 930, and second, near the top
end of the valve frame 930 along a circle generally intersecting near the mid-point of
each post 934. The resulting valve assembly 940 consisting of the valve frame 930 and
the trimmed composite material was separated from and slid off the mandrel. The
molded valve assembly 940, as shown in Figure 17, includes the valve frame 930 and a
plurality of leaflets 950 formed from the trimmed composite material. In one
embodiment, the valve assembly 940 included three leaflets. In another embodiment,
each leaflet 950 in the valve assembly 940 was approximately 40 pm thick.
       [00135] To help control the degree of opening of the valve, adjacent leaflets about
each post were bonded together. As shown in Figure 18, the adjacent leaflets 950a,
950b were wrapped around the post 934 and bonded together to form a seam 954. The
seam 954 had a depth 956 extending to at least about 2mm from the post 934. To
support the bond between the adjacent leaflets 950a, 950b, an attachment member 952
was fixedly secured to inner surfaces of the adjacent leaflets 950a, 950b thereby
bridging the seam 954 between the adjacent leaflets 950a, 950b. As shown in Figure
18, the attachment member 952 was generally rectangular. It should be appreciated,
however, that other shapes for the attachment member may be utilized. The attachment
member 952 was formed from the same type of composite material used to form the
leaflets 950. The attachment member 952 was fixedly secured to the inner surfaces of
                                              25
  10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

the adjacent leaflets 950a, 950b using the fluoroelastomer solution previously described.
These steps were repeated for the other pairs of adjacent leaflets of the valve assembly.
        [00136] The performance and durability of the valve leaflets in this example were
analyzed in the same manner as described in Example 1. The valve assembly was
initially characterized on the same real-time pulse duplicator as described in Example 1
that measured typical anatomical pressures and flows across the valve, generating an
initial or "zero fatigue" set of data for that particular valve assembly. The valve was then
subjected to accelerated testing as in Example 1. After about 79 million cycles, the
valve was removed from the high rate fatigue tester and the hydrodynamic performance
again characterized as in Example 1. The valve was removed finally at about 198 million
cycles. Pressure drop, EOA and regurgitant fraction measured at about 79 million cycles
and about 198 cycles are summarized in Table 2 below.
        [00137] Figures 13A and 13B display similar results for a similar valve. Figure 13A
is a graph of measured data output from the heart flow pulse duplicator system taken
after about 79 million cycles. The same measurements were taken for the similar valve
after about 198 million cycles, a graph of which is shown illustratively in Figure 13B.
Both sets of measurements were taken at about 4 liters per minute flow rate and about
70 cycles per minute rate. Comparing Figures 13A and 13B, it should be again
appreciated that the waveforms are significantly similar, indicating no substantial change
in the valve leaflet performance after about 198 million cycles. Pressure drop, effective
orifice area (EOA), and regurgitant fraction measured at 0, about 79, and about 198
million cycles are summarized in Table 2 below. These data indicate no substantial
change in the valve leaflet performance after about 198 million cycles.

        [00138] An embodiment of a heart valve having polymeric leaflets joined to a rigid
metallic frame was constructed according to the following embodiment of a process:

   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

        [00139] A valve support structure or frame 960 was laser cut from a length of 316
stainless steel tube with an outside diameter of about 25.4mm and a wall thickness of
about 0.5mm in the shape shown in Figure 19. In the embodiment shown, the frame
960 extends axially between a bottom end 962 and an opposite top end defined
generally by a plurality of axially extending, generally spire shaped posts 964
corresponding to the number of leaflets in the intended finished valve assembly (not
shown). A parabolically shaped top edge 968 extends between adjacent posts 964. In
the specific embodiment shown, three posts 964 and three top edges 968 form the top
end of the frame 960. The corners of the frame that would be in contact with the leaflet
material were rounded using a rotary sander and hand polished. The frame was rinsed
with water and then plasma cleaned using a PT2000P plasma treatment system, Tri
Star Technologies, El Segundo, CA, USA.
        [00140] In one embodiment, a cushion member is provided between at least a
portion of the frame and at least a portion of the leaflet to minimize stress related to
direct contact between the frame and the leaflet. A composite fiber of ePTFE and
silicone was created by first imbibing an ePTFE membrane with silicone MED-6215
(NuSil, Carpinteria, CA, USA), slitting it to a width of about 25 mm, and rolling into a
substantially round fiber. The ePTFE used in this fiber was tested in accordance with
the methods described in the Appendix. The ePTFE membrane had a bubble point of
about 217 KPa, a thickness of about 10 pm, a mass per area of about 5.2 g/m2 , a
porosity of about 78%, a matrix tensile strength in one direction of about 96 MPa, and a
matrix tensile strength of about 55 MPa in an orthogonal direction. The composite fiber
966 was wrapped around each of the posts 964 of the frame 960 as shown in Figure 20.
        [00141] A mandrel 970 was formed using stereolithography in a shape shown in
Figure 21. The mandrel 970 has a first end 972 and an opposite second end 974, and
extends longitudinally therebetween. The mandrel 970 has an outer surface 980 having
three (two shown) generally arcuate, convex lobes 982, each generally for forming
leaflets (not shown) of a finished valve assembly (not shown). The outer surface 980
also includes a frame seating area 984 for positioning the frame (960 in Figure 19)
relative to the convex lobes 982 prior to formation of the valve leaflets onto the valve
frame.
        [00142] The mandrel 970 was then spray coated with a PTFE mold release agent.
Four layers of the ePTFE membrane previously described in this example were
                                                27
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

wrapped around the mandrel. MED-6215 was wiped onto the ePTFE and allowed to
wet into and substantially fill the pores of the ePTFE. Excess MED-6215 was blotted off
and the frame 960 with the composite fiber 966 wrapped posts 964 was positioned on
the mandrel 970 along the frame seating area 984, as shown in Figure 22. Silicone
MED-4720, NuSil, Carpinteria, CA, USA was placed along the top edges 968 of the
frame 960 and along the posts 964 of the frame 960 to create a strain relief within the
leaflet (not shown). Eight additional layers of ePTFE were wrapped around the frame
960 and mandrel 970. Additional MED-6215 was wiped onto the ePTFE and allowed to
wet into and substantially fill the pores of the ePTFE. Another 8 layers of ePTFE were
wrapped around the frame 960 and mandrel 970. These layers form a blotter to absorb
any excess silicone during the molding process and were removed after the silicone had
cured.
        [00143] Silicone rubber forms (not shown) molded with one surface exactly
matching the inverse shape of the mandrel surface were previously fabricated for each
of the 3 leaflet-forming features. These forms were spray coated with PTFE mold
release and then mated to the matching feature of the mandrel. Approximately 50
wraps of an ePTFE fiber (not shown) were wound around the silicone forms to apply
generally radial pressure to the valve against the mandrel.
        [00144] This assembly was then placed in an oven at about 100 0 C for about 1 hour
to cure the silicone. After cooling, the fiber and silicone forms were removed, the 8
layers of blotter ePTFE were peeled away and discarded, and the resulting valve (not
shown) was slid off of the mandrel. The posts were trimmed using wire cutters and the
excess length of leaflet material and excess length of material at the base of the frame
was carefully trimmed using scissors to form a completed valve assembly, which is
shown and generally indicated at 990 in Figure 23. Thus, in one embodiment, the valve
assembly 990 was formed having the frame 960 or support structure; a plurality of
leaflets 992 supported on the frame 960 and movable between open and closed
positions to regulate blood flow through the valve assembly 990; and a composite fiber
966 wrapped post 964 located between at least a portion of the frame 960 and at least a
portion of each leaflet 992 to minimize stress in the leaflets due to the coupling and/or
proximity of the leaflets to the support structure. In another embodiment, the cushion
member is formed from a composite material with at least one fluoropolymer layer
                                                28

having a plurality of pores and an elastomer present in substantially all of the pores, as
described above.
        [00145] It should be appreciated that support structures other than as specifically
shown in the figures may be utilized. Further, cushion members may be utilized
anywhere along the support structure as necessary to minimize stress in the leaflets due
to the coupling and/or proximity of the leaflets to the support structure. For example,
cushion member(s) may be coupled to the support structure along the parabolically
shaped top edge.
        [00146] It should also be appreciated that the cushion members may be formed as
sheets and wrapped around desired locations along the support structure, or be formed
from fibers of various cross-sectional shapes and sizes.
        [00147] It should also be appreciated that the cushion members may be formed as
tubes and slid over the ends of the support structure, or be slit longitudinally and
positioned around the desired location along the support structure.
        [00148] The leaflets of the complete valve assembly were measured and
determined to have an average thickness at the center of each leaflet of about 120 pm.
        [00149] The valve assembly was then characterized for flow performance and
subjected to accelerated testing as in Example 1. After each block of about 50 million
cycles, the valve assembly was removed from the high rate fatigue tester and the
hydrodynamic performance again characterized as in Example 1. The valve assembly
was removed finally at about 150 million cycles and demonstrated acceptable
performance and no hole formation.
Comparative Example A
        [00150] Six valves were constructed in the manner of Example 1 with the
exception that the elastomer was not incorporated. The ePTFE material was the same
as that described in Example 1, but it was not imbibed with the fluoroelastomer
copolymer and was instead coated with a discontinuous layer of FEP copolymer that
served as a thermoplastic adhesive. Valves were constructed as in Example 1 with each
leaflet comprising 3 layers of membrane resulting in a final leaflet thickness averaging
about 20 pm. After hydrodynamic characterization, the valves were mounted in the
Dynatek accelerated tester described in Example 1. By about 40 million cycles, edge
delamination and hole formation in the leaflets was observed and the test was stopped.
                                               29
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

Comparative Example B
        [00151] Two valves were constructed in the manner of Example 1 but did not
incorporate the elastomer portion of the various embodiments presented herein. The
material employed was thin ePTFE membrane possessing properties similar to the
following: a mass per area of about 2.43 g/m2 , a porosity of about 88%, an IBP of about
4.8 KPa, a thickness of about 13.8 pm, a matrix tensile strength in one direction of about
662 MPa, and a matrix tensile strength of about 1.2 MPa in the orthogonal direction.
The ePTFE membrane was tested in accordance with the methods described in the
Appendix. Ten layers of the membrane were placed in alternating directions onto a
stack and then placed on the tooling as described in Example 1. The tooling was then
exposed to about 350 0 C in a convection air oven for about 25 minutes, removed and
quenched in a water bath. The three pieces of tooling were then inserted into the stent
frame and the leaflets bonded to the valve assembly with FEP as in Example 1.
        [00152] Each valve was subjected to high-rate fatigue testing using the real-time
heart flow pulse duplicator system, as described above. After about 30 million cycles on
one valve and about 40 million cycles on another valve, visual degradation, including
stiffening and deformation, was observed and measurable decrease in performance was
noted. In addition to the visual and measurable degradation in performance, Table 3
below summarizes the pressure drop, effective orifice area (EOA), and regurgitant
fraction measured after about 40 million cycles.

Example 4
        [00153] An embodiment of a heart valve having polymeric leaflets comprising a
composite material including a porous polyethylene membrane and an elastomeric
material as described above, joined to a metallic valve frame, was constructed
according to the following embodiment of a process:
        [00154] A valve frame 1000 was laser machined from a length of seamless MP35N
tubing made in accordance with ASTM F.562 with a full hard temper with an outside
                                                   30
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

diameter of 26 mm and a wall thickness of 0.60 mm. A pattern defining posts 1001 was
cut into the tube to form the valve frame 1000, as shown in perspective view in Figure
24.
        [00155] The valve frame 1000 was lightly bead blasted to round the edges and
roughen the surface. The valve frame 1000 was rinsed with water and then subjected to
a plasma cleaning treatment using methods commonly known to those of ordinary skill
in the art.
        [00156] A composite material was then prepared having a membrane of biaxially
expanded ePTFE imbibed with a silicone. More specifically, the membrane of ePTFE
was manufactured according to the general teachings described in U.S. Patent No.
3953566. The ePTFE membrane was tested in accordance with the methods described
previously. The biaxially expanded ePTFE membrane was amorphously locked, and
had the following properties: thickness = 0.045 mm, density = 0.499 g/cc, matrix tensile
strength in the strongest direction = 95.6 MPa, matrix tensile strength in the direction
orthogonal to the strongest direction = 31.1 MPa, elongation at maximum load in the
strongest direction = 37%, and elongation at maximum load in the direction orthogonal
to the strongest direction = 145%.
        [00157] This ePTFE membrane was imbibed with silicone 732 Multi-Purpose
Sealant (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) by first coating the silicone onto a PET film using a
0.102mm drawdown bar. The ePTFE membrane was then laid on top of the silicone
coating and the silicone was allowed to wet into the membrane. A 20 mm wide strip of
the composite material was removed from the PET film and rolled into a fiber and
spirally wrapped around each post 1001 on the valve frame 1000 of Figure 24, as
shown in perspective view in Figure 25. This spirally wrapped composite fiber creates a
cushion member 1030 which will be located between a portion of the valve frame 1000
and the leaflet 1102 to minimize stress related to direct contact between the valve frame
1000 and the leaflet 1102, as shown in perspective view in Figure 25.
        [00158] A mandrel 1200 was machined from aluminum in a generally cylindrical
shape shown in perspective view in Figure 26. The mandrel 1200 included a first end
1202 and an opposing second end 1203.
        [00159] The mandrel had twelve 0.5 mm diameter vent holes 1207 that pass from
the outer surface 1204 to a central cavity 1206 running within the center of the mandrel
1200. Twelve vent holes 1207 were positioned in two rows distributed circumferentially
                                             31
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

around the mandrel 1200, one row hidden from view by the valve frame in Figure 26.
These vent holes 1207, in communication with the central cavity 1206, allowed trapped
air to be vented away from the valve assembly during molding.
         [00160] Two layers of a sacrificial composite material comprising ePTFE and
polyimide with a thickness of approximately 0.004 mm were wrapped around mandrel
1200.
         [00161] A composite material was then prepared having a microporous
polyethylene membrane imbibed with a silicone. The microporous polyethylene
membrane was obtained from a Pall Corp. (Port Washington, NY) PE Kleen 5nm water
filter cartridge ABD1 UG53EJ, which contains a hydrophobic high density polyethylene
(HDPE) membrane. The microporous polyethylene membrane was tested in
accordance with the methods described previously and had the following properties:
thickness = 0.010 mm, density = 0.642 g/cc, matrix tensile strength in the strongest
direction = 214 MPa, matrix tensile strength in the direction orthogonal to the strongest
direction = 174 MPa, elongation at maximum load in the strongest direction = 62%,
elongation at maximum load in the direction orthogonal to the strongest direction =
157%, a fiber diameter of less than about 1 pm, a mean flow pore size of 0.0919 pm,
and a specific surface area of 28.7m 2 /cc. It is anticipated that microporous polyethylene
membrane may have a mean flow pore sizes of less than about 5 pm, less than about 1
pm, and less than about 0.10 pm, in accordance with embodiments.
         [00162] The microporous polyethylene membrane was soaked in acetone for
approximately 72 hours and allowed to air dry at room temperature. A coating of 732
Multipurpose Sealant was applied to a PET film using a 0.51 mm drawdown bar. The
microporous polyethylene membrane was then laid on top of the silicone coating and
the silicone was allowed to wet into the membrane. The silicone and polyethylene
composite material was removed from the PET and wrapped around the mandrel 1200
and the sacrificial PTFE/Polyamide composite material, for a total of two layers.
         [00163] The valve frame 1000 with posts 1001 covered by the cushion member
1030 was slid onto the mandrel 1200, on top of the two layers. Holes were poked
through the previously applied layers above the vent holes and the valve frame 1000
was positioned so a base 1003 of the valve frame 1000 covered one row of the vent
holes 1207 (hidden) as shown in Figure 26.
                                                32
    10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

        [00164] Five more layers of the silicone/polyethylene composite material were
wrapped around the valve frame 1000.
        [00165] Eight layers of the ePTFE membrane previously described in this example
were wrapped on top of the previous layers to create a sacrificial blotter layer to absorb
any excess silicone. Two layers of a sacrificial composite material comprising ePTFE
and polyimide with a thickness of approximately 0.004 mm were wrapped around the
mandrel and previously applied components. Adhesive-backed polyimide tape was
used to attach the ePTFE/polyimide composite to the mandrel at each end and to seal
the longitudinal seam.
        [00166] The mandrel 1200 with previously applied components was then mounted
in a pressure vessel so that a vent port 1211 in communication with the central cavity
1206 in the first end 1202 of the mandrel 1200 was plumbed to atmosphere. The
central cavity 1206 extends from the first end 1202 axially through the mandrel 1200
and in communication with the 12 previously described vent holes 1207.
        [00167] About 414 KPa (60 psi) of helium pressure was applied to the pressure
vessel, forcing the microporous polyethylene and silicone composite material against
the mandrel 1200 and the valve frame 1000. Heat was applied to the pressure vessel
until the temperature inside the mandrel reached about 950 C, about 28 minutes later.
The heat was removed and the pressure vessel was allowed to cool to room
temperature. This process bonded the layers of the silicone/polyethylene composite
material to each other and to the valve frame 1000. The pressure was released and the
mandrel 1200 was removed from the pressure vessel. The valve assembly 1010 was
slid off of the mandrel 1200 and the outer layer of the sacrificial ePTFE/polyimide
composite material was removed, as shown in perspective view in Figure 27.
        [00168] A shaped mandrel 1300 was machined from aluminum in a generally
cylindrical shape shown in perspective view in Figure 28. The mandrel 1300 includes a
first end 1302, an opposing second end 1303, and a central portion 1305 therebetween
defining concave features 1309.
        [00169] The mandrel 1300 had three 0.5 mm diameter holes 1307 that pass from
the outer surface 1304 to a central cavity 1306 running within the center of the mandrel
1300. The holes 1307 are located at the end of the concave feature closest to the
shaped mandrel first end 1302, and are in communication with the central cavity 1306.
                                               33
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

These holes 1307 allowed trapped air to be vented away from the valve assembly 1010
during molding.
       [00170] The valve assembly 1010 was slid onto the shaped mandrel 1300 and the
valve frame 1000 was aligned with the concave features 1309 of the mandrel 1300 as
shown in Figure 28. The composite material with the sacrificial layers were pressed
against the mandrel 1300 and taped to either ends of the mandrel 1300 using adhesive
backed polyimide tape. A tube of sacrificial composite material comprising ePTFE and
polyimide was prepared by wrapping a sheet of the composite material around a
23.9mm mandrel and taping the axial seam with adhesive-backed polyimide tape. This
tube was slid over the valve assembly 1010 while mounted on the shaped mandrel and
taped to the ends of the shaped mandrel using adhesive-backed polyimide tape.
       [00171] The shaped mandrel 1300 with previously applied components was then
mounted in a pressure vessel so that a vent port 1311, in communication with the
central cavity 1306, in the first end 1302 of the mandrel 1300 was plumbed to
atmosphere. The central cavity 1306 extends from the first end 1302 axially through the
mandrel 1300 and communicates to the previously described vent holes 1307.
       [00172] About 689 KPa (100 psi) of helium pressure was applied to the pressure
vessel, forcing the microporous polyethylene and silicone composite material against
the mandrel 1300 and the valve frame 1000. Heat was applied to the pressure vessel
until the temperature inside the mandrel reached about 980 C, about 13 minutes later.
The heat was removed and the pressure vessel was allowed to cool to room
temperature. This process forced the layers of the silicone/polyethylene composite
material to take the shape of the shaped mandrel 1300 with leaflet portions 1109 being
drawn into and taking the shape of a portion of the concave features 1309. The valve
assembly 1010 was slid off the mandrel 1300 and the sacrificial ePTFE/polyimide
composite material and the sacrificial ePTFE blotter material was removed.
       [00173] The microporous polyethylene and silicone composite was trimmed so that
approximately 2 mm of the composite extended beyond the base of the frame and
beyond the tips of the frame posts as shown in Figure 29.
       [00174] The thickness of the leaflets 1102 was approximately 139 pm and the
percent weight of the silicone within the composite material was about 69%.
       [00175] The performance of the valve leaflets in this valve assembly were
characterized on a real-time pulse duplicator that measured typical anatomical
                                               34
  10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

pressures and flows across the valve, generating an initial or "zero fatigue" set of data
for that particular valve assembly. The flow performance was characterized by the
following process:
       [00176] The valve assembly was pressed into a silicone annular ring (support
structure) to allow the valve assembly to be subsequently evaluated in a real-time pulse
duplicator.
       [00177] The potted valve assembly was then placed into a real-time left heart flow
pulse duplicator system. The flow pulse duplicator system included the following
components supplied by VSI Vivitro Systems Inc., Victoria BC, Canada: a Super Pump,
Servo Power Amplifier Part Number SPA 3891; a Super Pump Head, Part Number SPH
5891 B, 38.320 cm2 cylinder area; a valve station/fixture; a Wave Form Generator,
TriPack Part Number TP 2001; a Sensor Interface, Part Number VB 2004; a Sensor
Amplifier Component, Part Number AM 9991; and a Square Wave Electro Magnetic
Flow Meter, Carolina Medical Electronics Inc., East Bend, NC, USA.
       [00178] In general, the flow pulse duplicator system uses a fixed displacement,
piston pump to produce a desired fluid flow through the valve under test.
       [00179] The heart flow pulse duplicator system was adjusted to produce the
desired flow, mean pressure, and simulated pulse rate. The valve under test was then
cycled for about 5 to 20 minutes.
       [00180] Pressure and flow data were measured and collected during the test
period, including ventricular pressures, aortic pressures, flow rates, and pump piston
position.
       [00181] The valve in this example had a pressure drop of 11.3mm Hg, EOA of 2.27
cm 2 and regurgitant fraction of 15.4%
Example 5
       [00182] Another embodiment of a heart valve having polymeric leaflets comprising
a composite material including a microporous polyethylene membrane and an
elastomeric material as described above, joined to a metallic valve frame, was
constructed according to the following embodiment of a process:
       [00183] A valve frame 1000 was prepared as in Example 4.
       [00184] A composite material was prepared having a membrane of microporous
polyethylene imbibed with a silicone. The microporous polyethylene membrane was
                                               35
  10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

obtained from a Pall Corp. (Port Washington, NY) PE Kleen 5nm water filter cartridge
ABD1 UG53EJ, which contains a hydrophobic high density polyethylene (HDPE)
membrane. The microporous polyethylene membrane was stretched on a biaxial
expansion machine. The microporous polyethylene membrane was mounted on the
pins of the expansion machine with the pins positioned 70mm apart in a first direction
and 150mm apart in the direction orthogonal to the first direction. The microporous
polyethylene membrane was allowed to dwell for 60 seconds in a heated chamber
within the biaxial expansion machine, reaching a web temperature of 129 0 C. The pins
were then translated in the first direction from 70mm to 84mm at a rate of 0.7%/second
while the pins in the direction orthogonal to the first direction were translated from
150mm to 420mm at a rate of 10%/second. The membrane was removed from the
heated chamber while restrained by the pins and allowed to air cool to room
temperature.
        [00185] The stretched microporous polyethylene membrane was tested in
accordance with the methods described previously and had the following properties:
thickness = 0.006 mm, density = 0.524 g/cc, matrix tensile strength in the first direction =
156 MPa, matrix tensile strength in the direction orthogonal to the first direction = 474
MPa, elongation at maximum load in the first direction = 167%, elongation at maximum
load in the direction orthogonal to the first direction = 19%, a fiber diameter of less than
about 1 pm, a mean flow pore size of 0.1011 pm, and a specific surface area of
18.3m 2 /cc. It is anticipated that microporous polyethylene membrane may have a mean
flow pore size of less than about 5 pm, less than about 1 pm, and less than about 0.10
pm, in accordance with embodiments.
        [00186] The stretched microporous polyethylene membrane was imbibed with
silicone 734 Flowable Sealant (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) by first coating the silicone
onto a PET film using a 0.25mm drawdown bar. The polyethylene membrane was then
laid on top of the silicone coating and the silicone was allowed to wet into the
membrane. A 20 mm wide strip of the composite material was removed from the PET
film and rolled/twisted into a fiber and spirally wrapped around each post 1001 on the
valve frame 1000 of Figure 25. This spirally wrapped composite fiber creates a cushion
member 1030 which will be located between a portion of the valve frame 1000 and the
leaflet 1102 to minimize stress related to direct contact between the valve frame 1000
and the leaflet 1102, as shown in Figure 29.

   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

        [00187] A mandrel 1200 as described in Example 1 and shown in Figure 26 was
obtained. Two layers of a sacrificial composite material comprising ePTFE and
polyimide with a thickness of approximately 0.004 mm were wrapped around mandrel
1200.
        [00188] A composite material of stretched microporous polyethylene membrane
and silicone was prepared as described previously in this example.
        [00189] The silicone and microporous polyethylene membrane composite material
was circumferentially wrapped around the mandrel 1200 and the sacrificial
PTFE/Polyamide composite material, for a total of two layers. The first direction of the
stretched microporous polyethylene membrane was aligned with the long axis of the
mandrel 1300 while it was wrapped.
        [00190] The valve frame 1000 with fiber covered posts 1001 was slid onto the
mandrel 1200, on top of the two layers. Holes were poked through the previously
applied layers above the vent holes and the valve frame was positioned so a base 1003
of the valve frame 1000 covered one row of the vent holes 1207 (hidden) as shown in
Figure 26.
        [00191] A small amount of silicone was applied by hand to the frame to provide
additional adhesive between the frame and the circumferentially wrapped composite
material.
        [00192] Four more layers of the silicone and microporous polyethylene membrane
composite material were wrapped around the valve frame 1000.
        [00193] Eight layers of the ePTFE membrane previously described in Example 4
were wrapped on top of the previous layers to create a sacrificial blotter layer to absorb
any excess silicone. Two layers of a sacrificial composite material comprising ePTFE
and polyimide with a thickness of approximately 0.004 mm were wrapped around the
mandrel and previously applied components. Adhesive-backed polyimide tape was
used to attach the ePTFE/polyimide composite to the mandrel at each end and to seal
the longitudinal seam.
        [00194] The mandrel 1200 with previously applied components was then mounted
in a pressure vessel so that a vent port 1211, in communication with the central cavity
1206, in the first end 1202 of the mandrel 1200 was plumbed to atmosphere. The
central cavity 1206 extends from the first end 1202 axially through the mandrel 1200
and communicates to the 12 previously described vent holes 1207.

   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

        [00195] About 414 KPa (60 psi) of helium pressure was applied to the pressure
vessel, forcing the microporous polyethylene membrane and silicone composite material
against the mandrel 1200 and the valve frame 1000. Heat was applied to the pressure
vessel until the temperature inside the mandrel reached about 660 C, about 20 minutes
later. The heat was removed and the pressure vessel was allowed to cool to room
temperature. This process bonded the layers of the silicone/polyethylene composite
material to each other and to the valve frame 1000. The pressure was released and the
mandrel 1200 was removed from the pressure vessel. The valve assembly 1010 was
slid off of the mandrel 1200 and the outer layer of the sacrificial ePTFE/polyimide
composite material was removed, as shown in perspective view in Figure. 26.
        [00196] A shaped mandrel 1300 as described in Example 4 was obtained as
shown in Figure 28. The valve assembly 1010 was slid onto the shaped mandrel 1300
and the valve frame 1000 was aligned with the concave features 1309 of the mandrel
1300 as shown in Figure 28. The silicone and microporous polyethylene membrane
composite material with the sacrificial layers were pressed against the mandrel 1300
and taped to either ends of the mandrel 1300 using adhesive-backed polyimide tape. A
tube of sacrificial composite material comprising ePTFE and polyimide was prepared by
wrapping a sheet of the composite material around a 23.9mm mandrel and taping the
axial seam with adhesive-backed polyimide tape. This tube was slid over the valve
assembly 1010 while mounted on the shaped mandrel and taped to the ends of the
shaped mandrel using adhesive-backed polyimide tape.
        [00197] The shaped mandrel 1300 with previously applied components was then
mounted in a pressure vessel so that a vent port 1311 in the first end 1302 of the
mandrel 1300 was plumbed to atmosphere.
        [00198] About 551 KPa (80 psi) of air pressure was applied to the pressure vessel,
forcing the microporous polyethylene and silicone composite material against the
mandrel 1300 and the valve frame 1000. Heat was applied to the pressure vessel until
the temperature inside the mandrel reached about 950 C, about 13 minutes later. The
heat was removed and the pressure vessel was allowed to cool to room temperature.
This process forced the layers of the silicone and microporous polyethylene membrane
composite material to take the shape of the shaped mandrel 1300 with leaflet portions
1109 being drawn into and taking the shape of a portion of the concave features 1309.
The valve assembly 1010 was slid off the mandrel 1300 and the sacrificial
                                               38

ePTFE/polyimide composite material and the sacrificial ePTFE blotter material was
removed.
        [00199] The polyethylene/ silicone composite was trimmed so that approximately 2
mm of the composite extended beyond the base of the frame and beyond the tips of the
frame posts as shown in Figure 29.
        [00200] The thickness of the leaflets 1102 was approximately 53 pm and the
percent weight of the silicone within the composite material was about 65%.
        [00201] The performance of the valve leaflets in this valve assembly were
characterized on a real-time pulse duplicator that measured typical anatomical
pressures and flows across the valve, generating an initial or "zero fatigue" set of data
for that particular valve assembly. The flow performance was characterized by the
process as described in Example 4.
        [00202] The valve in this example had a pressure drop of 8.7mm Hg, EOA of 2.49
cm 2 and regurgitant fraction of 16.7%.
        [00203] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and
variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or
scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the
modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the
appended claims and their equivalents.
                                               APPENDIX
        [00204] As used in this disclosure, matrix tensile strength refers to the tensile
strength of a porous fluoropolymer specimen under specified conditions. The porosity of
the specimen is accounted for by multiplying the tensile strength by the ratio of density
of the polymer to the density of the specimen.
        [00205] The term membrane as used herein refers to a porous sheet of material
comprising a single composition, such as, but not limited to, expanded fluoropolymer.
        [00206] The term composite material as used herein refers to a combination of a
membrane, such as, but not limited to, expanded fluoropolymer, and an elastomer, such
as, but not limited to, a fluoroelastomer. The elastomer may be imbibed within a porous
structure of the membrane, coated on one or both sides of the membrane, or a
combination of coated on and imbibed within the membrane.
                                                 39
   10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

        [00207] The term laminate as used herein refers to multiple layers of membrane,
composite material, or other materials, such as elastomer, and combinations thereof.
        [00208] The term "imbibe" used herein refers to any process used to at least
partially fill pores with a secondary material.
        [00209] For porous membrane having pores substantially filled with elastomer, the
elastomer can be dissolved or degraded and rinsed away using an appropriate solvent
in order to measure desired properties.
        [00210] As the term "elastomer" is used herein it defines a polymer or a mixture of
polymers that has the ability to be stretched to at least 1.3 times its original length and to
retract rapidly to approximately its original length when released. The term
"elastomeric" is intended to describe a property whereby a polymer displays stretch and
recovery properties similar to an elastomer, although not necessarily to the same
degree of stretch and/or recovery.
        [00211] As the term "thermoplastic" is used herein it defines a polymer that is melt
processable. In contrast to a thermoplastic polymer, a "thermoset" polymer is hereby
defined as a polymer that solidifies or "sets" irreversibly when cured.
        [00212] As used herein, the terms "fibril" and "fiber" are used interchangeably. As
used herein, the terms "pores" and "interstices" are used interchangeably.
        [00213] As used herein, the term synthetic polymer refers to polymer not derived
from biological tissue.
        [00214] The term leaflet as used herein in the context of prosthetic valves refers to
a component of a one-way valve wherein the leaflet is operable to move between an
open and closed position under the influence of a pressure differential. In an open
position, the leaflet allows blood to flow through the valve. In a closed potion, the leaflet
substantially blocks retrograde flow through the valve. In embodiments comprising
multiple leaflets, each leaflet cooperates with at least one neighboring leaflet to block
the retrograde flow of blood. Leaflets in accordance with embodiments provided herein
comprise one or more layers of a composite.
Testing Methods
        [00215] It should be understood that although certain methods and equipment are
described below, any method or equipment determined suitable by one of ordinary skill
in the art may be alternatively utilized.

Effective Orifice Area
        [00216] One measure of the quality of a valve is the effective orifice area (EOA),
which can be calculated as follows: EOA(cm 2 ) = Qrms / (51.6 * (AP)   1 2 ) where Qrms is the
root mean square systolic/diastolic flow rate (cm 3 /s) and AP is the mean
systolic/diastolic pressure drop (mmHg).
Surface Area per Unit Mass
        [00217] As used in this application, the surface area per unit mass, expressed in
units of m2/g, was measured using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method on a
Coulter SA3100Gas Adsorption Analyzer, Beckman Coulter Inc. Fullerton CA, USA. To
perform the measurement, a sample was cut from the center of the expanded
fluoropolymer membrane and placed into a small sample tube. The mass of the sample
was approximately 0.1 to 0.2 g. The tube was placed into the Coulter SA-Prep Surface
Area Outgasser (Model SA-Prep, P/n 5102014) from Beckman Coulter, Fullerton CA,
USA and purged at about 110 C for about two hours with helium. The sample tube was
then removed from the SA-Prep Outgasser and weighed. The sample tube was then
placed into the SA3100 Gas adsorption Analyzer and the BET surface area analysis
was run in accordance with the instrument instructions using helium to calculate the free
space and nitrogen as the adsorbate gas.
Bubble Point and Mean Flow Pore Size
        [00218] Bubble point and mean flow pore size were measured according to the
general teachings of ASTM F31 6-03 using a capillary flow Porometer, Model CFP
1500AEXL from Porous Materials, Inc., Ithaca NY, USA. The sample membrane was
placed into the sample chamber and wet with SilWick Silicone Fluid (available from
Porous Materials Inc.) having a surface tension of about 20.1 dynes/cm. The bottom
clamp of the sample chamber had an about 2.54 cm diameter hole. Isopropyl alcohol
was used as the test fluid. Using the Capwin software version 7.73.012 the following
parameters were set as specified in the table below. As used herein, mean flow pore
size and pore size are used interchangeably.

Presence of Elastomer within the Pores
       [00219] The presence of elastomer within the pores can be determined by several
methods known to those having ordinary skill in the art, such as surface and/or cross
section visual, or other analyses. These analyses can be performed prior to and after
the removal of elastomer from the leaflet.
Diameter of Fibrils and Fibers
       [00220] The average diameter of the fibrils and fibers was estimated by examining
scanning electron micrographs that were obtained having at a magnification suitable for
showing numerous fibrils or fibers, such as the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
micrographs of FIGs. 7A-C, 30 and 31. In the case of a composite material, it may be
                                             42
  10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

necessary to extract the elastomer or other material that may be filling the pores, by any
suitable means, to expose the fibrils or fibers.
Mass, Thickness, and Density of ePTFE Membranes
       [00221] Membrane thickness was measured by placing the membrane between
the two plates of a Ksfer FZ1000/30 thickness snap gauge Ksfer Messuhrenfabrik
GmbH, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany. The average of the three measurements
was reported.
       [00222] Membrane samples were die cut to form rectangular sections about 2.54
cm by about 15.24 cm to measure the weight (using a Mettler-Toledo analytical balance
model AG204) and thickness (using a Ksfer Fz1000/30 snap gauge). Using these data,
density was calculated with the following formula: p = m/(w*I*t), in which: p = density
(g/cm 3), m = mass (g), w = width (cm), I = length (cm), and t = thickness (cm). The
average of three measurements was reported.
Matrix Tensile Strength (MTS) of ePTFE Membranes
       [00223] Tensile break load was measured using an INSTRON 122 tensile test
machine equipped with flat-faced grips and a 0.445 kN load cell. The gauge length was
about 5.08 cm and the cross-head speed was about 50.8 cm/min. The sample
dimensions were about 2.54 cm by about 15.24 cm. For highest strength
measurements, the longer dimension of the sample was oriented in the highest strength
direction. For the orthogonal MTS measurements, the larger dimension of the sample
was oriented perpendicular to the highest strength direction. Each sample was weighed
using a Mettler Toledo Scale Model AG204, then the thickness was measured using the
Ksfer FZ1000/30 snap gauge; alternatively, any suitable means for measuring thickness
may be used. The samples were then tested individually on the tensile tester. Three
different sections of each sample were measured. The average of the three maximum
loads (i.e., peak force) measurements was reported. The longitudinal and transverse
matrix tensile strengths (MTS) were calculated using the following equation: MTS=
(maximum load/cross-section area)*(bulk density of PTFE)/ (density of the porous
membrane), where the bulk density of the PTFE was taken to be about 2.2 g/cm 3.
Mass, Thickness, and Density of Polyethylene Membranes
                                               43
  10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

       [00224] Membrane samples were die cut to form circular sections about 5.0 cm in
diameter to measure the weight (using a Sartorius analytical balance model MC21OP)
and thickness (using a Starrett 3732XFL-1 micrometer). Using these data, density was
calculated with the following formula: p = m/(w*I*t), in which: p = density (g/cm 3 ), m =
mass (g), w = width (cm), I = length (cm), and t = thickness (cm). The average of three
measurements was reported.
Matrix Tensile Strength (MTS) of Polyethylene Membranes
       [00225] Tensile break load was measured using an INSTRON 5500R tensile test
machine equipped with flat-faced grips and a 0.890 kN load cell. The gauge length was
about 2.54 cm and the strain rate was approximately 1000%/min. The sample
dimensions were about 0.47 cm by about 3.90 cm. For highest strength measurements,
the longer dimension of the sample was oriented in the highest strength direction. For
the orthogonal MTS measurements, the larger dimension of the sample was oriented
perpendicular to the highest strength direction. The thickness of each sample was
measured using a Starrett 3732XFL-1 micrometer; alternatively, any suitable means for
measuring thickness may be used. The samples were then tested individually on the
tensile tester. Five different sections of each sample were measured. The average of
the Five maximum loads (i.e., peak force) measurements was reported. The
longitudinal and transverse matrix tensile strengths (MTS) were calculated using the
following equation: MTS= (maximum load/cross-section area)*(bulk density of
polyethylene)/ (density of the porous membrane), where the bulk density of the
polyethylene was taken to be about 0.94 g/cm 3.
       [00226] Flexural stiffness was measured by following the general procedures set
forth in ASTM D790. Unless large test specimens are available, the test specimen must
be scaled down. The test conditions were as follows. The leaflet specimens were
measured on a three-point bending test apparatus employing sharp posts placed
horizontally about 5.08 mm from one another. An about 1.34 mm diameter steel bar
weighing about 80 mg was used to cause deflection in the y (downward) direction, and
the specimens were not restrained in the x direction. The steel bar was slowly placed on
the center point of the membrane specimen. After waiting about 5 minutes, the y
deflection was measured. Deflection of elastic beams supported as above can be
represented by : d = F*L3/48*EI, where F (in Newtons) is the load applied at the center
                                               44
  10096775_1 (GHMatters) P100534.AU.2

of the beam length, L (meters), so L =1/2 distance between suspending posts, and El is
the bending stiffness (Nm). From this relationship the value of El can be calculated.
For a rectangular cross-section: I = t 3*w/12, where I = cross-sectional moment of inertia,
t = specimen thickness (meters), w = specimen width (meters). With this relationship,
the average modulus of elasticity over the measured range of bending deflection can be
calculated.
  Surface Area Measurements
       [00227] The surface area per unit mass (specific surface area), expressed in units
of m2/g, of the microporous polymer membrane was measured using the Brunauer
Emmett-Teller (BET) method on a Coulter SA3100 Gas Adsorption Analyzer (Beckman
Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). A sample was cut from the center of the microporous
polymer membrane sheet and placed into a small sample tube. The mass of the sample
was approximately 0.1 to 0.2 grams. The tube was placed into the Coulter SA-Prep
Surface Area Outgasser, (Model SA-PREP, P/N 5102014) from Beckman Coulter Inc.,
Fullerton, CA and purged at 11 0C for 2 hours with helium. The sample tube was then
removed from the SA-Prep Outgasser and weighed. The sample tube was then placed
into the SA3100 Gas Adsorption Analyzer and the BET surface area analysis was run in
accordance with the instrument instructions using helium to calculate the free space and
nitrogen as the adsorbate gas. A single measurement was recorded for each sample.
       [00228] It is useful to convert the specific surface area as expressed in units of
m2 /g to specific surface area expressed in units of m2 /cc in order to compare the specific
surface areas of materials of different densities. To do so, multiply the specific surface
area expressed in m2 /g by the density of the sample material expressed in g/cc. The
density of PTFE was taken to be 2.2g/cc and the density of polyethylene was taken to
be 0.98g/cc.
