         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         Valeric acid is mainly used for the production of valerate, as spices raw materials
   and estrogen estradiol valerate and disinfectant raw materials, However, most of the
10 existing synthetic methods are using that formic acid reacts with 1-butene to form
   n-valeric acid, it is complicated and the final yield is not very high. Therefore, it is
   necessary to propose a new synthetic method for further improving the quality and
   yield of the product and reducing the byproduct content, it has important economic
   significance.
