             SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MATCHING TRADING ORDERS
                                    BASED ON PRIORITY
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates generally to electronic trading and more specifically
to a system and method for matching trading orders based upon priority.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         In recent years, electronic trading systems have gained widespread acceptance for
the trading of a variety of items, such as goods, services, financial instruments, and
commodities.      For example, electronic trading systems may facilitate the trading of
financial instruments and commodities such as stocks, bonds, currency, futures contracts,
oil, and gold.
         Generally, an electronic trading system receives and processes trading orders from
traders.    For example, an electronic trading system may process trading orders by
matching buy orders for a particular item with sell orders for the same item. In placing a
trading order, a trader may indicate that only a portion of the trading order should be
displayed to other traders. This portion is referred to as the "displayed quantity."     An
electronic trading system generally comprises rules that dictate the sequence in which
trading orders are processed. These rules, however, often decrease or hinder the liquidity
of trading products.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         In accordance with the present invention, the disadvantages and problems
associated with prior electronic trading systems have been substantially reduced or
eliminated.
         In some embodiments, a system for managing trading orders comprises a memory
operable to store a first trading order for a particular trading product, wherein the first
trading order comprises a display portion and a reserve portion and is received from a first
trader. The memory is further operable to store a second trading order for the particular
trading product, wherein the second trading order comprises a display portion and a
reserve portion and the second trading order is received from a second trader after the first
trading order. The system further comprises a processor communicatively coupled to the

  WO 2007/019404                                                            PCT/US2006/030638
                                              2
memory and operable to receive from a counterparty trader a counterorder for the trading
product.    The processor is further operable to use the counterorder to fill the display
portion of the first trading order. The processor is further operable to use the counterorder
to fill the display portion of the second trading order. After filling the display portion of
the second trading order, the processor is further operable to exclusively offer at least a
portion of the counterorder to the first trader for a configurable period of time.
         In some embodiments, a method for managing trading orders comprises receiving
from a first trader a first trading order for a particular trading product, wherein the first
trading order comprises a display portion and a reserve portion. The method continues by
subsequently receiving from a second trader a second trading order for the particular
trading product, wherein the second trading order comprises a display portion and a
reserve portion.     The method continues by receiving from a counterparty trader a
counterorder for the trading product. The method continues by using the counterorder to
fill the display portion of the first trading order.      The method continues by using the
counterorder to fill the display portion of the second trading order.          After filling the
display portion of the second trading order, the method concludes by exclusively offering
at least a portion of the counterorder to the first trader for a configurable period of time.
         The invention has several important technical advantages. Various embodiments
of the invention may have none, some, or all of these advantages.                 One technical
advantage is that the trading platform reduces network traffic and increases throughput in
an electronic trading system.        In particular, the trading platform is operable to
automatically match a particular counterorder with the display portions of multiple orders.
In a system that is unable to automatically match a particular counterorder with the display
portions of multiple orders, the system must generally receive multiple counterorders
and/or transmit multiple confirmation messages prior to filling the display portions of
multiple orders. Because the present trading platform does not need to receive multiple
counterorders or transmit multiple confirmation messages to fill the display portions of
multiple orders, the trading platfonn reduces network traffic and increases                 data
throughput.
         Another advantage is that the trading platform assists traders in managing the risks
of trading.    In some embodiments, a trader may perceive that disclosure of an entire

  WO 2007/019404                                                           PCT/US2006/030638
                                              3
trading order to other traders may adversely affect market prices for a particular trading
product. As a result, the trading platform allows a trader to designate part of a trading
order as the display portion and the remaining part of the trading order as the reserve
portion.   The trading platform may immediately disclose the display portion to other
traders while preventing the disclosure of the reserve portion until one or more conditions
are satisfied. By allowing traders to configure trading orders with display portions and
reserve portions, the trading platform may assist traders in managing the risks of trading.
        Another advantage is that the trading platform may create incentives for traders to
increase liquidity and transparency in an electronic trading system. Upon submitting a
particular trading order, a trader may not know whether the particular trading order will
have priority relative to other trading orders. In the present trading system, however, the
trading platform is operable to fill the display portions of multiple trading orders prior to
granting priority privileges to any particular trader. Thus, a particular trader in the present
system may know that the display portion of his or her order will likely be filled prior to
any other trader receiving priority status. As a result, the particular.trader may perceive an
advantage in increasing the size of the display portion of the particular order.         Thus,
trading system creates incentives for traders to submit orders with larger display portions.
Receiving orders with larger display portions increases transparency and liquidity in the
trading system.
        Other advantages will be readily apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art
from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
        FIGURE 1 illustrates one embodiment of a trading system 10. Trading system 10
may comprise a trading platform 50 communicatively coupled to clients 20, networks 30,
and market centers 40. Generally, trading system 10 is operable to receive, route, and
execute trading orders 12 from traders 70. In some embodiments, trading orders 12 may
represent orders 12a and counterorders 12b. Each order 12a or counterorder 12b may
comprise a display portion and a reserve portion.         Trading platform 50 may use a
particular counterorder 12 to fill the display portions of multiple orders 12. After filling
the display portions of multiple orders 12a, trading platform 50 may exclusively offer a
portion of the particular counterorder 12b to a particular trader 70. By filling the display
portions of orders 12a prior to exclusively offering a portion of the counterorder to a
particular trader 70, trading platform 50 may create incentives for traders 70 to display
larger portions of orders 12a. Receiving orders 12a with larger display portions may
increase transparency and liquidity in trading system 10.
        Trading system 10 may comprise a plurality of clients 20. Clients 20 represent any
suitable local or remote end-user devices that may be used by traders 70 to access one or
more elements of trading system 10, such as trading platform 50. A particular client 20
may comprise a computer, workstation, telephone, Internet browser, electronic notebook,
Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), pager, or any other suitable device (wireless, wireline,
or otherwise), component, or element capable of receiving, processing, storing, and/or
communicating information with other components of system 10. Client 20 may also
comprise any suitable user interface such as a display, microphone, keyboard, or any other
appropriate terminal equipment according to particular configurations and arrangements.

  WO 2007/019404                                                          PCT/US2006/030638
                                              5
It will be understood that there may be any number of clients 20 communicatively coupled
to trading platform 50.          In addition, there may be any number of clients 20
 communicatively coupled to market centers 40 without using trading platform 50.
          Clients 20 are operable to receive trading orders 12 from traders 70 and to send
trading orders 12 to trading platform 50 and/or market centers 40. Trading orders 12 may
 comprise orders to trade products such as, for example, currencies, financial instruments,
 stocks, bonds, futures contracts, equity securities, mutual funds, options, derivatives,
 commodities, or any number and combination of suitable trading products. In particular
embodiments, trading order 12 may specify a target price for the trading product. Trading
orders 24 may comprise bids, offers, market orders, limit orders, stop loss orders, day
orders, open orders, GTC ("good till cancelled") orders, "good through" orders, "all or
none" orders, "any part" orders, or any other suitable order for trading.
          A particular trading order 12 may be referred to as an order 12a or a counter order
 12b.    Orders 12a and counterorders 12b represent complementary actions such as, for
example, buying and selling. If the party that submits a particular order 12a is referred to
as trader 70, the party that submits a corresponding counterorder 12b may be referred to as
a "counterparty" trader 70. If a particular order 12a represents a buy order (e.g., bid, take,
lift, etc.), then a corresponding counterorder 12b may represent a sell order (e.g., offer, hit,
etc.). Conversely, if a particular order 12a represents a sell order, then a corresponding
counterorder 12b may represent a buy order.
          Although clients 20 are described herein as being used by "traders" 70, it should be
understood that the term "trader" is meant to broadly apply to any user of trading system
 10, whether that user is an agent acting on behalf of a principal, a principal, an individual,
a legal entity (such as a corporation), or any machine or mechanism that is capable of
placing and/or responding to trading orders 12 in system 10. Certain traders 70 may be
customers and other traders 70 may be market makers.
         A market maker is any individual, firm, or other entity that submits and/or
maintains either or both bid and offer trading orders 12 simultaneously for the same
instrument.     For example, a market maker may be a brokerage or bank that maintains
either a firm bid and/or offer price in a given security by standing ready, willing, and able
to buy and/or sell that security at publicly quoted prices.      A market maker generally
displays bid and/or offer prices for specific numbers of specific securities, and if these

     WO 2007/019404                                                       PCT/US2006/030638
                                              6
  prices are met, the market maker will immediately buy for and/or sell from its own
  accounts. According to certain embodiments, a single trading order 12 may be filled by a
  number of market makers at potentially different prices.
           A customer may be any user of trading system 10 that is not a market maker. A
  customer may be an individual investor, an agent acting on behalf of a principal, a
  principal, an individual, a legal entity (such as a corporation), or any machine or
  mechanism that is capable of placing and/or responding to trading orders 12 in system 10.
           In some embodiments, market makers may include individuals, firms or other
  entities that are granted particular privileges such that trading orders 12 received from
  such individuals, finns or other entities are treated as being received from a traditional
  market maker (such as a brokerage or bank, for example).              For example, certain
  individuals, firms or other entities that may otherwise be treated as customers may be
   granted privileges to be treated as market makers for the purposes of the systems and
  methods discussed herein. To receive market maker privileges, an individual, firm or
   other entity may be required to pay a fee, pay a commission, or submit and/or
   simultaneously maintain both bid and offer trading orders 12 for particular instruments.
   According to certain embodiments, an individual, firm or other entity may be designated
   as a market maker for particular instruments but as a customer for other instruments.
            In some embodiments, a multi-tiered system of market makers may be employed.
   Trading platform 50 may grant different privileges to different market makers based on
   one or more criteria such as, for example, whether the market maker is associated with an
   electronic feed, whether the market maker is a strong trader, or whether the market maker
   has particular infonnation. Market makers may be categorized into different tiers for
   different tradable instruments. For instance, a particular market maker may be categorized
5  as a first-level market maker for instrument(s) for which that market maker is a strong
   trader and as a second-level market maker for other types of instruments.
             Clients 20 may be communicatively coupled to trading platform 50 via network 30.
   Network 30 is a communication platform operable to exchange data or information
   between clients 20 and trading platform 50 and/or market centers 40. According to certain
0   embodiments, a particular network 30 may represent an Internet architecture which
   provides clients 20 with the ability to communicate trading or transaction infonnation to
    trading platform 50 and/or market centers 40. According to certain embodiments, network

30 comprises a plain old telephone system (POTS), which traders 70 may use to perform
the same operations and functions. Transactions may be assisted by a broker associated
with trading platform 50 or manually keyed into a telephone or other suitable electronic
device to request that a transaction be executed. In certain embodiments, network 30 may
be any packet data network (PDN) offering a communications interface or exchange
between any two nodes in system 10. Network 30 may further comprise any combination
of the above examples and any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network
(MAN), wide area network (WAN), wireless local area network (WLAN), virtual private
network (VPN), intranet, or any other appropriate architecture or system that facilitates
communications between clients 20 and trading platform 50 and/or market centers 40.
        Market centers 40 comprise all manner of order execution venues including
 exchanges, Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs), Alternative Trading Systems
(ATSs), market makers, or any other suitable market participants. Each market center 40
may maintain a bid and offer price for a given trading product by standing ready, willing,
and able to buy or sell that trading product at publicly quoted prices, also referred to as
market center prices. Different market centers 40 may provide different market center
prices for particular trading products. For example, a particular market center 40 may
offer a particular bid price and/or offer price for a particular trading product, while another
market center 40 may offer a different bid price and/or offer price for the same trading
product. A particular market center 40 may charge a transaction cost to execute trading
orders 12 that remain in the order books of that market center 40 for more than a certain
length of time. Market centers 40 may be communicatively coupled to trading platform 50
via network 30.
        Trading platfonn 50 is a trading architecture that facilitates the routing, matching,
and processing of trading orders 12. Trading platform 50 may comprise a management
center or a headquartering office for any person, business, or entity that seeks to route,
match, process, or fill trading orders 12. Accordingly, trading platform 50 may include
any suitable combination of hardware, software, personnel, devices, components,
elements, or objects that may be utilized or implemented to achieve the operations and
functions of an administrative body or a supervising entity that manages or administers a
trading environment.      In certain embodiments, trading platform 50 comprises client
interface 52, market interface 54, processor 56, and memory module 60.

        Trading platform 50 is generally operable to route, process, transmit, and execute
trading orders 12 from traders 70 and/or market centers 40. Trading platform 50 may
allow trader 70 to submit trading order 12 comprising a display portion and a reserve
portion. Upon receiving trading order 12, trading platform 50 may immediately disclose
the display portion of trading order 12 to other traders 70 and/or to market centers 40. The
disclosure of the display portion of trading order 12 may be achieved by transmitting,
broadcasting, and/or displaying the display portion of trading order 12 to clients 20
associated with other traders 70 and/or to market centers 40. In contrast to the display
portion of trading order 12, trading platform 50 may limit or prevent the disclosure of the
reserve portion of trading order 12. In some embodiments, trading platform 50 may not
disclose the reserve portion of trading order 12 until one or more conditions are satisfied.
For example, trading platform 50 may be configured to not disclose the reserve portion of
trading order 12 until the display portion of trading order 12 is filled. As a another
example, trading platform 50 may be configured to not disclose the reserve portion of
trading order 12 until the volume of trading in trading system 10 reaches a configurable
threshold. It should be understood that the condition(s) for disclosing the reserve portion
of trading order 12 may be based on market data, time, trader preferences, thresholds, or
any number and combination of suitable criteria.
        Generally, trading platform 50 is operable to process trading orders 12 by filling
orders 12a with one or more corresponding counterorders 12b. Filling an order 12a refers
to matching, satisfying, filling, or exhausting that order 12a with one or more
corresponding counterorders 12b. For example, if a particular order 12a is a buy order for
product A with a display portion of 100 shares and if the counterorder 12b is a sell order
of 500 shares of product A, then using counterorder 12b to fill the display portion of order
12a may comprise routing, assigning, earmarking, or transferring 100 shares of product A
from counterorder 12b to the particular trader 70 associated with order 12a.
        In some instances, trader 70 may designate the entirety of trading order 12 as the
display portion. In other instances, trader 70 may designate part of a particular trading
order 12 as the display portion and the remaining part of the particular trading order 12 as
the reserve portion. In some embodiments, trader 70 may perceive that disclosure of the
entire trading order 12 to other traders 70 might adversely affect market prices for the
particular trading product. To reduce such a risk, trader 70 may choose to designate only

  WO 2007/019404                                                       PCT/US2006/030638
                                              9
part of trading order 12 as the display portion. By allowing traders 70 to configure trading
orders 12 with display portions and reserve portions, trading platform 50 may assist
traders 70 in managing the risks of trading.
        Trading platform 50 is further operable to monitor the sequence in which trading
orders 12 are received from traders 70 and/or market makers 40. In particular, trading
platform 50 may fill the display portions of trading orders 12 according to the sequence in
which trading orders 12 are received.       In some embodiments, after filling the display
portions of trading orders 12, trading platform 50 may exclusively offer at least a portion
of a particular counterorder 12b to a particular trader 12. The particular trader 70 that is
exclusively offered a portion of counterorder 12b may be referred to as the "priority
trader" 70. In some embodiments, trading platform 50 determines the priority trader 70
based on the order in which trading platform 50 received trading orders 12.
        The exclusive offer of counterorder 12b to priority trader 70 may last for a
configurable period of time. This configurable period of time may be referred to as a
priority period 82. The length of priority period 82 may be determined based on current
market data, trader preferences, predetermined parameters,           or any number and
combination of suitable criteria.
        Trading platform 50 may comprise client interface 52, market interface 54,
processor 56, and memory module 60. Client interface 52 of trading platform 50 is
communicatively coupled to network 30 and supports communications between clients 20
and the various components of trading platform 50. According to certain embodiments,
client interface 52 comprises a transaction server that receives trading orders 12
communicated by clients 20 via network 30.
        Market interface 54 is communicatively coupled to market centers 40 and supports
communications between market centers 40 and the various components of trading
platform 50. Market interface 54 may comprise a transaction server that receives trading
orders 12 communicated by market centers 40. Market interface 54 may be operable to
send to market centers 40 trading orders 12 received from clients 20 communicatively
coupled directly to trading platfonn 50.
        Client interface 52 and market interface 54 are communicatively coupled to
processor 56. Processor 56 is operable to record trading orders 12 in memory module 60
and route trading orders 12 to market centers 40. Processor 56 is further operable to

  execute rules 62 stored in memory module 60 to match orders 12a and counterorders 12b
  received by trading platform 50. Processor 56 may comprise any suitable combination of
  hardware and/or software implemented in one or more modules to provide the described
  function or operation. Processor 56 may be communicatively coupled to memory module
  60.
            Memory module 60 comprises any suitable arrangement of random access memory
   (RAM), read only memory (ROM), magnetic computer disk, CD-ROM, or other magnetic
   or optical storage media, or any other volatile or non-volatile memory devices that store
   one or more files, lists, tables, or other arrangements of information such as trading orders
   12. Although FIGURE 1 illustrates memory module 60 as internal to trading platform 50,
   it should be understood that memory module 60 may be internal or external to components
   of trading system 10, depending on particular implementations. Also, memory module 60
   may be separate from or integral to other memory devices to achieve any suitable
    arrangement of memory devices for use in trading system 10. According to certain
    embodiments, memory module 60 may store rules 62 and trading orders 12.
             Rules 62 comprises software instructions for routing, matching, processing, and/or
    filling trading orders 12. Processor 56 is operable to execute rules 62 to match orders 12a
    and counterorders 12b. Rules 62 may further comprise instructions for managing the
    sequence in which trading orders 12 are filled and for initiating one or more priority
    periods 82 for priority trader 70.
             It should be understood that the internal structure of trading platform 50 and the
    interfaces, processors, and memory devices associated therewith is malleable and can be
    readily changed, modified, rearranged, or reconfigured to achieve the intended operations
     of trading platform 50.
             In operation, trading platform 50 may manage the sequence in which counterorders
     12b are used to fill the display portions and reserve portions of orders 12a. In particular,
     trading platform 50 may receive from traders 70 a plurality of orders 12a for a particular
     trading product. Trading platform 50 may monitor and record the sequence in which
     orders 12a are received. Trading platform 50 may further monitor and record which
D    traders 70 are associated with which orders 12a. Trading platform 50 may subsequently
     receive a particular counterorder 12b for the particular trading product. Trading platform
     50 may use the particular counterorder 12b to fill the display portions of each of the

  WO 2007/019404                                                          PCT/US2006/030638
                                             11
received orders 12a according to the sequence in which trading platform 50 received
orders 12a. In other words, trading platform 50 may fill the display portion of a particular
order 12a according to when that particular order 12a was received relative to the other
orders 12a.
        In some embodiments, if counterorder 12b is sufficient to fill the display portions
of each of the received orders 12a, then trading platform 50 may designate the particular
trader 70 that submitted the first order 12a as the priority trader 70. Trading platform 50
may initiate priority period 82 with respect to the priority trader 70. During priority period
 82, trading platform 50 may exclusively offer all or part of the remaining portion of
counterorder 12b to the priority trader 70. Exclusively offering all or part of the remaining
portion of counterorder 12b may comprise making available, transmitting, or otherwise
disclosing the remaining portion of counterorder 12b to the priority trader 70 without
making available the remaining portion of counterorder 12 to the other traders 70 in
trading system 10. In some embodiments, during priority period 82, trading platform 50
may not allow any trader 70 in trading system 10, besides the priority trader 70, to aggress
against or to execute a trade involving the remaining portion of counterorder 12b. If, prior
to the expiration of priority period 82, the priority trader 70 does not accept the portion of
counterorder 12b exclusively offered, then trading platform 50 may disclose and/or make
available to other traders 70 the remaining portion of counterorder 12b.              In some
embodiments, once priority period 82 expires, trading platform 50 may no longer consider
the particular trader 70 to whom the exclusive offer was made to be the priority trader 70.
        The display portion of a particular trading order 12 from a particular trader 70 may
be determined based on one or more trader preferences 84 associated with the particular
trader 70. In some embodiments, the one or more trader preferences 84 may be stored in
one or more clients 20 associated with the particular trader 70. For example, trader 70
may input into client 20 trading order 12 for a total quantity of a particular trading product.
Based at least in part on the one or more trader preferences 84 associated with trader 70,
client 20 may automatically detennine how much of the total quantity of trading order 12
to designate as the display portion and how much of the total quantity of trading order 12
to designate as the reserve portion. Trader preferences 84 may be based on any number
and combination of suitable criteria. For example, trader 70 may be associated with trader
preference 84 to set the display portion equal to a configurable percentage of the total

   WO 2007/019404                                                         PCT/US2006/030638
                                             12
 quantity of trading order 12. In addition, or alternatively, trader preferences 84 may be
 based on configurable thresholds, current market data, trader history, or any number and
 combination of suitable criteria. The foregoing example describes client 20 as storing and
 using trader preferences 84 to automatically determine the display portion of trading order
 12. It should be understood that these functions may be performed by trading platform 50
 or by any other suitable component of trading system 10 without changing the function
 and operation of trading system 10.
         Trading platform 50 may be further operable to determine how much of a
 particular counterorder 12b to offer to the priority trader 70 during priority period 82. In
 particular, trading platform 50 may use one or more trader preferences 84 associated with
 trader 70 that submitted the particular counterorder 12b to determine how much of the
 particular counterorder 12b to offer during priority period 82. For example, trader 70
 associated with counterorder 12b may be associated with trader preference 84 to offer the
 entire remaining portion of counterorder 12b during priority period 82.           As another
 example, trader 70 associated with counterorder 12b may be associated with trader
preference 84 to offer a configurable percentage of the remaining portion of counterorder
 12b during priority period 82.     It should be understood that trader preferences 84 for
 determining how much of counterorder 12 to offer during the priority period may be based
on market activity, configurable thresholds, trading histories, or any number and
 combination of suitable criteria.
         In some embodiments, trading platform 50 may be operable to extend priority
period 82 associated with a priority trader 70.       In particular, if the priority trader 70
accepts, during priority period 82, the portion of counterorder 12b exclusively offered by
trading platform 50, then trading platform 50 may extend priority period 82 for a
configurable period of time. During the extended priority period, trading platform 50 may
offer to the priority trader 70 an additional part of the remaining portion of counterorder
 12b and/or may offer to the priority trader 70 one or more follow-on counterorders 12b. A
follow-on counterorder 12b refers to a particular counterorder 12b received by trading
platform 50 after the initial counterorder 12b. A follow-on counterorder 12b may be from
the same trader 70 that submitted the initial counterorder 12b or from a different trader 70.
According to certain embodiments, the priority trader 70 may retain priority status (e.g.,
extend priority period 82) for as long as the priority trader 70 continues to accept the

   WO 2007/019404                                                         PCT/US2006/030638
                                              13
 exclusively offered counterorders 12b during an extendable priority period 82. In other
 embodiments, the priority trader 70 may not extend priority period 82 more than a
 configurable number of times (e.g., the priority trader 70 may not accept more than a
 configurable number of exclusively offered counterorders 12b before losing priority
 status).
           FIGURES 2A-2E illustrate example timelines for processing trading orders 12 in
 trading system 10.       Although the following examples describe trading orders 12 for a
 particular trading product, it should be understood that trading orders 12 may be for any
 suitable trading product such as, for example, currencies, financial instruments, stocks,
 bonds, futures contracts, equity securities, mutual funds, options, derivatives, commodities
 or any number and combination of suitable trading products.             It should be further
 understood that the example timelines illustrated in FIGURES 2A-2E are not drawn to
 scale. These timelines are intended to depict sequences of events according to certain
 embodiments.      Certain events that are depicted in the example timelines as occurring
 sequentially may, in some embodiments, occur substantially simultaneously.
          FIGURE 2A illustrates an example timeline for filling the display portions of
 orders 12a. In this example, trading platform 50 comprises two rules -- Rule 62a and 62b.
When trading platform 50 receives a plurality of orders 12a for a particular trading product
followed by counterorder 12b for the particular trading product, Rule 62a directs trading
platform 50 to use counterorder 12b to fill the display portion of each of the plurality of
orders 12a according to the sequence in which orders 12a were received by trading
platform 50. Once the display portions of the received orders 12a are filled, Rule 62b
directs trading platform 50 to exclusively offer, for priority period 82, any remaining
portion of counterorder 12b to the particular trader 70 associated with the first order 12a.
          In the present example, trading platform 50 receives from Trader A bid A for 110
shares of product X. Order A is configured with a display portion of 10 shares and a
reserve portion of 100 shares. Subsequently, trading platform 50 receives from Trader B
bid B for 110 shares of product X. Trading platform 50 then receives from Trader C bid C
for 110 shares of product X. Bids B and C are each configured with a display portion of
10 shares and a reserve portion of 100 shares. After receiving bid C, trading platform
receives from Trader D a particular counterorder 12b -- hit D -- of 500 shares of product
X.

   WO 2007/019404                                                         PCT/US2006/030638
                                              14
          In the present example, based on Rule 62a, trading platform 50 uses hit D to fill the
 display portions of bids A, B, and C based on the sequence in which trading platform 50
 received bids A, B, and C. Consequently, trading platform 50 fills the display portion of
 bid A with 10 shares of product X from hit D. Trading platform 50 then fills the display
 portion of bid B with 10 shares of product X from hit D. Trading platform 50 next fills the
 display portion of bid C with 10 shares of product X from hit D. In the present example,
 after filling the display portions of bids A, B, and C, trading platform 50, based on Rule
 62b, exclusively offers the remaining 470 shares of product X from hit D to Trader A. In
 this example, the exclusive offer of the remaining portion of hit D lasts for priority period
 82, according to Rule 62b. In this example, during priority period 82, trading platform 50
 does not disclose the 470 shares remaining in hit D to Traders B or C and/or does not
 allow Traders B or C to execute a trade involving the 470 remaining shares in hit D. Thus,
 Trader A has an exclusive opportunity during priority period 82 to execute a trade for the
 470 shares remaining in hit D. If priority period 82 expires without Trader A executing a
 trade for the 470 remaining shares in hit D, then trading platform 50 may allow Trader B
 and/or Trader C to trade with Trader D for the 470 shares remaining in hit D.
          Notably, upon submitting a particular order 12a to trading platform 50, a particular
 trader 70 may not know whether the particular order 12a will be the first such order 12a in
trading platform 50 that will be waiting to be filled. Thus, the particular trader 70 may not
know whether he or she will receive priority to fill the reserve portion of the particular
order 12a with counterorder 12b.       However, in the trading system 10 illustrated in the
foregoing example, the particular trader 70 may know that the display portion of his or her
order 12a will likely be filled prior to any other trader 70 receiving priority status. Thus,
the particular trader 70 may perceive an advantage in increasing the size of the display
portion of the particular order 12a. Thus, trading system 10 may encourage traders 70 to
submit orders 12a with larger display portions.     Receiving trading orders 12 with larger
display portions may result in greater transparency and liquidity in trading system 10.
         FIGURE 2B illustrates another example timeline for processing trading orders 12
in trading system 10.      In the present example, trading platform 50 is operable to give
priority status to trader 70 associated with counterorder 12b. As explained above, if the
priority trader 70 does not accept, prior to the expiration of priority period 82, the portion
of counterorder 12b exclusively offered, then the priority trader 70 may lose priority status

   WO 2007/019404                                                          PCT/US2006/030638
                                              15
  and trading platform 50 may make available to other traders 70 the remaining portion of
  counterorder 12b. Although the priority trader 70 may lose priority status by declining to
  execute a trade for the remaining portion of counterorder 12b, trading platform 50 may
  grant to trader 70 associated with counterorder 12b a priority status relative to other
 traders 70 that submit follow-on counterorders 12b.          The priority status of trader 70
  associated with counterorder 12b may be represented as a counter priority period 83.
          In the present example, trading platform 50 comprises four rules 62 -- Rules 62a,
  62b, 62c, and 62d. When trading platform 50 receives a plurality of orders 12a for a
 particular trading product followed by counterorder 12b for the particular trading product,
 Rule 62a directs trading platform 50 to use counterorder 12b to fill the display portion of
 each of the plurality of orders 12a according to the sequence in which orders 12a were
 received by trading platform 50. Once the display portions of the received orders 12a are
-filled, Rule 62b directs trading platform 50 to fill the reserve portion of each of the
 plurality of orders 12a according to the same sequence. Once the reserve portions of the
 received orders 12a are filled, Rule 62c directs trading platform 50 to exclusively offer to
 the priority trader 70, for an extendable priority period 82, any remaining portion of
 counterorder 12b in increments of 700 units.        Rule 62d directs trading platform 50 to
 initiate counter priority period 83 for the particular trader 70 associated with counterorder
 12b. In this example, counter priority period 83 is extendable for as long as the particular
 trader 70 demonstrates a willingness to continue trading for the particular trading product.
          In the present example, trading platform 50 receives from Trader A bid A for 330
 shares of product X. Bid A is configured with a display portion of 30 shares and a reserve
 portion of 300 shares. Trading platform 50 subsequently receives from Trader B bid B for
 300 shares of product X. Bid B is configured with a display portion of 50 shares and a
 reserve portion of 250 shares. Trading platform 50 then receives from Trader C bid C for
 250 shares of product X. Bid C is configured with a display portion of 50 shares and a
reserve portion of 200 shares.       After receiving bid C, trading platform receives from
 Trader D hit D of 2000 shares of product X.
         In the present example, based on Rule 62a, trading platform 50 uses hit D to fill the
 display portions of bids A, B, and C according to the sequence in which trading platform
 50 received bids A, B, and C. Thus, trading platform 50 uses hit D to fill the display
portions of bids A, B, and C with 30 shares, 50 shares, and 50 shares of product X,

   WO 2007/019404                                                        PCT/US2006/030638
                                             16
 respectively. Then, based on Rule 62b, trading platform 50 uses hit D to fill the reserve
 portions of bids A, B, and C according to the sequence in which trading platform 50
 received each bid. Thus, trading platform 50 uses hit D to fill the reserve portions of bids
 A, B, and D with 300 shares, 250 shares, and 200 shares of product X, respectively. At
 this point, 1120 shares of hit D remain.         Based on Rule 62c, trading platform 50
 exclusively offers to Trader A (for priority period 82) 700 shares of product X from hit D.
 In addition, based on Rule 62d, trading platform initiates an extendable counter priority
 period 83 for Trader D. In this example, during priority period 82, trading platform 50
 receives from Trader E a follow-on counterorder 12b -- hit E -- of 1000 shares of product
 X. In the present example, Trader A executes a trade for the 700 shares of product X prior
 to the expiration of priority period 82. As a result, based on Rules 62c and 62d, trading
platform 50 extends priority period 82 and counter priority period 83.            During the
 extended priority periods, trading platform 50 offers the remaining 420 shares of product
X from hit D to trader A. In the present example, prior to the expiration of extended
priority period 82, Trader A fails to execute a trade for the remaining 420 shares of
product X. As a result, Trader A loses priority status and is no longer considered by
trading platform 50 to be a priority trader 70.
         Counter priority period 83 of Trader D, however, is extended according to Rule
62d because Trader D has not declined to execute further trades for product X. Thus,
trading platform 50 may give priority to hit D from Trader D over hit E from Trader E.
Thus, trading platform 50 may offer the remaining 420 shares of hit D to Trader B and/or
Trader C before trading platform 50 executes a transaction involving a portion of hit E
from Trader E.
         FIGURE 2C illustrates yet another example timeline for processing trading orders
12. In this example, logic 62 in trading platform 50 comprises rules 62 for processing a
follow-on order 12a. If the received orders 12a are for a particular trading product, a
follow-on order 12a is an order 12a for the particular trading product that is received after
counterorder 12b. In the present example, trading platform 50 comprises six rules 62 -
Rules 62a-62f. Rule 62a directs trading platform 50 to use counterorder 12b to fill the
display portion of each of the plurality of orders 12a according to the sequence in which
the orders 12a were received by trading platform 50. Once the display portions of the
received orders 12a are filled, Rule 62b directs trading platform 50 to fill the reserve

  WO 2007/019404                                                         PCT/US2006/030638
                                             17
portion of each of the plurality of orders 12a according to the sequence in which the orders
 12a were received by trading platform 50. Once the reserve portions of the received
 orders 12a are filled, Rule 62c directs trading platform 50 to exclusively offer to the
priority trader 70, for a configurable priority period 82, any remaining portion of
 counterorder 12b. If the priority trader 70 does not accept during priority period 82 the
remaining portion of counterorder 12b, then Rule 62d directs trading platform 50 to use
the remaining portion of counterorder 12b to fill the displayed portions of any follow-on
orders 12a according to the sequence in which trading platform 50 received the follow-on
orders 12a. Once the display portions of the follow-on orders 12a are filled, Rule 62e
directs trading platform to use the remaining portion of counterorder 12b to fill the reserve
portion the follow-on orders 12a according to the sequence in which trading platform 50
received the follow-on orders 12a.         Rule 62f then directs trading platform 50 to
exclusively offer to trader 70 associated with the first follow-on order 12a, for a
configurable priority period 82, any remaining portion of counterorder 12b.
         In the present example, trading platform 50 receives from Trader A offer A of 110
shares of product X. Offer A is configured with a display portion of 10 shares and a
reserve portion of 100 shares. Subsequently, trading platform 50 receives from Trader B
offer B of 110 shares of product X. Trading platform 50 then receives from Trader C offer
C of 110 shares of product X. Offers B and C are each configured with a display portion
of 10 shares and a reserve portion of 100 shares. After receiving offer C, trading platform
receives from Trader D a particular counterorder 12b -- take D -- for 500 shares of product
X.
         In the present example, based on Rule 62a, trading platform 50 uses take D to
satisfy the display portions of offers A, B, and C (i.e., 10 shares each) based on the
sequence in which trading platform 50 received offers A, B, and C. Based on Rule 62b,
after satisfying the display portions of offers A, B, and C, trading platform 50 uses take D
to satisfy the reserve portions of offers A, B, and C (i.e., 100 shares each) based on the
sequence in which trading platform 50 received offers A, B, and C. At this point, the
remaining portion of take D is 170 shares.        Based on Rule 62c, trading platform 50
exclusively offers to Trader A for priority period 82 the remaining portion of take D.
During priority period 82, trading platform 50 receives from Trader E a particular follow-

  WO 2007/019404                                                         PCT/US2006/030638
                                              18
 on order 12a -- offer E -- for 70 shares of product X. Offer E is configured with a display
 portion of 10 shares and a reserve portion of 60 shares.
         In the present example, Trader A fails to execute a trade for the remaining portion
 of take D prior to the expiration of priority period 82. Consequently, Trader A loses
 priority status. Based on Rules 62d and 62e, trading platform 50 then uses the remaining
 portion of take D to satisfy the display portion and the reserve portion of offer E (i.e., 10
 shares and 60 shares, respectively). At this point, the remaining portion of take D is 100
 shares. Based on Rule 62f, trading platform 50 then exclusively offers to Trader E, for
 priority period 82, the remaining portion of take D.
         FIGURE 2D illustrates yet another example timeline for processing trading orders
 12. In this example, trading platform 50 comprises rules 62 for processing a follow-on
 counterorder 12b.     As explained above, a follow-on counterorder 12b is a particular
 counterorder 12b received by trading platform 50 after the initial counterorder 12b.
         In the present example, trading platform 50 comprises four rules -- Rules 62a-62d.
Rule 62a directs trading platform 50 to use counterorder 12b to fill the display portion of
 each of the plurality of orders 12a according to the sequence in which the orders 12a were
received by trading platform 50. Once the display portions of the received orders 12a are
filled, Rule 62b directs trading platform 50 to fill the reserve portion of each of the
plurality of orders 12a according to the sequence in which the orders 12a were received by
trading platform 50. Once the reserve portions of the received orders 12a are filled, Rule
62c directs trading platform 50 to exclusively offer to the priority trader 70, for a
configurable priority period 82, any remaining portion of counterorder 12b. Rule 62d
directs that, if counterorder 12b filled the display portions of all received orders 12a but
was exhausted prior to filling the reserved portion of the first order 12a, trading platform
50 uses a follow-on counterorder 12b to fill the reserve portion of the first order 12a and
then exclusively offers, for a configurable priority period 82, any remaining portion of the
follow-on counterorder to the particular trader 70 associated with the first order 12a.
         In the present example, trading platform 50 receives from Trader A bid A for 110
shares of product X. Order A is configured with a display portion of 10 shares and a
reserve portion of 100 shares. Subsequently, trading platfonn 50 receives from Trader B
bid B for 110 shares of product X. Trading platform 50 then receives from Trader C bid C
for 110 shares of product X. Bids B and C are each configured with a display portion of

  WO 2007/019404                                                         PCT/US2006/030638
                                              19
 10 shares and a reserve portion of 100 shares. After receiving bid C, trading platform
 receives from Trader D a particular counterorder 12b -- hit D -- of 30 shares of product X.
         In the present example, based on Rule 62a, trading platform 50 uses all 30 shares
 of hit D to fill the display portions of bids A, B, and C (i.e., 10 shares each).
 Subsequently, trading platform 50 receives from Trader E a follow-on counterorder 12b -
 hit E -- of 400 shares of product X. Based on Rule 62d, trading platform 50 uses 100
 shares of hit E to fill the reserve portion of bid A. Trading platform 50 then exclusively
 offers, for priority period 82, the remaining 300 shares of product X from hit E to Trader
 A.
         FIGURE 2E illustrates yet another example timeline for processing trading orders
 12 according to certain embodiments. In this example, trading platform 50 may process
 multiple follow-on counterorders 12b.        In the present example, trading platform 50
 comprises the same four rules (Rules 62a-62d) described above with respect to FIGURE
 2D. In addition, trading platform 50 comprises Rule 62e, which directs trading platform
 50 to exclusively offer for priority period 82 to the priority trader 70 any follow-on
 counterorders 12b received after the first follow-on counterorder 12b and prior to the end
 of priority period 82.
         The circumstances of the present example are the same as described above with
respect to FIGURE 2D. In this example, however, during priority period 82 involving
 Trader A and Trader E, trading platform 50 receives from Trader F a follow-on
 counterorder 12b -- hit F -- of 100 shares of product X. As a result, based on Rule 62e,
trading platform 50 offers, during priority period 82, the 100 shares from hit F to Trader A
in addition to the 100 shares from hit E.
         In the examples illustrated in FIGURES 2A-2E, orders 12a and counterorders 12b
were for shares of product X. It should be understood, however, that orders 12a and
counterorders 12b may be for any suitable trading product such as, for example,
currencies, financial instruments, stocks, bonds, futures contracts, equity securities, mutual
funds, options, derivatives, commodities or any number and combination of suitable
trading products.
         The foregoing examples illustrate orders 12a and counterorders 12b that are bids,
offers, hits, and takes.       It should be understood, however, that orders 12a and
counterorders 12b may be any suitable type of trading order 12 such as, for example, buy

                                                20
  orders, sell orders, market orders, limit orders, stop loss orders, day orders, open orders,
  GTC ("good till cancelled") orders, "good through" orders, "all or none" orders, "any
  part" orders, or any other suitable order for trading.
           The example timelines illustrated in FIGURES 2A-2E are not drawn to scale.
  These timelines are intended to depict sequences of events according to certain
  embodiments. It should be understood that certain events that are depicted in the timelines
  as occurring sequentially may, in some embodiments, occur substantially simultaneously.
  It will be further understood that the events depicted in these timelines may be separated
  by any amount of time or may occur substantially simultaneously. For example, the filling
  of the display portion of the bid B may occur simultaneously with, microseconds after,
  minutes after, or any suitable amount of time after the filling of the display portion of bid
  A.
           The foregoing examples illustrates orders 12a and counterorders 12b that are for
  particular quantities of a trading product. It should be understood, however, that orders
  12a and counterorders 12b may be for any suitable quantities of any suitable trading
  products.
           In some of the foregoing examples, the priority trader 70 responded to an exclusive
  offer by accepting the offered portion of counterorder 12b.          In some embodiments,
  however, the priority trader 70 may respond to an exclusive offer of a portion of
  counterorder     12b by requesting from the counterparty trader 70 associated with
  counterorder 12b an amount greater than the portion of counterorder 12b that is
  exclusively offered.     According to certain embodiments, if the counterparty trader 70
  fulfills the request for the greater amount, than the counterparty trader 70 retains priority
  status (e.g., counter priority period 83 is extended), but if the counterparty trader 70 does
5 not fulfill the request for the greater amount, then the counterparty trader 70 loses priority
  (e.g., counter priority period 83 is not extended).
           FIGURES 3A to 3D illustrate a flowchart for matching trading orders 12.          The
  method starts at step 602 where trading platform 50 receives one or more orders 12a. At
  step 604, processor 56 categorizes orders 12a according to the trading product associated
3 with each order 12a. At step 606, processor 56 stores orders 12a in memory module 60 in
  accordance with the sequence in which trading platform 50 received each order 12a. At
  step 608, trading platform 50 receives counterorder 12b for a particular trading product.

  WO 2007/019404                                                           PCT/US2006/030638
                                              21
 Processor 56 identifies those orders 12a in memory module 50 that are associated with the
 same trading product as counterorder 12b. The orders 12a identified by processor 56 may
be referred to as "identified" orders 12a.
          At step 610, processor 56 matches counterorder 12b with the display portion of the
 first identified order 12a. The first identified order 12a is the first order 12a received by
trading platform 50 for the same trading product as counterorder 12b. At decisional step
 612, processor 56 determines whether the display portion of each identified order 12a has
been filled. If the display portion of each identified order 12a has not been filled, then at
decisional step 614 processor 56 determines whether there is any remaining portion of
 counterorder 12b.      If processor 56 determines that there is no remaining portion of
counterorder 12b at decisional step 614, then the method ends. However, if processor 56
determines that there is a remaining portion of counterorder 12b at decisional step 614,
then at step 616 processor 56 matches the remaining portion of counterorder 12b with the
display portion of the next identified order 12a. The next identified order 112 is the
particular identified order 12a that was next received by trading platform 50 and that has
not yet had its display portion filled. Once processor 56 matches the remaining portion of
counterorder 12b with the display portion of the next identified order 12a, the method
returns to decisional step 612.
          If processor 56 detennines at decisional step 612 that the display potions of each
identified order 12a has been filled, then at decisional step 618 processor 56 determines
whether there is any remaining portion of counterorder 12b. If processor 56 determines at
decisional step 618 that there is no remaining portion of counterorder 12b, then the method
proceeds to step 634. However, if processor 56 determines at decisional step 618 that
there is a remaining portion of counterorder 12b, then at step 620 processor 56 matches the
remaining portion of counterorder 12b with the reserve portion of the first identified order
12a. At decisional step 622, processor 56 detennines whether the reserve portions of each
identified order 12a has been filled. If processor 56 detennines at decisional step 622 that
the reserve portions of each identified order 12a has not been filled, then at decisional step
624 processor 56 detennines whether there is any remaining portion of counterorder 12b.
         If processor 56 determines at decisional step 624 that there is no remaining portion
of counterorder 12b, then the method proceeds to step 634. However, if processor 56
determines at decisional 624 that there is a remaining portion of counterorder 12b, then at

  WO 2007/019404                                                         PCT/US2006/030638
                                               22
 step 626 processor 56 matches the remaining portion of counterorder 12b with the reserve
 portion of the next identified order 12a. The method then returns back to decisional step
 622.
          If processor 56 detennines at decisional step 622 that the reserve portions of all
 identified orders 12a have been filled, then at decisional step 628 processor 56 determines
 whether there is any remaining portion of counterorder 12b. If processor 56 determines at
 decisional step 628 that there is no remaining portion of counterorder 12b, then the method
 proceeds to step 634. However, if processor 56 determines at decisional step 628 that
 there is a remaining portion of counterorder 12b, then at step 630 processor 56 exclusively
 offers for priority period 82 the remaining portion of counterorder 12b to the particular
 trader 70 associated with the first identified order 12a.
         At decisional step 632, processor 56 determines whether trader 70 associated with
 the first identified order 12a accepted during priority period 82 the exclusive offer of the
 remaining portion of counterorder 12b. If processor 56 determines at decisional step 632
 that trader 70 associated with the first identified order 12a did not accept the exclusive
 offer during priority period 82, then the method continues to decisional step 640.
However, if processor 56 determines at decisional step 632 that trader 70 associated with
the first identified order 12a accepted the exclusive offer during priority period 82, then
the method proceeds to step 634.
         At step 634, trading platform 50 receives the next counterorder 12b. At decisional
step 636, processor 56 determines whether the reserve portion of the first identified order
 12a has been filled. If processor 56 determines at decisional step 636 that the reserve
portion of the first identified order 12a has been filled, then the method proceeds to step
638. However, if processor 56 determines at decisional step 636 that the reserve portion
of the first identified order 12a has not been filled, then at step 640 processor 56 matches
the next counterorder 12b to the reserve portion of the first identified order 12a.        At
decisional step 642, processor 56 determines whether there is any remaining portion of the
next counterorder 12b. If processor 56 detennines at decisional step 642 that there is no
remaining portion of the next counterorder 12b, then the method returns back to step 634.
However, if processor 56 determines at decisional step 642 that there is a remaining
portion of the next counterorder 12b, then at step 638 processor 56 exclusively offers for

  WO 2007/019404                                                         PCT/US2006/030638
                                              23
 priority period 82 the next counterorder 12b to trader 70 associated with the first identified
 order 12a.
          At decisional step 644, processor 56 determines whether trader 70 associated with
 the first identified order 12a accepted the exclusive offer of the next counterorder 12b
 during priority period 82. If processor 56 determines at decisional step 644 that trader 70
 associated with the first identified order 12a accepted the exclusive offer during priority
 period 82, then the method returns back to step 634. However, if processor 56 determines
 at decisional step 644 that trader 70 associated with the first identified order 12a did not
 accept the exclusive offer during priority period 82, then at step 646 processor 56 matches
 the next counterorder 12b with the next identified order 12a or any follow-on orders 12a.
          Returning to decisional step 632, if the processor 56 determines at that step that
 trader 70 associated with the first identified order 12a did not accept the exclusive offer
 during priority period 82, then at decisional step 648 processor 56 determines whether the
 reserve portion of all identified orders 12a have been filled. If processor 56 determines at
 decisional step 648 that the reserve portions of all identified orders 12a have not been
 filled, then at step 650 processor 56 matches the remaining portion of counterorder 12b
with the reserve portion of the next identified order 12a. At decisional step 652, processor
 56 determines whether there is any remaining portion of counterorder 12b. If processor 56
determines at decisional step 652 that there is no remaining portion of counterorder 12b,
then the method ends. However, if processor 56 determines at decisional step 652 that
there is a remaining portion of counterorder 12b, then the method returns back to
decisional step 648.
          At decisional step 648, if processor 56 determines that the reserve portions of all
identified orders 12a have been filled, then at step 654 processor 56 matches the remaining
portion of counterorder 12b with the display portion of follow-on buy orders 12a
associated with the same trading product as counterorder 12b. At decisional step 656,
processor 56 determines whether there is any remaining portion of counterorder 12b. If
processor 56 determines at decisional step 656 that there is no remaining portion of
counterorder 12b, then the method ends.           However, if processor 56 determines at
decisional step 656 that there is a remaining portion of counterorder 12b, then at step 658
processor 56 matches the remaining portion of counterorder 12b to the reserve portions of
follow-on orders 12a.

  WO 2007/019404                                                         PCT/US2006/030638
                                            24
         At decisional step 660, processor 56 determines whether there is any remaining
 portion of counterorder 12b. If processor 56 determines at decisional step 660 that there is
 no remaining portion of counterorder 12b, then the method ends. However, if processor
 56 determines at decisional step 660 that there is a remaining portion of counterorder 12b,
 then at step 662 processor 56 exclusively offers for a priority period the remaining portion
 of counterorder 12b to, trader 70 associated with the first follow-on order 12a.          At
 decisional step 664, processor 56 determines whether trading platform 50 has received an
 additional follow-on counterorder 12b. If processor 56 determines at decisional step 664
 that trading platform 50 has not received an additional follow-on counterorder 12b, then
 the method proceeds to decisional step 670.       However, if processor 56 determines at
 decisional step 664 that trading platform 50 has received an additional follow-on
 counterorder 12b, then at step 668 processor 56 exclusively offers for priority period 82
the additional follow-on counterorder 12b to trader 70 associated with the first follow-on
 order 12a.
         At decisional step 670, processor 56 determines whether trader 70 associated with
the first follow-on order 12a accepted the exclusive offer during priority period 82.       If
processor 56 determines at decisional step 670 that trader 70 associated with the first
follow-on order 12a did not accept the exclusive offer during priority period 82, then at
step 672 processor 56 matches the exclusively offered counterorder(s) 12b (follow-on or
otherwise) to the next follow-on order(s) 12a.         However, if at decisional step 670
processor 56 determines that trader 70 associated with the first follow-on order 12a
accepted the exclusive offer during priority period 82, then at step 672 processor 56 waits
to receive the next follow-on counterorder 12b. The method then returns back to step 668.
         Although the present invention has been described in several embodiments, a
myriad of changes and modifications may be suggested to one skilled in the art, and it is
intended that the present invention encompass such changes and modifications as fall
within the scope of the present appended claims.
