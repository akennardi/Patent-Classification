                 NOVEL a4p7 PEPTIDE DIMER ANTAGONISTS
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]          The present invention relates to novel compounds having activity useful for
treating conditions which arise or are exacerbated by integrin binding, pharmaceutical
compositions comprising the compounds, methods of treatment using the compounds, and
methods of blocking or disrupting integrin binding.
[0001A]         This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013329135, the
entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]          Integrins are noncovalently associated a/p heterodimeric cell surface receptors
involved in numerous cellular processes ranging from cell adhesion and migration to gene
regulation (Dubree, et al., Selective a4j7 Integrin Antagonist and Their Potential as
Antiinflammatory Agents, J Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 3451-3457). Differential expression of
integrins can regulate a cell's adhesive properties, allowing different leukocyte populations to
be recruited to specific organs in response to different inflammatory signals.            If left
unchecked, integrins-mediated adhesion process can lead to chronic inflammation and
autoimmune disease.
[0003]          The a4 integrins, a4pl and a4p7, play essential roles in lymphocyte migration
throughout the gastrointestinal tract. They are expressed on most leukocytes, including B and
T lymphocytes, where they mediate cell adhesion via binding to their respective primary
ligands, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), and mucosal addressin cell adhesion
molecule (MAdCAM), respectively. The proteins differ in binding specificity in that VCAM
binds both a4pl and to a lesser extent a4p7, while MAdCAM is highly specific for a4p7.In
addition to pairing with the a4 subunit, the B7 subunit also forms a heterodimeric complex
with aE subunit to form aEB7, which is primarily expressed on intraepithelial lymphocytes
(IEL) in the intestine, lung and genitourinary tract. aEB7 is also expressed on dendritic cells
in the gut. The aEB7 heterodimer binds to E-cadherin on the epithelial cells. The IEL cells
are thought to provide a mechanism for immune surveillance within the epithelial
compartment. Therefore, blocking aEB7 and a4B7 together may be a useful method for
treating inflammatory conditions of the intestine
                                            -Page 1-

[00041          Inhibitors of specific integrins-ligand interactions have been shown effective
as anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases. For example,
monoclonal antibodies displaying high binding affinity for a4p7 have displayed therapeutic
benefits for gastrointestinal auto-inflammatory/autoimmune          diseases, such as Crohn's
disease, and ulcerative colitis. Id. However, these therapies interfered with a4pl integrin
ligand interactions thereby resulting in dangerous side effects to the patient.       Therapies
utilizing small molecule antagonists have shown similar side effects in animal models,
thereby preventing further development of these techniques.
[0005]          Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an integrin antagonist molecule
having high affinity for the a4p7 integrin and high selectivity against the a4pl integrin, as a
therapy for various gastrointestinal autoimmune diseases.
[0006]          Such an integrin antagonist molecule is disclosed herein.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[00071          The present invention has been developed in response to the present state of
the art, and in particular, in response to the problems and needs in the art that have not yet
been fully solved by currently available integrin antagonists that are selective for a4p7.
Thus, the present invention provides a4p7 antagonist dimer peptides for use as anti
inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive agents.          Further, the present invention provides
a4p7 antogonist dimer peptide for use in treating a condition that is associated with a
biological function of a4p7 to tissues expressing MAdCAM.
[0008]          The invention relates to a novel class of peptidic compounds exhibiting
integrin antagonist activity. The present invention further relates to a novel class of peptidic
compounds exhibiting high specificity for a4p7 integrin.            Compounds of the present
invention comprise two paired subunits that are linked together by their C- or N-terminus via
a linking moiety.    Each subunit of the present invention further comprises two natural or
unnatural amino acids that are capable of bridging to form a cyclized structure. Thus, the
compounds of the present invention comprise dimerized peptides, each subunit of the dimer
forming a cyclized structure through at least one of a disulfide salt bridge, an amide bond, or
an equivalent connection. This feature provides increased stability to the compound when
administered orally as a therapeutic agent.        This feature further provides for increased
specificity and potency as compared to non-cyclized analogs.

embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings. Understanding that
these drawings depict only typical embodiments of the invention and are not therefore to be
considered to be limiting of its scope, the invention will be described and explained with
additional specificity and detail through the use of the accompanying drawings in which:

[0021]          Figure 3 is a chart demonstrating stability data for integrin antagonist
homodimer molecules represented by SEQ ID NOs: 39, 57, 82, 102 and 121 in accordance

SEQUENCE LISTING
[0023]          The amino acid sequences listed in the accompanying sequence listing are
shown using three letter code for amino acids, as defined in 37 C.F.R. 1.822.           Only the
monomer subunit sequences are shown, however it is understood that the monomer subunits
                                             -Page 6-

are dimerized to form peptide dimer molecules, in accordance with the present teaching and
as shown generally in Figures 1 and 2.         The monomer subunits may be dimerized by a
suitable linker moiety, as defined herein. Some of the monomer subunits are shown having
C- and N-termini that both comprise free amine. Thus, a user must modify the monomer
subunit to eliminate either the C- or N-terminal free amine, thereby permitting dimerization at
the remaining free amine. Thus, some of the monomer subunits comprise both a free carboxy
terminal and a free amino terminal, whereby a user may selectively modify the subunit to
achieve dimerization at a desired terminus.        Therefore, one having skill in the art will
appreciate that the monomer subunits of the instant invention may be selectively modified to
achieve a single, specific amine for a desired dimerization.
[0024]           It is further understood that the C-terminal residues of the monomer subunits
disclosed herein are amides, unless otherwise indicated.          Further, it is understood that
dimerization at the C-terminal is facilitated by using a suitable amino acid with a side chain
having amine functionality, as is generally understood in the art. Regarding the N-terminal
residues, it is generally understood that dimerization may be achieved through the free amine
of the terminal residue, or may be achieved by using a suitable amino acid side chain having
a free amine, as is generally understood in the art.
[0025]           In the accompanying sequence listing:
[00261           SEQ ID NO: 1 shows a monomer subunit of a dimer compound of Formula
(I).
[00271           SEQ ID NO: 2 shows a monomer subunit of a dimer compound of Formula
(II).
[00281           SEQ ID NOs: 3-38, 49, 57-71, 76-117 and 124-136 show amino acid
sequences of monomer subunits that are dimerized to form various dimer compounds in
accordance with the present invention, wherein these sequences have been substituted with an
N-methylated arginine.
[0029]           SEQ ID NOs: 39-44, 58-65, 67-71, 74-76, 82, 83, 85, 86, 100-114, and 116
136 show amino acid sequences of monomer subunits that are dimerized at their respective
C-termini to form various dimer compounds in accordance with the present invention.

[00301          SEQ ID NOs: 45-57, 66, 72-73, 77-81, 84, 87-99 and 115 show amino acid
sequences of monomer subunits that are dimerized at their respective N-termini to form
various dimer compounds in accordance with the present invention.

[0072]         Dimer Structure and Biolovical Activity
[0073]         The present invention provides various novel antagonist disulfide peptide
dimers.    These compounds have been tested to more clearly characterize the increased
affinity for a4p7 binding, increased selectivity against a4p1, and increased stability in
simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). These novel antagonist molecules demonstrate high binding
affinity with a4p7, thereby preventing binding between a4p7 and the MAdCAM ligand.
Accordingly, these antagonist peptides have shown to be effective in eliminating and/or
reducing the inflammation process in various experiments.
[0074]         The present invention thus provides various dimer peptide compounds which
bind or associate with the a4p7 integrin, in serum and SIF, to disrupt or block binding
between a4p7 and the MAdCAM ligand. The various peptide compounds of the invention
                                           -Page 20-

may be constructed solely of natural amino acids. Alternatively, the peptide compounds may
include non-natural amino acids including, but not limited to, modified amino acids.
Modified amino acids include natural amino acids which have been chemically modified to
include a group, groups, or chemical moiety not naturally present on the amino acid. The
peptide compounds of the invention may additionally include D-amino acids. Still further,
the peptide compounds of the invention may include amino acid analogs.
[00751           Some antagonist disulfide dimers have been shown to be gastrointestinal
stable and provide high levels of specificity and affinity for the a4p7 integrin.        Some
implementations of the present invention provide a disulfide dimer comprising a half-life of
greater than 60 minutes when exposed to simulated intestinal fluids (SIF).               Some
implementations further provide a DRP comprising a half-life from approximately 1 minute
to approximately 63 minutes.
[0076]           The compounds of the present invention are homo- or heterodimers formed by
linking two subunit monomers at their C- or N-termini.          Dimerization of the monomer
subunits represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1-136 demonstrate increased potency over their non
dimerized, monomer analogs. Some dimer compounds of the present invention demonstrated
further increased potency as a result of substituting various natural amino acyl residues with
N-methylated analog residues. For example, SEQ ID NOs.: 1-38, 49, 57-71, 75-117 and 124
136 represent subunit monomers sequences that were substituted with N-Me-Arg.          Further
still, some dimer compounds of the present invention comprise monomer subunits that
undergo independent cyclization, whereby the cyclized structures demonstrate increased
stability over their non-cyclized monomer and dimer analogs. Specific examples and data
illustrating these improvements is provided in Figures 3 and 4.
[00771           Referring now to Figure 3, a chart is provided which includes various data
illustrating increased stability for various non-limiting sample homodimer molecules in
accordance with the instant invention. Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF) Stability assays were
performed     for all of the monomer peptides, and their respective homodimer molecules,
represented by SEQ ID NOs: 39-136.       A selective sampling of these results is provided in
Figure 3.

[00781          According    to  the  protocols    discussed    herein,  applicant  successfully
synthesized, purified and dimerized all of the integrin antagonist dimer molecules represented
by SEQ ID NOs: 39-139 to form homodimers.
[00791          Dimerization    of the   monomer       disulfide   peptide  subunits   generally
demonstrated increase stability, as compared to the monomer disulfide subunit peptides.
Further, substitutions at arginine with N-Me-Arg increased half-life substantially in SIF, as
demonstrated by SEQ ID NOs: 57 when compared to SEQ ID NO: 39 with Arg. In some
embodiments, substitution of Cys with Penicillamine (Pen) increased stability significantly in
simulated intestinal fluids (SIF), as demonstrated by SEQ ID NOs: 82, 102 and 121 when
compared to SEQ ID NO: 39 with Cys. The substitution of Cys with Pen also increased
stability under reduced conditions (DTT) indication improved gastric stability.
[0080]           Referring now to Figure 4, a chart is provided which includes various data
illustrating increased potency and selectivity for various non-limiting sample homodimer
molecules in accordance with the instant invention.        Potency and selectivity assays were
performed for all of the monomer peptides, and their respective homodimer molecules,
represented by SEQ ID NOs: 39-136.       A selective sampling of these results is provided in
Figure 4 wherein the homodimer peptides are represented by Samples 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15,
17-19 and 21, and the respective monomer subunits molecules are represented by Samples 1,
3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 20. Through dimerization, significant improvement in potency
achieved for a4P7 in ELISA as well as cell adhesion assay. In addition, dimerization lead to
significant improvement achieved in selectivity against a4p 1 through improved potency for
a437. The peptides also have low efficacy for ax4p1 when compared to a4P7 indicating
selectivity against a4 7.
[0081]               According to the protocols discussed herein, applicant successfully
synthesized, purified and dimerized all of the integrin antagonist dimer molecules represented
by SEQ ID NOs: 39-136 to form homodimers. Each of these molecules were subjected to an
a4p7-MAdCAM Competition ELISA assay, an a4pl-VCAM Competition ELISA assay, an
a4j7-MadCAM cell adhesion assay. For many sequences, these assays were also performed
on both the monomer subunit and dimer molecules.          A small sampling of these results is
provided in Figure 4.
                                           -Page 22-

[00821          Dimerization     of  the  monomer      disulfide peptides  subunits    generally
demonstrated increased affinity for a4b7 and/or decreased affinity for a4bl leading to
increased selectivity against a4bl, as compared to the monomer disulfide subunit peptides.
[0083]          Upon C and N-terminal dimerization a significant improvement in potency for
a4P7 was also observed. In addition dimerization also lead to loss of potency for ax4p1
leading to increased selectivity for a4P7 in ELISA and cell adhesion assays. When Arg is
replaced with N-Me-Arg, a significant improvement in potency for aX4 7 in both ELISA as
well as in cell adhesion assays.
[0084]           Compositions
[0085]          As discussed above, integrins are heterodimers that function as cell adhesion
molecules.    The a4 integrins, a4pl and a4p7, play essential roles in lymphocyte migration
throughout the gastrointestinal tract. They are expressed on most leukocytes, including B and
T lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells, where they mediate cell adhesion via binding
to their respective primary ligands, namely vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and
mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM).             VCAM and MAdCAM differ in
binding specificity, in that VCAM binds both a4pl and a4p7, while MAdCAM is highly
specific for a4p7.
[0086]          Differences in the expression profiles of VCAM and MAdCAM provide the
most convincing evidence of their role in inflammatory diseases.        Both are constitutively
expressed in the gut; however, VCAM expression extends into peripheral organs, while
MAdCAM expression is confined to organs of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, elevated
MAdCAM expression in the gut has now been correlated with several gut-associated
inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and hepatitis C.
[00871          The compounds of the invention, including but not limited to those specified
in the examples, possess integrin-antagonist activity. In one embodiment, the condition or
medical indication comprises at least one of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), ulcerative
colitis,., Crohn's disease, Celiac disease (nontropical Sprue), enteropathy associated with

anastomosis andvarious forms of gastrointestinal cancer, osteoporosis, arthritis, multiple
sclerosis, chronic pain, weight gain, and depression. In another embodiment, the condition is
                                            -Page 23-

pancreatitis,   insulin-dependent   diabetes   mellitus,  mastitis,  cholecystitis, cholangitis,
pericholangitis, chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, asthma or graft versus host disease. In
addition, these compounds may be useful in the prevention or reversal of these diseases when
used in combination with currently available therapies, medical procedures, and therapeutic
agents.
[00881           The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with other
compositions and procedures for the treatment of disease. Additionally, the compounds of
the present invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and
optionally sustained-release matrices, such as biodegradable polymers, to form therapeutic
compositions.

according to Formula (I), wherein the dimer peptide is used in combination with permeation
enhancers that promote the transport of the dimer peptides across the intestinal mucosa by
increasing paracellular or transcellular permeation.     For example, in one embodiment a
permeation enhancer is combined with a dimer peptide according to Formula (I), wherein the
permeation enhancer comprises at least one of a long-chain fatty acid, a bile salt, an
amphiphilic surfactant, and a chelating agent. In one embodiment, a permeation enhancer
comprising sodium N-[hydroxybenzoyl)amino] caprylate is used to form a weak noncovalent
association with the dimer peptide of the instant invention, wherein the permeation enhancer
favors membrane transport and further dissociation once reaching the blood circulation. In
another embodiment, a peptide dimer of the present invention is conjugated to oligoarginine,
thereby increasing cellular penetration of the dimer peptides into various cell types. Further,
in at least one embodiment a noncovalent bond is provided between a dimer peptide
according to Formula (I) and a permeation enhancer selected from the group consisting of a
                                           -Page 27-

cyclodextrin (CD) and a dendrimers, wherein the permeation enhancer reduces peptide
aggregation and increasing stability and solubility for the peptide dimer molecule.
[0100]           Other embodiments of the invention provide a method for treating an
individual with an a4p7 integrin antagonist dimer molecule having an increased half-life. In
one aspect, the present invention provides an integrin antagonist dimer molecule having a
half-life of at least several hours to one day in vitro or in vivo (e.g., when administered to a
human subject) sufficient for daily (q.d.) or twice daily (b.i.d.) dosing of a therapeutically
effective amount.      In another embodiment, the dimer molecule has a half-life of three days
or longer sufficient for weekly (q.w.) dosing of a therapeutically effective amount. Further,
in another embodiment the dimer molecule has a half-life of eight days or longer sufficient
for bi-weekly (b.i.w.) or monthly dosing of a therapeutically effective amount. In another
embodiment, the dimer molecule is derivatized or modified such that is has a longer half-life
as compared to the underivatized or unmodified dimer molecule. In another embodiment, the
dimer molecule contains one or more chemical modifications to increase serum half-life.
[0101]           When used in at least one of the treatments or delivery systems described
herein, a therapeutically effective amount of one of the compounds of the present invention
may be employed in pure form or, where such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable
salt form. As used herein, a "therapeutically effective amount" of the compound of the
invention is meant to describe a sufficient amount of the peptide dimer compound to treat an
integrin-related disease, (for example, to reduce inflammation associated with IBD) at a
desired benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however,
that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be
decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific
therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of
factors including: a) the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; b) activity of
the specific compound employed; c) the specific composition employed, the age, body
weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; d) the time of administration, route of
administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; e) the duration of
the treatment; f) drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound
employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the
skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than those required to achieve
                                            -Page 28-

the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is
achieved.
[0102]           Alternatively, a compound of the present invention may be administered as
pharmaceutical compositions containing the compound of interest in combination with one or
more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or
excipient refers to a non-toxic solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material
or formulation auxiliary of any type. The compositions may be administered parenterally,
intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, intrarectally, topically (as by powders,
ointments, drops, suppository, or transdermal patch), rectally, or buccally. The term
"parenteral" as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous,
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrastemal, subcutaneous, intradermal and intraarticular
injection and infusion.
[0103]           Pharmaceutical     compositions       for   parenteral       injection    comprise
pharmaceutically      acceptable  sterile aqueous     or nonaqueous        solutions,   dispersions,
suspensions or emulsions, as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable
solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous
carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol,
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable
mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl
oleate. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such
as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by
the use of surfactants.
[0104]           These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservative, wetting
agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms
may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example,
paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include
isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the
injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay
absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
[0105]           Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the
drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters),
                                            -Page 29-

poly(anhydrides), and (poly)glycols, such as PEG. Depending upon the ratio of drug to
polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be
controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in
liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.
[0106]           The injectable formulations may be sterilized, for example, by filtration
through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile
solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile
injectable medium just prior to use.
[01071           Topical administration includes administration to the skin or mucosa,
including surfaces of the lung and eye. Compositions for topical lung administration,
including those for inhalation and intranasal, may involve solutions and suspensions in
aqueous and non-aqueous formulations and can be prepared as a dry powder which may be
pressurized or non-pressurized.       In non-pressurized powder compositions, the active
ingredient in finely divided form may be used in admixture with a larger-sized
pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier comprising particles having a size, for example, of
up to 100 micrometers in diameter. Suitable inert carriers include sugars such as lactose.
[0108]           Alternatively, the composition may be pressurized and contain a compressed
gas, such as nitrogen or a liquified gas propellant. The liquified propellant medium and
indeed the total composition is preferably such that the active ingredient does not dissolve
therein to any substantial extent. The pressurized composition may also contain a surface
active agent, such as a liquid or solid non-ionic surface active agent or may be a solid anionic
surface active agent. It is preferred to use the solid anionic surface active agent in the form of
a sodium salt.
[0109]           A further form of topical administration is to the eye. A compound of the
invention is delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicle, such that the
compound is maintained in contact with the ocular surface for a sufficient time period to
allow the compound to penetrate the comeal and internal regions of the eye, as for example
the anterior chamber, posterior chamber, vitreous body, aqueous humor, vitreous humor,
comea,    iris/ciliary, lens, choroid/retina    and sclera. The pharmaceutically        acceptable
ophthalmic vehicle may, for example, be an ointment, vegetable oil or an encapsulating
                                             -Page 30-

material. Alternatively, the compounds of the invention may be injected directly into the
vitreous and aqueous humour.
[0110]           Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories
which may be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non
irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax
which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the
rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.
[0111]           Compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of
liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or
other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid
crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable
and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions
in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers,
preservatives, excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and the
phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are
known in the art.
[0112]           Total daily dose of the compositions of the invention to be administered to a
human or other mammal host in single or divided doses may be in amounts, for example,
from 0.000 1 to 300 mg/kg body weight daily and more usually 1 to 300 mg/kg body weight.
[0113]           Non-invasive Detection of IntestinalInflammation
[0114]           The peptides of the invention may be used for detection, assessment and
diagnosis of intestinal inflammation by microPET imaging using an orally stable compound
of Formula (I) that is further labeled with at least one of a chelating group and a detectable
label as part of a non-invasive diagnostic procedure. In one embodiment, an integrin
antagonist dimer molecule is conjugated with a bifunctional chelator to provide an orally
stable dimer molecule.      In another embodiment, an integrin antagonist dimer molecule is
radiolabeled to provide an orally stable dimer molecule.          The orally stable, chelated or
radiolabeled dimer molecule is then administered to a subject orally or rectally.         In one
embodiment, the orally stable dimer molecule is included in drinking water.           Following
uptake of the dimer molecules, microPET imaging may be used to visualize inflammation
throughout the subject's bowels and digestive track.

[01151          Synthesis ofPeptide Subunits
[01161          The monomer peptide subunits of the present invention may be synthesized by
many techniques that are known to those skilled in the art.      novel and unique monomer
subunits were synthesized, purified, and dimerized using the techniques provided herein. .
[0117]          The peptides of the present invention were synthesized using the Merrifield
solid phase synthesis techniques on Protein Technology's Symphony multiple channel
synthesizer. The peptides were assembled using HBTU (0-Benzotriazole-N,N,N',N'
tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate),       Diisopropylethylamine(DIEA)        coupling
conditions. Rink Amide MBHA resin (100-200mesh, 0.57mmol/g) is used for peptide with
C-terminal amides and pre-loaded Wang Resin with N-a-Fmoc protected amino acid is used
for peptide with C-terminal acids. The coupling reagents (HBTU and DIEA premixed) were
prepared at 100mmol concentration. Similarly amino acids solutions were prepared at
100mmol concentration. The peptides were assembled using standard Symphony protocols.
[0118]          Assembly
[0119]          The peptide sequences were assembled as follows: Resin (250mg, 0.14mmol)
in each reaction vial was washed twice with 4ml of DMF followed by treatment with 2.5ml
of 20% 4-methyl piperidine (Fmoc de-protection) for 10min. The resin was then filtered and
washed two times with DMF (4ml) and re-treated with N-methyl piperifine for additional 30
minute. The resin was again washed three times with DMF (4ml) followed by addition 2.5ml
of amino acid and 2.5ml of HBTU-DIEA mixture. After 45min of frequent agitations, the
resin was filtered and washed three timed with DMF (4ml each). For a typical peptide of the
present invention, double couplings were performed for first 25 amino acid, and triple
couplings were performed for the remaining residues. After completing the coupling reaction,
the resin was washed three times with DMF (4ml each) before proceeding to the next amino
acid coupling.
[0120]          Cleavage
[0121]          Following completion of the peptide assembly, the peptide was cleaved from
the resin by treatment with cleavage reagent, such as reagent K (82.5% trigluoroacetic acid,
5% water, 5% thioanisole, 5% phenol, 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol).      The cleavage reagent was
able to successfully cleave the peptide from the resin, as well as all remaining side chain
protecting groups.
                                          -Page 32-

[01221          The cleaved were precipitated in cold diethyl ether followed by two washings
with ethyl ether. The filtrate was poured off and a second aliquot of cold ether was added,
and the procedure       repeated.    The crude peptide was dissolved in a solution of
acetonitrile:water (7:3 with 1% TFA) and filtered. The quality of linear peptide was then
verified using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Micromass/Waters ZQ)
before being purified.
[0123]          Disulfide Bond Formationvia Oxidation
[0124]          50mg of crude, cleaved peptide was dissolved in 20ml of water:acetonitrile.
Saturated Iodine in acetic acid was then added drop wise with stirring until yellow color
persisted.   The solution was stirred for 15 minutes and the reaction was monitored with
analytic HPLC and LCMS. When the reaction was completed, solid ascorbic acid was added
until the solution became clear. The solvent mixture was then purified by first being diluted
with water and then loaded onto a reverse phase HPLC machine (Luna C18 support, 10u,
1OOA, Mobile phase A: water containing 0.1% TFA, mobile phase B: Acetonitrile (ACN)
containing 0.1% TFA, gradient began with 5% B, and changed to 50% B over 60 minutes at a
flow rate of 15ml/min).      Fractions containing pure product were then freeze-dried on a
lyophilyzer.
[0125]          Lactam Bond Formation
[0126]           100mg of crude, cleaved peptide (approx. 0.12mmol) was dissolved in 100ml
of anhydrous dichloromethane.        HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate) (0.24mmol, 2
equivalents)    was added     followed by DIEA       (N,N-Diisopropylethylamine)    (1.2mmol,
1Equivalents)        and     TBTU       (0-(Benzotriazol- 1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium
tetrafluoroborate)(0.24 mmol, 2 equivalents). The mixture was stirred overnight and followed
the reaction by HPLC. When the reaction was completed, dichloromethane was evaporated
and diluted with water and Acetonitrile and then loaded onto a reverse phase HPLC machine
(Luna C18 support, l0u, 1OA, Mobile phase A: water containing 0.l1% TFA, mobile phase
B: Acetonitrile (ACN) containing 0.l1% TFA, gradient began with 5% B, and changed to 50%
B over 60 minutes at a flow rate of 15ml/min). Fractions containing pure product were then
freeze-dried on a lyophilyzer.

[01281          Analytical reverse-phase, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
was performed on a Gemini C18 column (4.6 mm x 250 mm) (Phenomenex).                   Semi
Preparative reverse phase HPLC was performed on a Gemini 10 [m C18 column (22 mm x
250 mm) (Phenomenex) or Jupiter 10 [tm, 300 A ' C18 column (21.2 mm x 250 mm)
(Phenomenex). Separations were achieved using linear gradients of buffer B in A (Mobile
phase A: water containing 0.15% TFA, mobile phase B: Acetonitrile (ACN) containing 0.1%
TFA), at a flow rate of 1 mL/min (analytical) and 15 mL/min (preparative). Separations were
achieved using linear gradients of buffer B in A (Mobile phase A: water containing 0.15%
TFA, mobile phase B: Acetonitrile (ACN) containing 0.1% TFA), at a flow rate of 1 mL/min
(analytical) and 15mL/min (preparative).
[0129]          Linker Activation and Dimerization
[0130]          Small Scale DIG Linker Activation Procedure: 5mL of NMP was added to a
glass vial containing IDA diacid (304.2 mg, 1 mmol), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, 253.2
mg, 2.2 eq. 2.2mmol) and a stirring bar. The mixture was stirred at room temperature to
completely dissolve the solid starting materials.    N, N'-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC,
453.9mg, 2.2 eq., 2.2 mmol) was then added to the mixture. Precipitation appeared within 10
min and the reaction mixture was further stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction
mixture was then filtered to remove the precipitated dicyclohexylurea (DCU). The activated
linker was kept in a closed vial prior to use for dimerization. The nominal concentration of
the activated linker was approximately 0.20 M.
[0131]          For dimerization using PEG linkers, there is no pre-activation step involved.
Commercially available pre-activated bi-functional PEG linkers were used.
[0132]          Dimerization Procedure: 2mL of anhydrous DMF was added to a vial
containing peptide monomer (0.1 mmol). The pH of the peptide was the adjusted to 8~9 with
DIEA.    Activated linker ( IDA or PEG13, PEG 25) (0.48eq relative to monomer, 0.048
mmol) was then added to the monomer solution. The reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature for one hour. Completion of the dimerization reaction was monitored using
analytical HPLC. The time for completion of dimerization reaction varied depending upon
the linker.   After completion of reaction, the peptide was precipitated in cold ether and
centrifuged. The supernatant ether layer was discarded. The precipitation step was repeated
twice.   The crude dimer was then purified using reverse phase HPLC (Luna C18 support,
                                           -Page 34-

(ACN) containing 0.1% TFA, gradient of 150%B and change to 450%B over 60min, flow rate
15ml/min). Fractions containing pure product were then freeze-dried on a lyophilyzer.
[0133]           Simulated IntestinalFluid (SIF)Stability Assav
[0134]           Studies were carried out in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) to evaluate gastric
stability of the dimer molecules of the instant invention. SIF was prepared by adding 6.8 g of
monobasic potassium phosphate and 10.0 g of pancreatin to 1.0 L of water. After dissolution,
the pH was adjusted to 6.8 using NaOH. DMSO stocks (2 mM) were first prepared for the
test compounds. Aliquots of the DMSO solutions were dosed into 6 individual tubes, each
containing 0.5 mL of SIF, which had been pre-warmed to 37 0 C.
[0135]           The final test compound concentration was 20 [tM. The vials were kept in a
benchtop Thermomixer@ for the duration of the experiment. At each timepoint (0, 5, 10, 20,
40, and 60 minutes), 1.0 mL of acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid was added to one vial
to terminate the reaction. Samples were stored at 4'C until the end of the experiment. After
the final timepoint was sampled, the tubes were mixed and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for
10 minutes. Aliquots of the supernatant were removed, diluted 1:1 into distilled water
containing internal standard, and analyzed by LCMS/MS.              Percent remaining at each
timepoint was calculated based on the peak area response ratio of test to compound to
internal standard. Time 0 was set to 100%, and all later timepoints were calculated relative to
time 0. Half-lives were calculated by fitting to a first-order exponential decay equation using
GraphPad.      A small sampling of the results of these studies is provided and discussed in
connection Figure 3, above.
