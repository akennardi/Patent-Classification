  Patent Description - The patent is described in the following statements
     An innovative anti-tumor treatment derived from an methanolic
            isolate of Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcussenticosus)
         Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcussenticosus) is used primarily as an adaptogen
herb and also for its immune stimulant properties in Western Herbal Medicine. Another
closely related species used in East Asian medicine systems i.e. Kampo (/J "1        ), TCM
(rt [X) (Manchuria, Korea, Japan and Ainu of Hokkaido) and also called Siberian
ginseng (Acanthopanaxsenticosus) also displays immune-stimulant and anti-cancer
properties. These properties may affect tumour growth and also provide an anti-fatigue
effect for cancer patients, in particular lung cancer. There is some evidence that a
carbohydrate in Siberian ginseng may possess not only immune stimulatory effects but
also anti-tumour effects and also display other various anti-cancer effects.
Diet can play a major role in the development or alleviation of chronic illness such as
staple oil type (He et. a. 2014), or phytochemicals present in green tea (Cichello et. al.
2013). On the other hand, herbs and herbal teas such as ginseng contain a wide array of
phytochemicals and the efficacy of their health effect such as anti-cancer effect maybe
more difficult to elucidate in vivo, and thus in vitro investigation is warranted. It is well
established that Korean ginseng (Panaxginseng) and its main active phytochemical
Ginsenoside Rgl has been shown to posses' anti-cancer effects in vitro (leukemia cells)
(Jun Liu et al. 2012, Jing et. al. 2014, Zhi-Mei You et. al. 2014) and in vivo (intestinal
carcinogenesis) (Ichihara et. al. 2002). Two unrelated genus but with similar therapeutic
actions, but also known as 'ginseng', possess similar immune modulating, and
adaptogenic properties. The related ginseng's are known as 'Siberian ginseng'. Siberian
ginseng comprises of two closely related genus; (Eleutherococcussenticosus) and
(Acanthopanaxsenticosus). Animal studies and clinical studies have shown various anti
fatigue effects of Siberian ginseng supplementation (cortex) given to mice in a
swimming fatigue test, which has been attributed to the phytochemical Eleutheroside B
(Li et. al. 2008) eleutheroside E, E2 and derivatives (Kimura et. al. 2004 ),
eleutheroside E, and also reduced natural killer cell activity and reduced corticosterone
hormone elevation during the swimming test (Huang et. al. 2011). However, when
compared with stress management training (SMT), supplementation with Siberian
ginseng was found to be non-significant with SMT or their combination (Schaffler et. al.
2013), suggesting a physical effect as previously mentioned, rather than mental effect to

shown to improve aspects of quality of life (Cicero et. al. 2004), which may be related to
the release of both NPY and Hsp70 via interaction with human neurons (Asea et. al.
2013), and also via c-Fos accumulation in both the supraoptic nuclei (SON) and
paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the rat brain (Soya et. al. 2008).
           Various other effects of eleutherosides from E. senticosus include alleviation
of insulin resistance in db/db (obese type 2 diabetic) mice and increased glucose uptake
in C2C12 myotubles (Ahn et. al. 2013), neuroprotective effects during neural ischemia
in rats (Lee et. al. 2012), increased endurance capacity and cardiovascular function in
athletic training over an 8-week period (Kuo et. al. 2010), anti-inflammatory effects on
LPS-stimulated macrophages (Soo Kim et. al. 2012) and interestingly also cancer
(Huang et. al. 2005), with a glycoproteins from Acanthopanaxsenticosus (glycoproteins
(EN-SP) showed anti-tumor effects related to immune-stimulating activities (Ha et. al.
2004), further growth inhibition and apoptosis in stomach cancer cells (KATO III cells)
(Hibasami et. al. 2000), and inhibition of lung cancer metastasis in mice in a dose
dependent manner in colon26-M3.1 carcinoma cells (Yoon et. al. 2004).
         Our extract, a methanol extract and its polysaccharide fraction conferred an anti
cancer activity, small lung cell, anti-cancer effect and confer with previous author's
publications regarding E. senticosus and various lung cancer treatment. Moreover, the
cell lines used in this study have previously not been investigated, in particular A-549
which is representative of lung cancer and thus this finding is novel and has been
demonstrated in animal model as well (rat).

Patent Description - The patent is described in the following statements
  An innovative anti-tumor treatment derived from an methanolic
        isolate of Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcussenticosus)
                                  Patent Claim(s)
     1. The standard treatment for lung cancer is the use of radiotherapy,
         chemotherapy i.e. cisplatin (Platinol) or carboplatin (Paraplatin) plus
         docetaxel (Taxotere), gemcitabine (Gemzar), paclitaxel (Taxol and
         others), vinorelbine (Navelbine etc.)
     2. Our treatment involves the intravenous infusion of a methanolic
         extract of E. senticosus suspended in an isotonic solution at a rate of
         lmL/ minute (500tg/mL).
     3. The treatment can also be administered orally at 3 x 400mg tablets
         t.i.d. (assumes 36g fresh plant ingestion/ day)
     4. With respect to claim 2., our extract showed a concentration
         dependent inhibitory trend from 12.5 - 50pig/mL in A-549 (small
         cell lung cancer) cells.
     5. At 12.5 and 25 pg/mL concentration, there is a slight growth
         suppression in QBC-939 cells, but then a steady suppression from
         50, 100 and 200pg/mL (table 1).
     6. Moreover, in reference to claim 2., our extract showed an
         inhibitory effect which plateaued with increasing dosage in XWLC-05
         (Yunnan lung cancer cell line) (table 1).
     7. Finally, in colon cancer cell line (HCT-1 16) we observed an initially
         weak inhibitory effect and then plateau (table 1).
     8. With respect to claims 4-7, our extract shows in vivo efficacy in mice
         implanted with the respect lung cancer cells and in selected human
         cancer patients. The anti-tumor effect was due to a polysaccharide
         which has been isolated and has been synthesized.
