                                          SCAFFOLDING SYSTEM
    [0001]             The       present          invention        relates             to        building
   construction              and,      more      particularly,          to       scaffolding              for
 5 work      around the           outside       and    roof    areas    of      framed buildings
   under construction.
   BACKGROUND
    [00021            An        increased           concern        for        the          safety           of
10 construction              workers        has     led    to    a   demand          by     regulatory
   authorities             for     adequate        support      and   protective              means        for
   workers          when        working       on     the    roof     of      a    building             under
   construction              or     at    heights        greater     than        ...   metres          above
   ground level.
15  [00031             Modular        scaffolding         systems      are       known        which        are
   built       from       the     ground      up    and    on   which       scaffolding             planks
   can     be    laid       to    provide       a   working      walkways.          A    disadvantage
   of    these         systems        is   that      they    become       time        consuming            and
   difficult to erect on uneven or soft ground adjacent to the
20 building under construction.
    [00041             Systems for protection of workers on the roofs of
   a    building          under      construction          are    known,       in     which        railing
   support          structures           are    attached       to   the      roof       rafters.           One
   disadvantage                of    this      system       is    that       the       rafters           must
25 already         in     place.      Another       disadvantage         is     that       the     support

                                         - 2
   structures       impede      the    cladding      activity      of    the    roof
   structure.
    [00051       Another      arrangement      of  a    scaffolding       system   s
   disclosed       in    FR2892438      in    which     structures       to    carry
 5 scaffolding planks are suspended from the sides of a framed
   building     under    construction.      These    structures     are    unitary,
   that   is   formed in      one integral arrangement          of vertical      and
   horizontal       members,       making    them     awkward     and    heavy    to
   manipulate       by   personnel.      A   further      disadvantage      of   the
10 French     scaffolding       structures      lies    in   their     being    more
   difficult to transport to a work site.
    [0006]       It    is   an    object   of    the    present     invention     to
   address      or     at    least     ameliorate       some     of    the     above
   disadvantages.
