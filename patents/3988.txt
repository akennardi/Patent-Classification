   Detailed Description
   Overview of exemplary gaming system
25 Figure 1 shows an exemplary gaming system 1 where a group
   game controller 150 is in data communication over a
   network 2, such as an Ethernet, with a bank of eight
   gaming devices in the form of standalone gaming machines
   10. The group game controller 150 is arranged, when a
30 moving object feature is active, to control the gaming
   devices 10 so as to display an object as moving between
   display portions associated with them, to determine at
   which of the display portions to display the object in a
   stopped state, and to award any prize associated with the
35 stopped state. In an embodiment, the display portions are
   provided by the displays of the gaming devices and the
   object is displayed in a sub-portion of the display, e.g.
                                             9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                              - 8
   the top right corner, while the object is moving, so as
   not to interfere with play of a game on the gaming device
   and, when stopped takes over the display from the game
   being played on the gaming device  (this may not occur
 5 until an appropriate juncture, such as completion of a
   spin or play of the game). The object has pairs of stopped
   display sub-states: a conceal state and a reveal state.
   The object is initially displayed in the conceal state and
   then modified to be displayed in a reveal state which
10 indicates whether the player has won a prize. In an
   embodiment, the object is a virtual parcel having plural
   layers of virtual wrapping paper such that there may be
   prizes between the layers of wrapping paper and a grand
   prize is revealed by the last layer of paper.
15
   While, the group game controller 150 is shown in Figure 1
   as a separate entity to the gaming devices 10.          In an
   alternative embodiment, it could be provided by one of the
   gaming devices incorporating a server module arranged to
20 implement the group game controller in the manner
   described in Australian patent application 2008205413
   filed 13 August 2008.
   Gaming devices
25
   Gaming devices capable of participating in the method of
   gaming of the embodiment can take any suitable form
   including stand alone gaming machines and server based
   gaming terminals.
30
   A gaming device in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
35 by a player.  A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
                                             9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                               - 9
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
 5 reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may be configured for ticket
   in that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
10 shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
15 reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
20 the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.        Further
25 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
30 The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
35 electromechanical device.   The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
                                             9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

   type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
 5 different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
10 processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
15 memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
20 communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
25 devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
30 In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
35 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
                                              9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                               - 11
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
 5 input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
10 The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                   In
15 embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
20
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.              The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
25 execution by the processor 102 and related data.              The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
30 the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
35 input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
                                             9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                              - 12
   In a client server architecture a gaming device is
   provided by a gaming client and game server (and
   optionally other gaming network components). A gaming
   client has a similar outward appearance to gaming machine
 5 10 but the game server implements most or all of the game
   and as such acts as the game controller while the terminal
   operated by the player essentially provides only the
   player interface.  The gaming terminal receives player
   instructions, pass these to the game server which will
10 process them and return game play outcomes to the gaming
   machine for display.  Further details of a client/server
   gaming architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213 and
   PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference. In such an embodiment, a
15 group game controller can be provided, for example, by a
   dedicated server in data communication with the game
   server.
   Figure 5 shows that a gaming device may be connected
20 within a gaming network 200 which provides additional
   and/or enhanced functionality.  The gaming network 200
   includes a network 201, which for example may be an
   Ethernet network.  Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in
   three banks 203 of two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5,
25 are connected to the network 201.  The gaming machines 202
   provide a player operable interface and may be the same as
   the gaming machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3. While
   banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure
   5, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are also
30 envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
35 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
                                             9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                              - 13
   promotional or informational material.
   A group game controller can be provided within such a
   network 200 as a group game server 205, such that the
 5 group game server may implement a group game for a
   plurality of different banks of gaming machines rather
   than a specific controller being provide for each bank of
   gaming machines.
10 A database management server 206 may manage storage of
   game programs and associated data for downloading or
   access by the gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.
   Typically, if the gaming system enables players to
   participate in a Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 207 will
15 be provided to perform accounting functions for the
   Jackpot game.  A loyalty program server 212 may also be
   provided.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
20 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
25 network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming

   Further detail of gaming system
10
   Referring to Figure 6, the constitution of the group game
   controller 150 is similar to that of the gaming device
   illustrated in relation to Figures 2 to 4 and 9 (below) in
   that it has a processor 151 arranged to implement the
15 group game based on program code stored in memory 152 and
   a display driver 154 for driving the display 160 to show
   group game outcomes. The group game controller also has a
   speaker 155 for playing music during the moving object
   feature. The group game controller 150 also includes a
20 communication interface 153 which enables the processor
   151 to communicate with each of the gaming devices 10.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate the above
   components are the core components for implementing a
25 group game but other components may be present in a group
   game controller.   Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that the implementation of the group game
   controller is analogous to the implementation of bonus
   game controllers in existing gaming systems and reference
30 may be made to such controllers for further details of
   implementation.
   Figure 7 is a functional block diagram of the group game
   controller 150 which shows that the processor 151
35 implements a number of modules by executing program code
   stored in memory 152. In the embodiment, the moving object
   feature is intended to be active all the time such that
                                             9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                               - 15
   the moving object feature is carried out while players
   play individual gaming devices. At start up or after a
   grand prize is won, the object selector 726 uses random
   number generator 721 to select an object. In the
 5 embodiment, each object is a parcel and the object
   selector randomly selects an object based on rules stored
   as object data which determine factors including:               the
   minimum and maximum number of layers   (and hence how many
   times the object will be stopped before a grand prize is
10 won), the probability of a layer including a prize, a
   prize range for between layer prizes, and a prize range
   for the  (last layer) grand prize. In other embodiments,
   the objects may be predetermined and either selected at
   random or taken from a list. Each prize may be any
15 suitable award known to persons skilled in the art such as
   an award of wagerable credits, loyalty points, an
   instrument exchangeable for cash, services or goods, etc.
   Display controller 724 controls the displays of gaming
20 devices to display the object at each of a plurality of
   gaming devices 10 in turn. Figure 10 shows an example of a
   video display 911 having a game display area 911A where,
   in one example, virtual reels of a spinning reel game are
   shown as spinning and a moving object display area 911B
25 which shows the moving object when it is the gaming
   devices turn. Area 911B can be blank or have some other
   graphic when there is no object   (i.e. when the object is
   displayed on another gaming device).   Display controller
   724 communicates via communication interface 153 with the
30 gaming devices ljO to cause them to display the object in
   turn at display sub-portion 911B so that the object
   appears to be passed from one gaming device 10 to another.
   The order in which the object is passed is determined
   based on the physical position of the gaming devices
35 relative to one another and is configured by a technician
   allocating each device an identifier in an appropriate
   order during installation.
                                              9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                                 - 16
   Display controller 724 keeps the object in motion until a
   trigger module 720 receives a trigger signal via data
   communication interface 153.
 5
   In this respect, as will be described in further detail
   below, the gaming devices 10 are individually arranged to
   determine whether they can trigger a stopping of the
   object.  Accordingly, the trigger module 720A receives a
10 trigger signal via the data communication interface 153
   which identifies the gaming device 10 that has triggered.
   The position determiner 722 uses this information to
   determine the position at which the object is to be
   stopped.  Accordingly, in this embodiment the position
15 determiner 722 instructs the display controller 724 to
   stop the object in a concealed state at the identified
   gaming device and to instruct     that   gaming device 10 to
   carry out an object revealing display.        In    this      respect,
   the display controller 724 communicates the prize which is
20 to be displayed based on prize data 712A of the object
   data 712 of the object of this game.        Display controller
   724 also causes the speaker 154 to fall silent.                   If sound
   is reproduced at individual gaming machines, the
   individual gaming machines also fall silent.
25
   In this respect, music for output on the speakers 155 is
   provided from music source 725.        When the prize has been
   displayed as will be described in further detail below,
   the display controller 724 restarts display of the object
30 as moving.
   Figure 9 is a functional block diagram of one example of a
   gaming device in the form of a stand alone gaming machine.
   Each gaming device 900 has a communication interface 950
35 for receiving communications from the group game
   controller in relation to display of the moving object and
   awarding of a prize as necessary. The gaming device 900
                                                   9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                              - 17
   may be the same or different to gaming machine 10,100
   described above.  In Figure 9, the processor 930 of game
   controller 920 is shown implementing a number of modules
   based on program code and data stored in memory 940.
 5 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that various of
   the modules could be implemented in some other way, for
   example by a dedicated circuit.
   The gaming device 900 includes a player interface 910 has
lo a display 911 having a main display area (sub-portion)
   911A and a moving object display area 911B (sub-portion)
   which displays the moving object when it is moving. Gaming
   device 900 also has a game play mechanism 912 including
   input devices such as touch screen or buttons to enable
15 the player to interact with the game by placing wagers and
   entering any other instructions required to play the game.
   Game play mechanism 912 also enables the player to
   interact with the game to learn game rules etc.            The
   player interface 910 includes a credit mechanism 913
20 allowing the player to input credit into the gaming device
   900 and/or be paid out any winnings or remaining credit.
   A person skilled in the art will appreciate that other
   components will be present in a gaming device 900 such as
   those described in relation to Figures 2 to 4 above.                   The
25 memory 940 includes program code for implementing a game
   data 941 for implementing one or more portions of the game
   depending on how a specific play of the game progresses.
   The processor 930 when executing the program code stored
30 in memory 940 is arranged conduct a play of the game in
   response to the operation of the game play mechanism 912.
   In each play of the game, a base game is conducted based
   on base game data 941A.   Outcomes of the base game are
35 generated with the outcome generator 931. The outcome
   evaluator 932 evaluates the game outcomes that are
   generated based on the wager specified with the game play
                                            9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                               - 18
   mechanism 912 and updates meter data 942 as necessary. In
   the embodiment, at least one outcome of the base game
   result in a feature game 941B being conducted.
 5
   In the illustrated embodiment, the outcome evaluator 932
   also includes a trigger module 932A.   This module
   determines whether an outcome of a game entitles the
   player to opening of the parcel.   If the player is
10 entitled to open the parcel, the trigger module passes the
   trigger via communication module 933 and communication
   interface 950 to the group game controller 150 which
   operates to stop the parcel as described above.
15 While the object is being displayed as moving, the
   individual gaming device 900 receives data by
   communication 950 instructing the game controller 920 to
   display the parcel.   In this respect communication module
   933 routes a display communication to display controller
20 934.  Display controller 934 includes sub display
   controller 934A which controls the sub display 911B to
   display the moving object during the moving object stage
   of the game.   The sub-display controller 934A is arranged
   to display the object for preconfigured period of time,
25 for example, 5 seconds.
   When a prize is to be awarded, to the gaming device, the
   details of the prize are received by communication
   interface and communication module 933 and passed to
30 display controller 934 which waits for a configured pause
   in the game, such as completion of the current spin and
   then controls the whole of the display 911 to display the
   prize revealed such that it takes over the portion of the
   display 911A where outcomes of the game are normally
35 displayed.   The parcel is first displayed in a wrapped or
   conceal state and then is graphically unwrapped to display
   it in a reveal state by the display controller 934.                   In
                                             9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                               - 19
    this respect, the relevant graphics can be stored in
    memory 940 or communicated over the network of the game
    controller 920 from the group game controller 150.
  5 In addition to the above, the game controller 920 may
    incorporate an eligibility module 936 to enforce
    eligibility rules in respect of the game.     The eligibility
    rules can be based on known eligibility factors including
    that a bet is being placed within a defined time period, a
10  bet of a certain type has been placed in a certain time
    period, the player is playing a certain number of lines
    etc.
    In other embodiments the eligibility module 936 may
15  communicate with the group game controller in respect of
    the eligibility and this eligibility may be used to
    control display of the object.  For example, the object
    may be shown as moving only to those machines which are
    eligible.
20
    It will also be appreciated from Figure 9 that the player
    interface may incorporate a speaker 914 for outputting the
    music while the object is moving.  This music can be
    communicated from music source 725 over the network or can
25  be generated locally at the gaming device.
    Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there may
    be a number of variations on the above embodiment, for
    example, the object moving feature may be triggered by a
30  factor such as a trigger occurring on an individual game
    or by a turnover of the group of machines that are
    connected to the controller or the turnover of individual
    game machines.  Further, a trigger for triggering the game
    which is derived at the gaming device can be based on
35  other factors, such as turnover of the gaming machine, a
    random calculation calculator of the gaming machine etc.
    In other embodiments, the trigger may be determined by
                                              9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                              - 20
   trigger module 720 at the game controller 150 for example
   by obtaining a random value from random number generator
   721.
 5 In other embodiments, while the trigger may cause all
   prizes to be distributed.   For example, if the trigger is
   that a certain turnover value is reached for all the
   linked gaming machines, the group game controller may use
   random number generator 721 to randomly determine
10 positions at which each of the prizes of the object are to
   be awarded.  That is, the position determiner, 722 may
   include a routine for randomly determining the gaming
   devices at which the awards are to be made.        The parcel is
   then shown as moving from gaming machine to gaming machine
15 and stopped based on the determined positions until all of
   the prizes have been awarded.   In this embodiment, the
   grand prize corresponding to the last layer of wrapping
   removed from the virtual parcel may be awarded at random,
   or, for example to the gaming machine which caused the
20 turnover to reach a certain point.   In this example, the
   other prizes may be awarded at random.
   In the above embodiment the base game conducted is a
   conventional spinning reel type game. In such embodiments,
25 the evaluation entitlement may be based on how many lines
   are played in each game.  Such win lines are typically
   formed by a combination of symbol display positions, one
   from each reel, the symbol display positions being located
   relative to one another such that they form a line.
30
   In many games, the win entitlement is not strictly limited
   to the selected win lines for example, "scatter" pays are
   awarded independently of a players selection of pay lines
   and are an inherent part of the evaluation entitlement.
35
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, an evaluation entitlement may be based on a
                                             9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                              - 21
   number of reels to play such as in games are marketed
   under the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure
   Industries Pty Ltd. The selection of the reel means that
   each displayed symbol of the reel can be substituted for a
 5 symbol at one or more designated display positions. In
   other words, all symbols displayed at symbol display
   positions corresponding to a selected reel can be used to
   form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at a
   designated, symbol display positions of the other reels.
10 For example, if there are five reels and three symbol
   display positions for each reel such that the symbol
   display positions comprise three rows of five symbol
   display positions, the symbols displayed in the centre row
   are used for non-selected reels. As a result, the total
15 number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the
   number of active display positions of each reel, the
   active display positions being all display positions of
   each selected reel and the designated display position of
   the non-selected reels. As a result for five reels and
20 fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to win.
   Referring now to Figure 8, there is shown in summary form
   the method of the embodiment 800.   It will be appreciated
   that the method involves controlling 810 the display of
25 the object to show it moving between display portions
   associated with different gaming devices.     The method then
   involves determining 820 display positions for stop
   display states of the object.   It will be appreciated that
   steps 810 and 820 may be reversed.   The display is then
30 controlled to show the stop display states 830.             Provided
   an eligibility criteria is met the 840 the prize is
   awarded 850.  It will be appreciated in this example the
   eligibility criteria is applied independently of where the
   object stops.  That is, it is possible for a prize to be
35 revealed at a gaming device where the player is not
   eligible so that the player can be shown that if they have
   met the eligibility criteria they would have won the bet
                                             9784676_1 (GHMatters) P81469.AU.4 13/12/17

                               - 22
   that won the prize.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in the
   above embodiment, the display for moving object is
 5 provided by the displays of a plurality of different
   gaming machines.   In other embodiments, the display may be
   provided by a single display, for example an overhead
   display 160 which shows regions corresponding to each of
   the gaming devices.
10
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   digitally by a processor. Persons skilled in the art will
15 also appreciate that the method could be embodied in
   program code. The program code could be supplied in a
   number of ways, for example on a tangible computer
   readable storage medium, such as a disc or a memory (for
   example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as a
20 data signal  (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server). Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that
   program code provides a series of instructions executable
   by the processor.
25 It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
30 further embodiments.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred
   to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission
   that the prior art forms a part of the common general
35 knowledge in the art in any country.
