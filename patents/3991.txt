BACKGROUND
[0002]          Cancer is presently one of the leading causes of death in developed
nations. Although recent research has vastly increased our understanding of many of the
molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and has provided numerous new avenues for
the treatment of cancer, standard treatments for most malignancies remain gross
resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. While increasingly successful, each of these
treatments may cause numerous undesired side effects. For example, surgery may result
in pain, traumatic injury to healthy tissue, and scarring. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy
may cause nausea, immune suppression, gastric ulceration and secondary tumorigenesis.
Improved methods for the treatment of diseases, including cancer, and compositions
capable of delivering bioactive agents to aid in the treatment of diseases and other
conditions remain desirable.
[0003]          Approximately 60% of all drugs administered to patients in hospitals, for
conditions including cancer, are given in the form of injections.             Intravenous
formulations now have a major role as vehicles for drugs. Intravenous formulations are
finding a greater use in the administration of drugs, because of dependability, accuracy,
convenience, avoidance of the gastric irritation potential of orally administered drugs,
and the importance of continuous as well as intermittent drug therapy. Techniques for
providing intravenous administrations have improved steadily in the last decade, and the
use of such intravenous formulations has been annually increasing.
                                               1

[0004]          International Patent Application Publication No. WO/2009/126764 (filed
April 9, 2009) discloses the treatment of cancer with CoQ10. This application is herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0005]          CoQ10 has a long side chain of 10 isoprenoid units which causes the drug
to be extremely lipophilic and practically insoluble in water.       The bioavailability of
perorally administered CoQ10 is generally extremely low and variable and was found to
be related to the dissolution rate of the formulation. As a consequence of the low peroral
bioavailability, and its intrinsic high variability, intravenous administration systems are
of special interest particularly in the care of cancer patients.   Due to its lipophilicity,
CoQ10 needs to be incorporated into a carrier for intravenous administration so that its
pharmacokinetics are influenced by the carrier system.
[0006]          Coenzyme Q10, also referred to herein as CoQ10, ubiquinone, or
ubidecarenone, is a popular nutritional supplement and can be found in capsule form in
nutritional stores, health food stores, pharmacies, and the like, as a vitamin-like
supplement to help protect the immune system through the antioxidant properties of
ubiquinol, the reduced form of CoQ10. CoQ10 is found throughout most tissues of the
human body and the tissues of other mammals and is concentrated in the mitochondria.
CoQ10 is very lipophilic and, for the most part, insoluble in water. The insolubility is
related to the 50-carbon atom isoprenoid side chain, of hydrocarbon nature as shown in
the following structure of CoQ10.
                 O          CHJ          CC            CHg
 H3C
[0007]          CoQ10, being highly hydrophobic, is essentially insoluble in aqueous
solutions. For CoQ10 to be parenterally administered, it must be contained in a stable
formulation compatible with, for example, intravenous injection.          One approach to
prepare an intravenous formulation of CoQ10 in an aqueous medium requires the
inclusion of one or more surfactants and other entities which would allow the creation of
a dispersion of particles of CoQ1O in an aqueous medium. There are many difficulties
associated with this approach. A prominent difficulty is related to the fact that CoQ1O is
a solid at temperatures below about 500 C. The dispersion of solid particles of CoQ1O in
                                              2

an aqueous medium involves difficulties in the preparation of a safe formulation with a
stability up to about two years for clinical application. Such solid particle dispersions
have been explored, but on standing, particles containing CoQ1O fall to the bottom of
the container, and redispersion by stirring or shaking does not meet the requirements for
medical use. Successful formulations should have a chemical and physical stability of
up to about two years and provide accurate dosing for clinical use.            The second
prominent difficulty is having a formulation which, on intravenous administration, does
not lead to particle separation or precipitation within the blood stream.           Such a
separation would be detrimental to blood flow and potentially be life-threatening.
[0008]          A number of different formulations with the object to enhance the
bioavailability of CoQ10 can be found in the patent literature.         Taki and Takahira
disclose in EP 23349 (04.02.81) that the lymphatic absorption of orally administered
CoQ10 is increased by coadministration of long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides.
Increase   of intestinal  absorption by administration        of capsules  containing  oily
(surfactant) solutions of CoQ10 is disclosed in different patents such as WO 8604503
Al (14.08.86), JP 63188623 A2 (04.08.88), JP 62067019 A2 (26.03.87), JP 59148735
A2 (25.08.84) and JP 56012309 (06.02.81).            Solubilization of CoQ1O in micellar
solutions is described in EP 522433 Al (13.01.93), WO 8803019 Al (05.05.88) and JP
59148718 A2 (25.08.84). Ueno et al. (Acta Pharm. Nord., 1 (1989) 99-104) report on
the increase of peroral bioavailability by inclusion of CoQ1O in a complex with 0
cyclodextrins.    A similar formulation is disclosed in JP 56109590 A2 (31.08.81).
Moreover, incorporation of CoQ1O in emulsions is reported to enhance intestinal
absorption as described, for example, by Yano et al. in EP 494654 A2 (15.07.92).
CoQ1O particles in an amorphous physical state, in particular a super-cooled melt, are
described in US Patent Nos. 6,197,349 (issued March 6, 2001) and 6,207,178 (issued
March 27, 2001).
[0009]          For parenteral, in particular intravenous administration CoQ1O has to be
incorporated into a carrier vehicle since it is not possible to manufacture an aqueous
solution with therapeutic concentrations of CoQ1O due to its lipophilicity.        Lecithin
stabilized soya oil emulsions for intravenous administration of ubidecarenone are
disclosed by Groke and Polzer (DE 3524788 Al, 22.01.87). Sugio et al. (JP 62123113
A2. 04.06.87) as well as Mizushima et al. (JP 60199814 A2. 09.10.85).         JP 63319046
A2 (27.12.88) describes a soya oil emulsion vehicle coated by polysaccharides.         The
concentrations of CoQ1O which can be incorporated in emulsions are, however, limited
due to the relatively poor solubility of CoQ10 in vegetable oils.
                                              3

[0010]          Liposome preparations      of egg lecithin and cholesterol containing
ubidecarenone are disclosed in EP 69399 A2 (12.01.83).             Polysaccharide-modified
liposomes are described e.g. in EP 94692 Al (23.11.83), JP 60001124 A2 (07.01.85)
and JP 63313727 A2 (21.12.88).
[0011]          However, the disadvantage of incorporating a drug into a carrier system
might be that an undesired change and/or significant variability in the pharmacokinetics
of the substance will be caused because the biodistribution is influenced by the
biodistribution of the carrier, its RES activity and drug release from the carrier vehicle.
Bogentoft et al. (in Folkers K., Littaru G. P., Yamagami T., (Eds.), Biomedical and
Clinical Aspects of Coenzyme        Q. Vol. 6. Elsevier 1991, pp. 215-224) observed that
ubidecarenone accumulates in the RES organs when administered intravenously in a
mixed micellar system or an emulsion vehicle, respectively. Furthermore, the solubility
of the bioactive substance in the carrier is often too low to obtain therapeutic doses in
acceptable volumes of the formulation.        In addition, toxic side effects of the carrier
particles by themselves have been discussed in the literature inter alia for parenteral lipid
emulsions (Hajri T. et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1047 (1990) 121-130; Connelly P. W.
et al.; Biochim. Biophys. Acta 666 (1981) 80-89; Aviram M. et al., Biochem. Biophys.
Res. Commun. 155 (1988) 709-713; Singh M. et al.; J. Parenter. Sci. Technol. 40 (1986)

Biophys. Acta711 (1982) 176-192).
[0012]          CoQ1O    is a problematic      substance with regard to pharmaceutical
formulations of this drug. For pharmaceutical IV preparations of CoQ10, where it is
necessary to reduce the particle size, traditional methods have been unsuccessful. For
example, micronization of the material has not been possible using ball-mill, hammer
mill, jet mill, or cryogenic milling etc., due to the non-friable nature and low melting
point of Coenzyme Q10.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0093]          The present invention relates to intravenous formulations of poorly water
soluble active pharmaceutical agents, such as CoQ10.
[0094]          The intravenous formulations of the present invention allow the delivery
of precise amounts of an active pharmaceutical agent, such as CoQ10, into the blood
stream for transport to organs such as the liver and heart and other tissues including
tumors.    The present invention provides a clinically and therapeutically effective and
usable intravenous formulation of, e.g., CoQ1O, that is stable at common ambient
temperatures and remain essentially unchanged in dispersion characteristics for periods
of at least 12 months.
[0095]          For purposes of optimizing readability and to facilitate understanding of
the invention as described herein, it may be beneficial to consider the following
definition of terms and phrases as used herein.
                                             14

I.      Definitions
[0096]           In accordance with the present disclosure and as used herein, the
following terms are defined with the following meanings, unless explicitly stated
otherwise.
[0097]           As used herein, "a", "an," and "the" include plural references unless the
context clearly dictates otherwise.
[0098]           As used herein, a "pharmaceutically acceptable" component is one that is
suitable for use with humans and/or animals without undue adverse side effects (such as
toxicity, irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk
ratio.
[0099]           As used herein, the term "safe and therapeutic effective amount" refers to
the quantity of a component which is sufficient to yield a desired therapeutic response
without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response)
commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of this
disclosure. By "therapeutically effective amount" is meant an amount of a compound of
the present disclosure effective to yield the desired therapeutic response. For example,
accelerated wound healing, relief of pain and fatigue.      The specific safe and effective
amount or therapeutically effective amount will vary with such factors as the particular
condition being treated, the physical condition of the patient, the type of mammal or
animal being treated, the duration of the treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if
any), and the specific formulations employed and the structure of the compounds or its
derivatives.
[00100]           "Treatment" is an intervention performed with the intention of preventing
the development or altering the pathology or symptoms of a disorder.           Accordingly,
"treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic           or preventative
measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as
those in which the disorder is to be prevented.         As used herein, "ameliorated" or
"treatment" refers to a symptom which approaches a normalized value (for example a
value obtained in a healthy patient or individual), e.g., is less than 50% different from a
normalized value, in embodiments less than about 25% different from a normalized
value, in other embodiments is less than 10% different from a normalized value, and in
yet other embodiments the presence of a symptom is not significantly different from a
normalized value as determined using routine statistical tests.
                                               15

[00101]         As used herein, "an ameliorated symptom" or "treated symptom" refers
to a symptom which approaches a normalized value, e.g., is less than 50% different from
a normalized value, in embodiments less than about 25% different from a normalized
value, in other embodiments less than about 10% different from a normalized value, and
yet other embodiments the presence of a symptom is not significantly different from a
normalized value as determined using routine statistical tests.
[00102]         As used herein, "opsonization" refers to the process by which a lipophilic
bioactive agent as described herein is marked for ingestion and destruction by a
phagocyte. Opsonization involves the binding of an opsonin to bioactive agent. After
opsonin binds to the membrane, phagocytes are attracted to the active agent.               An
opsonin is any molecule that acts as a binding enhancer for the process of phagocytosis.
[00103]         As used herein, the term "opsonization reducer" refers to any agent that
works in conjunction with the active agent to reduce the ability of opsonins to act as a
binding enhancer for the process of phagocytosis.
[00104]         In accordance with the present disclosure, a formulation is provided for
improved administration of lipophilic bioactive agents, which may also be referred to
herein as hydrophobic bioactive agents. As used herein, a "lipophilic bioactive agent" or
"hydrophobic bioactive agent" includes an agent that is insoluble or is substantially
insoluble in water. Specifically, lipophilic bioactive agents, as used herein, will have a
solubility in water that is less than about 1 part of bioactive drug in about 1000 parts of
water.
[00105]         As used herein, the term "colloidal" refers to a state of subdivision,
implying that the molecules or polymolecular particles dispersed in a medium have at
least in one direction a dimension roughly between 1-nm and 1-Pm.
[00106]         As used herein, a "dispersion" or "colloidal dispersion" refers to a system
in which particles of colloidal size of any nature (e.g., solid, liquid or gas) are dispersed
in a continuous phase of a different composition or state. In intravenous drug delivery
the continuous phase is substantially water and the dispersed particles can be solid (a
suspension) or an immiscible liquid (emulsion).
[00107]         As used herein, a "super-cooled melt" refers to the state of the active
agent after homogenization wherein at a temperature below the melting point of the bulk
material of the active agent, the colloidal particles are not in a solid or crystalline form
but rather in an amorphous state.
                                             16

[00108]          As used herein, a "lyoprotectant" refers to pharmaceutically acceptable
excipients, which protect the dispersed active agent against destabilizing conditions
during the lyophilisation process, subsequent storage and reconstitution.
[00109]          The terms "colloidal particles," "dispersion particles," "nano-dispersion
particles," and "colloidal dispersion particles" are all used interchangeably herein and
refer to the dispersed form of the active agent into nano-particles either in the bulk state
or in a melted state.
[00110]          The term "formulation" as used herein to refer to CoQ1O includes
poloxamer unless otherwise specified.
[00111]          A "patient" or "subject" to be treated by the method of the invention can
mean either a human or non-human animal, preferably a mammal. It should be noted
that clinical observations described herein were made with human subjects and, in at
least some embodiments, the subjects are human.
[00112]          "Therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound
that, when administered to a patient for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such
treatment for the disease. When administered for preventing a disease, the amount is
sufficient to avoid or delay onset of the disease. The "therapeutically effective amount"
will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight,
etc., of the patient to be treated.
[00113]          "Preventing" or "prevention" refers to a reduction in risk of acquiring a
disease or disorder (i.e., causing at least one of the clinical symptoms of the disease not
to develop in a patient that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not
yet experience or display symptoms of the disease).
[00114]          The    term    "prophylactic"    or  "therapeutic"   treatment  refers   to
administration to the subject of one or more of the subject compositions. If it is
administered prior to clinical manifestation of the unwanted condition (e.g., disease or
other unwanted state of the host animal) then the treatment is prophylactic, i.e., it
protects the host against developing the unwanted condition, whereas if administered
after manifestation of the unwanted condition, the treatment is therapeutic (i.e., it is
intended to diminish, ameliorate or maintain the existing unwanted condition or side
effects therefrom).
[00115]          The term "therapeutic effect" refers to a local or systemic effect in
animals,    particularly    mammals,   and    more   particularly   humans   caused   by   a
                                               17

pharmacologically active substance. The term thus means any substance intended for use
in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or in the
enhancement of desirable physical or mental development and conditions in an animal
or human. The phrase "therapeutically-effective amount" means that amount of such a
substance that produces some desired local or systemic effect at a reasonable benefit/risk
ratio applicable to any treatment. In certain embodiments, a therapeutically-effective
amount of a compound will depend on its therapeutic index, solubility, and the like. For
example, certain compounds discovered by the methods of the present invention may be
administered in a sufficient amount to produce a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable
to such treatment.
[00116]         The terms "disorders" and "diseases" are used inclusively and refer to any
deviation from the normal structure or function of any part, organ or system of the body
(or any combination thereof). A specific disease is manifested by characteristic
symptoms and signs, including biological, chemical and physical changes, and is often
associated with a variety of other factors including, but not limited to, demographic,
environmental, employment, genetic and medically historical factors. Certain
characteristic signs, symptoms, and related factors can be quantitated through a variety
of methods to yield important diagnostic information.
The term "expression" is used herein to mean the process by which a polypeptide is
produced from DNA. The process involves the transcription of the gene into mRNA and
the translation of this mRNA into a polypeptide. Depending on the context in which
used, "expression" may refer to the production of RNA, protein or both.
[00117]         The terms "level of expression of a gene" or "gene expression level"
refer to the level of mRNA, as well as pre-mRNA nascent transcript(s), transcript
processing intermediates, mature mRNA(s) and degradation products, or the level of
protein, encoded by the gene in the cell.
[00118]         Reference will now be made in detail to preferred embodiments of the
invention. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the preferred
embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to those
preferred embodiments. To the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives,
modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the
invention as defined by the appended claims.
[00119]         In all occurrences in this application where there are a series of recited
numerical values, it is to be understood that any of the recited numerical values may be
the upper limit or lower limit of a numerical range. It is to be further understood that the
                                              18

invention encompasses all such numerical ranges, i.e., a range having a combination of
an upper numerical limit and a lower numerical limit, wherein the numerical value for
each of the upper limit and the lower limit can be any numerical value recited herein.
II.      Compositions
[00120]         The present disclosure provides CoQ1O compositions for the treatment
and prevention of cancer.         The composition of the present disclosure can be
administered to a patient either by themselves, or in pharmaceutical compositions where
it is mixed with suitable carriers or excipient(s).      In treating a patient exhibiting a
disorder of interest, a therapeutically effective amount of an agent or agents such as
these is administered.     A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of the
compound that results in amelioration of symptoms or a prolongation of survival in a
patient.
[00121]         Subjects   from   many    different  species   can    be  treated   with the
compositions of the present disclosure. A non-exhaustive exemplary list of such animals
includes mammals such as mice, rats, rabbits, goats, sheep, pigs, horses, cattle, dogs,
cats, and primates such as monkeys, apes, and human beings. Those animal subjects
known to suffer muscle fatigue, pain, wounds, and the like may be suitable for use of the
present disclosure.     In particular, human patients suffering from injuries, surgery,
arthritis, muscle fatigue, cancer and the like are suitable animal subjects for use of the
invention disclosed herein.     By adapting the methods taught herein to other methods
known in medicine or veterinary science (e.g., adjusting doses of administered
substances according to the weight of the subject animal), the compositions utilized in
the present disclosure can be readily optimized for use in other animals.
[00122]         Suitable routes of administration of the present compositions of the
invention may include parenteral delivery, including, intravenous              intramuscular,
subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular,
intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections, just to name a few. In
one embodiment, the compositions provided herein may be administered by injecting
directly to a tumor. In some embodiments, the formulations of the invention may be
administered by intravenous injection or intravenous infusion. In one embodiment, the
                                              19

compositions of the invention are administered by intravenous injection.              In one
embodiment, the compositions of the invention are administered by intravenous
infusion.    Where the route of administration is, for example intravenous infusion,
embodiments are provided herein where the IV infusion comprises the active agent, e.g.,
Coenzyme Q1O, at approximately a 40 mg/mL concentration. Where the composition is
administered by IV infusion, it is diluted in phosphate buffered saline.            In some
embodiments, one or more routes of administration may be combined, such as, for
example, intravenous and intratumoral, or intravenous and peroral, or intravenous and
oral, or intravenous and transdermal or transmucosal.
[00123]         The compositions described herein may be administered to a subject in
any suitable formulation.     For example, CoQ10 might be formulated for parenteral
delivery, e.g., for subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intratumoral injection.
The compositions may be administered in a single bolus, multiple injections, or by
continuous infusion (for example, intravenously or by peritoneal dialysis).              For
parenteral administration, the compositions may be formulated in a sterilized pyrogen
free form. Compositions of the present disclosure can also be administered in vitro to a
cell (for example, to Bcl-2 production in a cell or in an in vitro culture) by simply adding
the composition to the fluid in which the cell is contained.
[00124]         Use of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to formulate the compounds
herein disclosed, for the practice of the present invention, into dosages suitable for
systemic administration is within the scope of the present disclosure.           With proper
choice of carrier and suitable manufacturing practice, the compositions of the present
disclosure,   in particular,  those formulated      as  solutions,   may be     administered
parenterally, such as by intravenous injection.
[00125]         Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined
by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for
determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose
therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and
therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio
LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices may be desirable. The
data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in
formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds may be
within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no
toxicity.   The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form
employed and the route of administration utilized.

[00126]         Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention
include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an effective amount
to achieve its intended purpose. Determination of the effective amounts is well within
the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure
provided herein.       In addition to the      active ingredients,    these pharmaceutical
compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers including
excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into
preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.          The preparations formulated for
intravenous administration may be in the form of solutions of colloidal dispersion.
[00127]         Pharmaceutical    compositions    for parenteral    administration  include
aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form.              Additionally,
suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection
suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame
oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes.
Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of
the   suspension,   such as sodium carboxymethyl          cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran.
Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase
the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated
solutions.
III.    Formulations
[00128]         The present invention provides therapeutic formulations comprising a
hydrophobic active agent, such as Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), that are suitable for
intravenous administration to a subject as described herein.        Through high pressure
homogenization, active agent (e.g., CoQ10) particles are reduced to produce particles
that are small enough to pass through a 200-nm sterilizing filter. Particles that are small
enough to pass through a 200-nm sterilizing filter can be injected intravenously. These
particles are much smaller than blood cells and therefore will not embolize capillaries.
Red blood cells for example are 6-mm x 2-mm disks. The particles are dispersed to and
are encased or surrounded by a stabilizing agent. While not wishing to be bound by any
theory, it is believed that the stabilizing agents are attracted to the hydrophobic active
agent such that the dispersed particles of the hydrophobic active agent are surrounded by
the stabilizing agent forming a suspension or an emulsion. The dispersed particles in the
suspension or emulsion comprises a stabilizing agent surface and a core consisting of the
hydrophobic active agent in a solid particulate form (suspension) or in an immiscible
                                             21

liquid form (emulsion). In certain aspects, the dispersed particles are entrenched in the
lipophilic regions of a liposome.
[00129]         The    dispersed  colloidal  system provided    herein provides      certain
performance advantages over the prior art. For example, the present invention permits a
high drug load in the formulation without the use of co-solvents. Additionally, high and
relatively reproducible plasma levels are achieved without the dependence                 on
endogenous low-density lipoprotein carriers. More importantly, the present invention
allows sustained high drug levels in solid tumors due to the passive accumulation of the
colloidal particles of the hydrophobic active agent.
[00130]         The present intravenous formulation substantially comprises a continuous
phase of water and dispersed solids (suspension) or dispersed immiscible liquid
(emulsion). Dispersed colloidal systems, in which the particles are composed largely of
the active agent (drug) itself, can often deliver more drug per unit volume than
continuous solubilizing systems, if the system can be made adequately stable.           The
present invention provides colloidal dispersions of poorly water-soluble active agents,
such as CoQ10.
[00131]         By utilizing mechanical devices, such as a Microfluidizer, the particle
size is reduced by high pressure continuous homogenization, forming colloidal-sized
droplets in a spray system, or by shearing the particles in a liquid flowing at high
velocity in a restricted and tortuous passage. Significant energy is required to cleave the
bulk particle itself. The smaller particles increases the interfacial area of the active
agent.   Surfactants are used to reduce the interfacial energy thereby stabilizing the
dispersion.   The particle size determines the total interfacial area and the interfacial
energy that must be accommodated to achieve a stable system. As the particle size goes
down, more energy is required to produce the particle and since the total surface area
goes up, the surfactant must accommodate a greater interfacial energy.
[00132]         Through high pressure homogenization as exemplifed herein, the particle
size of the active agent, e.g., CoQ1O, was reduced to less than 200-nm.            In some
embodiments the particle size was reduced to between 10-nm and 200-nm or between
 10-nm and 100-nm or more preferably between 30-nm and 80-nm.                     In some
embodiments, the resulting colloidal active agent, e.g., CoQ1O, particles are in an
amorphous super-cooled state as defined herein.
[00133]         In certain embodiments, the dispersed CoQ10 particles are crystallized by
a lyophilization process to produce nano-dispersion particles wherein the active agent
core was in crystalline form (see Figures 1-3). Polarizing light microscopy (PLM) or X
                                             22

ray powder diffraction (XRDP) was used to confirm the crystalinity of the CoQ1O
colloidal dispersion and compared to the XRDP of bulk CoQ1O (see Figures 4-13.). In
form R, as depicted in Fig. 1, a formulation comprising 5.0 wt% CoQ1O, 3.3 wt%
poloxamer and 91 wt% of water, was cycled 20 times in a microfluidizer and then
lyophilized to produce the particles depicted in the first vial from the left in Fig. 1. The
XRDP, as depicted in Fig. 9 demonstrates that the CoQ10 particles were crystalline. In
form A, as depicted in the Fig. 1 vial, second from the left, a formulation comprising 3
wt% CoQ10, 1.8 wt% Lipoid SPC-3 and 95.2 wt% water, was cycled 20 times in a
microfluidizer to reduce the particle size. The particles were then lyophilized to produce
the particles depicted in the second from left vial of Fig. 1. The XRDP, as depicted in
Fig. 4 below, demonstrates that the CoQ10 particles were crystalline. In form 0, as
depicted in Fig. 1, a formulation comprising 5.0 wt% CoQ10, 3.0 wt% DMPC and 92
wt% of water, was cycled 20 times in a microfluidizer and then lyophilized to produce
the particles depicted in the third vial from the left in Fig. 1. The XRDP, as depicted in
Fig. 7 below, demonstrates that the CoQ10 particles were crystalline.         In form C, as
depicted in Fig. 1, a formulation comprising 5.0 wt% CoQ10, 3.3 wt% poloxamer and
91 wt% of water, was cycled 20 times in a microfluidizer and then lyophilized to
produce the particles depicted in the fourth vial from the left in Fig. 1. The XRDP, as
depicted in Fig. 5 demonstrates that the CoQ10 particles were crystalline. In form G, as
depicted in Fig. 2, a formulation comprising 5.0 wt% CoQ10, 3.0 wt% Lipoid SPC-3
and 92 wt% of water, was cycled 20 times in a microfluidizer and then lyophilized to
produce the particles depicted in the first vial from the left in Fig. 2. The XRDP, as
depicted in Fig. 6 demonstrates that the CoQ1O particles were crystalline. In form      Q, as
depicted in Fig. 2, a formulation comprising 5.0 wt% CoQ1O, 2.5 wt% DMPC, 0.5 wt%
sodium deoxycholate and 92 wt% of water, was cycled 20 times in a microfluidizer and
then lyophilized to produce the particles depicted in the second vial from the left in Fig.
2.   The XRDP, as depicted in Fig. 8 demonstrates that the CoQ1O particles were
crystalline. In form S, as depicted in Fig. 2, a formulation comprising 7.5 wt% CoQ1O,
4.5 wt% DMPC and 88 wt% of water, was cycled 20 times in a microfluidizer and then
lyophilized to produce the particles depicted in the third vial from the left in Fig. 2. The
XRDP, as depicted in Fig. 10 demonstrates that the CoQ1O particles were crystalline. In
form T, as depicted in Fig. 2, a formulation comprising 7.5 wt% CoQ1O, 5.0 wt%
polaxamer and 87.5 wt% of water, was cycled 20 times in a microfluidizer and then
lyophilized to produce the particles depicted in the fourth vial from the left in Fig. 2.
The XRDP, as depicted in Fig. 11 demonstrates that the CoQ1O particles were
crystalline. In form U, as depicted in Fig. 3, a formulation comprising 7.5 wt% CoQ1O,
4.0 wt% DMPC, 1.0 wt% poloxamer 188 and 87.5 wt% of water, was cycled 20 times in
a microfluidizer and then lyophilized to produce the particles depicted in the first vial
                                             23

from the left in Fig. 3. The XRDP, as depicted in Fig. 12 demonstrates that the CoQ10
particles were crystalline. In form V, as depicted in Fig. 3, a formulation comprising 3.0
wt% CoQ10, 1.5 wt% DMPC and 95.5 wt% of water, was cycled 20 times in a
microfluidizer and then lyophilized to produce the particles depicted in the second vial
from the left in Fig. 3. The XRDP, as depicted in Fig. 13 demonstrates that the CoQ10
particles were crystalline.
[00134]         In lyophilizing the particles, the dryer was cooled to -35 C.          Three
milliliters of each of the above formulation was added to the 5 mL serum vial, in
duplicate. Serum stopper was placed on top but allowed room for water vapor to escape.
Formulations were placed in -78'C freezer for 1-hour to rapid freeze. After this period,
all were transferred in toto to the middle shelf of dryer. Vacuum was immediately
initiated. After 16 hours the temperature was adjusted from -35'C to -30'C. After 24
hours the temperature was adjusted from -30'C to -28'C. After 2 hours, the temperature
was adjusted from -28'C to -26'C. After 4 hours the temperature was further adjusted to
between -26'C and -25'C. After reaching -25'C, the vials were stoppered and the
vacuum released to ambient air.       Vials were banded and photos taken of the dried
products as depicted in Figs. 1-3.
[00135]         In reducing the dispersion particle size, it may be desirable for the CoQ10
mixture to go through several passes through a Microfluidizer to obtain the desired
particle size. After a single pass through M110P Microfluidizer with F12Y interaction
chamber with     7 5-am passages, particles of less than 200-nm mean diameter were
produced. After 20 passes the mean diameter of the particles were less than 50-nm (see
Fig. 14). The formulation contained 5g of CoQ1O, 3g of DMPC and 92 mL of water.
One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the amounts of the CoQ10, DMPC
and water may be adjusted depending on the desired therapeutic use. The Microfluidizer
operated at a maximum pressure of 25,000 PSI. In certain embodiments, it is preferable
to add at least one of a dispersion stabilizing agent and an opsonization reducer. In
certain embodiments, the colloidal particles are prepared using both the dispersion
stabilizer agent and the opsonization reducer. Preferred dispersion stabilizing agents
include Polyethoxylated (a/k/a pegylated) castor oil (Cremophor@ EL), Polyethoxylated
hydrogenated castor oil (Cremophor@ RH 40), Tocopherol polyethylene glycol
succinate (Pegylated vitamin E, Vitamin E TPGS), Polysorbates (Tweens®), Sorbitan
fatty acid esters (Spans@), Bile acids and bile-acid salts and DMPC while preferred
opsonization    reducers    include  Polyethylene    glycol    of  various   chain   lengths,
polysaccharides, other PEG-containing copolymers, poloxamines or poloxamers such as
poloxamer 188. In certain embodiments, heparin also constitutes a suitable opsonization
reducer.    The poloxamer provides a hydrophilic surface so as to reduce particle
                                            24

opsonization after administration.      The poloxamer also functions as a particle surface
modifier, to add bulky chains to reduce opsonization by steric interaction. Poloxamer
 188 (Pluronic@ F68, Lutrol@ F68) has approximately 28 PPG units in the center block
and 79 PEG units in the end blocks. The hydrophobic center block anchors the molecule
to the particle, and the PEG end blocks are extended from the particle. Opsonization is
reduced by both the hydrophilicity of the PEG chains and by the steric (space-filling)
effects of the chains (i.e., proteins can't get to the surface).
[00136]          Through the methods, further described herein, the present invention
provides a therapeutic formulation that is suitable for intravenous administration to a
subject.    The therapeutic formulation includes an aqueous solution.           In certain
embodiments of the present invention, the aqueous solution is water.        The aqueous
solution may function as either or both the dispersion medium for the colloidal system or
as the formulation medium for parenteral administration and delivery of the colloidal
particles.   As the dispersion medium, the aqueous solution may contain other water
soluble or dispersible stabilizers, isotonicity agents such as glycerol or xylitol,
lyoprotectants such as sucrose, glucose, trehalose, etc., electrolytes, buffers,
antilloculants such as sodium citrate, sodium pyrophosphate or sodium dodecylsulfate or
preservatives.
[00137]          Lyoprotectants comprise but are not limited to the group consisting of
sugars, polyols (such as e.g. sugar alcohols) and amino acids. Preferred lyoprotectants
include sugars such as sucrose, trehalose, and glucose. Other suitable sugars include,
lactose, mannose, maltose, galactose, fructose, sorbose, raffinose, neuraminic acid,
amino      sugars    such     as    glucosamine,      galactosamine, N-methylglucosamine
("Meglumine"), polyols such as mannitol and sorbitol, and amino acids such as arginine
and glycine.
[00138]          As the formulation medium, the aqueous solution may include Hank's
solution, ringer's solution, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), physiological saline buffer
or other suitable salts or combinations to achieve the appropriate pH and osmolarity for
parenterally delivered formulations..       The aqueous solution may contain substances
which increase the viscosity of the solution, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,
sorbitol, or dextran.
[00139]          The therapeutic formulations of the invention include a hydrophobic, or
otherwise poorly water-soluble, active agent. The hydrophobic active agent is dispersed
in the aqueous solution such that a colloidal dispersion is formed wherein the nano
dispersion particles of the hydrophobic active agent are covered or encased or encircled
                                               25

by the dispersion stabilizing agents to form nano-dispersions of the active agent (e.g.,
CoQ10) particles. The nano-dispersed active agent (e.g., CoQ10) particles have a core
formed of the hydrophobic active agent that is surrounded by the stabilizing agent.
Similarly, in certain aspects, the stabilizing agent is a phospholipid having both a
hydrophilic and lipophilic portion.        The phospholipids form liposomes or other
nanoparticles upon homogenization.       In certain aspects these liposomes are bi-layered
unilamellar liposomes while in other aspects the liposomes are bi-layered multi-lamellar
liposomes.    The dispersed active agent (e.g., CoQ10) particles are dispersed in the
lipophilic portion of the bi-layered structure of the liposome formed from the
phospholipids.    In certain other aspects the core of the liposome, like the core of the
nano-dispersion of active agent (e.g., CoQ10) particles is formed of the hydrophobic
active agent and the outer layer is formed of the bi-layered structure of the phospholipid.
In certain embodiments the colloidal dispersions are treated by a lyophilization process
whereby the nanoparticle dispersion is converted to a dry powder.
[00140]         In certain embodiments of the present invention, the hydrophobic agent is
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).         Coenzyme Q10, also referred to herein as CoQ10, is also
known as ubiquinone, or ubidecarenone. CoQ10 is art-recognized and further described
in International Publication No. WO 2005/069916, the entire disclosure of which is
incorporated by reference herein.        CoQ10 is one of a series of polyprenyl 2,3
dimethoxy-5-methylbenzoquinone        (ubiquinone) present in the mitochondrial electron
transport systems of eukaryotic cells. Human cells produce CoQ10 exclusively and it is
found in cell and mitochondrial membranes of all human cells, with the highest levels in
organs with high energy requirements, such as the liver and the heart. The body pool of
CoQ10 has been estimated to be about 2 grams, of which more than 50% is endogenous.
Approximately 0.5 grams of CoQ10 is required from the diet or biosynthesis each day.
CoQ10 is produced in ton quantities from the worldwide supplement market and can be
obtained from Kaneka, with plants in Pasadena, Texas and Takasagoshi, Japan.
[00141]         The tissue distribution and redox state of CoQ10 in humans has been
characterized.   Typically, tissues with high-energy requirements or metabolic activity
such as the heart, kidney, liver and muscle have relatively high concentrations of
CoQ10. Most of the CoQ10 in plasma is present as the reduced ubiquinol. A substantial
portion of CoQ10 in tissues is in the reduced form as the hydroquinone or uniquinol.
The exception is brain and lung. The oxidized state is presumed to be a reflection of the
increased oxidative stress in the tissues.      More specifically, in heart, kidney, liver,
muscle, intenstine and blood (plasma), about 61%, 75%, 95%, 65%, 95% and 96%,
respectively, of CoQ10 is in the reduced form.
                                             26

[00142]         CoQ10 is very lipophilic and, for the most part, insoluble in water. Due
to its insolubility in water, limited solubility in lipids, and relatively large molecular
weight, the efficiency of absorption of orally administered CoQ10 is poor. Bhagavan, et
al. (Free Rad. Res. 40:445-453(2006)) reported that that in rats only about 2-3% of
orally-administered CoQ10 was absorbed and that CoQ10 is reduced to ubiquinol either
during or following absorption in the intestine. In a study by Matthews et al., (Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:8892-8897 (1998)), CoQ10 uptake was found to be age
dependent in some tissues.         For example, in young rats, plasma, liver, and spleen
concentrations increased after four days of dosing, but no increase was observed in heart
or kidney. Similarly, oral administration did not increase concentration of CoQ10 in
brain in 1-2 month old animals. However, administration of CoQ10 to 12 month old and
24 month old rats resulted in accumulation of CoQ10 in cerebral tissues in both the
oxidized and reduced forms.        Interestingly, CoQ10 production is stimulated in young
rats, but not old rats, after ischemia-reperfusion injury.
[00143]         In one embodiment of the invention, the hydrophobic active agent is
CoQ10, a metabolite of CoQ10, a building block of CoQ10, an analog of CoQ10, or a
derivative of CoQ10. An analog of CoQ10 includes analogs having no or at least one
isoprenyl repeats. CoQ10 has the following structure:
                              0
                  O                     CH

                                       L           CH       x
wherein x is 10. In the instant invention, CoQ10 can include derivatives of CoQ10 in
which x is any number of isoprenyl units from 4-10, or any number of isoprenyl units
from 6-10, or any number of isoprenyl units from 8-10, or 9-10 isoprenyl units. CoQ1O
includes the fully oxidized version, also known as ubiquinone, the partially oxidized
version, also known as semiquinone or ubisemiquinone, or the fully reduced version,
also known as ubiquinol; or any mixtures or combinations thereof.
[00144]         Building blocks of CoQ1O           include any components     or synthetic
precursors, preferably biologically relevant precursors, of CoQ1O. Thus, building blocks
                                                27

of    CoQ10     include,  but    are   not  limited  to,   phenylalanine,   tyrosine,  4
hydroxyphenylpyruvate, phenylacetate, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelate, vanillic acid,
4-hydroxybenzoate, mevalonic acid, farnesyl, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-p-benzoquinone,
as well as the corresponding acids or ions thereof.      Experimental data indicate that
building blocks of CoQ10 biosynthesis, such as the precursors for the biosynthesis of the
benzoquinone ring, and those for the biosynthesis of the isoprenoid repeats and their
attachment to the benzoquinone ring, can be individually administered or administered
in combination to target cells to modulate expression of the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2
and/or expression of the apoptosis promoter Caspase-3. See, e.g., US Patent Application
Ser. No. 12/778,094 and the examples provided herein.
[00145]         A metabolite of CoQ10 includes any known metabolite of CoQ10. See
e.g., Turunen, M. et al. Biochemica et Biophysica Acta 1660: 171-199 (2004), the entire
contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. The main metabolite has been
identified has an aromatic ring with a side chain shortened to 5-7 atoms.          Such a
metabolite is shown below. The metabolite may optionally be phosphorylated at carbon
4 or carbon 1.

[00146]         A derivative of CoQ10 includes any compound that is structurally
identical to CoQ10, except that one atom is replaced with another atom or group of
atoms.

this colloidal system include anesthetics such as butanilicain, fomocain, lidocain,

E, D, K and their derivates; insecticides, herbicides and pesticides such as acephate,
cyfluthrin,   azinphosphomethyl,      cypermethrin,  fenclofos,  permelthrin,   piperonal,
tetramethrin and trifluralin. In certain other embodiments, the colloidal system includes
mTor inhibitors, EGFr, and FGF analogues.
[00148]         The active agent can be located in the core of the colloidal particles
where they are dissolved, solubilized or dispersed in the matrix, and/or in the stabilizer
layer(s) surrounding the particle core, and/or can be adsorbed to the surface of the
colloidal particles.     The bioactive substances can be dissolved or crystalline or
amorphous or a mixture of any of these states. The therapeutic formulation also includes
at least one of a dispersion stabilizing agent and an opsonization reducer. The colloidal
particles may be liposomes as described herein and may also contain other active agents
or other inactive agents, or other hydrophobic or hydrophilic agents.
[00149]         Dispersion of the active agent, e.g., CoQ1O, bulk material into nano
particles increases the interfacial energy as the size of the particles is reduced over
passes through the homogenization process.        The affinity of a dispersion stabilizing
agent such as, for example, DMPC, to the active agent, e.g., CoQ1O, nano-particles,
causes the dispersion stabilizing agent (e.g., DMPC) to encase the nano-particles and
form an active agent, e.g., CoQ1O, nano-dispersion.      The dispersion stabilizing agent
stabilizes the active agent, e.g., CoQ1O, nano-dispersion by accommodating the high
interfacial energy and thereby preventing or reducing coalescence of the dispersed active
agent, e.g., CoQ1O, particles. In certain embodiments of the invention, liposomes are
formed by the colloidal dispersions wherein the phospholipid stabilizer forms a bi
                                             29

layered system about the dispersed particles of the hydrophobic bioactive agent or
substance. In certain embodiments the liposomes are bi-layered unilamellar liposomes
as depicted in Fig. 15. In other embodiments the liposomes are bi-layered multilamellar
liposomes as depicted in Fig. 15. In certain embodiments, the dispersed particles of the
hydrophobic active agent are within lipophilic portion of the bi-layers. In certain other
embodiments, where the liposome are multi-lamellar, the hydrophobic active agent is
within the lipophilic portion of the bi-layers. In certain other embodiments where the
liposomes are multi-lamellar, the dispersed hydrophobic active agent is within the
lipophilic portion of the bi-layer of the liposome and a second agent is in the hydrophilic
portion that is between the bi-layered portions of the multi-lamellar liposome.
[00150]         Proper selection of a surfactant, or a mixture of surfactants, can produce a
formulation in which the shelf product is a concentrated solution of drug in liquid
surfactants, and upon addition of infusion fluid, the interfacial energy reduction achieved
by the surfactants is sufficient to emulsify the system to a colloidal system.           The
dispersion stabilizing agent may be selected from Polyethoxylated (a/k/a pegylated)
castor oil (Cremophor@ EL), Polyethoxylated hydrogenated castor oil (Cremophor@ RH
40), Tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (Pegylated vitamin E, Vitamin E TPGS),
Polysorbates (Tweens®), Sorbitan fatty acid esters (Spans®), Bile acids and bile-acid
salts and dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline (DMPC).         The dispersion stabilizing agent
organizes at the interface of the reduced size particles and reduce the interfacial energy,
making the dispersion more stable.
[00151]         Phospholipids have a high affinity for CoQ10, as is demonstrated by the
close association of the two in biological membranes. The dispersion stabilizing agent is
included in the formulation to, at least, reduce the interfacial tension as the particle size
is reduced.   In the colloidal dispersion, the nano-dispersion particles include an active
agent core surrounded by the stabilizing agent.        The dispersion stabilizing agent is
typically an amphiphilic substance, i.e. those with a hydrophilic and hydrophobic part of
the molecules.    At the particle surface, the amphiphilic substances are predominantly
arranged in such a way that the hydrophobic part of the molecule protrudes into the core
and the hydrophilic part into the surrounding dispersion medium.           The surfaces are
therefore hydrophilic.
[00152]          Other suitable phospholipids include lecithin, lysolecithin,
phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol,
phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylcholine,
lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidic acid,
                                              30

lysophosphatidylserine, PEG-phosphatidylethanolamine, PVP
phosphatidylethanolamine, and combinations thereof and therewith.
[00153]          In one embodiment, the dispersion stabilizing agent is not an agent
selected from the group of lecithin, polysorbate 80 and olacta. In one embodiment, the
dispersion stabilizing agent is not lecithin.         In one embodiment, the dispersion
stabilizing agent is not polysorbate 80. In one embodiment, the dispersion stabilizing
agent is not olacta.
[00154]          The formulations of the invention may further include an opsonization
reducer. The opsonization reducer may be selected from Polyethylene glycol of various
chain lengths, polysaccharides, other PEG-containing copolymers, poloxamines or
poloxamers such as poloxamer 188. As defined herein, an opsonization reducer refers to
any inactive agent that works in conjunction with the active agent to reduce the ability of
opsonins to act as a binding enhancer for the process of phagocytosis. The inactive
agent must be included in the FDA's Inactive Ingredient List, which is hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety. The inactive agents must not include pegylated
nonionic surfactants (e.g., polysorbate 80, polyethoxylated castor oil, and PEG ethers
and esters of fatty alcohols and acids, respectively), since these materials can cause
extreme hypersensitivity reactions. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the opsonization
reducer is not polysorbate 80.      In one embodiment, the opsonization reducer is not
polyethoxylated castor oil. In one embodiment, the opsonization reducer is not PEG
ethers of fatty alcohols. In one embodiment, the opsonization reducer is not PEG esters
of fatty acids.
[00155]          Colloidal-sized particles larger than 10-nm, for example, are not filtered
by the kidneys and will circulate until they are cleared by active processes or they
extravasate by diffusing through gaps between vascular endothelial cells.      Phagocytic
cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) or mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS)
will capture colloidal particles by endocytosis. These cells include macrophages related
to liver (Kupffer cells), spleen, lymph nodes (perivascular macrophages), nervous
system (microglia), and bones (osteoclasts). Nonspecific attachment of opsonins (e.g.,
immunoglobulins, complement components, other serum proteins) marks the particles as
foreign. Enzymes and an oxidative-reactive environment in the endosome will destroy
the captured particles.
[00156]          Opsonization of colloidal particles can be reduced, resulting in longer
circulation, by a number of factors, including particle size below 100-nm, a neutral or
negative surface charge, and adsorption or bonding of bulky hydrophilic chains.         An
                                              31

important element of the utility of colloidal drug delivery to solid tumors results from
unique anatomical and physiological characteristics of tumors. The capillary network of
tumors is tortuous with wide interendothelial junctions (100 to 780-nm) and the tumor
has no lymphatic drainage. These characteristics result in passive targeting of colloidal
particles to tumors. Particles extravasate through the leaky junctions and remain in the
tumor interstitium.
[00157]         The opsonization reducer is included in the formulation to modify the
biological response to the particles. The present invention provides a method wherein
the ability to clear the colloidal drug particles by opsonization is reduced by the
inclusion of an opsonization reducer in the formulation presented herein. The inclusion
of an opsonization reducer results in higher drug levels in tumors than in the plasma.
[00158]         In one embodiment, the formulation of the invention does not comprise
polysorbate 80. In one embodiment, the formulation of the invention does not comprise
polyethoxylated castor oil. In one embodiment, the formulation of the invention does not
comprise PEG ethers of fatty alcohols.       In one embodiment, the formulation of the
invention does not comprise PEG esters of fatty acids.           In one embodiment, the
formulation of the invention does not comprise an agent selected from the group of
lecithin, polysorbate 80 and olacta. In one embodiment, the formulation of the invention
does not comprise lecithin. In one embodiment, the formulation of the invention does
not comprise polysorbate 80. In one embodiment, the formulation of the invention does
not comprise olacta.
[00159]         It has been found, and herein disclosed, that the ratio of the active agent
and the inactive agents are important to the control of the particles' size. In order to
obtain the benefits of the dispersion stabilizing agent and the opsonization reducer
without negatively impacting the benefits of either, or that of the particle size, the ratio
of active agent      (e.g., CoQ10),   dispersion stabilizing   agent (e.g., DMPC)       and
opsonization reducer (e.g., poloxamer) may be adjusted to accommodate a desired
particle size and a desired biological response to the colloidal dispersion upon
intravenous administration. In certain embodiments, the formulation is prepared such
that the weight-per-volume of active agent (e.g., CoQ10), dispersion stabilizing agent
(e.g., DMPC) and opsonization reducer (e.g., poloxamer) are each 4%, 3%, and 1.5%,
respectively. In certain other embodiments the weight-per-volume of active agent (e.g.,
CoQ10), dispersion stabilizing agent (e.g., DMPC) and opsonization reducer (e.g.,
poloxamer) are 8%, 6% and 3.0%, respectively.               In certain embodiments, the
formulation is prepared such that the weight-per-volume of CoQ10, DMPC and
poloxamer are each 4%, 3%, and 1.5%, respectively. In certain other embodiments the
                                             32

weight-per-volume     of CoQ10, DMPC and poloxamer are 8%, 6% and 3.0%,
respectively.
[00160]         The hydrophobic active agent is dispersed at a temperature above its
melting point to facilitate dispersion.    CoQ10 has a melting point of approximately
48'C. It is herein contemplated that the melting point may vary and may, for example
include any value ranging from 47.5'C to 49.5'C, e.g., 47.5'C, 48.0'C, 48.5'C, 49.0'C
or 49.5'C. In certain embodiments, CoQ10 is mixed in a water bath of 65'C to form a
CoQ10/water mixture, thereby improving the ability to disperse and reduce the particle
size of CoQ10.
[00161]         In preferred embodiments, the active agent, for example CoQ10, is
processed through a high-pressure homogenizer (Microfluidizer), such as those available
from Microfluidics, Inc.     A process stream containing CoQ10 is pumped into an
interaction chamber at high velocity and the particles are sheared by wall collisions and
cavitations. These shear effects reduce the particle size over repeated passes through the
Microfluidizer.   The particles of the present invention have size distributions in the
nanometer size range with mean particle diameters less than about 200-nm as
determined by photon correlation spectroscopy. In one embodiment, the mean size of
the nano-dispersion particle is less than about 150-nm. In one embodiment, the mean
size of the nano-dispersion particle is less than about 125-nm. In one embodiment, the
mean size of the nano-dispersion particle is less than about 100-nm.               In one
embodiment, the mean size of the nano-dispersion particle is less than about 95-nm, less
than about 90-nm, less than about 85-nm, less than about 80-nm, less than about 75-nm,
less than about 70-nm, less than about 65-nm, less than about 60-nm, less than about 55
nm, less than about 50-nm, less than about 45-nm, less than about 40-nm, less than about
35-nm, less than about 30-nm, or less than about 25-nm. In one embodiment, the mean
size of the nano-dispersion particle is less than about 49-nm, less than about 48-nm, less
than about 47-nm, less than about 46-nm, less than about 45-nm, less than about 44-nm,
less than about 43-nm, less than about 42-nm, or less than about 41-nm. In one
embodiment, the mean size of the nano-dispersion particle is less than about 45-nm.      It
should be understood that ranges having any one of these values as the upper or lower
limits are also intended to be part of this invention, e.g. between about 40-nm and 49
nm, between about 25-nm and 48-nm, or between 25-nm and 47-nm.
[00162]         In certain other embodiments, through several passes through the
Microfluidizer, the mean particle size is reduced to between 10-nm and 200-nm. In one
embodiment, the mean particle size is reduced to between 10-nm and 150-nm. In one
embodiment, the mean particle size is reduced to between 10-nm and 125-nm. In other
                                              33

embodiments the mean particle size is reduced to between 10-nm and 100-nm.              In
certain other embodiments the mean particle size is reduced to between 10-nm and 90
nm, between 10-nm and 80-nm, between 10-nm and 70-nm, between 10-nm and 60-nm,
between 10-nm and 50-nm, between 10-nm and 45-nm, between 10-nm and 40-nm, or
between 10-nm and 30-nm. In certain preferred embodiments the mena particle size is
reduced to between 20-nm and 80-nm. In one embodiment, the mean particle size is
reduced to between 20-nm and 70-nm. In one embodiment, the mena particle size is
reduced to between 20-nm and 60-nm. In one embodiment, the mean particle size is
reduced to between 20-nm and 50-nm. In one embodiment, the mean particle size is
reduced to between 25-nm and 45-nm. In one embodiment, the mean particle size is
reduced to between 30-nm and 45-nm. In certain other preferred embodiments the mean
particle size is reduced to between 35-nm and 40-nm. It should be understood that
additional ranges having any one of the foregoing values as the upper or lower limits are
also intended to be part of this invention, e.g., between 30-nm and 80-nm, or between
30-nm and 40-nm.
[00163]         It may be preferable to have the colloidal dispersion in the form of a
suspension or, alternatively, in the form of an emulsion. As defined elsewhere herein, a
suspension, or nanosuspension, comprises a continuous phase and dispersed solids while
an emulsion includes a dispersed immiscible liquid.       In certain aspects the emulsion
includes a dispersed hydrophobic agent that has been melted and dispersed in a
continuous phase to form nano-particles. Where the hydrophobic active agent is CoQ10,
the melted and dispersed particles may be further dispersed and the size of the particles
reduced further by subsequent passes through the homogenization process. As with the
solid particles, the smaller the particles of the melted hydrophobic active agent the
higher the interfacial energy. A stabilizing agent, such as DMPC, is used to stabilize the
dispersed particles by forming a surface layer around the dispersed particles thereby
creating nano-dispersed CoQ1O particles.      The particles formed are less than 200 nm.
The suspension includes particles of the bulk hydrophobic active agent that are dispersed
by high energy homogenization.          In the suspension are nano-dispersions of the
hydrophobic active agent, such as CoQ10. The nano-dispersion of CoQ10, for example,
includes dispersed particles of the bulk CoQ1O that are surrounded by a stabilizing
agent, such as DMPC. The stabilizing agent forms a surface layer around the dispersed
bulk hydrophobic agent and the dispersed particle of the CoQ1O forms the core of the
nano-dispersed particles. In some embodiments the nano-dispersed particles are in an
amorphous state. In certain other embodiments, the particles are lyophilized and the
CoQ10 core of the nano-dispersion particles of CoQ10 is crystallized.

[00164]         The formulations described herein may be administered to a subject in an
effective amount. An effective amount is an amount which is capable of producing a
desirable result in a treated subject or cell. As is well known in the medical and
veterinary arts, dosage of any one animal depends on may factors, including the
particular animal's size, body type, age, the particular composition to be administered,
time and route of administration, general health, and the effects of pre-, co- or post
administered drugs.        It is expected that an appropriate        dosage for parenteral
administration of the formulation would be from about 10 to about 500 mg of CoQ10 for
subjects ranging from about 110 to about 300-lbs. An effective amount for use with a
cell culture will also vary, but can be readily determined empirically (i.e., by adding
varying concentrations to the cell and selecting the concentration that best produces the
desired result). It is expected that an appropriate concentration would be from about 1 to
about 250-kM.
IV.     Methods of Preparing the Formulation
[00165]         CoQ10 is a solid and primarily crystalline substance at room temperature
in the bulk phase (i.e., bulk material). The solid bulk material which is used as a starting
material for preparing colloidal particles according to the present invention can be non
particulate, or particulate, e.g., a powder, precipitate, agglomerates, crystals or any other
solid raw material commonly used.
[00166]         In preparing the formulations of the present invention, poorly water
soluble hydrophobic active agent, such as bulk phase CoQ10 or a mixture of poorly
water-soluble substances, are heated in a bath above the melting point of the
hydrophobic active agent. For example, the melting point of CoQ10 is approximately
480 C. It is herein contemplated that the melting point may vary and may, for example
include any value ranging from 47.5 0 C to 49.5 0 C. The bath, consisting of water is at
650 C. CoQ10 in bulk form at room temperature is added to the 65 0 C water and mixed to
form a CoQ1O/water mixture.          In certain embodiments, the CoQ1O/water mixture is
mixed for 45 minutes.       In certain other embodiments it is mixed for 20-30 minutes.
Powder DMPC is then added to the CoQ10/water mixture (M1) and mixed to form a
CoQ10/water/stabilizer mixture.        In certain embodiments the CoQ10/water/stabilizer
mixture (M2) is mixed for between 25 and 45 minutes at 650 C.               In certain other
embodiments, the CoQ10/water/stabilizer mixture is mixed for 30 minutes at 650 C. An
opsonization reducer is then added to form a CoQ10/water/stabilizer/reducer mixture.
The      Microfluidizer       chamber       is    pre-heated    to     60-65 0 C.        The
                                               35

CoQ1O/water/stabilizer/reducer (M3) is then processed in the Microfluidizer in repeated
passes to reduce the particle size below 200-nm.
[00167]         Suitable Microfluidizers include the M110P and is available through
Microfluidics, Inc. (MFI). The MilOP has a 75-pm passages and a F12Y interaction
chamber. In processing M3, the Microfluidizer has an inlet pressure of 30,000 psi.
[00168]         After 20 passes in the Microfluidizer, the particle size was reduced to
between 30-nm and 80-nm or preferably between 30-nm and 75-nm.
[00169]         Colloidal dispersions of CoQ1O were prepared by emulsification of the
molten CoQ1O stock material in water employing various types and amounts of
stabilizing agents and opsonization reducers. Emulsification was accomplished by probe
sonication and/or high pressure homogenization.         Preferably, the emulsification is
accomplished by high pressure homogenization. High pressure homogenization systems
display a smaller mean particle size and a more narrow particle size distribution. The
mean particle diameter of the colloidal dispersions of CoQ1O can be varied within a
considerable range by varying the process parameters            such as homogenization
equipment,    homogenization     parameters  (time, cycles,    pressures,  etc.) and the
composition of the dispersions (type and amount of stabilizer and opsonization reducer,
phase ratio, etc.). Siekmann and Westesen describes sub-micron sized formulations of
CoQ1O made by emulsification wherein the colloidal particles are in an amorphous state
(Siekmann, B., and K. Westesen. "Preparation and physicochemical characterization of
aqueous dispersions of coenzyme Q1O nanoparticles." Pharmaceutical Research 12, no.
2 (1995): 201-208.) which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[00170]         The present invention provides colloidal dispersions of hydrophobic
active agents, such as CoQ1O, prepared by methods unlike those disclosed by Siekmann
and Westesen.       The present invention provides methods wherein the CoQ1O is
emulsified to produce colloidal particles of CoQ1O.         While the particles in some
embodiments are in an amorphous state, in other embodiments, the particles are
lyophilized such that the colloidal CoQ1O particles are in a crystalline form. In certain
embodiments of the present invention, a lyoprotectant is used to stabilize the particle
size upon lyophilization.   Further notable distinctions in the present invention include
the inactive agents employed in the homogenization of the colloidal particles of the
present invention. The presently disclosed methods include at least one of a stabilizing
agent and an opsonization reducer as described further herein.
[00171]         The present invention further includes novel ratios for the hydrophobic
agent, the stabilizing agent and the opsonization reducer. The homogenization process
                                            36

for CoQ10 produces an amorphous CoQ10 colloidal dispersions which include
poloxamer (as an opsonization reducer) and DMPC (as a dispersion stabilizing agent) in
ratios that produce colloidal CoQ10 particles having sizes below 200-nm and preferably
about 40-nm. Suitable DMPC can be purchased from Genzyme Corporation, Lipoid,
Avanti, or NOF while suitable poloxamer 188 may be purchased from Spectrum
Corporation or BASF Corporation.
[00172]         In preparing the colloidal dispersion, the weight-per-volume of CoQ10,
DMPC and poloxamer 188 were selected as 4%, 3% and 1.5%, respectively (i.e., the
4:3:1.5 ratio). In certain other suitable embodiments, the weight-per-volume of CoQ10,
DMPC and poloxamer were 8%, 6% and 3%, respectively (i.e. the 8:6:3 ratio).              In
certain embodiments, the concentration of CoQ10 is between 30 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL.
In certain other embodiments, the concentration of CoQ10 is about 40 mg/mL for the
4:3:1.5 ratio, about 80 mg/mL for the 8:6:3 ratio and about 60 mg/mL for the 6:3:1 ratio.
[00173]         The colloidal dispersions of CoQ10 are stable at room temperature over
several weeks.      Over two to three weeks, the particles size remained unchanged as
shown in Table 1 and Table 2. A comparison of the columns labeled "Filtered" and
"Repeat" indicates that up to two weeks storage of filtered suspension did not
significantly affect the particle size.       Table 1 further demonstrates that increase in
DMPC/CoQ1O ratio and addition of poloxamer 188 results in decreased particle size. A
CoQ1O/DMPC/P188 4:3:0 formulation was stored in a stability chamber at 25C and
60% humidity.    Zavg    (particle size) was assessed over time.

[00186]         As used herein, "oncological disorder" refers to all types of cancer or
neoplasm or malignant tumors found in humans, including, but not limited to:
leukemias, lymphomas, melanomas, carcinomas and sarcomas. As used herein, the
terms or language "oncological disorder", "cancer," "neoplasm," and "tumor," are used
interchangeably and in either the singular or plural form, refer to cells that have
undergone a malignant transformation that makes them pathological to the host
organism. Primary cancer cells (that is, cells obtained from near the site of malignant
transformation) can be readily distinguished from non-cancerous cells by well
established techniques, particularly histological examination. The definition of a cancer
cell, as used herein, includes not only a primary cancer cell, but also cancer stem cells,
as well as cancer progenitor cells or any cell derived from a cancer cell ancestor. This
includes metastasized cancer cells, and in vitro cultures and cell lines derived from
cancer cells. When referring to a type of cancer that normally manifests as a solid
tumor, a "clinically detectable" tumor is one that is detectable on the basis of tumor
mass; e.g., by procedures such as CAT scan, MR imaging, X-ray, ultrasound or
palpation, and/or which is detectable because of the expression of one or more cancer
specific antigens in a sample obtainable from a patient.

[00190]         Where   utilized to   treat cancer, the    formulations   may    be in   a

[00191]         The present disclosure also provides methods for modulating proteins

                                            44

restore a healthy apoptosis state in cancer cells.         Mitochondrial dysfunction and
dysregulation of apoptosis are implicated in many diseases such as cancer and
neurodegeneration. Respiratory chain (RC) dysfunction may have a role in apoptosis, as
demonstrated using mitochondrial DNA mutations as genetic models. Although some
mutations eliminate the entire RC, others target specific complexes, resulting in either
decreased or complete loss of electron flux, which leads to impaired respiration and
adenosine triphosphate     (ATP) synthesis.        Despite these similarities,   significant
differences in responses to apoptotic stimuli emerge. Cells lacking RC are protected
against both mitochondrial- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis.
Cells with RC, but unable to generate electron flux, are protected against mitochondrial
apoptosis, although they have increased sensitivity to ER stress.     Finally, cells with a
partial reduction in electron flux have increased apoptosis under both conditions. RC
modulates apoptosis in a context-dependent manner independent of ATP production and
that apoptotic responses are the result of the interplay between mitochondrial functional
state and environmental cues.
[00192]         The execution of apoptosis and communication between oncogenic
factors may also be mediated by released factors such as cytochrome C, Endo G, or AIF
through mitochondrial membrane pores which open upon membrane depolarization.
Cancer cells also generate excessive lactate in the presence of oxygen (aerobic
glycolysis). It now appears that this phenomenon is the product of two factors: a return
to the more glycolytic metabolism of the embryo and alterations in oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production. Alterations in the Ras-PJ3K-Akt signal transduction pathway can result in
induction of hexokinase II and its attachment to mitochondrial porin redirecting
mitochondrial ATP to phosphorylate glucose and drive glycolysis. Furthermore, partial
inhibition of OXPHOS by mitochondrial gene mutations (germ-line or somatic) can
reduce electron flux through the electron transport chain, increasing mitochondrial ROS
production. The increased ROS mutagenizes nuclear proto-oncogenes (initiation) and
drives nuclear replication (promotion), resulting in cancer. Therefore, hexokinase II and
mitochondrial ROS may be useful alternate targets for cancer therapeutics. Metabolic
flux as it relates to cancer is compromised in an oncogenic state and shifts towards a
glycolytic state. A cancer cell's survival is vitally dependent on glucose metabolism and
low oxygen levels.      More perplexing is that mitochondrial activity is significantly
attenuated to the point of dormancy. Oxidative phosphorylation usually associated with
Complex 1 -IV that accepts electrons from the Citric Acid Cycle (TCA) is essentially
shut down.     There is a marked increase in the amount of free radicals and lactate
dehydrogenase activity. Hence, the cancer cell is in a state of: (1) Decreased oxygen
                                             45

(Hypoxia); (2) Increase free- radical formation; (3) Dysregulated apoptosis (cell death);
(4) Dependence of glucose metabolism; (5) Increased blood vessel formation; and (6)
Altered immune recognition (auto-regulatory state commences).

liver cancer, or bone cancer. In one embodiment, CoQ1O is used for treatment of a skin
oncological disorder including, but not limited to, squamous cell carcinomas (including
SCCIS (in situ) and more aggressive squamous cell carcinomas), basal cell carcinomas
(including superficial, nodular and infiltrating basal cell carcinomas), melanomas, and
actinic keratosis.    In one embodiment, the oncological disorder or cancer which can be
treated with CoQ1O is not melanoma. In one embodiment, the oncological disorder is
merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).
[00195]          In certain embodiments, the effect CoQ1O may have on cancer cells may
depend, in part, on the various states of metabolic and oxidative flux exhibited by the
                                                46

cancer cells. CoQ1O may be utilized to interrupt and/or interfere with the conversion of
an oncogenic cell's dependency of glycolysis and increased lactate utility. As it relates
to a cancer state, this interference with the glycolytic and oxidative flux of the tumor
microenvironment may influence apoptosis and angiogenesis in a manner which reduces
the development of a cancer cell. In some embodiments, the interaction of CoQ1O with
glycolytic and oxidative flux factors may enhance the ability of CoQ1O to exert its
restorative apoptotic effect in cancer while establishing viable drug targets for drug
discovery and development. While the present disclosure has focused on CoQ1O and its
metabolites, other compounds related to CoQ1O which may be administered instead of,
or in combination with, CoQ1O include, but are not limited to, benzoquinones,
isoprenoids, farnesols, famesyl acetate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, 1-phenylalanine, d
phenylalanine, dl-phenylalanine, 1-tyrosine, d- tyrosine, dl-tyrosine, 4-hydroxy
phenylpyruvate, 4-hydroxy-phenyllactate, 4-hydroxy- cinnamate, dipeptides and
tripeptides of tyrosine or phenylalanine, 3,4-dihydroxymandelate, 3- methoxy-4
hydroxyphenylglycol, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelate, vanillic acid, phenylacetate,
pyridoxine, S-adenosyl methionine, panthenol, mevalonic acid, isopentyl pyrophosphate,
phenylbutyrate, 4-hydroxy-benzoate,decaprenyl pyrophosphate, beta-hydroxybutyrate,
3- hydroxy-3-methyl-glutarate, acetylcamitine, acetoacetylcamitine, acetylglycine,
acetoacetylglycine,      carnitine,    acetic     acid,    pyruvic     acid,     3-hydroxy-3
methylglutarylcarnitine, all isomeric forms of serine, alanine, cysteine, glycine,
threonine, hydroxyproline, lysine, isoleucine, and leucine, even carbon number C4 to C8
fatty acids (butyric, caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, and stearic acids)
salts of camitine and glycine, e.g., palmitoylcarnitine and palmitoylglycine, and 4
hydroxy-benzoate polyprenyltransferase, any salts of these compounds, as well as any
combinations thereof, and the like.
[00196]         In one embodiment, IV administration of the colloidal dispersion of
CoQ1O as described herein, reduces tumor size, inhibits tumor growth and/or prolongs
the survival time of a tumor-bearing subject. Accordingly, this invention also relates to
a method of treating tumors in a human or other animal by intravenously administering
to such human or animal an effective, non-toxic amount of CoQ1O. One skilled in the
art would be able, by routine experimentation, to determine what an effective, non-toxic
amount of CoQ1O would be for the purpose of treating malignancies. For example, a
therapeutically active amount of CoQ1O may vary according to factors such as the
disease stage (e.g., stage I versus stage IV), age, sex, medical complications (e.g.,
immunosuppressed conditions or diseases) and weight of the subject, and the ability of
the CoQ1O to elicit a desired response in the subject. The dosage regimen may be
adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided
                                              47

doses may be administered daily, or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated
by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.
[00197]         The invention also provides, in another aspect, methods for treating or
preventing aggressive oncological disorders in humans.          These methods include
intravenously administering Coenzyme Q1O to the human at a therapeutically effective
dose, so that treatment or prevention of the aggressive oncological disorder occurs. In
one embodiment, these methods include intravenously administering Coenzyme Q1O to
the human at a selected lower dosage than a dosage regimen used or selected for less
aggressive or non-aggressive oncological disorder, so that treatment or prevention of the
aggressive oncological disorder occurs.         In certain embodiments the aggressive
oncological disorder includes pancreatic carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing's
sarcoma, metastatic breast cancer, metastatic melanoma, brain cancer (astrocytoma,
glioblastoma),    neuroendocrine   cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer,      lung cancer,
osteosarcoma, androgen-independent prostate cancer, ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin's
Lymphoma.
[00198]         In a related aspect, the invention provides a method for treating or
preventing a non-aggressive oncological disorder in a human. These methods include
intravenously administering Coenzyme Q1O to the human at a therapeutically effective
dose, so that treatment or prevention of the non-aggressive oncological disorder occurs.
In one embodiment, these methods include administering Coenzyme Q1O to the human
at a selected higher dosage over a dosage regimen used or selected for aggressive
oncological disorders so that treatment or prevention of the non-aggressive oncological
disorder occurs.     In certain embodiments, the non-aggressive oncological disorder
includes non-metastatic breast cancer, androgen-dependent prostate cancer, small cell
lung cancer and acute lymphocytic leukemia.
[00199]         In some embodiments of the invention, the treatment or prevention of the
oncological disorder occurs via an interaction of CoQ1O with a protein selected from the
group consisting of HNF4-alpha, Bcl-xl, Bcl-xS, BNIP-2, Bcl-2, Birc6, Bcl-2-L1 1
(Bim), XIAP, BRAF, Bax, c-Jun, Bmf, PUMA, cMyc, transaldolase 1, COQI, COQ3,
COQ6, prenyltransferase, 4-hydrobenzoate, neutrophil cytosolic factor 2, nitric oxide
synthase 2A, superoxide dismutase 2, VDAC, Bax channel, ANT, Cytochrome c,
complex 1, complex II, complex III, complex IV, Foxo 3a, DJ-1, IDH-1, CptlC and
Cam Kinase II.      In some embodiments the oncological disorder is selected from the
group consisting of leukemia, a lymphoma, a melanoma, a carcinoma or a sarcoma.
                                             48

[00200]         In certain embodiments of the invention, the oncological disorder is
selected from the group consisting of a leukemia, a lymphoma, a melanoma, a
carcinoma and a sarcoma.
[00201]         In certain embodiments of the invention, the methods further include a
treatment regimen which includes any one of or a combination of surgery, radiation,
hormone therapy, antibody therapy, therapy with growth factors, cytokines, and
chemotherapy.
[00202]         The resulting CoQ1O nanoparticles can also serve as a carrier systems for
other lipophilic drugs. Vitamins A and K3 can be incorporated therein, for example.
VI.     Combination Therapies
[00203]         In certain embodiments, the formulations of the invention, e.g., the
CoQ1O I.V. formulations, can be used in combination therapy with at least one other
therapeutic agent. CoQ10 and/or pharmaceutical formulations thereof and the other
therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically.            In one
embodiment, CoQ10 and/or a formulation thereof is administered concurrently with the
administration of another therapeutic agent. In another embodiment, a compound and/or
pharmaceutical       formulation   thereof    is administered    prior   or   subsequent   to
administration of another therapeutic agent.        In one embodiment, the CoQ1O and
additional therapeutic agent active synergistically. In one embodiment, the CoQ1O and
additional therapeutic agent act additively.
[00204]         In one embodiment, the therapeutic methods of the invention further
comprise administration of one or more additional agents, e.g., one or more therapeutic
agents. For example, in one embodiment, an additional agent for use in the therapeutic
methods of the invention is a chemotherapeutic agent.
[00205]         Chemotherapeutic agents generally belong to various classes including,
for example: 1.       Topoisomerase II inhibitors (cytotoxic antibiotics), such as the
anthracyclines/anthracenediones,      e.g.,   doxorubicin,   epirubicin,    idarubicin   and
nemorubicin,    the   anthraquinones,   e.g., mitoxantrone    and losoxantrone,     and the
podophillotoxines, e.g., etoposide and teniposide; 2.       Agents that affect microtubule
formation (mitotic inhibitors), such as plant alkaloids (e.g., a compound belonging to a
family of alkaline, nitrogen-containing molecules          derived from plants that are
biologically active and cytotoxic), e.g., taxanes, e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxel, and the
                                              49

vinka alkaloids, e.g., vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine, and derivatives of
podophyllotoxin; 3.        Alkylating agents, such as nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimine
compounds, alkyl sulphonates and other compounds with an alkylating action such as
nitrosoureas,     dacarbazine,     cyclophosphamide,       ifosfamide     and    melphalan;    4.
Antimetabolites      (nucleoside    inhibitors),   for  example,    folates,  e.g., folic   acid,
fiuropyrimidines, purine or pyrimidine analogues such as 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine,
gemcitabine, methotrexate and edatrexate; 5.             Topoisomerase I inhibitors, such as
topotecan, irinotecan, and 9- nitrocamptothecin, and camptothecin derivatives; and 6.

                                                 50

[00206]          In another embodiment, an additional agent for use in the combination
therapies of the invention is a biologic agent.
[00207]          Biological agents (also called biologies) are the products of a biological
system, e.g., an organism, cell, or recombinant system.         Examples of such biologic
agents include nucleic       acid molecules    (e.g., antisense nucleic    acid molecules),
interferons,   interleukins,  colony-stimulating    factors,  antibodies, e.g., monoclonal
antibodies, anti-angiogenesis agents, and cytokines.         Exemplary biologic agents are
discussed in more detail below and generally belong to various classes including, for
example: 1. Hormones, hormonal analogues, and hormonal complexes, e.g., estrogens
and estrogen analogs, progesterone, progesterone analogs and progestins, androgens,
adrenocorticosteroids, antiestrogens, antiandrogens, antitestosterones, adrenal steroid
inhibitors, and anti-leuteinizing hormones; and 2.            Enzymes, proteins, peptides,
polyclonal and/or monoclonal antibodies, such as interleukins, interferons, colony
stimulating factor, etc.
[00208]          In one embodiment, the biologic is an interfereon. Interferons (IFN) are a
type biologic agent that naturally occurs in the body. Interferons are also produced in
the laboratory and given to cancer patients in biological therapy. They have been shown
to improve the way a cancer patient's immune system acts against cancer cells.
[00209]          Interferons may work directly on cancer cells to slow their growth, or
they may cause cancer cells to change into cells with more normal behavior.           Some
interferons may also stimulate natural killer cells (NK) cells, T cells, and macrophages
which are types of white blood cells in the bloodstream that help to fight cancer cells.
[00210]          In one embodiment, the biologic is an interleukin. Interleukins (IL)
stimulate the growth and activity of many immune cells. They are proteins (cytokines
and chemokines) that occur naturally in the body, but can also be made in the laboratory.
[00211]          Some interleukins stimulate the growth and activity of immune cells,
such as lymphocytes, which work to destroy cancer cells.
[00212]          In another embodiment, the biologic is a colony-stimulating factor.
[00213]          Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are proteins given to patients to
encourage stem cells within the bone marrow to produce more blood cells. The body
constantly needs new white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, especially when
cancer is present. CSFs are given, along with chemotherapy, to help boost the immune
system.    When cancer patients receive chemotherapy, the bone marrow's ability to
                                             51

produce new blood cells is suppressed, making patients more prone to developing
infections.     Parts of the immune system cannot function without blood cells, thus
colony-stimulating factors encourage the bone marrow stem cells to produce white blood
cells, platelets, and red blood cells.
[00214]           With proper cell production, other cancer treatments can continue
enabling patients to safely receive higher doses of chemotherapy.
[00215]           In another embodiment, the biologic is an antibody.      Antibodies, e.g.,
monoclonal antibodies, are agents, produced in the laboratory, that bind to cancer cells.
[00216]           When cancer-destroying agents are introduced into the body, they seek
out the antibodies and kill the cancer cells. Monoclonal antibody agents do not destroy
healthy cells.     Monoclonal antibodies achieve their therapeutic effect through various
mechanisms. They can have direct effects in producing apoptosis or programmed cell
death.    They can block growth factor receptors, effectively arresting proliferation of
tumor cells.     In cells that express monoclonal antibodies, they can bring about anti
idiotype antibody formation.
[00217]           Examples of antibodies which may be used in the combination treatment
of the invention include anti-CD20 antibodies, such as, but not limited to, cetuximab,
Tositumomab, rituximab, and Ibritumomab. Anti-HER2 antibodies may also be used in
combination with an environmental influencer for the treatment of cancer.           In one
embodiment, the anti-HER2 antibody is Trastuzumab (Herceptin).          Other examples of
antibodies which may be used in combination with an environmental influencer for the
treatment of cancer include anti-CD52 antibodies (e.g., Alemtuzumab), anti-CD-22
antibodies     (e.g.,  Epratuzumab),   and   anti-CD33    antibodies  (e.g.,  Gemtuzumab
ozogamicin).       Anti-VEGF antibodies may also be used in combination with an
environmental influencer for the treatment of cancer.        In one embodiment, the anti
VEGF antibody is bevacizumab.           In other embodiments, the biologic agent is an
antibody which is an anti-EGFR antibody e.g., cetuximab. Another example is the anti
glycoprotein 17-lA antibody edrecolomab.        Numerous other anti-tumor antibodies are
known in the art and would be understood by the skilled artisan to be encompassed by
the present invention.
[00218]           In another embodiment, the biologic is a cytokine. Cytokine therapy uses
proteins (cytokines) to help a subject's immune system recognize and destroy those cells
that are cancerous. Cytokines are produced naturally in the body by the immune system,
but can also be produced in the laboratory. This therapy is used with advanced
melanoma and with adjuvant therapy (therapy given after or in addition to the primary
                                             52

cancer treatment). Cytokine therapy reaches all parts of the body to kill cancer cells and
prevent tumors from growing.
[00219]        In another embodiment, the biologic is a fusion protein.      For example,
recombinant human Apo2L/TRAIL (Genentech) may be used in a combination therapy.
Apo2/TRAIL is the first dual pro-apoptotic receptor agonist designed to activate both
pro-apoptotic receptors DR4 and DR5, which are involved in the regulation of apoptosis
(programmed cell death).
[00220]        In one embodiment, the biologic is an antisense nucleic acid molecule.
[00221]        As used herein, an "antisense" nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide
sequence which is complementary to a "sense" nucleic acid encoding a protein, e.g.,
complementary to the coding strand of a double-stranded cDNA molecule,
complementary to an mRNA sequence or complementary to the coding strand of a gene.
Accordingly, an antisense nucleic acid can hydrogen bond to a sense nucleic acid.
[00222]        In one embodiment, a biologic agent is an siRNA molecule, e.g., of a
molecule that enhances      angiogenesis, e.g., bFGF, VEGF and EGFR.              In one
embodiment, a biologic agent that inhibits angiogenesis mediates RNAi.               RNA
interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional, targeted gene-silencing technique that uses
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to degrade messenger RNA (mRNA) containing the
same sequence as the dsRNA (Sharp, P.A. and Zamore, P.D. 287, 2431-2432 (2000);
Zamore, P.D., et al. Cell 101, 25-33 (2000). Tuschl, T. et al. Genes Dev. 13, 3191-3197
(1999); Cottrell TR, and Doering TL. 2003. Trends Microbiol. 11:37-43; Bushman
F.2003. MoI Therapy. 7:9-10; McManus MT and Sharp PA. 2002.               Nat Rev Genet.
3.737-47).   The process occurs when an endogenous ribonuclease cleaves the longer
dsRNA into shorter, e.g., 21- or 22-nucleotide-long RNAs, termed small interfering
RNAs or siRNAs.      The smaller RNA segments then mediate the degradation of the
target mRNA. Kits for synthesis of RNAi are commercially available from, e.g. New
England Biolabs or Ambion.      In one embodiment one or more chemistries for use in
antisense RNA can be employed in molecules that mediate RNAi.
[00223]        The use of antisense nucleic acids to downregulate the expression of a
particular protein in a cell is well known in the art (see e.g., Weintraub, H. et al.,
Antisense RNA as a molecular tool for genetic analysis, Reviews - Trends in Genetics,
Vol. 1(1) 1986; Askari, F.K. and McDonnell, W.M. (1996) N. Eng. J. Med. 334:316
318; Bennett, M.R. and Schwartz, S.M. (1995) Circulation 92:1981-1993; Mercola, D.
and Cohen, J.S. (1995) Cancer Gene Ther. 2:47-59; Rossi, JJ. (1995) Br. Med. Bull.
51.217-225; Wagner, R.W. (1994) Nature 372:333-335).           An antisense nucleic acid
                                            53

molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to the coding strand of
 another nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an mRNA sequence) and accordingly is capable of
hydrogen bonding to the coding strand of the other nucleic acid molecule. Antisense
 sequences complementary to a sequence of an mRNA can be complementary to a
 sequence found in the coding region of the mRNA, the 5' or 3' untranslated region of the
mRNA or a region bridging the coding region and an untranslated region (e.g., at the
junction of the 5' untranslated region and the coding region). Furthermore, an antisense
nucleic acid can be complementary in sequence to a regulatory region of the gene
encoding the mRNA, for instance a transcription initiation sequence or regulatory
element. Preferably, an antisense nucleic acid is designed so as to be complementary to a
region preceding or spanning the initiation codon on the coding strand or in the 3'
untranslated region of an mRNA.
 [00224]        Given the coding strand sequences of a molecule that enhances
 angiogenesis, antisense nucleic acids of the invention can be designed according to the
rules of Watson and Crick base pairing. The antisense nucleic acid molecule can be
complementary to the entire coding region of the mRNA, but more preferably is an
 oligonucleotide which is antisense to only a portion of the coding or noncoding region of
the mRNA. For example, the antisense oligonucleotide can be complementary to the
region surrounding the translation start site of the mRNA. An antisense oligonucleotide
can be, for example, about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 nucleotides in length.
 [00225]        An antisense nucleic acid of the invention can be constructed using
chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art.
For example, an antisense nucleic acid (e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide) can be
chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified
nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase
the physical stability of the duplex formed between the antisense and sense nucleic
 acids, e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides can be
used. Examples of modified nucleotides which can be used to generate the antisense
nucleic   acid include 5-     fluorouracil,   5-bromouracil,     5-chlorouracil,  5-iodouracil,
hypoxanthine,     xantine,  4-   acetylcytosine,    5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl)       uracil, 5

methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5- methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5
methylaminomethyluracil,          5-       methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil,            beta-D

2-thiouracil, 3-(3-amino-3-N-2- carboxypropyl) uracil, (acp3)w, and 2,6-diaminopurine.
To inhibit expression in cells, one or more antisense oligonucleotides can be used.
Alternatively, the antisense nucleic acid can be produced biologically using an
expression vector into which a nucleic acid has been subcloned in an antisense
orientation (i.e., RNA transcribed from the inserted nucleic acid will be of an antisense
orientation to a target nucleic acid of interest, described further in the following
subsection).
[00226]          In yet another embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid molecule of the
invention is an a-anomeric nucleic acid molecule. An a-anomeric nucleic acid molecule
forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to
the usual a-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gaultier et al. (1987) Nucleic
Acids. Res. 15:6625-6641). The antisense nucleic acid molecule can also comprise a 2'
o-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al. (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15:6131- 6148) or a
chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue et al. (1987) FEBS Lett. 215:327-330).
[00227]          In another embodiment, an antisense nucleic acid of the invention is a
compound that mediates RNAi. RNA interfering agents include, but are not limited to,
nucleic acid molecules including RNA molecules which are homologous to the target
gene or genomic sequence, "short interfering RNA" (siRNA), "short hairpin" or "small
hairpin RNA" (shRNA), and small molecules which interfere with or inhibit expression
of a target gene by RNA interference (RNAi).               RNA interference is a post
transcriptional,   targeted gene-silencing technique that uses double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) to degrade messenger RNA (mRNA) containing the same sequence as the
dsRNA (Sharp, P.A. and Zamore, P.D. 287, 2431-2432 (2000); Zamore, P.D., et al. Cell
 101, 25-33 (2000). Tuschl, T. et al. Genes Dev. 13, 3191-3197 (1999)).         The process
occurs when an endogenous ribonuclease cleaves the longer dsRNA into shorter, 21- or
22-nucleotide-long RNAs, termed small interfering RNAs or siRNAs. The smaller RNA
segments then mediate the degradation of the target mRNA. Kits for synthesis of RNAi
are commercially available from, e.g. New England Biolabs and Ambion. In one
embodiment one or more of the chemistries described above for use in antisense RNA
can be employed.
[00228]          Nucleic   acid    molecules   encoding   molecules     that,  e.g.,  inhibit
angiogenesis, may be introduced into the subject in a form suitable for expression of the
encoded protein in the cells of the subject may also be used in the methods of the
invention. Exemplary molecules that inhibit angiogenesis include, but are not limited to,
                                             55

TSP-I, TSP-2, IFN-g, IFN-a, angiostatin, endostatin, tumastatin, canstatin, VEGI, PEDF,
vasohibin, and the 16 kDa fragment of prolactin 2-Methoxyestradiol (see, Kerbel (2004)
J. Clin Invest 114:884, for review).
[00229]         For example, a full length or partial cDNA sequence is cloned into a
recombinant expression vector and the vector is transfected into a cell using standard
molecular biology techniques.         The cDNA can be obtained, for example, by
amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by screening an appropriate
cDNA library. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA can be used for the design of
PCR primers that allow for amplification of a cDNA by standard PCR methods or for
the design of a hybridization probe that can be used to screen a cDNA library using
standard hybridization methods. Following isolation or amplification of the cDNA, the
DNA fragment is introduced into a suitable expression vector.

[00231]         It should be noted that more than one additional agent, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
may be administered in combination with the CoQ1O formulations of the inventin. For

agent, and CoQ10 may be administered.

[00244]         Example 10 - Formulation CoQJO/DMPC/P188 (4:2:1.5 - SOP4.4): (a)

[00245]         As can be seen from Fig. 17, the processing of formulation 4:3:0
SOP4.1 mixture results in particle sizes of about 50-nm after 18 passes; formulation
4:2:0 - SOP4.2 led to particle sizes of about 60-nm after 18 passes; formulation 4:1:0
SOP4.4 led to particle sizes of about 80-nm after 18 passes.
[00246]         The addition of poloxamer 188 (P188) to the mixture, as depicted in Fig.
 18 shows that formulation 4:1:1 - SOP4.4 results in particle sizes of about 80-nm after
 12 passes; formulation 4:2:1 - SOP4.4 results in particle sizes of about 50-nm after 12
passes; and 4:3:1 - SOP4.4 results in particle sizes of about 40-nm after 12 passes. The
DMPC/CoQ1O and DMPC/P188 ratios are therefore critical factors in determining the
particle sizes. While not wishing to be bound by any specific theory, it is believed that
the P188 softens the DMPC layer and facilitates initial formation of the smaller size
particles.
[00247]         In certain embodiments, the CoQ1O/DMPC ratios of 4:3 and 4:2 were
adjusted with varying amounts of P188. As depicted in Fig. 19, there was no significant
                                            59

effect of P188 concentration on the final particle size when the CoQ10/DMPC ration
was 4:3.
[00248]         Similarly, varying the P188 concentration for CoQ10/DMPC 4:2 ration
had insignificant effects on the particle size as is seen in Fig. 20.
[00249]         The following examples provide exemplary embodiments demonstrating
the uses and methods related to the administration of the CoQ10 IV formulation of the
colloidal dispersions of CoQ10 provided herein.
[00250]         Example 11 - Determination of pK of Coenzyme Q10: 39 female
SCID.CB 17 mice, 4-6 weeks old, were acclimated for 3-5 days prior to study dosing.
The 39 mice were placed into 13 groups of 3 each by average body weight taken prior to
dosing day. On day 0, groups 1-6 were administered a single dose of the formulation as
described herein without poloxamer (formulation 1). Groups 1-6 were administered 100
mg/kg by IV injection of formulation 1 and plasma and tissue (spleen, liver, pancreas,
lungs and brain) samples were taken at 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h and 36h post dosing. On
day 0, groups 7-12 were administered a single dose of the CoQ10 formulation as
described herein with poloxamer (formulation 2). Groups 7-12 were administered 100
mg/kg by IV injection of formulation 2 and plasma and tissue (spleen, liver, pancreas,
lungs and brain) samples were recovered at 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h and 36h post dosing.
Group 13 received no treatment.
[00251]         A biological assay was conducted to quantify the levels of CoQ10 in the
mouse plasma, liver, lung, spleen, pancreas and brain tissues by using LC/MS/MS. The
CoQ10 was quantified at the range of 1-600 pg/mL for mouse plasma and at the range of
0.25-100 pg/mL for mouse tissues up to 36 hours following IV administration. Figures
22 and 23 provide the concentration profile of the CoQ10 formulation 1 in the plasma.
Figures 24 and 25 provide the concentration profile of the CoQ10 formulation 2 in the
plasma. Figures 26 and 27 provide the liver concentration for formulations 1 and 2,
respectively. Figures 28 and 29 provide the lung concentration for formulation 1 and 2,
respectively. Figures 30 and 31 provide the spleen concentration for formulation 1 and
2, respectively. Figures 32 and 33 provide the pancreas concentration for formulation 1
and 2, respectively. Figures 34 and 35 provide the brain concentration for formulation 1
and 2, respectively.

[00252]          The results of this study demonstrate a greater accumulation of
Coenzyme Q10 in the liver and spleen for Formulation 1, which does not comprise
poloxamer, as compared to Formulation 2, which comprises poloxamer. These results
indicate a greater clearance of Coenzyme Q10 from the blood by the liver and spleen in
the absence of poloxamer, and less clearance of Coenzyme Q10 from the blood by these
organs in the presence of poloxamer, and are consistent with the role of poloxamer in the
Coenzyme Q10 formulations as an opsonization reducer.
[00253]          Example 12 - Effect of CoQJ0 IV Formulation on Liver Cancer: The
ability of a Coenzyme Q10 formulation of the present invention to inhibit proliferation
of liver tumor cells was examined in an animal model. Twenty-four Fischer 344 rats
were injected intraperitoneally with the liver clone of a malignant chloroma Rats were
then randomized into groups of 6 rats each. Group 1 served as a control, treated with 0.5
mL of phosphate buffered saline on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for three (3) weeks.
Group II received a sterile nanodispersion by IP injection of 20 mg of Coenzyme Q10.
                                                  66

This formulation contained, by weight, 4% Coenzyme Q10, 3% DMPC, and 1.5%
poloxamer 188 in PBS. The formulation was administered by IP injection in a volume
of 0.5 mL on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for three (3) weeks. Group III received
35 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide once. Group IV received 20 mg of the 4:3:1.5 CoQ10
formulation in 0.5 mL on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for three (3) weeks. In
addition, they received 35 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide once.
[00254]         All animals in the control group were dead of liver metastasis by day 20
post-transplant. In the group treated with the sterile 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV nanodispersion
formulation (Group II), 50% of rats survived and remained disease-free. The other 50%
survived 38 days or more. In the group treated with chemotherapy alone (Group III), 1
rat remained disease-free while the other three rats survived up to day 34 and hence. In
the group that received the 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV formulation and the chemotherapy (Group
IV), 5 of 6 rats remained disease free and one survived up to day 38.
[00255]         The 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV formulation demonstrated a better safety profile.
No side effects were observed in the animals receiving CoQ10 as evidenced by weight
gain and behavior. The 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV formulation alone showed more significant
efficacy as a single agent than chemotherapy alone. Moreover, where the 4:3:1.5
CoQ10 IV formulation was used in combination with chemotherapy, the effect on
survival was synergistic, yielding 83% survival. Figure 35 depicts these results.
[00256]         In conclusion, the CoQ10 formulation demonstrated improved safety over
chemotherapy, significant therapeutic activity in treating liver cancer that was more
effective than chemotherapy alone, and demonstrated synergistic therapeutic activity
with chemotherapy in treating liver cancer.
[00257]         Example 13 -- Efficacy of Daily Dosing of CoQJO IV Formulation on
Liver Tumors: A group (n=30/group) of seven-day-old Fischer 344 rats were injected
intraperitoneally with the liver clone of a malignant chloroma. Beginning 6 hours later,
the animals were dosed daily via intraperitoneal injection for 20 days as follows:
untreated, saline control, vehicle control (DMPC and Poloxamer 188 in PBS), or the
4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV formulation at 0.5, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg/day. Mortality was as
follows: 30/30 in the untreated and saline controls (by Day 29); 29/30 at 0.5 mg/kg/day
(by Day 29); 27 or 28/30 at 2 mg/kg/day (by Day 44); 24/30 at 5 mg/kg/day (by Day
55); 21/30 at 10 mg/kg/day (by Day 46); 15/30 at 25 mg/kg/day (by Day 46); and 13/30
at 50 mg/kg/day (by Day 53).       In addition to a dose-related increase in survival, the
4:3:1.5 CoQ1O IV formulation extended the day at which mortality began (i.e.,
approximately Day 15 for the untreated and saline controls as compared to
                                             67

approximately Days 25, 38, 36, 40, and 45 at 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg/dose,
respectively) and decreased the slope of the mortality curve.
[00258]         Example 14 - Effect of CoQJ0 IV Formulation on Lung Tumors: The
ability of a Coenzyme Q10 formulation of the invention to inhibit proliferation of lung
tumor cells was examined in an animal model. Twenty-four Fischer 344 rats were
injected intraperitoneally with the lung clone of a malignant chloroma. The rats were
then randomized into groups of 6 rats each. Group 1 served as a control, treated with 0.5
mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for three (3)
weeks. Group II received 20 mg of the 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV formulation, that contained in
a sterile nanodispersion at a concentration of 40 mg/mL coenzyme Q10 in the 4:3:1.5
formulation. The formulation was administered by IP injection in a volume of 0.5 mL
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for three (3) weeks. Group III received 35 mg/kg
cyclophosphamide by IP injection once. Group IV received 20 mg of the 4:3:1.5 CoQ10
IV formulation, via the same formulation as that used for Group II and was injected IP in
a volume of 0.5 mL on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for three (3) weeks and, in
addition, received 35 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide once.
[00259]         All animals in the control group were dead due to lung metastasis by day
21 post-transplant. In the group treated with the 4:3:1.5 CoQ1O IV formulation (Group
II), 50% of rats survived and remained disease-free. The other 50% survived 40 days or
more. In the group treated with chemotherapy alone (Group III), 1 rat remained disease
free while 4 rats survived up to day 35. One animal died within the control range and
was therefore considered a non-responder. In the group that received the combination
treatment of the 4:3:1.5 CoQ1O IV formulation and chemotherapy, 6 out of 6 rats
remained disease free.
[00260]         The 4:3:1.5 CoQ1O IV formulation demonstrated a better safety profile.
No side effects were observed in the animals receiving CoQ1O as evidenced by weight
gain and behavior. The 4:3:1.5 CoQ1O IV formulation alone showed significant and
greater efficacy as a single agent than chemotherapy alone. Where the 4:3:1.5 CoQ1O
IV formulation was used in combination with chemotherapy, the therapeutic activity was
synergistic, yielding 100% survival. Figure 36 depicts these results.
[00261]         In conclusion, the 4:3:1.5 CoQ1O formulation demonstrated improved
safety over chemotherapy, significant and greater therapeutic activity in treating lung
cancer than chemotherapy alone, and demonstrated synergistic therapeutic activity with
chemotherapy in treating lung cancer.

[00262]          Example 15 -- Induction of Apoptosis in Cells In Vitro by CoQ10 IV
Formulation: Three apoptotic assays, (1) oxygen consumption rate (OCR), (2) caspase
3 activity assay, and (3) Western Blotting analysis for Caspase 3 were used to validate
the effects of the CoQ10 IV formulation on cancer cells.
[00263]          For the oxygen consumption rate assay, the oxygen consumption rates in
the cell lines was determined using the Seahorse apparatus. The caspase 3 activity was
determined using a colorimetric method using a commercially available kit according to
manufacturer's instructions. The increase in the expression of Caspase 3 as a measure of
apoptosis was determined by western blotting analysis using an antibody specific for
detection of Caspase 3 protein.
[00264]          The effects of two CoQ10 IV formulations were examined using OCR as
a readout. The first formulation (no poloxamer) included 4% CoQ1O; 3% DMPC; and
93% water. The second formulation (with poloxamer) included 4% CoQ1O; 3% DMPC;
 1.5% Poloxamer P188; and 91.5% water. The effects of the two formulations on OCR
were evaluated 6 hours after the start of the treatment against an untreated "media only"
control for each cell line. A final concentration of 50 pM and of 100 pM of CoQ10 was
used for both formulations.
[00265]          As depicted in Figs. 25-28, the results of this study demonstrate that
highly cancerous or metastatic cell lines are particularly sensitive to 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV
formulation treatment. Most of the cancer cell lines tested had OCR values that were
sensitive to the 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV formulation treatment.          CoQ10 IV Formulation
reduced OCR in HepG2 cells (50 and 100 uM), MCF-7 cells (100 uM), PC-3 cells (50
and 100 uM), and PaCa2 cells (50 and 100 uM). The non-metastatic cell line LnCap and
normal cell lines such as HDFa were not sensitive to the CoQ1O IV formulations.
[00266]          Caspase 3 levels were determined in various cell lines following
treatment with the same two CoQ1O IV formulations as used above (the first formulation
included 4% CoQ1O; 3% DMPC; and 93% water, and the second formulation included
4% CoQ1O; 3% DMPC; 1.5% Poloxamer P188; and 91.5% water). Specifically, PC-3,
HepG2, MCF-7, HDFa and MIAPACA2 cells were treated with the CoQ1O IV
formulation and harvested after 24 hours of treatment. The whole cell pellets of these
cells were used for Western Blots. Sample volumes equivalent to 10 Pg of protein were
prepared with Lamelli Loading Dye (LDS) and water and run on a 4-12% Bis-Tris
Novel NuPAGE gel on two 10 lane gels (15 pL loaded per lane) as detailed below.
[00267]          For gel 1 (Figs. 29 and 30), lane 1 contains a sample from MCF-7 cells
treated with media only, lane 2 contains a sample from MCF-7 cells treated with the
                                             69

CoQ10 formulation without poloxamer, lane 3 contains sample from MCF-7 cells
treated with the CoQ10 formulation comprising poloxamer, lane 4 contains sample from
HDFa cells treated with media only, lane 5 contains sample from HDFa cells treated
with the CoQ10 formulation without poloxamer, lane 6 contains sample from HDFa
cells treated with the CoQ10 formulation comprising poloxamer, lane 7 contains sample
from Paca2 cells treated with media only, lane 8 contains sample from Paca2 cells
treated with the CoQ10 formulation without poloxamer, lane 9 contains sample from
Paca2 cells treated with the CoQ10 formulation comprising poloxamer, and lane 10
contains a standard protein size marker.
[00268]         For gel 2 (Figs. 31 and 32), lane 1 contains a protein marker, lane 2
contains a sample from PC3 cells treated with media only, lane 3 contains a sample from
PC3 cells treated with the CoQ10 formulation without poloxamer, lane 4 contains
sample from PC3 cells treated with the CoQ10 formulation comprising poloxamer, lane
5 contains sample from HepG2 cells treated with media only, lane 6 contains sample
from HepG2 cells treated with the CoQ10 formulation without poloxamer, lane 7
contains sample from HepG2 cells treated with the CoQ10 formulation comprising
poloxamer, lane 8 is blank and lanes 9 and 10 both contain protein size markers.
[00269]         The gels were ran for 50 minutes using IX MOPS buffer using a NOVEX
Xcell Surelock system with the voltage at 200 V. The gels were then transferred for 1
hour using a NOVEX Xcell Surelock wet transfer protocol at a voltage of 35 V. The
blots were stained for 5 hours with Simply Blue Safestain from Invitrogen (LC6065).
[00270]         A Western blot analysis was performed to determine the level of Caspase
3 and Beta Actin in the above samples. For the detection of caspase 3, after transfer,
each blot was placed in between 2 Whatman Filter papers and dried for 15-20 minutes.
The blots were activated with methanol for 5 seconds, washed with water for 5 minutes,
and TBST for 15 minutes. The blots were blocked for 1 hour with 5% blocking reagent
in TBS-T at room temperature and then washed 3 times with TBS-T ( iX-15'; 2X 5'
each) and probed with the primary antibody for Caspase 3 (Santacruz sc7272) in 5%
BSA (at 1:200 dilutions) by incubation overnight at 40 C with shaking.
[00271]         After overnight incubation with primary antibody for Caspase 3, the blots
were washed 3 times with TBS-T ( IX-15'; 2X 5' each) and probed with the secondary
antibody (antimouse; 1:10,000 dilution) for 1 hour while shaking at room temperature.
The blots were washed 3 times with TBS-T ( iX-15'; 2X 5' each), incubated with ECF
reagent for 5 minutes and then each blot scanned with 5100 Fuji Laser scanner at 25 uM
resolution, 16 bit, green laser, at 400V and at 500 V.
                                             70

[00272]         To detect actin in the samples, the Caspase 3 blots were stripped by
incubating for 30 minutes with methanol, followed by two 10 minute washes with TBS
T, then 30 minutes of incubation with stripping buffer at 50'C, and followed by two
washes with 100 mL or more of TBS-T for 30 minutes each. The blots were scanned in
a laser scanner to confirm complete stripping. The blots were activated with methanol
for 5 seconds, washed with water for 5 minutes, and TBST for 15 minutes. The blots
were blocked for 1 hour with 5% blocking reagent in TBS-T at room temperature and
then washed 3 times with TBS-T ( 1X-15'; 2X 5' each) and probed with the antibody for
Actin in 5% BSA (Sigma # A5316 clone AC 74) at 1:5000 dilutions) for 1 hour at room
temperature with shaking.
[00273]         After incubation with primary antibody for Actin, the membranes were
washed 3 times with TBS-T ( 1X-15'; 2X 5' each) and probed with the secondary
antibody (antimouse; 1:10,000 dilution) for 1 hour while shaking at room temperature.
The blots were washed 3 times with TBS-T ( 1X-15'; 2X 5' each), incubated with ECF
reagent for 5 minutes and then each blot scanned with 5100 Fuji Laser scanner at 25 uM
resolution, 16 bit, green laser, at 400V and at 500 V.
[00274]         The final Western blots for gel 1 are shown in Figure 29 (Caspase 3) and
Figure 26 (Actin), and for gel 2 are shown in Figure 31 (Caspase 3) and Figure 32
(Actin). The levels of Caspase 3 were quantitated, normalized to Actin and the resulting
data is presented in Figures 33-36.
[00275]         The results of this study show that an increase in normalized Caspase 3
protein levels was observed in PC3 (Figure 33) and MiaPACA2 (Figure 34) cells treated
with the CoQ1O formulation comprising poloxamer 24 hours post treatment. The level
of unnormalized Caspase 3 protein in HepG2 cells 24 hours after treatment is depicted in
Figure 35, since Actin was not obtained for these samples. The increase in the HepG2
lower band is very similar to that observed in the PACA2 (Figure 34) and PC-3 (Figure
33) cells with the upper band. Only the lower band was detected in the HDFa cells, and
the intensity of this band decreased with CoQ1O treatment (Figure 36), similar to the
pattern seen with the upper band in HepG2 (Figure 35).       In summary, an increase in
Caspase 3 protein levels was observed in at least both PACA2 and PC-3 cells, and likely
also in HepG2 cells, following treatment with CoQ10, indicating induction of apoptosis
in these cells.   In normal cells, no induction of apoptosis was observed following
exposure to the CoQ1O IV formulation.
[00276]         Example 16 - Effect of CoQJ0 IV Formulation on Pancreatic
Carcinoma Cell Line: MiaPACA2, a pancreatic cell line was employed on NSG mice.
                                             71

Mice were anesthetized in a sterile environment where they had been housed. Once
animals reached surgical-plane anesthesia, mice were laid down, and the abdominal area
was palpated. The pancreas was located behind the stomach, between the spleen, and
the stomach, both of which are palpable organs.         Thereafter, 10X1065 cells were
injected in the pancreas by gently manipulating the animal to reach the area behind the
stomach. All of these procedures were performed under sterile conditions in a biosafety
cabinet, and the animals were housed under strict sterile conditions as well to avoid
opportunistic infections. After injection of cells, animals were closely monitored daily.
Animals were then randomized into 8 groups receiving a different dose of the CoQ10 IV
formulation.   Group one remained untreated; group 2 received saline only; group 3
received excipient control; group 4 received 0.5 mg/kg of the 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV
formulation as described herein; group 5 received 5 mg/kg of the 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV
formulation as described herein; group 6 received 10 mg/kg of the 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV
formulation as described herein; group 7 received 25 mg/kg of the 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV
formulation as described herein and group 8 received 50 mg/kg of the 4:3:1.5 CoQ10 IV
formulation as described herein. The formulation was administered intravenously via
tail veins with dosing every other day three times per week for up to 28 days. The
summary of results are depicted in the following graphs (Figures 49-56).
[00277]         All animals in the untreated and saline treated control groups were dead
by Day 21. Excipient-treated animals died by Day 36. A dose-related improvement in
mortality was noted following treatment with CoQ10 IV Formulation. Doses of 0.5, 5
and 10 mg/kg/dose produced complete mortality by Days 31, 41 and 56 respectively. At
25 and 50 mg/kg/dose, complete mortality was not observed with 3 and 11 animals
surviving. Survival was significantly increased at 5 mg/kg/dose and above and health
was improved at these doses.      In addition, at 25 and 50 mg/kg/dose, 3 and 4 of the
surviving animals     had tumors, respectively.       Co-administration   of CoQ10    IV
Formulation at 50 mg/kg with doxorubicin resulted in a significant improvement in
survival (25 of 30 animals survived at 60 days as compared to 0 of 30 survivors in the
doxorubicin group) as well as the number of animals free of tumors (25/30 with CoQ1O
IV Formulation).
[00278]         Example 17 -- Combination Therapy With CoQJ0 IV Formulation and
Chemotherapy Adjuvant:       Doxorubicin, a powerful chemotherapeutic, is lethal when
administered intraperitoneally, by itself, in rodents.      CoQ1O IV Formulation was
administered in combination with doxorubicin. As can be seen in the graphs presented
in Figs. 45 and 46, when doxorubicin is administered in combination with the 4:3:1.5
CoQ1O IV formulation, survival of rodents significantly increased over doxorubicin
when administered alone.
                                            72

[00279]         As can be seen in Figure 58, COQ10 IV was not only additive, but also
protective against the doxorubicin toxicity.     Mortality rates were highly statistically
significantly low, with only a few deaths starting on day 41. Nevertheless, 25 out of 30
animals remained alive and cancer-free by day 60, with six animals exhibiting small
tumors at day sixty. These findings demonstrate that the administered Coenzyme Q10
formulation exerted a potent adjuvant effect.
[00280]         Example 18 -- Effect of CoQJO on Breast Cancer: In another in vitro
study, the effect of CoQ10 (50 and 100 tiM) on various members of the Bcl-2 family
(bcl-2, bcl-xl, bid, bad, bak, mcl-i, bim, and bax), p53, and caspases 4, 8, 12 in two
breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and Sk-BR3, was evaluated. The Bcl-2 protein family
has been implicated as the major contributing factor to conferral of resistance to cancer
therapy.   CoQ10 upregulated protein expression of pro-apoptotic members and BH3
subfamily members (bid, bad, bax, bim, and bak), significantly decreased levels of the
anti-apoptotic members (bcl-xl, mcl- 1, and bcl-2), and increased apoptosis (measured by
activation of caspase 3, 6 and 9) restoring the apoptotic potential in breast cancer
without presenting any adverse effects to normal breast tissue.
[00281]         Example     19   --   Absorption/Pharmacokinetics        of   CoQJO    IV
Formulation: The pharmacokinetics of the CoQ10 IV Formulation was determined
after intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg of one of two CoQ10 IV Formulations
(Tables 16-18).   Formulation 1 did not contain any Poloxamer 188, but Formulation 2
did contain Poloxamer 188. There were 18 female mice in each formulation group, and
three mice were sacrificed for sampling at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 hr post-dose. There was
no apparent difference in the plasma profiles for the two formulations. A t 12 value of
approximately 38 hr was determined. There were no measurable plasma concentrations
of CoQ10 IV Formulation in a group of three untreated mice.
[00282]         The pharmacokinetic parameters for CoQ10 IV Formulation in Sprague
Dawley rats were determined in the toxicokinetic evaluations for two toxicity studies.
Charles River Study Number 20000711 was a rising-dose study with a subsequent 7-day
treatment phase. For the toxicokinetic evaluation in the rising-dose phase (Tables-18),
groups of nine male and nine female rats received 100, 250, 750 and 1,000 mg/kg
CoQ1O IV Formulation as a single bolus intravenous injection. For the multiple dose
phase (Table 19), groups of nine males and nine females received 250 or 500 mg/kg
CoQ1O IV Formulation as bolus intravenous injections for every three days for seven
days. For the rising-dose phase and on Day 7 of the multiple-dose phase, samples were
collected from subgroups of three males and three females pre-dose, at 5 and 15
minutes, and at 1, 4, and 24 hr post-dose.     Many of the concentrations were above 1
                                            73

mg/mL for animals receiving 100, 250 or 500 mg/kg, and quite a few are above 10
mg/mL for animals receiving 750 or 1,000 mg/kg, with many of the remaining samples
being above 1 mg/mL.                                              The plasma profiles were not typical of intravenous
administration.                    Although Cmax and AUCo-t generally increased with dose, there were
exceptions, and there was no clear linear dose-dependency, which is expected with
intravenous administration. Estimated values of t12 ranged from 0.8 to 10.0 hr, and there
was no apparent dependence on gender or dose.

CoQ10 was administered as short intravenous infusions at the rate of 1.0 mL/min three
times a week for four weeks. For the toxicokinetic evaluation, three groups of nine male
and nine females received 62.5, 125, and 250 mg/kg CoQ1O IV Formulation (Table 20).
On Days 1 and 26, samples were collected from subgroups of three males and three
females at 5 and 15 minutes, and at 1, 4, 24 and 48 hr post-dose. The peak systemic
exposure to CoQ1O IV Formulation, as measured by Cmax, and the total exposure, as
measured by AUCo-t, increased with increasing dose. The increases in Cmax were close
to linear with dose, and the increases in AUCo-t were slightly greater than dose
                                                                            75

proportional. Between Day 1 and Day 26, Cmax and AUCo-t decreased. Tmax occurred at
0.083 or 0.25 hr, the first two sampling times.                               There may have been small dose
dependent increases in           t1/2.    There was no apparent gender difference.

[00284]             The pharmacokinetic parameters for CoQ10 IV Formulation in beagle
dogs were determined in the toxicokinetic evaluations for two toxicity studies. Charles
River Study Number 20000713 was a rising-dose study with a subsequent 5- to 7-day
treatment phase. In the rising dose phase of the study Tables 16-18), one group of two
male and two female dogs received 250 mg/kg CoQ10 IV Formulation as a single bolus
intravenous injection. In the multiple-dose phase of the study (Table 19), one group of
two male and two female dogs received 125 mg/kg CoQ10 IV Formulation on Days 1, 3
and 5 as bolus intravenous injections. For males on Day 5, the amount of CoQ10 IV
Formulation was indeterminate, and the males were re-dosed on Day 7. Plasma samples
were collected at 5 and 15 minutes, and at 1, 4, and 24 hr post-dose on Day 1 of the
rising-dose phase and on Days 1 and 5 (females) or 7 (males) of the multiple-dosing
phase. Exposure, as measured by Cmax and AUCo-24 was approximately twice as high for
250 mg/kg as for 125 mg/kg. There was a possibly longer half-life for 250 mg/kg (5.94
to 8.16 hr) than for 125 mg/kg (2.07 to 4.87 hr). During dosing on alternate days, the
parameters were similar for Day 1 and Day 7 for males and for Day 1 and Day 5 for
females.       There were no consistent gender differences for any of the pharmacokinetic
parameters.
[00285]             In the second dog toxicity study, Charles River Study Number 20000334,
CoQ1O IV Formulation was administered as short intravenous infusions at the rate of 5.0
mL/min three times a week for four weeks. Four groups of five male and five female
                                                                 76

dogs received vehicle, 31.25, 62.5 or 125 mg/kg CoQ10 IV Formulation (Table 20).
Plasma samples were collected pre-dose, at 5, 15, and 30 minutes, and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and
24 hr post-dose on Days 1 and 26.      Cmax,  AUCo-t, and AUCo-- increased with dose for
both sexes on both sampling days. The increases in        Cmax    were greater than proportional
to dose on Day 1, but close to dose-proportional on Day 26. The increases in AUCo-t
were greater than proportional to dose on both Day 1 and Day 26, however, the
magnitude of the nonlinearity was less on Day 26. Between Day 1 and Day 26, there
were slight or small changes in mean    Cmax  and AUCo-t for the low- and mid-dose groups
indicating little change in exposure for the two lower dose groups. For the high-dose
group, there decreases in both mean    Cmax  and AUCo-t between Day 1 and Day 26. With
the exception of one high-dose female with a     Tmax   value of 0.5 hr, all other   Tmax values
occurred at the first or second sampling time. For the low- and mid-dose groups on both
days and high-dose animals on Day 26, the mean       t1/2  values ranged from 1.91 to 3.62 hr.
For high-dose males and females on Day 1, the mean           t1/2 values were 3.92 and 4.14 hr,
respectively. There was no apparent gender difference for any of the pharmacokinetic
parameters.
[00286]          A non-GLP four-week toxicity study was conducted using sub-adult male
macaques (The Mannheimer Foundation Study 2010-01).                  Groups of four macaques
received vehicle, 31.25, 62.5, or 125 mg/kg CoQ10 by intravenous injection three times
weekly for four weeks. Plasma samples for toxicokinetic analysis were collected pre
dose, and at 0.25, 1, 6, 24, and 48 hr postdose on the first day of dosing. Pre-dose, but
no post-dose samples were collected on Days 7, 14, 21 and 29. Preliminary results show
that Cmax  and AUCo-t increased with increasing dose.             The increases for   Cmax were
slightly greater than directly dose-proportional.           The increases for AUCo-t were
apparently substantially greater than directly dose-proportional, but the nonlinearity may
be in part a reflection of the sampling schedule.   Tmax   occurred at the first sampling time,
0.25 hr, except for one animal with   Tmax at 1 hr. Due to lack of sampling times between
6 and 24 hr, firm conclusions could not be drawn for      t1/2.
[00287]          The four-week toxicity studies in rats, dogs, and macaques showed
increases in Cmax and AUCo-t with dose. Non-linearity was observed for some increases,
but linearity was observed for others. The rat and dog studies, which included animals
of both sexes, did not reveal any apparent gender difference in the pharmacokinetics.
[00288]          Samples of liver, lungs, spleen, pancreas and brain were collected from
mice after a single administration of 100 mg/kg CoQ1O in Formulation 1 or 2 (Tables
21-23). The samples of liver, lungs, spleen and pancreas were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24
and 36 hr post-dose.     Samples of brain were collected at 12, 24 and 36 hr post-dose.
                                              77

            Samples of all tissues were also collected from mice that were not treated. None of the
            samples from the untreated mice had any measurable CoQ1O concentrations. The results
            for the post-dose samples were similar for Formulation 1 and Formulation 2. The results
            for the tissues indicated that there was high uptake of CoQ1O IV Formulation by the
            liver and spleen, intermediate uptake by the lungs, and very little uptake by the pancreas.
            The very limited data for brain indicated possible brain levels similar to plasma
            concentrations, at least from 12 to 36 hr.

    pancreas, and brain were collected from rats at approximately 72 hr after the end of four
    weeks of three times weekly intravenous administration of 0, 62.5, 125 or 250
    mg/kg/dose of CoQ10 IV Formulation (Tables 21-23).                                             There were no measurable
    concentrations of CoQ10 IV Formulation in any of the tissues from the control group.
    At 72 hr post-dose, there were high concentrations in the liver that were approximately
    linearly dose-dependent. Concentrations in the lung and pancreas were lower than in the
    liver.        Only two of the high-dose males had measurable concentrations of CoQth IV
    Formulation in the brain; all others did not have measurable concentrations. There were
    no apparent gender differences in the tissue concentrations.
     [00290]                In Charles River Study Number 20000334, samples of liver, lung,
    pancreas, and brain were collected from dogs at approximately 72 hr after the end of
    four weeks of three times weekly intravenous administration of 0, 31.25, 62.5, or 125
    mg/kg/dose of CoQ10 (Tables 21-23). There were no measurable concentrations of
    CoQ10 IV Formulation in the lung, pancreas or brain samples from the control group.
    Two males in the control group had low levels of CoQ10 IV Formulation in the liver
     samples, indicating low levels of endogenous CoQ1O IV Formulation . At 72 hr post
    dose, there were high concentrations in the liver samples from CoQ1O IV Formulation
    treated dogs. The mean concentrations were approximately linearly dose-dependent.
    Concentrations in the lung were less than 1% of the concentrations in the liver. None of
    the pancreas or brain samples had measurable concentrations. There were no apparent
    gender differences in the tissue concentrations.
                                                                          79

[00291]          Figure 47 shows the mean liver concentrations of CoQ1O IV Formulation
versus dose for male and female rats and dogs. It shows that the dose dependencies are
similar for rats and dogs, and there is no apparent gender difference for either species.
[00292]          The four-week toxicity studies in rats and dogs showed increases in Cmax
and AUCo-t with dose. Non-linearity was observed for some increases, but linearity was
observed for others. The rat and dog studies, which included animals of both sexes, did
not reveal any apparent gender difference in the pharmacokinetics.
[00293]          The results of the tissue-distribution study in mice indicated that there
was high uptake of CoQ1O IV Formulation by the liver and spleen, intermediate uptake
by the lungs, and very little uptake by the pancreas. The very limited data for mouse
brain indicated possible brain levels similar to plasma concentrations, at least from 12 to
36 hr. The published studies of distribution in rats and mice are in general agreement
with the limited data from the study of CoQ10 IV Formulation in mice.
[00294]          The necropsy samples taken 72 hr after the last dose in a four-week
treatment period showed high concentrations of CoQ1O IV Formulation in the liver,
lower concentrations in the lung, low (rats) or nonmeasurable (dogs) in the pancreas, and
no measurable levels in the brain of either species. The dose-dependency of the mean
liver concentrations was similar for rats and dogs.        There was no apparent gender
difference in the tissue concentrations.
[00295]          Example 20 -- Single-Dose Toxicology Study of CoQJ0 IV Formulation
In Rats: In single-dose toxicity studies in rats, Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 3/sex/group)
received single IV injections of the CoQ10 formulation via the tail vein at 100, 250, 750
mg/kg (using a 45.9 mg/mL formulation), and 750 and 1000 mg/kg (using a 80 mg/mL
formulation) (Charles River Study Number 20000711; Table 24).                Animals were
observed for three days post-dose. One additional group (3/sex) received the vehicle
only (3% DMPC and 1.5% Poloxamer 188). An additional 9/sex/group were similarly
treated and used for toxicokinetic studies. Parameters evaluated included mortality and
reactions   to treatment, detailed     examinations,   body weight,    food consumption,
hematology and clinical chemistry, gross pathology, and organ weights. Histopathology
was conducted on a limited number of tissues (heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas,
discolored skin samples, lymph nodes) from animals in all groups except 750 mg/kg
(45.9 mg/mL). Toxicokinetics was evaluated following each dose.

cavity and discolored liver; discolored lymph nodes were noted at 100 and 250 mg/kg.
Histopathological evaluation from animals treated at 750 and 1000 mg/kg that died
revealed intrathoracic fluid, injection site lesions and discoloration of tissues.  Fibrin
deposition in the renal glomerulus was seen in the two males that died at 750 mg/kg but
not in the two females that died at 1000 mg/kg. Fibrin deposition in the lung was seen in
animals that died at both doses. Hepatic necrosis was seen in one animal that died at
750 mg/kg. Tissues were generally normal among survivors at these two doses except
for vascular inflammation at the injection site. Evaluation of vehicle treated animals
was generally unremarkable except for eosinophillic crystals in the kidney (one female),
alveolar epithelial hyperplasia in the lung (one female) and minimal inflammation in the
pancreas (one female). These changes are likely incidental.
[00299]         Example 21   -- Single-Dose Toxicology Study of CoQJ0 IV Formulation
In Dogs: Beagle dogs (n         1 or 2/sex) received single doses of sterile CoQ1O nano
suspension for injection as a slow bolus IV injection at 250 and 125 mg/kg (Charles
River Laboratories Study Number 20000713; Table 24). To evaluate the possible effect
of the vehicle following the observed significant toxicity observed at 250 mg/kg (using
vehicle containing 6% DMPC and 3% Poloxamer 188), additional groups of dogs were
treated with the vehicle (6% DMPC and 3% Poloxamer), the "complete" vehicle (3%
DMPC and 1.5% Poloxamer 188), or PBS/Poloxamer (a suitable formulation of DMPC
in PBS could not be prepared). The initial injection rate for the 250 mg/kg dose and for
the vehicle was 5.44 mL/kg based on a formulation of CoQ1O concentration of 45.9
mg/mL.      The injection rate for the 125 mg/kg dose was 3.51 mL/kg based on a
formulation of CoQ1O concentration of 35.6 mg/mL. Parameters evaluated included
mortality and reactions to treatment, detailed examinations,         body weight, food
consumption, hematology and biochemistry, gross pathology, and organ weights and
limited histopathology (heart , kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, discolored skin from dogs
dosed with 250 mg/kg, vehicle, and the complete vehicle).             Toxicokinetics was
determined after each dose.
                                              82

[00300]         The two males and two females dosed with 250 mg/kg were moribund
sacrificed on Day 2 due to significant adverse clinical signs. To evaluate the possible
role of the vehicle, the vehicle was administered to another group of 1/sex. Observed
responses were the same, including moribund euthanasia, as seen with the animals
treated at 250 mg/kg, suggesting this dose of vehicle was responsible for some, if not all
of the effects noted. This was confirmed when another male and female were dosed
with the complete vehicle at the same rate of 5.44 mL/kg. Administration of PBS and
Poloxamer 188 to another male and female dog produced no such effects, suggesting
that the DMPC in the vehicle formulation with the higher concentration of excipients
was the component causing the effects. In a fifth group of 1/sex, the drug formulation
was given at 125 mg/kg using a reduced dose volume of 3.51 mL/kg.           Effects were
limited to emesis and soft stools, but the animals survived.
[00301]         Adverse effects on body weight, food consumption, clinical pathology
(hemolysis), gross pathology changes in the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder,
and urinary bladder, and microscopic changes consistent with hemolysis in the kidneys
and livers were only noted in the animals administered 250 mg/kg, the vehicle and the
complete vehicle. No findings were noted in the dogs administered PBS/Poloxamer 188
or 125 mg/kg.
[00302]         Toxicokinetic data showed dose proportional increases in Cmax and AUC
and slightly increased half-life at 250 mg/kg/dose than at 125 mg/kg/dose.
[00303]         Example    22    --  Repeat-Dose    Toxicology  Study   of CoQJ0       IV
Formulation In Rats: In a one-week repeat dose study in rats, two groups of 5 rats/sex
received 250 and 500 mg/kg every 3 days for a total of three doses (Charles River
Laboratories Study Number 20000711; Table 25).            Parameters evaluated included
mortality and reactions to treatment, detailed examinations, body weight, and gross
pathology (on animals that died). Histopathology was not conducted on these animals.
Toxicokinetics was evaluated on the last day of treatment. No adverse clinical signs
were seen at 250 mg/kg/dose. At 500 mg/kg/dose, four animals died or were sacrificed
in a moribund condition: two males found dead on Day 2, one female euthanized
moribund on Day 3 (clinical signs of hypothermia and decreased activity), and one
female found dead on Day 6. Survivors at 500 mg/kg/dose showed no adverse clinical
signs.   Animals at both doses generally maintained (males) or gained (females) body
weight through Day 4, and thereafter experienced slight weight loss. Hematological
data indicated increased reticulocytes and various while blood cell types at 500
mg/kg/day. Slight polychromasia and/or anisocytosis were seen among some animals at
both doses. At the end of the treatment period (three doses), increased values for ALT,
                                             83

AST, GGT and urea nitrogen were noted among animals receiving 500 mg/kg/dose as
well as decreases in total protein, albumin and globulin. At necropsy, discolored lymph
nodes, discoloration of the subcutaneous layer of the skin and pale liver as well as
injection site lesions were observed. Compared to animals at 250 mg/kg/dose, decreased
weights of the thymus, epididymides, prostate, seminal vesicles, ovaries and uterus were
noted, as well as an increase in liver weights in females.        No histopathology was
performed.
[00304]           Toxicokinetic data showed that, in general, plasma concentrations, Cmax
and AUCo-t values of CoQ10 increased with increasing dose. Based on these results, 250
mg/kg/dose was selected as the high dose in the definitive study.

[00305]           Example 23     -- 4-Week Repeat-Dose Toxicology Study of CoQJ0 IV
Formulation In Rats: Four groups of young adult Sprague Dawley rats (n=
10/sex/group) received the vehicle (PBS containing Poloxamer 188 and DMPC) or the
test article at doses of 0, 62.5, 125 and 250 mg/kg by IV injection three times per week
(Charles River Laboratories Study Number 20000328; Table 26). An additional 5
rats/sex were included in each group and were maintained after treatment for a 2-week
recovery period.          A single batch (#0494-02-021) of test article with a target
concentration of 40 mg/mL of CoQ10 was provided for use on the study. The doses of
62.5, 125 and 250 mg/kg were achieved using dose volumes of 1.56, 3.13, and 6.25
mL/kg, respectively.       The vehicle was administered at the same dose volume as the
high-dose group. Additionally, three groups of 9 animals/sex served as toxicokinetic
(TK) animals and received the test article in the same manner as the main study groups.
Parameters evaluated included cageside observations, clinical observations, body
                                              84

weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinical pathology evaluations (hematology,
coagulation tests, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), gross pathology, and organ
weights. Histopathology was conducted on all tissues in control and high-dose groups
from animals sacrificed at the end of the treatment period, and on bone marrow, kidney,
liver, mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen from animals in the low and
middle dose groups. Examination of animals from the recovery sacrifice was limited to
those tissues showing gross lesions, and included liver and lymph nodes. Blood samples
for determination of the plasma concentrations of the test article were collected from
cohorts of three TK animals per sex per dose group at 5, 15 and 60 minutes and at 4, 24
and 48 hours after dosing on Days 1 and 28 (after the last dose).

          parameters were observed. Decreased body weight gains and food consumption were
                                                                                                88

observed for animals treated at the high dose and to a lesser extent at the middle dose.
Some recovery was seen at the end of the non-treatment period.
[00307]         Evaluation of hematological data revealed a slight but inconsistent
decrease in red cell parameters that was primarily limited to the high dose males.
Reticulocytes were not meaningfully affected.        Activated partial thromboplastin time
was somewhat longer among the high dose animals that tended to persist through the
recovery period.      Elevation in total white cell counts, also reflected in increases in
neutrophils, eosinophils or lymphocytes were see at the highest dose only.         Clinical
chemistry data revealed increased values for AST, ALT, GGT and cholesterol for the
high dose males at the end of the treatment period and were more pronounced at the end
of the recovery period. For females, the increases were seen only at the end of the
recovery period.
[00308]         At necropsy (terminal and recovery), test article-related gross changes
included pale discoloration of the liver and pale discoloration/enlargement of multiple
lymph nodes at 62.5 mg/kg/dose and above, enlargement of the spleen at 125
mg/kg/dose and above, and pale adrenals, pale ovaries, and subcutaneous                skin
discoloration at 250 mg/kg/dose. Spleen and liver weights were increased at 250
mg/kg/dose at the terminal and recovery necropsies.
[00309]         Test     article-related histopathological   findings   at  the  scheduled
termination on Day 29 included mild to moderate cytoplasmic vacuolation of the adrenal
cortex (250 mg/kg/dose), minimal to mild erythrocytic hyperplasia in the bone marrow
of the sternum of males (            125 mg/kg/dose), mild to marked mononuclear cell
infiltration of the injection site (250 mg/kg/dose), minimal to mild hepatocellular
cytoplasmic vacuolation (         62.5 mg/kg/dose), minimal to moderate histiocytic cell
infiltration of the liver (       62.5 mg/kg/dose), minimal to moderate histiocytic cell
infiltration of multiple lymph nodes (> 62.5 mg/kg/dose), mild to moderate histiocytic
cell infiltration of ovary in females (250 mg/kg/dose females), mild to moderate
histiocytic cell infiltration of the dermis and/or subcutis in females (> 125 mg/kg/dose),
and minimal to moderate histiocytic cell infiltration of the spleen in males (> 125
mg/kg/dose) and in females (> 62.5 mg/kg/dose). In the recovery animals, similar test
article-related lesions were noted as were observed in the main study animals; the
severity of these changes followed a dose-response.         Findings included: minimal to
marked vacuolation of the adrenal gland cortex at > 62.5 mg/kg/dose (males and
females), minimal to moderate focal or mutifocal hepatic necrosis at > 125 mg/kg/dose
(males and females), minimal to moderate histiocytic infiltration and vacuolation of the
liver at > 62.5 mg/kg/dose (males and females), minimal to moderate histiocytic

infiltration of the lymph nodes at > 62.5 mg/kg/dose (males and females), minimal to
marked histiocytic infiltration of the spleen at > 62.5 mg/kg/dose (males and females),
and minimal to moderate histiocytic infiltration of the ovaries > 62.5 mg/kg/dose
(females). In several organs/tissues, the severity of the changes seen in the recovery
animals, particularly at 125 and 250 mg/kg/dose, were more pronounced than at the
terminal necropsy including the adrenal gland, liver, and additional lymph nodes (iliac,
renal, pancreatic, cervical, popliteal, mediastinal, and/or brachial).
[00310]           Toxicokinetic analyses revealed that Cmax and AUC increased in a dose
proportional or greater than dose-proportional manner.                                    Values on Day 26 were
substantially lower relative to Day 1. There were no notable gender differences.                                   A
tabular presentation of pertinent data is shown below (Table 27).

[00311]           In a one-week toxicity study in dogs, one group of 2 dogs/sex received
 125 mg/kg every 3 days for a total of three doses (Charles River Laboratories Study
Number 20000713; Table 25). Parameters evaluated included mortality and reactions to
treatment,    detailed        examinations,          body             weight,    food     consumption,    cardiology
parameters, hematology and clinical chemistry parameters, organ weights and gross
pathology.     Histopathology was not conducted on these animals. Toxicokinetics was
evaluated on the last day of treatment.
[00312]           No adverse effects were seen at the 125 mg/kg/dose level for any of the
parameters evaluated except for a slight reduction in red cell mass and morphology at
the end of the treatment period.
[00313]           Toxicokinetic data showed that plasma concentrations, and mean values
for Cmax, AUCo- 24, and AUCo0                  of CoQ10 IV Formulation were comparable between
the first and the third dose administered.
                                                                 90

[00314]         Based on these results, 125 mg/kg/dose was selected as the high dose in
the definitive dog study.
[00315]         In a 4-week repeat-dose study in dogs, four groups of beagle dogs (n
3/sex/group) received the vehicle or drug product containing CoQ10 IV Formulation at
doses of 31.25, 62.5 and 125 mg/kg by IV injection daily for four weeks (Charles River
Laboratories Study Number 20000334; Table 28).         An additional two dogs/sex were
included in each group and maintained for a 2-week recovery after treatment. A single
test article concentration of 40 mg/mL was provided for use on the study. The doses of
31.25, 62.5 and 125 mg/kg were achieved using dose volumes of 0.78, 1.56 and 3.13
mL/kg, respectively.      Parameters evaluated included cageside observations, clinical
observations, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopy, electrocardiography,
clinical pathology, gross pathology, organ weights, and histopathology. Blood samples
for determination of the plasma concentrations of CoQ10 IV Formulation were collected
pre-dose and at 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes and at 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours post-dose on Days 1
and 26.

body weight loss, elevations in liver enzymes, and a pale appearing liver at necropsy, but
a definitive cause of death was not determined following histopathological evaluation of
tissues in this animal.
[00317]          Among all other animals, no adverse test article-related findings were
observed in clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmic and
electrocardiographic evaluations, clinical pathology, macroscopic, and organ weight
parameters.    Increases in reticulocyte counts were noted for the vehicle and high dose
treated animals at the end of the treatment period, which persisted only in the males at
the end of the recovery period. An association with the formulation vehicle cannot be
ruled out. At necropsy, macroscopic observations were limited to a pale appearance to
the liver at the middle and high dose groups, which was also noted at the recovery
necropsy.    At histopathology, no morphological alterations were seen in any tissue
except the liver.     Hepatocellular glycogen deposition was identified in all groups,
including the vehicle treated group. No adverse changes were noted in the liver of these
animals. Following the recovery period, these microscopic changes were limited to the
middle and high dose animals.
[00318]          Toxicokinetic     evaluations    revealed   that exposure    increased with
increasing dose, with increases in Cmax and AUC tending to be greater than dose
proportional. There were no remarkable gender differences and, in most cases, exposure
parameters were similar on Days 1 and 26 except for decreased values for the high dose
animals at Day 26. A tabular summary of pertinent parameters is shown below (Table
