                      "REPLACEABLE SEEDING BOOT"
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to agricultural machines being seeders
arranged to create furrows and deposit seeds within. In particular, the present
invention relates to a seeding boot for use as part of a seeder.
Background to the Invention
[0002] A seeder is a piece of agricultural machinery arranged to be drawn by
a tractor. Generally, a seeder has a plurality of seeding units spaced across
its width. Each seeding unit has a number of components: a leading 'knife' or
tine arranged to penetrate the ground and create a furrow as the seeder is
pulled forward; a fertiliser tube through which liquid or granular fertiliser can
be deposited in the furrow, a seeding 'boot' through which seeds can be
deposited into the furrow, and a trailing press wheel which acts to close the
furrow.
[0003] The seeding boot is subject to significant abrasive wear. As such, it is
necessary for the seeding boot to be periodically replaced.
[0004] It is desirable to construct seeders with seeding boots which are
readily replaceable. It is also important that the seeding boots are securely
and rigidly held in position during use.
[0005] Replaceable seeding         boots are generally formed as unitary
components including a ground engaging portion, a seeder tube connection,
at least one seed delivery opening, and an adjustable coupling for connection
to the seeder. The ground engaging portion is typically faced with an abrasion
resistant material.
[0006] The present invention proposes a replacable seeding boot which
allows for different wear rates to be accommodated more efficiently than in
unitary seeding boots.

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
[0022] Referring to the Figures, there is shown a seeding boot assembly 10
having three main components: a body portion 12, a wear member 14 and a
rear cover 16.
[0023] Figures 2 to 4 show a wear member 20, which is similar to the wear
member 14 of Figure 1.
[0024] The wear member 20 has an attachment portion 22 and a base 24.

                                          5
[0025] The attachment portion 22 includes two generally vertical side walls
26, spaced apart to define a channel 28. The side walls 26 are generally
triangular in shape. A front wall 30 extends between the side walls 26 to close
one side of the channel 28. Each of the side walls 26 has a locating tab 32
extending beyond the front wall 30.
[0026] A cylindrical pin recess 34 passes through the attachment portion 22,
close to the base 24. The pin recess 34 passes through both side walls 26
and the channel 28. The pin recess 34 is oriented in a transverse direction
relative to a direction-of-travel of the seeding boot assembly 10.
[0027] The base 24 has two angled walls 40, which extend downwardly and
away from the attachment portion 22 in an inverted 'V shape when seen from
the front.
[0028] The angled walls 40 each have a leading edge 42. The leading edges
42 are angled relative to the vertical, such that they extend from the
attachment portion 22 in a direction downwardly and towards a rear of the
wear member 20.
[0029] Each leading edge 42 is thus angled with respect to both vertical and
horizontal directions.
[0030] Each leading edge 42 has a strip of abrasion resistant material, such
as carbide, bonded to it.
[0031] The wear member 14 of Figure 1 differs from the wear member 20 of
Figures 2 to 4 in that it has a rearwardly projecting, triangular-pyramid shaped
splitter 44. The splitter 44 has a generally horizontal lower surface, and two
upper surfaces 46 which are both oriented at about 450 relative to the vertical.
[0032] Figures 5 and 6 show a body portion 50, which is similar to the body
portion 12 of Figure 1. The body portion 50 includes a connection portion 52

                                        6
at a front upper end thereof, the connection portion 52 being arranged to bolt
to a seeding apparatus frame.
[0033] The body portion 50 includes a vertically oriented, cylindrical tube
receiving member 54 located to the rear of the connection portion 52. The
tube-receiving member 54 is arranged to connect to a seed-dispensing tube
56 of the seeding apparatus frame.
[0034] The body portion 50 has a generally vertical main wall 58, extending
downwardly from the connection portion 52. The main wall 58 is generally
perpendicular to the direction of travel of the assembly 10.
[0035] The main wall 58 has side faces 60.
[0036] At a lower front corner 62 of the main wall 58, each of the side faces
60 has a recess 64 formed into it. The effect is to create a front corner 62 of
the main wall 58 which has a smaller width than the remainder of the main
wall 58. The width of the front corner 62 corresponds to the width of the
channel 28 of the attachment portion 22.
[0037] The recesses 64 each have an upper shoulder portion 66 arranged to
correspond to locating tabs 32 of the side walls 26.
[0038] The outer edge front corner 62 is shaped to complement the shape of
the channel 28, and includes a laterally aligned pin recess 68. It will be
appreciated that the wear member 20 can thus be located such that each side
wall 26 of the attachment portion 22 locates in a recess 68, with the locating
tabs 32 being positioned within the upper shoulder portions 66 and the pin
recess 34 being coaxial with the pin recess 68. It will further be appreciated
that a pin 70 can be slotted into the coaxial pin recesses 34, 68 to fix the wear
member 20 to the body portion 50.
[0039] At a rear edge of the main wall 58, each of the side faces 60 has a
second recess 72 formed into it. The effect is to create a rear edge 74 of the

                                        7
main wall 58 which has a smaller width than the remainder of the main wall
58 (although larger than the width of the front corner 62). The depth of each
second recess 72 corresponds to the material width of the rear cover 16.
[0040] A bolt receiving aperture 76 is located generally centrally of each
second recess 72, extending through the main wall 58.
[0041] The body portion 12 of Figure 1 differs from the body portion 50 of
Figures 5 and 6 in that the body portion 50 has a rearwardly projecting splitter
44 extending from a lower edge of the main wall 58. It will be appreciated that
the splitter 44 of Figure 1 and the splitter 44 of Figures 5 and 6 ultimately
locate in the same place relative to the seeding boot assembly 10, and the
choice as to which component they are fixed does not affect their function.
[0042] The rear cover 16 is shown in Figure 7. The rear cover 16 is generally
U-shaped in cross section, forming a channel 80. The rear cover 16 has flared
lower edges 82, and rearwardly extending locating tabs 84 located along its
open side. The locating tabs 84 each include a bolt receiving aperture 86.
[0043] The arrangement is such that the rear cover 16 can be located at the
rear of the body portion 50, with its open side locating in the second recesses
72 and the bolt receiving apertures 86 being coaxial with the bolt receiving
aperture 76. The rear cover 16 can be secured to the body portion 50 by
means of a bolt 90.
[0044] When thus positioned, the flared lower edges 82 locate over the upper
surfaces 46 of the splitter 44.
[0045] The channel 80 of the rear cover 16 and the rear edge 74 of the main
wall 58 cooperate to form a generally vertical chute which communicates with
the tube-receiving member 54. The seed dispensing tube 56; the tube
receiving member 54 and the chute formed by the channel 80 together form
a seed travel path. In use, a seed will travel downwardly through the seed

                                          8
travel path before striking the splitter 44 and being deflected away from the
vertical axis into a furrow created by the seeding apparatus.
[0046] When the wear member 20 becomes sufficiently worn to necessitate
replacement, removal of the pin 70 allows for the wear member 20 to be taken
away and replaced, without the need for changing the body portion 50.
Similarly, the rear cover 16 can be independently replaced if and when
required.
[0047] It will be appreciated that the embodiments described above relate to
a 'splitting boot', where the splitter 44 imparts a lateral deflection to the seed.
Figure 8 shows use of an alternative wear member 92, with an attachment
portion 22 identical to that of the wear member 20 and a base 94 which simply
locates snugly below the main wall 58. In this case, each seed passes through
the seed travel path and is deposited in the ground directly beneath the
channel 80.
[0048] Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a skilled
addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.
