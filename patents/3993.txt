         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to antagonists medicine intermediates o-nitrobenzoic
 5 acid synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         O-nitrobenzoic acid is mainly used for pharmaceutical synthesis and organic
   synthesis, it can also be used for 5HT2-D2 antagonist drug intermediates synthesis.
10 However, most of the existing synthetic methods are using potassium permanganate as
   a reactant, it is complicated and the final yield is not very high. Therefore, it is
   necessary to propose a new synthetic method for further improving the quality and
   yield of the product and reducing the byproduct content, it has important economic
   significance.
