    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention relates to novel benzofuran-2-sulfonamide pyridine
    derivatives, processes for preparing them, pharmaceutical compositions containing
    them and their use as pharmaceuticals as modulators of chemokine receptors. The
 5  invention relates specifically to the use of these compounds and their pharmaceutical
    compositions to treat disorders associated with chemokine receptor modulation.
    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            Chemokines are a group of 7- to 14-kd peptides that play an important role in
    orchestrating leukocyte recruitment and migration during inflammation, and therefore
 '0 represent an important target for anti-inflammatory therapies (Wells et al., 2006).
    They act by binding to seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptors, the
    chemokine receptors. The chemokine system is complex, with about 50 chemokines
    and 20 chemokine receptors identified in humans, often acting with redundancy,
    making selection of specific antagonists difficult (Gerard and Rollins, 2001). Genetic
25  knockout strategies have confirmed the importance of chemokines as regulators of
    immune function, but the deletion of specific chemokines has led to only specific and
    relatively mild defects in the inflammatory response further emphasizing the complex
    redundancy of the system. Selectivity is crucial for use of chemokine receptor
    antagonists in systemic diseases where a single chemokine-receptor system is
30  implicated such as atheroscelorsis where the macrophage/monocyte system is the
    major player in order to allow a subtle and specific control over immune function
    (Weisberg et al., 2006; Feria and Diaz Gonzalez et al., 2006).
                                                  1

        WO 2013/130962                                                       PCT/US2013/028607
              Many ocular conditions are characterized by inappropriate migration and
    infiltration of cells such as leukocytes and endothelial cells into the eye with
    deleterious effects to ocular structures (Wallace et al., 2004). Chemokines have
    been identified in such diseases and misregulation of the chemokine system is
 5  apparent in corneal graft rejection, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular
    degeneration (ARM D), chronic inflammatory diseases such as uveitis, dry eye etc.
    Mice lacking CCR2 or MCP-1 develop features of ARMD with age, including drusen
    deposits, choroidal neovascularization and photoreceptor atrophy indicating a crucial
    role for this chemokine and its receptor signaling (Amabati et al., 2003). Thus CCR2
 0  receptor-specific inhibitor might have potential therapeutic benefit in ocular diseases
    like ARMD. In contrast, various human and animal studies have identified several
    chemokines in different forms of uveitis, produced both by resident and infiltrating
    cells, that strongly suggests a prominent role for these molecules in its pathogenesis.
    Studies in rat and mice models of uveitis have demonstrated up-regulation of
 5  monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1
    (MIP-1), RANTES, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) which are powerful
    chemoattractants for monocytes and T-cells (Fang et al., 2004; Keino et al., 2003).
    Similar findings have been reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients
    with acute anterior uveitis (AAU), the most common form of human uveitis (Klitgaard
 '0 et al., 2004). MCP-1 knockout mice and CCR5 knockout mice show reduced
    endotoxin-induced uveitis, which is the animal model for AAU (Takeuchi et al., 2005;
    Tuallion et al., 2002). It has also been demonstrated that blocking the chemokine
    system upstream with the use of NF-KB blockers significantly attenuates
    experimental AAU in rats (Yang et al., 2005). Blockage of NF-KB results in
25  transcriptional inhibition of multiple chemokines. Given the complexity of
    pathogenesis in uveitis it is unlikely that a selective inhibition of a chemokine
    receptor in monotherapy will offer therapeutic benefit. A similar role of multiple
    chemokines have been shown to be correlated with clinical stage of disease in
    diabetic retinopathy and dry eye (Meleth et al., 2005; Yamagami et al., 2005). In
30  these ocular diseases the use of broad spectrum chemokine receptor inhibitor which
    inhibits the function of a wide range of chemokines may be beneficial.
             The first broad spectrum chemokine inhibitor (BSCI) to be reported was
    termed Peptide 3, which was derived from the sequence of human chemokine MCP
                                                  2

        WO 2013/130962                                                    PCT/US2013/028607
    1 and was shown to block the migration of monocytes in response to MCP-1, MIP-1,
    RANTES and SDF-1 (Reckless and Grainger. 1999). A cyclic retro inverse analogue
    of Peptide 3, constructed of D-amino acids in the reverse sequence, called NR58
    3.14.3 was observed to be a more potent chemokine inhibitor (Beech et al., 2001).
 5  NR58-3.14.3 has been used to test for anti-inflammatory activities in animal models
    of atherosclerosis, lung inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome etc (Beech et al.,
    2001; Grainger and Reckless. 2003; Tokuyama et al., 2005). However there are
    several disadvantages to using these BSCI as a long-term therapeutic strategy. The
    known BSCIs which are peptides which have relatively low potency, poor
 0  pharmacokinetics, and are unstable in vivo. In addition, systemic use of broad
    spectrum chemokine receptor inhibitors could potentially lead to deleterious side
    effects due to their systemic anti-inflammatory activity. However in ocular diseases, a
    local or topical application would prevent the broad spectrum inhibitor to be taken up
    systemically. Identification of a small molecule inhibitor of several chemokine
 5  receptors could be very useful for treatment of inflammatory ocular diseases. Given
    the evidence for the role of multiple chemokines in several ocular diseases and
    these results, we propose that the use of small and large molecule broad spectrum
    chemokine receptor inhibitors will have utility in the local treatment of ocular
    inflammatory diseases including, but not limited to, uveitis, dry eye, diabetic
 '0 retinopathy, allergic eye disease and proliferative retinopathies. Manipulation of
    multiple chemokines therefore represents a novel therapeutic approach in treating
    ocular diseases.

    known in the art. While topical administration is preferred, this compound may also
    be used in an intraocular implant as described in U.S. Patent 7,931,909.
 0          Invention compounds may also be administered in the form of suppositories
    for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions may be prepared by mixing
    the invention compounds with a suitable non-irritating excipient, such as cocoa
    butter, synthetic glyceride esters of polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary
    temperatures, but liquefy and/or dissolve in the rectal cavity to release the drug.
 5          Since individual subjects may present a wide variation in severity of
    symptoms and each drug has its unique therapeutic characteristics, the precise
    mode of administration and dosage employed for each subject is left to the discretion
    of the practitioner.
            The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions described herein are
 '0 useful as medicaments in mammals, including humans, for treatment of diseases
    and/or alleviations of conditions which are responsive to treatment by agonists or
    functional antagonists of chemokine receptors. Thus, in further embodiments of the
    invention, there are provided methods for treating a disorder associated with
    modulation of chemokine receptors. Such methods can be performed, for example,
25  by administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition
    containing a therapeutically effective amount of at least one invention compound. As
    used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of the
    pharmaceutical composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the
15 following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not
   restrictive of the invention claimed. As used herein, the use of the singular includes
   the plural unless specifically stated otherwise.
           It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that some of the
   compounds of the invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers, such that
20 the compounds may exist in enantiomeric as well as in diastereomeric forms.
   Unless it is specifically noted otherwise, the scope of the present invention includes
   all enantiomers, diastereomers and racemic mixtures. Some of the compounds of
   the invention may form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases, and
   such pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein are also
25 within the scope of the invention.
                                                26

       WO 2013/130962                                                       PCT/US2013/028607
            The present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically
    enriched compounds. Any compound of the invention may contain one or more
    isotopic atoms enriched or different than the natural ratio such as deuterium     2H  (or
    D) in place of protium 1H (or H) or use of 13 C enriched material in place of   12C  and
 5  the like. Similar substitutions can be employed for N, 0 and S. The use of isotopes
    may assist in analytical as well as therapeutic aspects of the invention. For example,
    use of deuterium may increase the in vivo half-life by altering the metabolism (rate)
    of the compounds of the invention. These compounds can be prepared in accord
    with the preparations described by use of isotopically enriched reagents.
 0          As will be evident to those skilled in the art, individual isomeric forms can be
    obtained by separation of mixtures thereof in conventional manner. For example, in
    the case of diasteroisomeric isomers, chromatographic separation may be
    employed.
            Compound names were generated with ACD version 12.0 and some
 5  intermediates' and reagents' names used in the examples were generated with
    software such as Chem Bio Draw Ultra version 12.0 or Auto Nom 2000 from MDL
    ISIS Draw 2.5 SP1. In general, characterization of the compounds is performed
    according to the following methods:
            NMR spectra are recorded on Varian 600 or Varian 300, in the indicated
 '0 solvent at ambient temperature; chemical shifts in [ppm], coupling constants in [Hz].
            All the reagents, solvents, catalysts for which the synthesis is not described
    are purchased from chemical vendors such as Sigma Aldrich, Fluka, Bio-Blocks,
    Combi-blocks, TCI, VWR, Lancaster, Oakwood, Trans World Chemical, Alfa, Fisher,
    Maybridge, Frontier, Matrix, Ukrorgsynth, Toronto, Ryan Scientific, SiliCycle,
25  Anaspec, Syn Chem, Chem-Impex, MIC-scientific, Ltd; however some known
    intermediates were prepared according to published procedures. Solvents were
    purchased from commercial sources in appropriate quality and used as received. Air
    and/or moisture-sensitive reactions were run under an Ar- or N2- atmosphere.
            Usually the compounds of the invention were purified by chromatography:
