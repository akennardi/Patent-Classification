ABSTRACT
        Automated package deliveries comprises a server at a package delivery system that
receives a request for a package delivery, the request comprising an identification of a
package and an identification of a first kiosk location. The server associates the package with
an aerial delivery device and a user authentication to retrieve the package.         The server
transmits to the delivery device instructions to deliver the package to the first kiosk.
Subsequently, the server receives a request from a user computing device to retrieve the
package from the first kiosk and deliver the package to an alternate kiosk.          The server
transmits to the delivery device instructions to retrieve the package from the first kiosk and
instructions to deliver the package to the alternate kiosk. The delivery device retrieves the
package from the automated kiosk and delivers the package to the alternate kiosk.

      AUTOMATED PACKAGE RELOCATION FROM AN UNMANNED KIOSK
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]          The present disclosure relates generally to automated package delivery, and
more particularly to relocating packages with an aerial drone from a mechanized kiosk.
BACKGROUND
[0002]          Delivery services (also known as courier services, mail services, and shipping
services), such as those offered by the U.S. Postal Service and commercial carriers provide
delivery of letters, packages, and parcels (hereinafter referred to as "packages") to and from
residences and businesses across the country. Other delivery services may be provided by
merchants, retailers, manufacturers, or other organizations that desire to ship products to
users. Typically, such services operate in hub and spoke architecture.
[0003]          A typical nationwide or international delivery service maintains a large fleet
of vehicles.    Such vehicles include airplanes and semi-trailer trucks to move packages
between hubs and spokes, and smaller vehicles for the "last mile" from spoke endpoints to
delivery destinations (for example a home or business). The two largest commercial delivery
services in the U.S. together operate over 100,000 last mile vehicles - each of which requires
a human operator.      In some situations, interaction with a person at pickup or delivery is
desired, for example, for proof of delivery, payment on delivery (also known as "cash on
delivery" or "COD"), or payment of delivery costs on pickup. The growth of commercial
areas, such as business-to-consumer e-commerce and online shopping, is expected to
continue to increase the demand for delivery services, and hence the need for capacity and
efficiency in the last mile.
[0004]          Recently, package delivery systems have employed kiosks for receiving
packages. The package delivery systems deliver packages to the kiosk, and a user retrieves
the package directly from the kiosk. The kiosk delivery provides a safer delivery method
when the user may be unavailable to receive a valuable package at the residence of the user.
Additionally, unmanned aerial delivery devices are being developed for delivery of packages
to users.
[0005]          Conventional delivery systems do not allow packages to be relocated by
unmanned aerial delivery devices from an unmanned kiosk to an alternate kiosk.
Conventional delivery systems do not allow packages to be returned by unmanned aerial
delivery devices from an unmanned kiosk back to the package delivery service.

SUMMARY
[0006]          In certain example aspects described herein, a computer-implemented method
for automated package delivery is provided.        In an example embodiment, a server at a
package delivery system receives a request for a package delivery, the request comprising an
identification of a package and an identification of a first destination kiosk location. The
server associates the package with an aerial delivery device and a user authentication to
retrieve the package from the pickup location. The server transmits to the delivery device
instructions to deliver the package to the first destination kiosk. Subsequently, the server
receives a request from a user computing device to retrieve the package from the first kiosk
and deliver the package to an alternate kiosk that is more convenient to the user at that time.
The server transmits to the delivery device instructions to retrieve the package from the first
kiosk and instructions to deliver the package to the alternate kiosk.      The delivery device
retrieves the package from the automated kiosk and delivers the package to the alternate
kiosk or back to the package delivery system.
[0007]          In certain other example aspects described herein, a system and a computer
program product for automated package delivery are provided.
[0008]          These and other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the example

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
Overview
[0017]          The example embodiments described herein provide computer-implemented
techniques for relocating a package delivery to an alternate kiosk via a drone. In an example
embodiment, an aerial delivery device, such as a drone, is transmitted instructions for
delivery of a package to a kiosk. After delivery of the package to the first kiosk, the user
requests an alternate kiosk for delivery of package. An aerial delivery device retrieves the
package from the first kiosk and delivers the package to the alternate kiosk.           The user
subsequently provides authentication at the alternate kiosk and retrieves the package. In an
alternate embodiment, the user provides a request to return a product to the package delivery
system warehouse or other location. The user transports the package to kiosk and enters an
authentication on a user interface of the kiosk. The kiosk makes a package bin available to
the user. When the user deposits the package, the kiosk transmits a request for an aerial
delivery device to retrieve the package and return the package to the package delivery system
or other location.
[0018]           In an example, a package delivery system identifies a package for delivery to
a user. The package delivery system may be a warehouse depot for a merchant system or
manufacturer.     The package delivery system may be a courier service, a package delivery
agent, or any suitable system. The package is associated with an aerial delivery device for
delivery.
[0019]          The user provides a preferred kiosk location for delivery of the package. The
user is associated with a user identification number, a password, or other authentication data.
[0020]          The package delivery system provides the kiosk location to the aerial delivery
device. For example, the package delivery system provides an address for the kiosk.            In
another example, the package delivery system provides a GPS location to the kiosk. Any
suitable instructions that will allow the aerial delivery device to locate the kiosk may be used.
[0021]          Upon arrival at the kiosk location, the aerial delivery device initiates
communication with the kiosk.        The communication may be transmitted via any suitable
                                                  3

technology, such as near field communication.        After confirming that the aerial delivery
device is at the correct kiosk location, the kiosk opens a bay door or other access portal. The
aerial delivery device deposits the package into the bay door, confirms the delivery, and
departs.   When the kiosk receives a package, the kiosk identifies the package and the
associated user. The kiosk transports the package to the appropriate package bin.
[0022]          Before the user retrieves the package, the user requests an alternate delivery
kiosk. The user may select the alternate kiosk by accessing the package delivery system on
the Internet or via application on a user computing device.       The package delivery system
provides instructions to an aerial delivery device to retrieve the package from the kiosk. The
first kiosk prepares the package for retrieval by the aerial delivery device by moving the
package to the bay.    Upon arrival of the aerial delivery device the kiosk opens the bay and
allows the aerial delivery device to retrieve the package.
[0023]          The aerial delivery device delivers package to the alternate kiosk.         The
package is received by alternate kiosk in a similar manner as the first kiosk received the
package. When the user arrives, the user enters an authentication into the user interface of
the kiosk. The user is allowed access to the appropriate package bin by the kiosk. The kiosk
may provide a confirmation that the user retrieved the package to the package delivery
system.
[0024]          In an alternate embodiment, the user provides a request to return a product to
the package delivery system warehouse or other location.             The user may receive an
authorization from a merchant system, a manufacturer, a retailer, or other party to return a
package. For example, the user may contact an online retailer and request an authorization to
return a package.    In any suitable manner, the user may indicate to the package delivery
system that the package is being returned.       The user transports the package to kiosk and
enters an authentication on a user interface of the kiosk. The kiosk makes a package bin
available to the user. When the user deposits the package, the kiosk transmits a request for
an aerial delivery device to retrieve the package. In a certain embodiment, the user has not
retrieved the package from the kiosk at the time of the authorization to return the package. In
this example, the package is returned to the package delivery system directly form the first
kiosk.
[0025]          Upon arrival by the aerial delivery device, the kiosk transports the package to
a bay for pickup by the aerial delivery device.       The aerial delivery device retrieves the
package and transports the package to the package delivery system warehouse or other
location.
                                                 4

                                                5

voice-based interface or any other interface that allows the user 101 to provide input and
receive output from an application or module on the user computing device 110.
[0031]          In an example embodiment, the data storage unit 113 comprises a local or
remote data storage structure accessible to the user computing device 110 suitable for storing
information.     In an example embodiment, the data storage unit 113 stores encrypted
information, such as HTML5 local storage.
[0032]          In an example embodiment, the user 101 can use a communication application
112, such as a web browser application or a delivery application 115, to view, download,
upload, or otherwise access documents or web pages via a distributed network 105.
[0033]          In an example embodiment, the delivery application 115 is a program,
function, routine, applet, or similar entity that exists on and performs operations on the user
computing device 110.       In certain embodiments, the user 101 must install the delivery
application 115 and/or make a feature selection on the user computing device 110 to obtain
the benefits of the techniques described herein. In an example embodiment, the user 101
may access the delivery application 115 on the user computing device 110 via a user
interface. In an example embodiment, a user 101 signs in to the delivery application 115,
which enables the user 101 to interact with the package delivery system 140, a kiosk 130 a
merchant system, or other system to arrange, alter, or cancel the delivery of a product.
[0034]          An example package delivery system 140 comprises a web server 144 and a
data storage unit 147.      In an example embodiment, the package delivery system 140
communicates with the user device 110, merchant systems, other package delivery systems,
or any other person, group, or system that delivers or receives packages.        In an example
embodiment, user device 110 has a delivery application 115 distributed by the package
delivery system 140 that enables the user 101 to access an account or information about a
package.     In another example embodiment, the user 101 accesses an account via the
communication application 112 of the user device 110. In an example embodiment, when the
user 101 accesses his account via the delivery application 115 or communication application
112, the web server 144 logs user device 110 location data.
[0035]          The package delivery system 140 may represent any system that delivers or
receives packages. For example, the package delivery system 140 may be a courier, a
merchant system, a retailer, a shipping company, a postal service, or any suitable system.
[0036]          The aerial delivery device 120 may be a drone or other unmanned vehicle.
The aerial delivery device 120 may be helicopter, quadcopter, or other aerial delivery device.
In alternative embodiments, a device other than an aerial delivery device can be utilized,
                                                 6

which does not deliver packages via flight. For example, a wheeled vehicle or other vehicle
that delivers packages without flight may be used.
[0037]          In an example, the non-flying delivery device may utilize wheels, articulated
legs, or any suitable means for propulsion. The non-flying delivery device may drive to a
location, scan for the QR code 103, and proceed to the QR code 103 by rolling, walking, or
via any suitable propulsion. The non-flying delivery device may deposit the package via an
articulated arm, a conveyor belt, or any other suitable means.
[0038]          The aerial delivery device 120 employs an aerial delivery device computing
system 121.     The aerial delivery device computing system 121 comprises the hardware,
software, and other devices for communications, navigations, image capturing, image
processing, and any other suitable computerized or automated functions.
[0039]          The aerial delivery device computing system 121 comprises a communication
application 122, an optical detection module 124, and a data storage unit 123.     The aerial
delivery device computing system 121 may utilize a communication application 122 to
receive instructions for package deliveries.        For example, the aerial delivery device
computing system 121 may receive, via the communication application 122, delivery
addresses, GPS locations, package details, or other delivery information. The aerial delivery
device computing system 121 may utilize the data storage unit 123 for storing the
information received via the communication application, and other suitable data.
[0040]          The optical detection module 124 may be a video camera or a still camera that

[0043]          The kiosk 130 may be a storage kiosk comprising compartments that are
locked and controlled by a kiosk computing system 131. Alternatively, the compartments
may be accessible by a key, combination, or other suitable access system. The kiosk 130
may have a user interface that allows a user 101 to enter access codes, personal identification
codes, delivery information, or any suitable information. The kiosk 130 may store a package
for a user 101 until the user 101 is available to retrieve the package.   The kiosk 130 may
utilize automated machinery for transporting a package to a particular compartment.        The
kiosk may utilize automated doors for the bay door or other suitable doors that open
automatically to receive the package, provide access to the user 101, or for other suitable
purposes. The kiosk 130 may employ barcode scanners, QR code scanners, optical character
recognition technology, or other suitable technology for determining the identity of a
package.     The kiosk 130 may a scanner or other optical reading device for capturing
information from a label on the package, a sticker on the package, printed data, or any
suitable available information.
[0044]          In an example embodiment, the kiosk 130 may open a by door to receive a
package after exchanging appropriate communications with the aerial delivery device 120.
The aerial delivery device 120 hovers over the open bay door and deposits the package in to
open bay door. The aerial delivery device 120 may deposit the package by detaching a hook
or other retention device and allowing the package to drop away from the aerial delivery
device 120. The package drops into a compartment in the kiosk 131. The bin is locked and
is available to be accessed by the user 101 for retrieval of the package.
[0045]          The kiosk 130 employs a kiosk computing system 131. The kiosk computing
system 131 comprises the hardware, software, and other devices for communications,
package handling, door controls, user interfaces, image capturing, image processing, and any
other suitable computerized or automated functions.
[0046]          The kiosk computing system 131 may utilize a communication application
132 to receive instructions for package deliveries. For example, the kiosk 130 may receive
via the communication application 132, delivery addresses, user 101 identification, user 101
authentication information, package details, or other delivery information. The kiosk 130
may use the communication application 132 to communicate with the aerial delivery device
120 for package deliveries. The kiosk 130 may utilize the data storage unit 133 for storing
the information received via the communication application 132, and other suitable data.
[0047]          It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are example and
other means of establishing a communications link between the computers and devices can
                                                8

disclosure will appreciate that the user computing device 110, the aerial delivery device 120,
the kiosk 130, and the package delivery system 140 illustrated in Figure 1 can have any of
several other suitable computer system configurations.        For example, a user computing
device 110 embodied as a mobile phone or handheld computer may or may not include all the
components described above.
Example Processes
[0048]           The example methods illustrated in Figures 2-7 are described hereinafter with
respect to the components of the example operating environment 100. The example methods
of Figures 2-7 may also be performed with other systems and in other environments.
[0049]           Figure 2 is a block diagram depicting a method 200 for an aerial delivery
device 120 to relocate a package from a kiosk 130, in accordance with certain example
embodiments. The method 200 is described with reference to the components illustrated in
Figure 1.
[0050]           In block 205, a user 101 selects a package kiosk 130 for delivery of a package.
The package may be any product for delivery to user 101, a merchant system, or other
recipient.   The package may be a product shipped from a merchant system, shipped from
another user 101, shipped from a manufacturer, or may be shipped from any suitable shipper.
The user 101 may select a delivery kiosk 130 via the delivery application 115 on the user
computing device 110. In an alternate embodiment, the user 101 may select the kiosk 130 on
a website of the package delivery service 140. In an alternate embodiment, the user 101 may
select the kiosk 130 from a merchant system, such as at the time of entering delivery
information while ordering a product. Any suitable application or method may be used by
the user 101 to select a delivery kiosk 130.
[0051]           In block 210, a package is delivered to a selected kiosk. The details of block
210 are described in greater detail in the method 210 with respect to Figure 3.
[0052]           Figure 3 is a block diagram depicting a method 210 for a package to be
delivered to a selected kiosk, in accordance with certain example embodiments, as referenced
in block 210 of Figure 2. The method 210 is described with reference to the components
illustrated in Figure 1.
[0053]           In block 305, a package is assigned for delivery. The details of block 305 are
described in greater detail in the method 305 with respect to Figure 4.
[0054]           Figure 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 305 for the package
delivery service to assign a package for delivery, in accordance with certain example
                                                 9

embodiments. The method 305 is described with reference to the components illustrated in
Figure 1.
[0055]          In block 405, a package delivery system 140 receives a package for delivery.
The package delivery system 140 may be any system, company, organization, government
service, or individual that delivers packages from one entity to another. For example, the
package delivery system 140 may be a courier, postal service, package delivery company, a
merchant system, a retailer, or any other suitable system that delivers packages. The package
for delivery arrives at the package delivery system 140 with appropriate paperwork for
delivery to a kiosk 130. The paperwork may be in the form of digital information, a barcode,
or other machine-readable code, a sticker, or any suitable paperwork comprising purchase
information. The paperwork may contain a user 101 name, a user address, an address of the
delivery kiosk 130, a confirmation number, a sender name and address, and/or other
identifying information.
[0056]          The delivery information associated with the package also comprises a kiosk
130 specified for delivery. The kiosk 130 information may comprise an address or other
location information for the kiosk 130, a description of the capabilities of the kiosk 130, an
availability of compartments in the kiosk 130, compartment sizes, and other suitable
information.
[0057]          In block 410, a destination address of the kiosk 130 is associated with
package. For example, the package delivery system 140 obtains the address of the kiosk 130
from the paperwork associated with the package.          The delivery address is stored with
identification of the package in the package delivery system 140. The delivery address may
be a street address, a global positioning system ("GPS") location, or other suitable address
data. Additionally, the delivery address may include directions to locate the kiosk 130 on the
property at the address. For example, if the kiosk 130 is located near the northwest corner of
a retail business, then the delivery address may include that exact location in the delivery
address data. In a certain example embodiment, the package delivery system 140 identifies
the kiosk 130 nearest to the address of the user 101 and selects the identified kiosk 130 as the
delivery kiosk 130.
[0058]          In block 415, the package delivery system 140 associates the package with an
aerial delivery device 120. The package delivery system 140 may identify an aerial delivery
device 120 that is associated with a delivery area in which the kiosk address is located. For
example, certain aerial delivery devices 120 may be assigned a delivery route that
encompasses a particular geographic region.         If the kiosk address is located in that
                                                10

geographic region then the package may be associated with that particular aerial delivery
device 120. In an alternate embodiment, the package is associated with the aerial delivery
device 120 that is next in a queue of aerial delivery devices 120.
[0059]          In block 420, the instructions for delivery of the package are provided to the
aerial delivery device computing system 121.        In an example embodiment, the instructions
are delivered to the communication application 122 of the aerial delivery device computing
system 121 via near field communication, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or any available communication.
The instructions may be transmitted to the aerial delivery device computing system 121 by a
computing system associated with the package delivery system 140.            In an example, an
operator of the package delivery system 140 may direct a computing system to deliver the
instructions, or the operator may enter the instructions directly into a user interface of the
aerial delivery device computing system 121.          Any suitable manner of transmitting the
instructions to the aerial delivery device computing system 121 may be used.
[0060]          The package delivery system 140 provides to the aerial delivery device
computing system 121 an address for the kiosk 130.           In another example, the package
delivery system provides a GPS location to the aerial delivery device.         Additionally, the
aerial delivery device computing system 121 is provided with instructions for communicating
with the kiosk computing system 131 upon arrival, such as the preferred communication
technology, an authorization code, or any other suitable information.        Any other suitable
instructions that will allow the aerial delivery device to locate the delivery location may be
used.
[0061]          From block 420, the method 210 returns to block 310 of Figure 3.
[0062]          Returning to Figure 3, in block 310, the package is loaded onto the aerial
delivery device 120. The package may be loaded in in any suitable manner that allows the
aerial delivery device 120 to transport the package to the delivery location. For example, the
aerial delivery device 120 may be equipped with a platform for supporting the package
during transit. In another example, the aerial delivery device 120 may support the package
with a strap, a hook, an attached net, or with any suitable attachment device. The package
may be loaded with an automated packaging process. In this example, the aerial delivery
device 120 may be positioned under an automated package sorter that drops the package from
a sorting chute. The package drops onto a platform of the aerial delivery device 120 that
supports packages for transfer to delivery locations.       Alternatively, the package may be
loaded manually by an operator at the package delivery system 140.           The aerial delivery
                                                 11

device computing system 121 may receive a digital confinnation of the package's
identification from an operator or a computing system of the package delivery system 140.
[0063]          In block 230 of Figure 3, the aerial delivery device 120 transports the package
to the kiosk address associated with the delivery. For example the aerial delivery device 120
may fly to the address via a predetermined route.        The aerial delivery device computing
system 121 may use a mapping program to proceed to the address. The aerial delivery device
computing system 121 may utilize a global positioning system ("GPS") technology for
locating the address of user 101. The aerial delivery device 120 may be transported a portion
of the distance to the delivery address by a separate vehicle. For example, a delivery truck
may deliver multiple aerial delivery devices 120 to a location that is central to multiple kiosk
delivery addresses. The aerial delivery device 120 then leaves the delivery truck and travels
the remaining distance with the package.
[0064]          In an example embodiment, the aerial delivery device 120 arrives at the
address of the kiosk 130 when the aerial delivery device 120 is on or above the street directly
in front of the kiosk at the address. In another example, the aerial delivery device 120 hovers
over the property located at the address.
[0065]          In block 235, the aerial delivery device computing system 121 alerts the kiosk
130 of arrival. The aerial delivery device computing system 121 communicates wirelessly
with the kiosk computing system 131.         The communication application 122 of the aerial
delivery device computing system 121 may use a communication technology such as near
field   communication      ("NFC"), Wi-Fi,     Bluetooth,   RFID,   cellular,  or any    suitable
communication technology. The preferred communication technology for a particular kiosk
computing system 131 may be included in the delivery instructions received from the
package delivery service 140. The communication application 132 of the kiosk computing
system 131 and the communication application 122 of the aerial delivery device computing
system 121 may exchange authentication information or other information to verify the
delivery information.
[0066]          In block 240, the aerial delivery device 120 deposits the package. Block 240
is described in greater detail in the method 240 of Figure 5.
[0067]          Figure 5 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 240 for an aerial delivery
device 120 to deposit a package to a kiosk 130, in accordance with certain example
embodiments, as referenced in Figure 5. The method 240 is described with reference to the
components illustrated in Figure 1.
                                                12

[0068]          In block 505, the kiosk 130 receives the alert of the package arrival from the
aerial delivery device computing system 121. The aerial delivery device computing system
121 transmits, over the communication technology, a message that an expected package has
arrived and is available for deposit into the kiosk 130.     The kiosk computing system 131
transmits an acknowledgment that the package is at the appropriate kiosk 130.         The kiosk
computing system 131 may receive the package information from aerial delivery device
computing system 121 and confirm the delivery information for the package. For example,
the kiosk computing system 131 may communicate with the package delivery service 140 or
the user computing device 110 to verify that the package is configured to be delivered to the
kiosk 130.
[0069]          In block 510, the kiosk computing system 131 provides instructions for
depositing the package. For example, the kiosk computing system 131 may provide to the
aerial delivery device computing system 121 an approach route to the kiosk from the street
that will provide the safest flight path. In another example, the kiosk computing system 131
provides instructions for locating the package receiving bay of the kiosk 130.            In an
alternative embodiment, the kiosk computing system 131 may provide a continuous wireless
signal to the aerial delivery device computing system 121 that will guide the aerial delivery
device 120 to the kiosk 130 location. In another example, the kiosk computing system 131
provides information regarding procedures required to deposit a package into the bay.
[0070]          In block 515, the kiosk 130 opens the bay for receiving the package. The bay
may be a landing pad on the kiosk 130, a chute for receiving the package, a retractable door,
or any suitable receptacle for receiving the package. The bay may be opened or otherwise
prepared by activating a mechanical door, an automated landing platform, or any suitable
mechanism.
[0071]          In block 520, the aerial delivery device 120 deposits the package into the bay.
[0072]          For example, the aerial delivery device 120 may hover over the bay and lower
the package via a retractable line or cable into the bay of the kiosk 130. The aerial delivery
device 120 may release the line or cable by transmitting a communication to a clasp, hook, or
other device to release. The aerial delivery device 120 may proceed to move away from the
bay with the package no longer attached, or the line or cable may retract into the aerial
delivery device 120 with the package no longer attached.        In another example, the aerial
delivery device 120 hovers over the delivery platform and releases the package allowing the
package to drop to a delivery platform or into the bay. The aerial delivery device 120 may
deposit the package in any suitable manner.
                                                 13

[0073]          The bay may employ a platform for receiving the package instead of an open
chute or bay. After receiving the package on a platform, the kiosk 130 transports the package
inside the kiosk 130. For example, the kiosk computing system 131 may activate a conveyor
belt or other mechanical means to transport the package.
[0074]          In block for 425, the kiosk 130 deposits the package into the appropriate
package bin.     For example, the kiosk computing system 131 employees an automated
mechanical means for transporting the package to the appropriate bin. The kiosk computing
system 131 may utilize a series of conveyor belts, electro-hydraulic grabbers, robotic
handling equipment, automated storage and retrieval systems, or other means of transporting
the package into the appropriate bin.
[0075]          From block 525, the method 230 returns to block 215 of Figure 2.
[0076]          Returning to Figure 2, in block 215, the user 101 requests a delivery
destination change. The user 101 requests that the package be delivered to a different kiosk
130 for retrieval by the user 101. The user 101 may desire a change of delivery kiosk 130 for
any suitable reason. For example, the user 101 may not be able to reach the location of the
original kiosk 130 because of a change in the work schedule of the user 101.         In another
example, the user 101 may realize that an error was made in the original kiosk 130 selection.
[0077]          In an example, the user 101 accesses the delivery application 115 on the user
computing device 110 and selects an option to change the delivery kiosk 130. The user 101
may actuate a user interface object and select a new kiosk 130 location from a list of kiosks
130. In another example, the user 101 may access a webpage of the package delivery service
140 and select the option to change the delivery kiosk 130. In another example, the user 101
requests the change in the delivery kiosk 130 to a merchant system or other product shipper
and the change is submitted to the package delivery system 140 by the merchant system. In
another example, the user 101 submits a verbal request for the change in the delivery kiosk
130. Any suitable manner of requesting the change in the delivery kiosk 130 may be used.
[0078]          In block 217, the instructions for retrieval of the package are provided to the
aerial delivery device computing system 121.       In an example embodiment, the instructions
are delivered to the communication application 122 of the aerial delivery device computing
system 121 via near field communication, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or any available communication.
The instructions may be transmitted to the aerial delivery device computing system 121 by
the package delivery system 140. In an alternate embodiment, the instructions for retrieval of
the package are provided to the aerial delivery device computing system 121 by the by the
communication application 132 of the kiosk computing system 131, by a merchant system, or
                                                14

by any suitable party. Any suitable manner of transmitting the instructions to the aerial
delivery device computing system 121 may be used.
[0079]          The package delivery system 140, or other party, provides the aerial delivery
device computing system 121 with an address for the first kiosk 130. In another example, the
package delivery system provides a GPS location to the aerial delivery device computing
system 121. Additionally, the aerial delivery device computing system 121 is provided with
instructions for communicating with the kiosk computing system 131 upon arrival, such as
the preferred communication technology, an authorization code, or any other suitable
information.    Any other suitable instructions that will allow the aerial delivery device
computing system 121 to locate the delivery location may be used.
[0080]          In block 220, the aerial delivery device 120 retrieves the package from the
kiosk 130. Block 220 is described in greater detail in the method 220 of Figure 6.
[0081]          Figure 6 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 220 for an aerial delivery
device 120 to retrieve a package from a kiosk 130, in accordance with certain example
embodiments. The method 220 is described with reference to the components illustrated in
Figure 1.
[0082]          In block 603, the kiosk computing system 131 receives a notification that a
package will be picked up for a return. In an example, the package delivery system 140
provides a communication to the communication application 132 of the kiosk computing
system 131 that a package will be retrieved by an aerial delivery device 120 at a specific date
and time. The communication may be provided via any suitable communication technology
such as an Internet connection over the network 105, via a wireless communication, via
cellular, or any suitable technology.          The communication may provide a package
identification, an aerial delivery device 120 identification, or any suitable information. The
communication may provide instructions to the kiosk 130 for preparing the package for
return. For example, the communication may provide the manner of retrieval by the drone
and suitable instructions for placement of the package for retrieval.
[0083]          The kiosk computing system 131           stores the provided information in
anticipation of the arrival of the delivery device 120.
[0084]          In block 605, the kiosk computing system 131 receives the alert of the arrival
of the aerial delivery device 120. The aerial delivery device computing system 121 transmits,
over the communication technology, a message that an expected aerial delivery device 120
has arrived and is available to retrieve a scheduled package.     The kiosk computing system
131 transmits an acknowledgment that the aerial delivery device 120 is at the appropriate
                                                 15

kiosk 130.     The kiosk computing system 131 may receive the retrieval information from
aerial delivery device computing system 121 and confirm the retrieval information for the
package. For example, the kiosk computing system 131 may communicate with the package
delivery service 140 or the user computing device 110 to verify that the package is
configured to be retrieved from the kiosk 130.
[0085]          In block 607, the kiosk computing system 131 compares package retrieval
information with stored information. For example, the kiosk computing system 131 receives
the retrieval information from aerial delivery device computing system 121 and confirms the
retrieval information for the package.    The kiosk computing system 131 assesses the stored
retrieval information received from the package delivery service 140 and compares the
information the information received from the aerial delivery device computing system 121.
[0086]          In an alternate example, the kiosk computing system 131 may communicate
with the package delivery service 140 or the user computing device 110 to verify that the
package is configured to be retrieved from the kiosk 130. In an alternate example, the kiosk
computing system 131 has not previously received the retrieval information and only uses the
retrieval information provided by the aerial delivery device computing system 121.
[0087]          In block 610, the package is prepared for return.     The package is retrieved
from the appropriate package bin.       For example, the kiosk 130 employs an automated
mechanical means for transporting the package from the appropriate bin. The kiosk 130 may
utilize a series of conveyor belts, electro-hydraulic grabbers, robotic handling equipment,
automated storage and retrieval systems, or other means of transporting the package from the
appropriate bin and to a position for retrieval by the aerial delivery device 120.       In an
example, the package is positioned on a platform associated with the bay.           In another
example, the package is positioned on a separate retrieval platform, or in any suitable
position. In certain embodiments, the kiosk computing system 131 provides the package with
new, written delivery information. For example, the kiosk 130 may apply a new sticker to
the package with the destination address of the new delivery kiosk 130.       In an example, a
printer installed within the kiosk 130 is provided instructions by the kiosk computing system
131 to print a new destination address onto the surface of a package. The package may be
positioned before the printer by a mechanically actuated system, such as a conveyor belt.
The printer sprays, prints, or in any suitable manner applies the destination address to the
surface of the positioned package.
[0088]          In block 615, the kiosk computing system 131 provides instructions for
retrieving the package.     For example, the kiosk computing system 131 may provide an
                                                16

approach route to the kiosk from the street that will provide the safest flight path. In another
example, the kiosk computing system 131 provides instructions for locating the package
receiving bay of the kiosk 130. In an alternative embodiment, the kiosk computing system
131 may provide a continuous wireless signal to the aerial delivery device computing system
121 that will guide the aerial delivery device 120 the kiosk 130 location. In another example,
the kiosk computing system 131 provides information regarding procedures required to
retrieve a package from the bay.
[0089]          In block 620, aerial delivery device 120 retrieves the package from the kiosk
130. In an example, the kiosk 130 opens the bay to allow the aerial delivery device 120 to
access the package. The bay may be a landing pad on the kiosk 130, a chute for receiving the
package, a retractable door, or any suitable receptacle for retrieving the package. The bay
may be opened or otherwise prepared by activating a mechanical door, an automated landing
platform, or any suitable mechanism. In the example, the aerial delivery device 120 lands on
the platform associated with the bay and secures the package. The package may be loaded on
the aerial delivery device 120 in in any suitable manner that allows the aerial delivery device
120 to transport the package to the new delivery location. For example, the aerial delivery
device 120 may be equipped with a platform for supporting the package during transit. In
another example, the aerial delivery device 120 may support the package with a strap, a hook,
an attached net, or with any suitable attachment device. The package maybe loaded with an
automated packaging process. The aerial delivery device computing system 121 may receive
a digital confirmation of the package's identification from the kiosk computing system 131.
[0090]          From block 620, the method 220 returns to block 225 of Figure 2.
[0091]          Returning to Figure 2, in block 225, the instructions for delivery of the
package are provided to the aerial delivery device computing system 121.          In an example
embodiment, the instructions are delivered to the communication application 122 of the aerial
delivery device computing system 121 via near field communication, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or
any available communication by the package delivery system 140. The instructions may be
provided at any time during the retrieval process. For example, the instructions for delivering
the package may be provided at the time that the retrieval instructions were provided. In an
alternate embodiment, the instructions for delivery of the package are provided to the aerial
delivery device computing system 121 by the by the communication application 132 of the
kiosk 130, by a merchant system, or by any suitable party.            Any suitable manner of
transmitting the instructions to the aerial delivery device computing system 121 may be used.
                                                 17

[0092]          The package delivery system 140, or other party, provides the aerial delivery
device computing system 121 with an address for the new kiosk 130. In another example, the
package delivery system provides a GPS location to the aerial delivery device computing
system 121. Additionally, the aerial delivery device computing system 121 is provided with
instructions for communicating with the kiosk computing system 131 upon arrival, such as
the preferred communication technology, an authorization code, or any other suitable
information.    Any other suitable instructions that will allow the aerial delivery device
computing system 121 to locate the delivery location may be used.
[0093]          In certain embodiments, the aerial delivery device 120 delivers the package
back to the package delivery service 140.       The package is assigned to a different aerial
delivery device for delivery to the second kiosk 130.
[0094]          In block 230, the aerial delivery device 120 transports the package to the new
kiosk 130 address associated with the delivery. For example the aerial delivery device 120
may fly to the address via a predetermined route.        The aerial delivery device computing
system 121 may use a mapping program to proceed to the address. The aerial delivery device
computing system 121 may utilize a global positioning system ("GPS") technology for
locating the address of user 101. The aerial delivery device 120 may be transported a portion
of the distance to the delivery address by a separate vehicle. For example, a delivery truck
may deliver multiple aerial delivery devices 120 to within a location that is central to
multiple delivery addresses. The aerial delivery device 120 then leaves the delivery truck
and travels the remaining distance with the package.
[0095]          In an example embodiment, the aerial delivery device 120 arrives at the
address of the kiosk when the aerial delivery device 120 is on or above the street directly in
front of the kiosk at the address. In another example, the aerial delivery device 120 hovers
over the property located at the address.
[0096]          In block 235, the aerial delivery device 120 alerts the kiosk computing system
131 of arrival. The aerial delivery device computing system 121 communicates wirelessly
with the kiosk computing system 131.         The communication application 122 of the aerial
delivery device computing system 121 may use a communication technology such as near
field  communication       ("NFC"), Wi-Fi,     Bluetooth,  RFID,    cellular,  or any   suitable
communication technology.       The preferred communication technology may be included in
the   delivery   instructions  received   from the package      delivery service   140.     The
communication application 132 of the kiosk computing system 131 and the communication
                                                18

application   122 of the aerial delivery device computing system 121 may exchange
authentication information or other information to verify the delivery information.
[0097]          In block 240, the aerial delivery device 120 deposits the package. Block 240
is described in greater detail in the method 240 of Figure 5 as described herein.
[0098]          In block 245, the user 101 enters authentication information into the user
interface the kiosk computing system 131. In an example, the kiosk computing system 131,
the aerial delivery device computing system 121, the package delivery service 140, a
merchant system, or other suitable party alerts the user computing device 110 that the
package is available for retrieval at the kiosk 130. The user 101 approaches the kiosk 130
and accesses the user interface. The user interface of the kiosk computing system 131 may
be a touchscreen interface, an alphanumeric keypad, a voice activated interface, or other
suitable user interface. The user 101 enters an authentication code to access the kiosk bin.
The authentication code maybe a code is associated with the user 101 such as a password or
personal identification number. The code may be configured for use by the user 101 for all
package retrievals. Alternatively, the code may be a single use code that was established at
the time of the delivery arrangement.
[0099]          In block 250, if the user code is authenticated then the kiosk computing
system 131 grants access to the user 101 to be appropriate bin. In an example, the kiosk
computing system 131 transmits a signal to the locking device of the bin causing the bin to
open. In another example, the user interface of the kiosk computing system 131 provides
information, such as a combination code, allowing the user 101 to open the bin. Any other
suitable manner of allowing the user 101 access to the bin may be used.
[00100]         The user 101 retrieves the package from the bin. The kiosk computing system
131 logs the retrieval of the package by the user 101.        The kiosk computing system 131
notifies the package delivery system 140, the user computing device 110, a merchant system,
or other suitable party that the package has been retrieved.
[00101]         Figure 7 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 700 for an aerial delivery
device 120 to return a package from a kiosk 130 to the package delivery system 140, in
accordance with certain example embodiments. The method 700 is described with reference
to the components illustrated in Figure 1.
[00102]         In certain situations, the user 101 or another party desires that the package be
returned to the package delivery system 140 instead of to another kiosk 130. For example, if
a user 101 is returning a package to a merchant system or a retailer, then the package may be
returned via the package delivery system 140.        In another example, the package delivery
                                                 19

system 140 delivered a package to an incorrect recipient.        In the example, the package
received in incorrect label and the package was delivered to a user 101 that was not the
intended recipient.   The user 101 may be instructed to return the package to the package
delivery system 140. The package may be returned to the package delivery system 140 for
any other suitable reason.
[00103]         In block 705, the user 101 selects a package for return. The user 101 requests
that the package be returned from a kiosk 130. The user 101 may desire a return from the
kiosk 130 for any suitable reason. For example, the user 101 may have determined that the
package did not contain the product that was expected. In another example, the user 101 may
realize that an error was made and that the product was intended for a different user.
[00104]         In an example, the user 101 accesses the delivery application 115 on the user
computing device 110 and selects an option to return the package from a kiosk 130. The user
101 may actuate a user interface object and select an option to return the package from a
particular kiosk 130 from a list of kiosks 130. In another example, the user 101 may access a
webpage of the package delivery service 140 and select a similar option. In another example,
the user 101 requests a return on a merchant system or other product shipper and the return
request is submitted to the package delivery system 140 by the merchant system. In another
example, the user 101 submits a verbal request for the return.        Any suitable manner of
requesting the return of the package to the kiosk 130 may be used.
[00105]         In block 710, the user 101 deposits the package in the package kiosk 130 if the
package had previously been retrieved from the kiosk 130 or if the user 101 otherwise has
possession of the product.     In a certain example embodiment, the user 101 purchased a
product at a merchant location and later requested to return the product. In this example, the
user 101 did not receive the product at the kiosk 130, but the user 101 desires to utilize the
kiosk 130 for the return of the package.     The user 101 may be instructed by the payment
delivery service 140 or another party to return the package to the kiosk 130.     The user 101,
the payment delivery service 140, or another party may select the appropriate kiosk 130.
[00106]         Upon approaching      the kiosk 130, the user 101        enters authentication
information into the user interface the kiosk computing system 131. In an example, the kiosk
computing system 131, the aerial delivery device computing system 121, the package
delivery service 140, a merchant system, or other suitable party alerts the user computing
device 110 that the package is being returned at the kiosk 130. The user 101 approaches the
kiosk 130 and accesses the user interface. The user interface of the kiosk computing system
131 may be a touchscreen interface, an alphanumeric keypad, a voice activated interface, or
                                               20

other suitable user interface. The user 101 enters an authentication code to access the kiosk
bin.   The authentication code maybe a code is associated with the user 101 such as a
password or personal identification number. The code may be configured for use by the user
101 for all package retrievals. Alternatively, the code may be a single use code that was
established at the time of the delivery arrangement.
[00107]         The user code is authenticated then the kiosk computing system 131 grants
access to the user 101 to be appropriate bin. In an example, the kiosk computing system 131
transmits a signal to the locking device of the bin causing the bin to open. In another
example, the user interface of the kiosk computing system 131 provides information, such as
a combination code, allowing the user 101 to open the bin. Any other suitable manner of
allowing the user 101 access to the bin may be used. The user 101 deposits the package in
the accessed bin of the kiosk 130.
[00108]         In another embodiment, the user 101 has does not have possession of the
package. In the example, the package has never been retrieved from the kiosk 130 and is
residing in the appropriate bin. In this example, the user 101 does not need to return the
package to the kiosk 130.
[00109]         In block 715, the aerial delivery device 120 receives instructions to retrieve
the package from the package kiosk 130. The instructions for retrieval of the package are
provided to the aerial delivery device computing system 121 by the package delivery service
140.    In an example embodiment, the instructions are delivered to the communication
application 122 of the aerial delivery device computing system 121 via near field
communication, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or any available communication. The instructions may be
transmitted to the aerial delivery device computing system 121 by the package delivery
system 140. In an alternate embodiment, the instructions for delivery of the package are
provided to the aerial delivery device computing system 121 by the by the communication
application 132 of the kiosk computing system 131, by a merchant system, or by any suitable
party. Any suitable manner of transmitting the instructions to the aerial delivery device
computing system 121 may be used.
[00110]         The package delivery system 140, or other party, provides the aerial delivery
device computing system 121 with an address for the kiosk 130. In another example, the
package delivery system provides a GPS location to the aerial delivery device computing
system 121. Additionally, the aerial delivery device computing system 121 is provided with
instructions for communicating with the kiosk computing system 131 upon arrival, such as
the preferred communication technology, an authorization code, or any other suitable
                                               21

information.    Any other suitable instructions that will allow the aerial delivery device
computing system 121 to locate the delivery location may be used.
[00111]         In block 220, the aerial delivery device 120 retrieves the package. The details
of block 220 are described in greater detail in the method 220 of Figure 6 as described herein.
[00112]         In block 720, the aerial delivery device 120 returns the package to the package
delivery system 140. The aerial delivery device 120 may deliver the package to a warehouse
or other facility associated with the package delivery system 140. In another embodiment,
the aerial delivery device 120 delivers the package to a vehicle associated with the package
delivery system 140, such as a delivery truck. In another embodiment, the aerial delivery
device 120 delivers the package to a merchant system or other product shipper. Any suitable
method for returning the package may be utilized.
