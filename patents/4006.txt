Cross Reference to Related Applications
[0001] The present application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No 2012379005,
which is the national phase application of International Patent Application
No PCT/US20121070031, which claims priority from US Provisional Application No 61/641509
filed 2 May 2012, US Provisional Application No 61/674435 filed 23 July 2012, and
US Provisional Application No 61/678355 filed 1 August 2012, the disclosures of which are
herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.
[0002] The disclosure of International Patent Application No PCT/US2012/020242            is also
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.
Background
[0003] The delivery of therapeutic agents for animals, for example humans, equines, bovines,
canines, felines, ovines, and porcines suffer from numerous serious disadvantages for a variety
of reasons.
[0004] Injectable formulations, which typically provide rapid onset of activity, are most preferably
administered in an environment of cleanliness to prevent infections entering the injection site.
But, this is difficult to ensure outside of a clinical setting. And cleanliness is nearly impossible to
ensure in a typical horse barn, farm, field or racetrack. Along with this rapid onset of activity, an
injectable therapeutic typically suffers from a relatively short and single-peaked Time versus
Blood Concentration profile.
[0005] Conventional oral dosing of animals also suffers from a variety of disadvantages. For
example, the animal can spit out the formulation, resulting in a loss of the full dosage. Also, if
administered by intubation, the bioavailability can vary considerably due to the inherent and
unique characteristics of each animal's digestive system, i.e., the amount of food in the animal's
stomach, the length of time since its last feeding, and the animal's levels of digestive enzymes,
which may vary due to other environmental conditions, etc. Also, the active ingredient in the oral
formulation is sometimes unstable. In some cases the active ingredient in an oral formulation
may be unstable because of the pH and/or digestive materials present in an animal's stomach.
Moreover, administering conventional oral dosages forms to an animal, e.g., a horse, creates the
risk of inadvertently dosing the human administrator with the drug substance.

                                                    3
[0006] Another disadvantage of many oral and injectable formulations is that those formulations
require administering a relatively high mass percentage ("mass%") of inactive material to the
animal. For example, many oral and injectable formulations comprise significant amounts of
carriers and/or excipients that provide no direct benefit to the animal. Many care providers
generally agree that animals should not consume unnecessary pharmaceutical substances.
Accordingly, it would be advantageous to minimize the amount of non-therapeutic materials
administered to an animal when providing the pharmaceutically active substance. For example,
when providing omeprazole to an animal in need thereof, many conventional formulations
comprise more than 50% of an inactive substance having no therapeutic effect. Conventional
oral formulations of omeprazole may also often suffer from the disadvantageous correlation
between bioavailability and the contents of the animal's stomach. For example, bioavailability
may be lessened on account of the animal having food present in its stomach.
[0007] Fast release pharmaceutical formulations have been disclosed in the art. These may
include multi-particulate fast disintegrating tablets as disclosed, for instance in U.S. Patent
6,596,311; the so-called rapidly dispersing "3-D platform", disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,471 ,992;
and pectin-based dissolvable films, such as disclosed in US2007/0042023. Immediate release
compositions are disclosed WO 2012/106058. Each of these disclosures is incorporated herein
by reference.
[0008] Still, there exists a need in the art to provide improved therapeutic methods for animals
(for example humans, equines, bovines, ovines, canines, felines and porcines) which obviate
many of the disadvantages and side effects of the commonly used injectable and oral
formulations.
[0009] There is also a need in the art to provide methods for the treatment of humans, equines,
bovines, canines, felines, ovines, and porcines equines with drug products which give an earlier
onset of action, reduce the number and severity of side effects, lessen the risk of infection at
injection sites, and mitigate the bioavailability issues incident to administering the drug via
absorption within the digestive tract of the animal.
[0010] There is a still another need in the art to provide methods which enable treatment of the
animal patient that provide more reliable and predictable clearance from the animal.
[0011] The invention disclosed here answers one or more of these needs discussed above.
The features, objects, and advantages of the disclosed invention will be apparent to those skilled
in the art from the description of the invention, and from the claims.
[0012] Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word
"comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the

                                                   4
inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the
exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.
[0013] Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which has been
included in the present specification is solely for the purpose of providing a context for the
present invention. It is not to be taken as an admission that any or all of these matters form part
of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present
invention as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this specification.
Summary of the Invention
[0014] The invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions for direct systemic introduction
(DSI), which are also known as DSI pharmaceutical compositions. DSI pharmaceutical
compositions may be used in both as human pharmaceutical compositions and veterinary
pharmaceutical compositions. Various DSI pharmaceutical compositions are described herein.
[0015] In one embodiment, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for direct
system introduction comprising: about 5-20 mass% bovine gelatin, about 5-20 mass% mannitol,
about 0-1 mass% of a surfactant, about 0-0.5 mass% of a flavorant, and about 60-90 mass% of
an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The pharmaceutical composition may comprise about
10-17 mass% bovine gelatin, about 10-17 mass% mannitol, and about 0-0.5 mass percent of a
surfactant. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition may comprise about 10-13 mass%
bovine gelatin, about 12-15 mass% mannitol, and about 0.1-0.3 mass% of a surfactant.
Omeprazole is one active pharmaceutical ingredient that may be formulation in a pharmaceutical
composition of the invention.
[0016] Another embodiment of the invention relates to a DSI pharmaceutical composition , such
as described herein, having a disintegration time of 5 seconds or less in deionized water
maintained at 37.00 ± 0.50C. A DS1 pharmaceutical composition of the invention may have a
disintegration time of 3 seconds or less in deionized water maintained at 37.00 ± 0.50C.
[0017] The invention also relates to a method of delivering an active pharmaceutical ingredient
to an animal comprising the step of placing a DSI pharmaceutical composition of the invention
into a mucosal cavity of an animal to be treated with the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The
invention also relates to various methods of treatment administering an active pharmaceutical
ingredient in this manner.

Detailed Description
[0021] Disclosed herein are pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating animals, for
example humans, equines, bovines, canines, felines, ovines, and porcines. Various
embodiments comprise administering an active pharmaceutical ingredient, also known as a
therapeutic agent, into the bloodstream of the animal by introducing it transdermally across the
animal's non-keratinous fibers, e.g., via the oral cavity, anal cavity, vaginal cavity, nasal cavity,
gingival mucosa, lingual mucosa, palatal mucosa, pharyngeal mucosa, sublingual mucosa,
and/or non-gastric mucosa. In various embodiments, a majority of the formulation may be
absorbed prior to reaching the gastric mucosa. In certain embodiments, the formulation may be
adapted for animals, for example humans, equines, bovines, canines, felines, ovines, and
porcines to dissolve in a relatively short period of time, e.g., 90 seconds or less.
[0022] In some embodiments, administering a DSI pharmaceutical composition of the invention
provides for faster onset of the therapy, diminished occurrences of the side-effects due to
nonuniformity of bioavailability of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and/or more accurate
dosing. In at least some embodiments, these features result in dose lowering. Further, in at
least some embodiments, such administration may result in a greater portion of the therapeutic
agent actually being directly introduced systemically into the circulatory system for its therapeutic
effect. For example, in the case of omeprazole, the DSI pharmaceutical compositions disclosed
herein provide an advantage because the bioavailability of omeprazole is not limited by the
presence of matter (e.g., food) in the animal's stomach. For example, the disclosed methods of
administering the active pharmaceutical ingredient omeprazole do not require fasting the
animals prior to administering omeprazole. And the bioavailability of omeprazole is not
compromised by the contents of the animal's stomach.
[0023] Also disclosed herein are methods for the treatment and control of various diseases
afflicting animals, for example equines, bovines, canines, felines, ovines, and porcines, with
improved safety for the both the animal and the person administering the therapeutic agent. In at

                                                    6
least certain exemplary embodiments, the compositions and methods are useful for
administration to humans. For example, disclosed herein are methods of treating
gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, dyspepsia, laryngopharyngeal
reflux, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, duodenal ulcers and/or preventing gastric ulcers (e.g., gastric
ulcers associated with NSAID therapy or Chrohn's disease) and/or controlling the production of
digestive fluids (e.g., gastric acids) and/or normalizing the pH of an animal's stomach comprising
administering a DS1 compound comprising one or more proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole
and/or any of its stereoisomers).
[0024] Administering therapeutic agents to the animal without needles, via the non-keratinous
tissues into a mucosal cavity, e.g., the oral cavity, anal cavity, vaginal cavity, nasal cavity,
gingival mucosa, lingual mucosa, palatal mucosa, pharyngeal mucosa, sublingual mucosa,
and/or non-gastric mucosa results in rapid onset of activity, more accurate dosing, lowered
dosing, an absence or diminishment of side-effects, and greater safety to both the animal and
the administrator of the formulation. In some cases the therapeutic agents may be administered
via the animal's oral cavity, anal cavity, vaginal cavity, nasal cavity, gingival mucosa, lingual
mucosa, palatal mucosa, pharyngeal mucosa, sublingual mucosa, and/or non-gastric mucosa.
[0025] As used herein, the term "oral cavity" means that portion of the alimentary canal from the
orifice conventionally referred to as the mouth, including, for example the area distally from the
mouth to the esophagus and all tissues including, for example under the tongue (sublingual), on
the top of the tongue, and/or between the cheek and gums (buccal), the mucal membranes,
epithelium, and gums.
[0026] As used herein, the term "non-gastric mucosa" refers to the pre-gastric mucosal cells,
e.g., oral mucosa, including the mucous membrane beneath the tongue, and/or the buccal
mucosa at the inside of the cheek and gum and absorption sites in the esopaghus.
[0027] As used herein, the term "pre-gastric" refers to all parts of the alimentary canal beginning
at the mouth and continuing to the juncture with the first secretory stomach.
[0028] As used herein, "Direct Systemic Introduction" ("DSI"), means administering one or more
therapeutically active agent directly to the circulatory system of an animal via a formulation
administered and absorbed across non-keratinous fibers, e.g., the oral cavity and/or the non
gastric mucosa. DSI may, in at least some embodiments, provide relatively high systemic
concentrations of the active agents, e.g. by allowing agents to pass directly into the systemic
circulation avoiding the destructive activities in the digestive tract by gastric breakdown,
metabolism in the wall of the GI tract and first pass metabolism by the liver. In one embodiment,
administering a DSI pharmaceutical composition comprises contacting the animal's first

                                                   7
secretory stomach with less than about 50% of the DSI pharmaceutical composition
administered to the animal.
[0029] DSI may result in higher systemic availability of therapeutic agents in the animal for their
desired therapeutic effects vis-a-vis products formulated in conventional oral delivery systems.
DSI provides advantages over traditional oral, intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous
routes of administration, in that more of the drug may be available systemically for its desired
therapeutic effects. For example, in equines, DSI can provide more rapid metabolic clearance of
the drug, resulting in a shortened withdrawal time to clear the animal for performance racing.
See, e.g., "Equine Drug Testing and Therapeutic Medication Regulation: 2009 Policy of the
National Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc." edited by Thomas Tobin &
Kent H. Stirling, which discusses the necessary withdrawal times for performance animals.
[0030] A DSI pharmaceutical composition of the invention disintegrates quickly in water. A DSI
pharmaceutical composition of the invention generally has a disintegration time of 7 seconds or
less in deionized water maintained at 37.00 ± 0.5 0 C. A DSI pharmaceutical composition of the
invention may have a disintegration time of 4 seconds or less in deionized water maintained at
37.00 C ± 0.50C.
[0031] The raid dissolution of the DS1 pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein allows
them to also dissolve rapidly when in contact with an animal's non-keratinous fibers/mucosal
cavity, for example, the oral cavity and/or the non-gastric mucosa. In some embodiments, the
formulations contemplated herein will dissolve when in contact with the animal's non-keratinous
fibers, e.g., the oral cavity and/or the non-gastric mucosa in about 90 seconds or less. In some
embodiments, the DSI pharmaceutical composition will dissolve in about 75 seconds or less,
such as in about 60 seconds or less, about 45 seconds or less, about 30 seconds or less, about
20 seconds or less, about 10 seconds or less or about 5 seconds or less. In some embodiments,
the DSI pharmaceutical composition dissolves in less than about 3 seconds.
[0032] A further benefit of the DSI dosing of an animal is that the person administering may be
able to more quickly titrate an appropriate dosage for the level and severity of the condition of
the animal. Using typical routes of administration, due to metabolic disposition and the overall
health of the animal, it may take a practitioner a period of several days to achieve an appropriate
dose to treat and control a condition. One advantage of a DSI pharmaceutical composition is
that the practitioner may reliably assume therapeutic effects within a short period of time, and
adjust the level of administration of the drug, as needed.
[0033] In at least some embodiments, DSI pharmaceutical compositions permit a shorter
withdrawal time from treatment than with some conventional oral dosing regimens. By way of

                                                   8
example only, typically, an equine patient will need to be withdrawn from many medications for
periods ranging from 24-72 hours prior to performance racing. This results in interruption of the
therapy, and can lead to a worsening of the existing disease, or at the least, a slower recovery
than if the withdrawal had not occurred. In many cases using DSI therapy, however, the equine
patient may only need to discontinue the therapy for a period as short as 0-12 hours or not at all,
depending upon the particular therapeutic agent being utilized in the methods of the present
disclosure.
[0034] In at least one exemplary embodiment, the methods herein are administered to the
circulatory system of the animal via a DSI pharmaceutical composition administered and
absorbed via the non-keratinous fibers/mucosal cavity, such as in the oral cavity and/or the non
gastric mucosa, adapted for humans, equines, bovines, canines, felines, ovines, and porcines,
resulting in rapid absorption of the active ingredient and faster clearance. Due to both
administration and absorption to the oral cavity and/or the non-gastric mucosa, the resultant
effect is DSI.
[0035] In some embodiments, the oral dissolution of the disclosed DSI pharmaceutical
compositions occurs without the addition of non-biological liquids or accelerants. For example,
the DSI pharmaceutical compositions may disintegrate rapidly upon contact with the animal's
biological fibers and/or biological fluids. In some embodiments, the DSI pharmaceutical
compositions may be administered without the need for any additional sources of accelerant,
dissolving agent, or contemporaneous drink.
[0036] In one embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical composition comprises a proton pump
inhibitor as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. As used in this application, the term "proton
pump inhibitor" (sometimes abbreviated "PPI") refers to a group of drugs that provide
pronounced and long-lasting reduction of gastric acid production. Without being bound by any
theory, proton pump inhibitors are believed to act by irreversibly blocking the
hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (often described in terms of "the
H+/K+ ATPase" or "gastric proton pump") of the gastric parietal cells. As used in this
application, the term proton pump inhibitor includes but is not limited to omeprazole,
lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, etc.
[0037] In one embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical composition comprises omeprazole. In one
embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical composition comprises micronized omeprazole. As used
herein, the term "micronized" means having an average particle diameter of between about 1 x
10-3 to about 1 x 10-7 meters. For example, in some embodiments the disclosed DSI

                                                    9
pharmaceutical compositions comprising omeprazole are formulated with micronized
omeprazole having an average particle diameter of about 1 to about 10 microns.
[0038] In one embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical composition comprises both a proton pump
inhibitor and an H2 blocker (also known as an H2 receptor antagonist). In one embodiment, the
DSI pharmaceutical composition comprises omeprazole and at least one compound chosen
from famotidine, cimetidine, ranitidine, and nizatidine.
[0039] One embodiment of the invention provides DSI pharmaceutical compositions comprising
greater than about 50 mass% of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, such as omeprazole. In
one embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical composition comprises greater than about 60 mass%
of omeprazole as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. In another embodiment, the DSI
pharmaceutical composition comprises greater than about 70 mass% of an active
pharmaceutical ingredient. In other embodiments, the DS1 pharmaceutical composition
comprises about 70-90 mass% of an active pharmaceutical ingredient or about 75-85 mass% of
an active pharmaceutical ingredient.
[0040] For example, a DS1 pharmaceutical composition o according to the invention may contain
about 5-25 mass% bovine gelatin, 5-25 mass% mannitol, about 0-1 mass% of a surfactant,
about 0-0.5 mass% of a flavorant and about 50-90 mass% of an active pharmaceutical
ingredient. A preferred DSI formulation contains about 5-20 or 10-15 mass% bovine gelatin,
about 5-20 or 10-15 mass% mannitol, about 0-0.7 mass% of a surfactant, about 0.001-0.4
mass% of a flavorant and about 65-85 mass% of anomeprazole. Also disclosed herein are
products produced by the above-described methods. In one embodiment the product produced
comprises about 70 mass% omeprazole. In one embodiment, a DSI pharmaceutical
composition of omeprazole according to the invention may contain about 5-25 mass% bovine
gelatin, 5-25 mass% mannitol, about 0-2 mass% of a surfactant, about 0-1 mass% of a flavorant
and about 60-90 mass% of omeprazole. A preferred DSI formulation contains about 10-15
mass% bovine gelatin, 10-15 mass% mannitol, about 0.001-0.7 mass% of a surfactant, about
0.001-0.4 mass% of a flavorant and about 65-85 mass% of omeprazole. Also disclosed herein
are products produced by the above-described methods. In one embodiment the product
produced comprises about 70 mass% omeprazole.
[0041] In at least one embodiment, the methods of treatment described herein comprise
administering the active ingredient (e.g., omeprazole) in a dehydrated form, such that the active
ingredient is rapidly and efficiently delivered to the animal's circulatory system upon contact with
the animal's natural biological fluids.

                                                  10
[0042] In one embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical composition provides a Tmax of less than
about 200 minutes. In another embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical composition provides a
Tmax of less than about 150 minutes. In another embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical
composition provides a Tmax of less than about 120 minutes. In another embodiment, the DSI
pharmaceutical composition provides a Tmax of less than about 100 minutes. In another
embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical composition provides a Tmax of less than about 80
minutes. In another embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical composition provides a Tmax of less
than about 60 minutes. In another embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical composition provides a
Tmax of less than about 50 minutes. In another embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical
composition provides a Tmax of less than about 40 minutes. In another embodiment, the DSI
pharmaceutical composition provides a Tmax of less than about 30 minutes.
[0043] In one embodiment, administering a DS1 pharmaceutical composition as disclosed
hereing provides a first Tmax and a second Tmax. As used herein the term "first Tmax" refers to
the first relative maximum for the blood concentration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient
following administering a DSI pharmaceutical composition comprising that active pharmaceutical
ingredient. As used herein the term "second Tmax" refers to the second relative maximum for
the blood concentration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient following administering a DSI
pharmaceutical composition comprising that active pharmaceutical ingredient. The first Tmax
occurs when a portion of the DSI pharmaceutical composition is absorbed via the non
keratinous fibers or in a mucosal cavity, for example in the mouth. The second Tmax then may
occur as the remainder of the DSI pharmaceutical composition is absoebed viw the gastro
intestinal (GI) tract. In one embodiment, the first Tmax is less than about 150 minutes. In
another embodiment, the first Tmax is less than about 120 minutes. In another embodiment, the
first Tmax is less than about 100 minutes. In another embodiment, the first Tmax is less than
about 80 minutes. In another embodiment, the first Tmax is less than about 60 minutes. In
another embodiment, the first Tmax is less than about 40 minutes. In one embodiment, the
second Tmax is less than about 200 minutes. In another embodiment, the second Tmax is less
than about 180 minutes. In another embodiment, the second Tmax is less than about 160
minutes. In another embodiment, the second Tmax is less than about 140 minutes. In another
embodiment, the second Tmax is less than about 120 minutes. In another embodiment, the
second Tmax is less than about 100 minutes.
[0044] In one embodiment, when the active pharmaceutical ingredient is omeprazole, one dose
of a DSI pharmaceutical composition provides a first Tmax and a second Tmax. In another
embodiment, one dose of an omeprazole DSI pharmaceutical composition provides a first Tmax

                                                  11
and a second Tmax. In another embodiment, a dose of an omeprazole DSI pharmaceutical
composition provides a first Tmax between about 30-60 minutes and a second Tmax between
about 120-160 minutes.
[0045] Disclosed herein are methods of controlling the production of digestive fluids, comprising
administering an above-described the DSI pharmaceutical composition comprising omeprazole
to an animal in need of treatment. In one embodiment, the animal is an equine. In another

[0055] Disclosed herein are methods of making a DSI pharmaceutical composition comprising
combining one or more active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) with one or more pharmaceutically
inactive compound(s) to form a pre-formulation, freezing the pre-formulation, reducing the
pressure surrounding the pre-formulation, and lyophilizing the pre-formulation. In one
embodiment, the method comprises combining one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients
with bovine gelatin and water to form a pre-formulation, freezing the pre-formulation, reducing
the pressure surrounding the pre-formulation, and lyophilizing the pre-formulation to form a DSI
pharmaceutical composition. In one embodiment, the method comprises combining one or more
active pharmaceutical ingredients with bovine gelatin and water and also adding at least one
compound chosen from mannitol, sucralose, a flavorant and a surfactant. In one embodiment,

                                                 14
the method comprises combining omeprazole with bovine gelatin, mannitol and water to form a
pre-formulation, adjusting the pH of that formulation to a basic pH (e.g., between about 8 to 9,
between about 9 to 10, or between about 10 to 11 and preferably between about 8-8.5, or 8.3),
freezing the pre-formulation, then reducing the pressure surrounding the pre-formulation and
lyophilizing the pre-formulation to form a DSI pharmaceutical composition. The preformulation
may also optionally contain a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, a flavorant and other
additives and excipients known in the pharmaceutical and veterinary arts. The components of
the pre-formulation may be dissolved together in a single solution or prepared as separate
solutions that are then combined to make the pre-formulation.
[0056] In one embodiment, the pre-formulation comprises omeprazole, bovine gelatin, mannitol,
and water in about the following relative proportions by mass: 40:7:6:200, respectively. For
example, an omeprazole preformulation may contain about 1-10 mass% bovine gelatin, 1-10
mass% mannitol, about 0-0.5 mass% of a surfactant, about 0-0.2 mass% of a flavorant, about
10-30 mass% of omeprazole and about 45-90 mass% deionized (DI) water. A preferred
preformulation contains about 3-5 mass% bovine gelatin, 3-5 mass% mannitol, about 0.1-0.3
mass% of a surfactant, about 0.05-0.15 mass% of a flavorant, about 15-25 mass% of
omeprazole and about 55-75 mass% DI water. The amount of omeprazole in a DSI
pharmaceutical composition of the invention many range from about 50 to 500 mg, preferably
from about 100 to 300 mg, or be about 200 mg. In one embodiment, the DSI pharmaceutical
composition produced by the above method has a mass% of omeprazole of between about 65
mass% - about 75 mass% omeprazole.
[0057] As mentioned above, pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants may be included in a DSI
pharmaceutical composition of the invention. Exemplary surfactants include, but are not limited
to, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), sodium docusate and PEG. For DSI pharmaceutical
compositions with omeprazole an anionic surfactant such as sodium docusate is generally
preferred. The surfactant aids in releasing the composition from a bubble pack, e.g., preventing
it from sticking to the package surface. Mixtures of surfactants may be used in a DSI
pharmaceutical composition of the invention.
[0058] Any flavorant used in pharmaceutical or veterinary formulations may be used. A mint
flavor is one example. Fruit flavorants, such as citrus or cherry, are another example.
[0059] Advantageously, in at least some embodiments, DSI pharmaceutical compositions
according to the disclosure may ensure complete and accurate dosing with less stress for both
the animal and the animal handler. Further, the methods of the disclosure may allow for higher
concentrations of active ingredients, thereby minimizing the need for multiple dosing.

                                                   15
[0060] Effective amounts may vary according to various factors, such as, but not limited to, the
general health of the animal, the degree or severity of the particular disease under treatment,
the age of the animal, the organs infected or infested, and the like. In at least one embodiment
of the therapeutic methods disclosed herein, the amount of the DSI pharmaceutical composition
is sufficient to provide therapeutic levels of the active ingredient as quickly as possible.
[0061] In one example, the active ingredient is omeprazole, the amount of said DSI
pharmaceutical composition administered is that sufficient to provide about 0.5 mg/kg to about
8.0 mg/kg of active ingredient per body weight of the animal and about 1.0 mg/kg to about 6.0
mg/kg, about 4.0 mg/kg of active ingredient per body weight of the animal, with an approximate
amount of about 5 - 700 mg omeprazole/dose, about 5 - 85 mg omeprazole/dose about 100
250 mg omeprazole/dose or about 350 - 550 mg omeprazole/dose, depending factors such as
whether a low dose formulation or high dose formulation is needed and upon the animal being
treated. For example, in humans omeprazole is administered in doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg.
[0062] In another embodiment, the method disclosed herein comprises administering less than
about 100 mg of omeprazole to the animal per day. In some embodiments, the methods
disclosed herein comprise administering between about 1 mg to about 100 mg of omeprazole
per day or between about 10 mg to about 80 mg of omeprazole per day. In some embodiments,
the methods disclosed herein comprise administering between about 25 mg to about 75 mg of
omeprazole per day.
[0063] In some embodiments, the methods and compositions of this disclosure comprise
controlling the pH of an animal's stomach. For example, this disclosure includes methods of
controlling the pH of an animal's stomach comprising administering omeprazole to an animal.
As used herein the term controlling means maintaining a pH range that is healthy for the animal;
maintaining does not necessarily include raising or lowering the pH to achieve the said healthy
pH range.
[0064] In a further exemplary embodiment, the active ingredient is omeprazole and the amount
of the DSI pharmaceutical composition administered is that sufficient to provide omeprazole at a
pH of greater than about 6. In other exemplary embodiments, omeprazole is administered to the
animal's non-keratinous fibers at a pH of about 10.
[0065] Animals suitable for treatment in the disclosed methods include homeothermic animals,
for example, humans, equine, bovine, ovine, porcine, caprine, canine, feline or the like animals.
For example, the disclosed methods would provide a benefit to any animal for whom the
metabolic disposition of an active pharmaceutical ingredient is found problematic, or for which
initial dose titration may pose risks, or which is otherwise undesirable.

                                                    16
[0066] The above disclosed doses and dosage ranges are not intended to be limiting. A
practitioner skilled in the art may likewise administer suitable DSI pharmaceutical compositions
(e.g., immediate or rapid release formulation) in single or divided doses, according to the desired
therapeutic effect. Thus, in certain clinical situations it may be desirable to administer
compositions to give initial high levels of the active ingredient, followed by lower dose
maintenance doses.
Examples
[0067] The preparation and characterization of DSI pharmaceutical compositions of the
invention are described below. The DSI pharmaceutical compositions described below were
characterized using the following tests:
[0068] Dry weight - Weights of ten units were measured individually using an analytical balance
to determine consistency of unit dosage.
[0069] Disinteqration Time - This test determined the speed of which a DSI unit disintegrate in
water maintained at 37.00 ± 0.5 0 C. Testing is carried out using a USP Disintegration Tester
and a calibrated thermometer and timer.
[0070] Load to Fracture - This test was used to determine the force in Kg at which a DSI unit will
break using TA-XT2 Texture Analyser 3-point bend test.
[0071] Appearance - The test evaluates the physical appearance of top and bottom surface of
DSI units particularly relating to freeze drying defects such as melting, shrinkage of unit and
cracking. Rating from 1 (the worst) to 10 (the best) are assigned after examination of 10 units.
[0072] Assay - To determine the % LC, testing was performed using Agilent 1100 and 1200
HPLC systems connected to a TotalChrom acquisition system for data collection and
processing.

Example 2: Formulation Design of Experiments for DSI pharmaceutical compositions of
Omeprazole
[0077] A Design of Experiments (DOE) study was performed by manufacturing and testing nine
batches on a 250 gram wet mass scale. The DOE study, using a 2 level, 3 factor design (8
experiments), varied three parameters: the amount of bovine gelatin, the amount of mannitol
and the shelf temperature. A centerpoint experiment was added to the design for a total of 9
experiments. Table 7 describes the DOE study parameters in terms of the wet mass percent of
bovine gelatin and mannitol and drying temperature.

[0078] The manufacturing process of Example 1 was used with the following process
parameters: (i) the freezing step was at -500C setpoint with a 3.3minute cycle; (ii) in the freeze
drying, the unit loading was at -250C with a ramp rate of 1.5-2 0 C/min to reach primary drying set
point/375mTorr; (iii) the primary drying was at -150 C, OC or 150C shelf-temperature (these are
the Low-Mid-High variables for the DOE) using constant vacuum of 375mTorr and a time of 6
hours; and (iv) the secondary drying was at a ramp rate of 1.5-2 0 C/min to 220C. The DOE
outputs were three sets of physical data: Appearance (Table 8), Load to Fracture (Table 9) and
Disintegration Time (Table 10).
[0079] The center-point batch (Experiment 8) yielded optimal physical data, with an Appearance
rating of 10/10 and 3 second disintegration time. The DOE study did not yield data supporting a
formulation change from the center-point batch. However, data analysis using Minitab@ software
(version 16.21) did identify a number of significant interactions. A single value of "Desirability"
was determined based on the study outputs which are displayed on Figure 1 (fixed shelf temp.
of 15  0C), Figure 2 (fixed shelf temp. of 0 0C) and Figure 3 (fixed shelf temp. of -15 C). This
DOE study did show that (i) overall, changes in gelatin concentration have a much greater affect
on desirability of the DIS pharmaceutical composition of omeprazole than changes in mannitol
concentration; and (ii) low level freeze drying (shelf) temperature is most favorable, yielding the
best desirability scores and also an apparent robust knowledge space at the centerpoint.

Example 3: Stability Studies of DSI pharmaceutical compositions of Omeprazole
[0080] Two batches of DSI pharmaceutical compositions of omeprazole, 200mg unit, were
manufactured using the method of Example 1 but at different pH of 7.96 and 8.47. The tablets
were packaged in Marvel Seal 360 aluminum sachets with 4 trays of 8 tablets each (32 tablets).
The DSI pharmaceutical compositions were placed on accelerated conditions to generate
stability data. As is known in the art, omeprazole under certain aqueous conditions is chemically
unstable. The DSI pharmaceutical compositions were stored at 25 0 C/60%RH and 40'C/75%RH
storage conditions and tested on an initial (T=0), one month (T=1) and three month (T=3) time
points. The testing included content uniformity (at initial time point (T=0) only) in compliance

[0081] In the compositions and methods described herein, where a particular compound is
recited, applicants contemplate isolated enantiomers and mixtures thereof in any proportions.
For example, where the only one stereoisomer is stated for a particular stereocenter, applicants
contemplate any possible stereoisomer at that position. For example, where the compound
omeprazole is used, it should be understood that applicants contemplate either pure isomer
and/or any mixture thereof.
[0082] It is to be understood that the foregoing description is exemplary and explanatory only,
and not to be interpreted as restrictive of the disclosure.
[0083] Various modifications of this disclosure, in addition to those shown and described herein,
will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following examples and the foregoing
description. Such modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the present
disclosure. Other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of
the disclosure and practice of the various exemplary embodiments disclosed herein.

                                                 25
[0084] It is also to be understood that, as used herein the terms "the," "a," or "an," mean "at least
one," and should not be limited to "only one" unless explicitly indicated to the contrary. Thus, for
example, the use of "a pharmaceutically active ingredient" or "a therapeutic agent" is intended to
mean at least one therapeutic agent. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers or ranges used in
the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term
"about," whether or not so stated. It should also be understood that the precise numerical values
used in the specification and claims form additional embodiments of the disclosure, and are
intended to include any ranges which can be narrowed to any two end points disclosed within
the exemplary ranges and values provided. Efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of
the numerical values disclosed herein. Any measured numerical value, however, can inherently
contain certain errors resulting from the standard deviation found in its respective measuring
technique.
