A line marking apparatus includes a closed circuit circulation system for line marking material. The
circulation system comprises a pump (17) for circulating line marking material under pressure
through the circuit from an outlet of the pump back to an inlet thereof. The circulation system also
comprises an inlet (15) for introducing fresh line marking material to the circuit when required, the
inlet being positioned upstream of the inlet of the pump. The circulation system further comprises
means (19, 25) for controlling the pressure of line marking material downstream of the outlet of the
pump. The circulation system moreover comprises an outlet for conducting pressurised line marking
material to a spray nozzle (21) for marking a line (23) with the line marking material when the fluid
pressure in the circulation system exceeds a threshold.

LINE MARKING APPARATUS HAVING A CLOSED CIRCULATION SYSTEM
[0001] This invention relates to a line marking apparatus having a closed
         circulation system.
[0002] Line marking apparatus conventionally applies a spray of line marking
         material (paint) to a surface being marked, but one of the problems
         associated with such apparatus is arranging the spray such that the
         edges of the marked line are sharp and distinct. A number of different
        factors are involved, but one factor concerns the rheological
         properties of the line marking material and maintaining the rheological
         properties constant. It is well known that line marking materials for
         line marking apparatus are thixotropic and the rheological properties
         therefore vary during use of a line marking apparatus. This results in
         the quality of the edges of the line being marked varying during use of
         a line marking apparatus, either the quality of the edges deteriorates
         during use or the quality improves during use.
[0003] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a line
         marking apparatus in which the quality of the edges of a marked line
         remains substantially constant.
[0004] According to the present invention there is provided a line marking
         apparatus including a closed circuit circulation system for line marking
         material comprising: a pump for circulating line marking material
         under pressure through the circuit from an outlet of the pump back to
         an inlet thereof; an inlet for introducing fresh line marking material to
         the circuit when required, the inlet being positioned upstream of the
         inlet of the pump; means for controlling the pressure of line marking
         material downstream of the outlet of the pump; and an outlet for
         conducting pressurised line marking material to a spray nozzle for
         marking a line with the line marking material when the fluid pressure
         in the circulation system exceeds a threshold.
[0005] A non-return valve may be provided upstream of the closed circuit
         circulation system.

WO 2015/015353                                                     PCT/IB2014/063113
                                          2
[0006] Line marking material may enter the closed circuit circulation system
         by way of an inlet in the form of a T-junction.
[0007] The means for controlling the pressure downstream of the outlet of
         the pump may comprise pressure control valve, which may be
         adjustable, for example manually or automatically. The pressure
         control valve may incorporate an outlet in the form of a diverter valve.
[0008] Alternatively, the means for controlling the pressure downstream of
         the pump outlet may comprise the piping for the closed circuit, the
         dimensions of the piping being adapted to create a resistance to flow
        from the pump. In such a case, the rate at which the pump operates
         may be controlled. In such a case, the flow of line marking material to
         the spray nozzle may be by way of a separate diverter valve, which
         itself may be adjustable and/or which may be positioned in piping
         leading to the spray nozzle.
[0009] Alternatively, the pressure control valve and the diverter valve may be
         separate. In such a case, the pressure control valve may be located
         downstream of the pump, but at a point upstream of the inlet for fresh
         line marking material. The pressure control valve may be positioned
         in piping between the inlet of the pump and the outlet of the diverter
         valve, or alternatively in piping leading to the spray nozzle. One or
         both of the pressure control valve and the diverter valve may be
         adjustable if desired.
[0010] The pump may be a suction pump.
[0011] The line marking apparatus may include a body provided with wheels.
         The apparatus may further include a handle or other means for
         propelling the apparatus.
[0012] The line marking apparatus may include a source of line marking
         material and/or a source of water. The or each source may comprise
         a tank or a replaceable (for example, collapsible) bag. Where both a
         line marking material source and a water source are provided, a multi
        way valve may be provided to select the desired source. In any event
         an on-off valve may be provided, incorporated into the multi-way valve

WO 2015/015353                                                      PCT/IB2014/063113
                                          3
        where present. The or each valve may be manually operable valve or
         electromechanically operable.
[0013] For a better understanding of the present invention and to show more
         clearly how it may be carried into effect reference will now be made,
         by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which:
[0014] Figure 1 is a diagrammatic illustration of a line marking apparatus
         according to the present invention having a closed circuit circulation
         system;
[0015] Figure 2 is a diagrammatic illustration of a modification of part of the
         line marking apparatus shown in Figure 1; and
[0016] Figure 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of a further modification of part
         of the line marking apparatus shown in Figure 1.
[0017] The line marking apparatus shown in Figure 1 includes a body 1
         provided with a wheels 3 and a handle 5 for propelling the apparatus.
        Alternatively, the apparatus could be self-propelled.
[0018] The apparatus further includes a source 7 of line marking material
         (paint) for marking a line and a source 9 of water for washing out the
         spraying system after use. The line marking material source and or
         the water source may each comprise, for example, a tank or a
         replaceable, collapsible bag. A replaceable flexible bag has the
         advantage that the bag collapses as the line marking material is used
        without introducing air into the bag with the potential for causing the
         line marking material to deteriorate before it is applied. Either the line
         marking material source 7 or the water source 9 can be selected by
        way of a three-way valve 11, which may be a manually operable valve
         or an electromechanically operable valve. If desired, the valve 11
         may additionally have an "off" setting so that neither line marking
         material nor water can pass through the valve.
[0019] The line marking material or water then passes through a non-return
         valve 13 to a closed circuit circulation system. If desired, the non
         return valve 13 may be incorporated into the valve 11. The closed
         circuit circulation system will be described in relation to the use

WO 2015/015353                                                     PCT/IB2014/063113
                                          4
         thereof with line marking material, although water may equally flow
         around the system for cleaning purposes.
[0020] Line marking material enters the closed circuit circulation system from
         the non-return valve 13 by way of an inlet in the form of a T-junction
         15, the line marking material being drawn into the system, when
         required, by a pump 17, such as a suction pump. Line marking
         material is recirculated from the outlet of the pump 17 back to the T
        junction 15 and from the T-junction to the inlet of the pump, thus
         giving rise to the closed circuit circulation system. A pressure control
         valve 19 is incorporated in the system. As illustrated, the pressure
         control valve 19 incorporates a diverter valve (alternatively known as
         a pressure reducing valve) so as to pass line marking material to and
         out of a spray nozzle 21 when the fluid pressure in the circulation
         system exceeds a threshold. The pressure control valve 19 may be
         adjustable, most simply manually but automatic control may be
         provided if desired, so as to vary the threshold, for example up to
         about 5 bar although different thresholds may be employed if desired,
         and to control the fluid pressure in the circulation system. The
         rheological properties of the thixotropic line marking material vary
         according to the way in which the line marking material is treated
         (such as the shear forces applied to the material), so an ability to vary
         the pressure threshold allows the rheological properties to be varied,
         either manually or automatically, so as to adjust the properties of the
         line marking material being sprayed and consequently the outline of
         the line 23 being marked. Line marking material leaving the control
         valve 19 and not passing to the nozzle 21 returns to the T-junction 15
         and to the pump 17, from where it is pumped back to the control valve
         19, completing the closed circuit. A pressure gauge 27 is provided for
         indicating the pressure of the line marking material in the closed loop
         system, that is, downstream of the pump 17.
[0021] The closed circuit arrangement of Figure 1 may be modified in a
         number of ways while remaining a closed circuit.

WO 2015/015353                                                    PCT/IB2014/063113
                                         5
[0022] For example, the dimensions of the piping for the closed circuit may
         be such as to create a resistance to flow from the pump 17 such as to
         eliminate the need for a separate control valve. Adjustment of the
         rheological properties of the thixotropic line marking material may
         then be accomplished by varying the rate at which the pump
         operates. In such a case, the flow of line marking material to the
         spray nozzle 21 may be by way of a separate diverter valve 25, which
         itself may be adjustable and/or which may be positioned in piping
         leading to the spray nozzle 21 or in the spray nozzle itself such that
         line marking material exits the spray nozzle when the fluid pressure
         exceeds a threshold, which may be variable. Such an arrangement is
         shown in Figure 2.
[0023] An embodiment of the present invention with a separate pressure
         control valve 19 and diverter valve 25 is shown in Figure 3. As shown
         in the modification of Figure 3, pressure control valve 19 is located
         downstream of the pump 17 but at a point upstream of the T-junction
         15 where fresh line marking material is introduced when required.
         Thus, the rheological properties of the line marking material are
         adjusted in the region from the inlet of the pump 17 to the outlet of the
         pressure control valve 19. The pressure control valve 19 is positioned
         in the piping between the inlet of the pump and the outlet of the
         diverter valve 25, or alternatively the diverter valve may be positioned
         in piping leading to the spray nozzle 21 or in the spray nozzle itself, so
         as to allow line marking material to pass out of the spray nozzle 21
        when the fluid pressure in the circulation system exceeds a threshold.
         One or both of the pressure control valve and the diverter valve may
         be adjustable if desired.
[0024] The use of a closed circuit, rather than returning the line marking
         material to the source 7, ensures that the line marking material is
         returned to the inlet of the pump 17 under a pressure corresponding
         to the weakest pressure relief valve in the closed loop system. The
         line marking material is subjected to pressure and shear forces which
         result in a change in the viscosity of the line marking material

WO 2015/015353                                                    PCT/IB2014/063113
                                         6
         compared with the material stored in the source 7. This helps to
         maintain a desired rheological properties, especially viscosity, for the
         line marking material exiting the spray nozzle 21, resulting in a
         substantially clean line being marked with no overspray. The ability to
         adjust the pressure within the closed loop, where provided, allows
         adjustment to compensate, for example for changes in ambient
         temperature and for differing rheological properties of various line
         marking materials.
[0025] Where the water source 9 is also a replaceable, collapsible bag a
         duplicate closed system may be provided for passing water through
         the system and to the nozzle for cleaning purposes.
