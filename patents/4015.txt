A VEHICLE FLOOR AND TROLLEY ASSEMBLY
FIELD
[0001] The present invention relates to vehicle floor systems, and trolleys that are received on
the vehicle floor systems.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Many motor vehicles are provided with a rear load receiving tray, upon which a load is
supported. It is known to have trolleys, and other wheeled articles, received on the vehicle tray
and movable therealong for the purposes of loading and unloading.
[0003] A disadvantage of previous vehicle floors is that the load receiving area forward and
rearward of the wheel arches is frequently unusual, since the trolleys need to move forward and
rearward. The wheel arches preventing movement in the areas forward and rearward of the
wheel arches.
OBJECT
[0004] It is the object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above
disadvantage.

vehicle, the member includes at least one track to extend longitudinally in a forward direction of
movement of the vehicle, and at least one transverse track to extend transverse of said direction,
the tracks intercepting and configured to engage a trolley to direct a trolley longitudinally of the
load receiving area and transverse of the load receiving area.
[0006] Preferably, the member is a sheet member, with the vehicle having a floor upon which the

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0026] In Figures 1 to 8 there is schematically depicted the load receiving area 10 of a motor
vehicle, such as a utility, a vehicle with a load receiving tray or a motor lorry.
[0027] The motor vehicle has a platform or tray 13 that supports a load, with wheel arches 11
projecting upwardly therefrom. The vehicle is intended to have a forward travel direction 12.
[0028] Supported on the tray 13 is a support member, in the form of a sheet 14 (load support
member). Preferably, the sheet 14 is formed of flexible material, such as plastic material, and
most preferably is formed of high density of polypropylene.
[0029] The sheet 14 of this embodiment has three sub-sheets 15, 16 and 17. The sub-sheet 16 is
located generally centrally between the wheel arches 11, while sub-sheets 15 and 17 are located
so as to be adjacent the wheel arches 11. The sub-sheet 16 is located between the sub-sheets 15
and 17.
[0030] Preferably, the sub-sheets 15, 16 and 17 are co-extensive and extend generally parallel to
the direction 12. Preferably the sub-sheets 15, 16 and 17 have edge portions 19 that are stepped
so that the sub-sheets 15 and 17 partly project above the sub-sheet 16 at the edge portions 36.
[0031] The sheet 14 is provided with a pair of longitudinally extending tracks 19, that are
parallel and co-extensive. Most preferably the tracks 19 are provided by the sub-sheet 16.
Additionally, the tracks 19 extend longitudinally in the direction 12.
[0032] Also provided are transverse tracks 20 that intercept with the tracks 19 and extend
generally perpendicular relative to the longitudinal direction of extension of the tracks 19 and
therefore the direction 12. Most preferably the tracks 20 have their major length in the
sub-sheets 15 and 17, with a small proportion of their length provided by the sub-sheet 16, and
extending from the tracks 19.
[0033] Most preferably, the tracks 19 and 20 are formed of metal and most preferably and
aluminium extrusions.

                                                  5
[0034] The area 10 is intended to receive and support a plurality of trolleys. Some trolleys may
be supported on the sub-sheet 16, while other trolleys may be supported on the sub-sheets 15 and
17. In particular, the trolleys would include one or more trolleys 22 as shown in Figure 9. The
trolley 22 of Figure 9 is intended to be located adjacent the wheel arch 11 on the left hand side of
the vehicle. The trolley 22 can also be located adjacent the other wheel arch 11.
[0035] The trolley 22 includes a base 23 that is intended to receive and support a load. The base
23 includes a floor 24 and end walls 25 between which the floor 24 extends. The floor 24 has a
recess 26 through which the associated wheel arch 11 would project.
[0036] Preferably each end wall 25 is hollow and slidably receives an associated frame 26, with
the frames 26 being movable in the direction 27 between a raised position at least substantially
located within the associated end wall 12, and a lowered extended position at which the frames
26 project below the floor 24.
[0037] Each frame 26 is provided with wheels 27 that may be castor wheels.
[0038] Mounted in each end wall 25 is an electric motor 28 that rotatably drives a pinion 29,
with each pinion 29 meshingly engaged with a rack gear 30 fixed to a respective frame 26, so
that upon activation of the motor 28, the pinion 29, via engagement with its associated rack 30,
causes movement of the associated frame 26 in the direction 21. That is, by activating the motor
28 the frames 26 can be raised and lowered, that is moved between their extended and retracted
positions.
[0039] In the extended position, the trolley 22 is supported on the wheels 27.
[0040] The trolley 22 is also provided with a plurality of further wheels 31 that are spherical
elements captively located with respect to the floor 24 but projecting below the floor 24 so that
when the wheels 27 are retracted, the trolley 22 is supported on the wheels 31.
[0041] The trolley 22 also includes a projection or pin 32 that projects lower than the floor 24.
[0042] Each track 19 is provided with one or more recesses 33 to be engaged by the pin 32 to
retain the trolley 22 in the position required.

                                                   6
[0043] In use of the above trolley 22, in loading the trolley 22 on the sheet 14, the trolley 22 is
supported on the wheels 27 and moved towards the rear edge 34 of the tray 13 and sheet 14. At
this time, the forward edge of the trolley 22 projects above the sheet 14 so that the forward
wheels 31 are located above the sheet 14. At this time, the forward frame 26 is moved to the
retracted position, so that the forward edge of the tray 22 is now supported on the wheels 31.
The trolley 22 is then moved forward in the direction 12 until the rear frame 26 is located
adjacent the edge 34.
[0044] The trolley 22 also includes a pair of track following projections 35 that are engaged in a
respective one of the tracks 19 to guide the trolley 22 in its direction 12. The trolley 22 is moved
in the direction 12 and engaged with the track 19 until the projections 35 are aligned with one of
the transverse tracks 20. At that time, the trolley 22 is moved laterally so that the projections 35
travel along the engaged tracks 20. The trolley 22 will then be positioned so that the wheel arch
11 projects through the recess 26.
[0045] The pin 32 is then moved downward so as to engage the recess 33 to secure the trolley 22
in position.
