FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The present invention relates to a dispenser and to a putty-like
adhesive to be dispensed by the dispenser.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]       Putty-like removable adhesives are used to attach many lightweight
articles to a number of surfaces. Particularly, posters and other sheets of paper
can be attached to walls, doors or other dry surfaces using such putty-like
adhesive. This type of putty-like adhesive can be easily removed from the
surface and in most cases will not damage a surface against which it is attached.
The putty-like adhesive is also reusable. Blu Tack T M is a leading product in the
field of putty-like adhesives.
[0003]      The putty-like adhesives available at present include a large partially
flattened sheet of the putty-like adhesive, most commonly in a rectangular shape.
A release paper is provided on upper and lower surface of the sheet of putty-like
adhesive. The putty-like adhesive does not easily stick to the release paper or
can be easily removed form the release paper. The release paper ensures that
the putty-like adhesive does not stick to a cardboard outer packaging of the
product. To obtain a piece of the putty-like adhesive to be used, a user can grip a
section of the sheet of putty-like adhesives and pull away a section. The pulling
away of the putty-like adhesive can leave an unattractive string effect of
stretching a localised portion of the sheet of putty-like adhesive. It can be difficult
for a user to acquire a desired amount of putty-like adhesive in a single pulling
action from the sheet of putty-like adhesive. It is very difficult for a user to
consistently acquire a desired amount of putty-like adhesive from the partially
flattened sheet or to know precisely how much putty-like adhesive has been
acquired each time.

                                            2
[0004]      Currently, there is not much choice in the market place in relation to
putty-like adhesives. Most products come in rectangular cardboard packaging.
To access the putty-like adhesive product, the cardboard packaging must be
opened and the sheet of putty-like adhesive is slid out of an opening of the
cardboard packaging. The sheet of putty-like adhesive and release paper
thereon, can be slid back into the cardboard packaging for storage following its
use. These types of packages are not very sophisticated and require an amount
of time to access and use the putty-like adhesive product within.
[0005]      It would be desirable to provide improvements in the field of putty-like
adhesives. Particularly, it would be desirable to provide an improved manner of
obtaining a desired amount of putty-like adhesive, storing the putty-like adhesives
and/or using putty-like adhesives. It would also be desirable to provide
consumers with a useful alternative to existing packages of putty-like adhesives.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]      According to a first aspect, there is provided a dispenser configured to
dispense a putty-like adhesive, the dispenser comprising: a housing; and a
cylindrical member configured to hold a roll of the putty-like adhesive, wherein the
cylindrical member is positioned within the housing, and wherein the putty-like
adhesive can be dispensed from the dispenser by pulling a first end of the roll of
putty-like adhesive to cause the roll to rotate about the cylindrical member, such
that a desired amount of the putty-like adhesive can be taken from the roll.
[0007]      According to embodiments, the housing comprises a first side part and
a second side part, and the first and second side parts are configured to engage
one another to form the housing. Preferably, the first side part includes a first
tubular member and the second side part includes a second each include a
tubular member extending inwardly toward the other one of the first and second
side parts and wherein the tubular members engage one another.

                                             3
[0008]       According to preferred embodiments, the first tubular member has a
diameter that is larger than a diameter of the second tubular member, and the
second tubular member at least partially fits inside the second tubular member
such that, in engagement, the second tubular member is located at least partially
within and engages with the first tubular member.
[0009]       The first and second tubular members may form the cylindrical
member.
[0010]       Alternatively, the cylindrical member may be in the form of a spool and
separately formed from the housing. The cylindrical member or spool may be
mounted on one or both of the first and second tubular members such that the
cylindrical member or spool can be rotated relative to the housing.
[0011]       The dispenser may also include a cover moveably attached to the
housing, wherein the cover is movable between a first position where the first end
of the roll of putty-like adhesive is obscured and a second position where the first
end of the roll of putty-like adhesive is accessible.
[0012]       A further aspect of the present invention provides a roll of putty-like
adhesive configured to be dispensed by the dispenser described above, wherein
the roll includes a hollow central section that is sized to receive the cylindrical
member.
[0013]       Preferably, the roll is formed from an elongated strip of putty-like
adhesive. The roll may include a spool in an internal diameter of the roll.
[0014]       The roll of putty-like adhesive may comprise a layer of release paper
on at least one side of the putty-like adhesive within the roll. According to
embodiments, a layer of release paper may be provided on each side of the
putty-like adhesive within the roll.

                                            4
[0015]      The roll of putty-like adhesive may include perforations located at
predetermined intervals along the putty-like adhesive on the roll such that one or
more predetermined lengths of the putty-like adhesive can be dispensed at a
time.
[0016]      The at least one layer of release paper may incude perforations at
predetermined intervals along a length to enable a predetermined length of the
putty-like adhesive to be dispensed at a time. The perforations are preferably
provided perpendicularly to the length of the putty-like adhesive on the roll.
According to preferred embodiments, both the putty-like adhesive and the layer(s)
of release paper comprise perforations at the same predetermined intervals to aid
a user to dispense the predetermined length of putty-like adhesive easily. The
predetermined interval between perforations on the putty-like adhesive or release
paper may be in the region of 10mm to 100mm. Alternatively, the predetermined
interval is a value in the region of 20mm to 80mm. The predetermined interval
may be a value in the region of 40mm to 60mm. In preferred embodiments the
predetermined interval between perforations is about 50mm.
[0017]      According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided
a system for dispensing a putty-like adhesive, the system comprising: the
dispenser described above; and the roll of putty-like adhesive according to the
above description, wherein the roll of putty-like adhesive is mounted onto the
cylindrical member of the dispenser and retained at least partially within the
housing, such that an amount of the putty-like adhesive can be dispensed when
desired.
[0018]      The dispenser, roll of putty-like adhesive and system according to the
present invention provide an improvement over the packages of putty-like
adhesives according to the prior art. The present invention may enable putty-like
adhesive to be dispensed more easily and more quickly than was previously
possible. The present invention also allows desired quantities of putty-like
adhesive to be dispensed at a time.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0019]      The invention may be better understood with reference to preferred
embodiments, as shown in the accompanying drawings, in which:
[0020]      Figure 1 is an exploded isometric view of a dispenser and roll of putty
like adhesive according to an embodiment of the invention;
[0021]      Figure 2 is an isometric view of the dispenser with the cover in a
closed configuration; and
[0022]      Figures 3a to 3c are top, side and front views, respectively, of the
dispenser with a cover in a closed configuration as shown in figure 2.
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
[0023]      According to an embodiment of the invention, figure 1 shows an
exploded view of system for dispensing a putty-like adhesive including a
dispenser 10 with roll 50 of putty-like adhesive 51.
[0024]      The roll 50 is formed from an elongate strip of putty-like adhesive 51
which has been turned in a coil like manner to form the roll 50. As shown in
figure 1, the strip of putty-like adhesive 51 is covered on one side by release
paper 52. The release paper 52 is preferably a waxed-paper, grease proof paper
or similar material which from which the putty-like adhesive 51 can be easily
detached from. The release paper 52 forms a barrier between adjacent turns of
the putty-like adhesive 51 in the roll 50 to prevent the adjacent turns of the putty
like adhesive 51 from sticking to one another. The layer of release paper 52 also
enables the putty-like adhesive 51 to be more easily dispensed from the roll 50.

                                            6
[0025]      The release paper 52 includes lines of perforation 53 at predetermined
intervals along its length. The lines of perforation 53 allow the release paper 52
to be easily broken along those lines during dispensing of the putty-like adhesive
51.
[0026]      The putty-like adhesive 51 may include lines of perforation to enable a
user to more easily remove a desired amount of the putty-like adhesive 51 (not
shown in the figures). Where the roll 50 of putty-like adhesive 51 also includes a
layer of release paper 52, the lines of perforation on the putty-like adhesive 51
should be aligned with the lines of perforation 53 on the release paper 52.
[0027]      A second layer of release paper (not shown) could be included on the
opposite side of the putty-like adhesive 51 to the layer of release paper 52.
Similarly, as discussed above, if the release paper 52 includes lines of perforation
53 and/or the putty-like adhesive 51 includes lines of perforation, the second layer
of release paper would preferably also include its own lines of perforation aligned
with the perforations on the release paper 52 and/or putty-like adhesive 51. Each
of the perforations discussed in relation to the putty-like adhesive and release
paper is preferably aligned in a direction substantially perpendicularly to the
length of the elongate strip of putty-like adhesive 51 that forms the roll 50.
[0028]      The dispenser 10 is formed from a first side part 11 and a second side
part 12, which join together to form a singular housing from which putty-like
adhesive 51 can be dispensed. The external appearances of the first and second
side parts 11, 12 when the dispenser is formed, as shown in figures 2 and 3A to
3C, are largely the same but mirror images of one another. Each of the first and
second side parts 11, 12 includes a flattened base 20. The first side part 11 has
a wall 16 extending upwardly from the base 20 and the second side part 12 has a
pair of walls 17 extending upwardly from the base 20. The walls 16, 17 can be of
constant thickness throughout. Alternatively, the walls 16, 17 can vary in
thickness depending on the internal and external contours of the first and second
side parts 11, 12 that are required.

                                             7
[0029]       As shown in figure 1, the first side part 11 includes a first tubular
member 13 which extends inwardly of the wall 16. The second side part 12
similarly includes a second tubular member 14. The first tubular member 13 has
a hollow internal portion 15. The second tubular member 14 may also include a
similar hollow internal portion. The first tubular member 13 has an external
diameter and an internal diameter. The second tubular member 14 has an
external diameter that is about the same as or less than the internal diameter of
the first tubular member 13. The first and second side parts 11, 12 can be
brought together with one another such that the second tubular member 14
becomes located within the hollow internal portion 15 of the first tubular member
13. In this manner the walls 16, 17 of the first and second side parts 11, 12 are
also brought together until their edges are in contact with one another. The first
side part 11 includes a locating tab 18 which aligns with a receiving recess of the
second side part 12 (not shown). The first side part 11 also includes locating tabs
19 adjacent to the base 20, which are used to align with respective receiving
recesses on the second side part 12 (also not shown). The tabs 18, 19 and
recesses are used to ensure that the first and second side parts 11, 12 are
correctly aligned when brought together. In some embodiments, one or more of
the tabs 18, 19 may include a locking means that engages a similar locking
means in the corresponding recess to hold the first and second side parts 11, 12
together. The locking means may be in the form of a resilient clipping
mechanism.
[0030]       In other embodiments, the dispenser 10 may be formed as a unitary
piece rather than having first and second side parts 11, 12. A person skilled in
the art will easily recognise that the number of parts forming the dispenser 10 is
less important than the function that it performs.
[0031]       A cylindrical member 30 in the form of a spool is provided. The
cylindrical member is ring-like in shape and includes an outer surface 31 and an
inner surface 32. The outer and inner surfaces 31, 32 are each formed from a
thin tubular piece of material and are spaced apart from one another. A plurality

                                           8
of ribs 33 are provided between the thin tubular pieces of material to retain them
in a sturdy spaced relationship. The outer surface 31 runs around the outside of
the cylindrical member 30 which has an outer diameter. The inner surface 32
runs around the inside of the cylindrical member 30 which has an internal
diameter. In other embodiments, the cylindrical member 30 could be formed as a
single ring of material, in which case, the outer and inner surfaces 31, 32 would
be on opposite sides of the same ring of material.
[0032]      The internal diameter of the cylindrical member 30 defined between
the inner surface 32 is greater than the external diameter of the first tubular
member 13 of the first side part 11 of the dispenser 10. This means that
cylindrical member 30 can be placed over the first tubular member 13 prior to the
first tubular 13 member receiving the second tubular member 14 when the first
and second side parts 11, 12 are brought together. In this manner the cylindrical
member 30 will be retained in place on the first tubular member 13 when the
dispenser 10 is formed by the engagement of the first and second side parts 11,
 12. Further, the internal diameter of the cylindrical member 30 being larger than
the external diameter of the first tubular member 13 means that that the
cylindrical member 30 is free to rotate on the first tubular member 13 relative to
the first and second side parts 11, 12. Preferably, the internal diameter of the
cylindrical member 30 differs only slightly from the external diameter of the first
tubular member 13 such that the cylindrical member can rotate freely on the first
tubular member 13 but with only a small amount of relative rocking motion
between the cylindrical member 30 and the first tubular member 13 being
permitted. For example, the difference between the internal diameter of the
cylindrical member 30 and the external diameter of the first tubular member 13
may be from about 0.1mm to 10mm. Alternatively, the difference in diameter may
be from about 0.5mm to 5mm. Alternatively, the difference in diameter may be
from about 1mm to about 5mm.
[0033]      The roll 50 of putty-like adhesive 51 includes an internal diameter
defined by its vacant central section 54. The external diameter of the spool 30

                                             9
defined by its outer surface 31 is the about the same as or smaller than the
internal diameter of the central section 54 of the roll 50 of putty-like adhesive. In
embodiments where the outer diameter of the cylindrical member 30 is about the
same as or slightly less than the internal diameter of the roll 50 of putty-like
adhesive 51, the roll 50 will rotate relative to the dispenser 10 when the cylindrical
member 30 rotates. Alternatively, the roll 50 of putty-like adhesive 51 may have
an internal diameter that is larger than the outer diameter of the cylindrical
member 50 such that the roll 50 is free to rotate relative to both the cylindrical
member 30 and the dispenser 10.
[0034]      In some embodiments the cylindrical member 50 is in the form of a
spool and is part of the roll 50. A second end 56 of the roll 50 in its central
section 54 may be attached to the outer surface 31 of the spool 30.
[0035]      In embodiments, the dispenser 10 does not include a separate
cylindrical member 30. In such embodiments on or both of the tubular members
13, 14 will receive the roll 50 of putty-like adhesive directly without the addition of
a cylindrical member 30 between them. In that case the tubular member(s) 13,
14 acts as the cylindrical member which is part of the dispenser 10. The roll 50
will be able to rotate relative to the tubular member(s) 13, 14 on which it is
positioned.
[0036]      As shown in the accompanying figures, the dispenser includes a cover
40. The cover 40 is an optional feature of the dispenser 10 and it is envisaged
that a dispenser 10 which fulfils the same purpose could be provided that does
not include a cover 40. The cover 40 includes a protrusion 41 on either side. The
protrusions 41 of the cover 40 are aligned with one another and protrude from a
surface of the cover 40 internally towards one another. The protrusions 41
interact with a respective recess 28 that is provided on each of the first and
second side parts 11, 12. The cover 40 is adapted such that when the first and
second side parts 11, 12 have been brought into engagement with one another,

                                           10
the cover can be fitted over the first and second side parts 11, 12 such that each
protrusion 41 clips into the respective recess 28.
[0037]      The engagement of the protrusions 41 in the recesses 28 permits the
cover 40 the move and rotate relative to the first and second side parts 11, 12
when in position. Preferably, the cover 40 can be rotated between a closed
configuration (as shown in figures 2 and 3a to 3c) and an open configuration. In
the open configuration the first end 55 of the roll 50 of the putty-like adhesive 51
is accessible by a user. For example, the open configuration of the cover 40
allows the putty-like adhesive to be dispensed from the dispenser by a user
pulling on the first end 55 in such a manner that a desired amount of the putty-like
adhesive is dispensed. Where perforations 53 are provided on the roll 50, the
user can dispense the predetermined amounts of the putty-like material defined
by the spacing of the lines of perforation 53. In other embodiments, some type of
releasing or cutting means can be provided on the dispenser to allow a user to
accurately select a desired amount of putty-like adhesive 51 to be dispensed and
to separate this amount of putty-like adhesive 51 from the rest of the roll 50.
When the cover 40 is in the closed configuration, the putty-like adhesive 51 is not
accessible to a user and is retained within the dispenser 10.
[0038]      The first and second side parts 11, 12 of the dispenser 10 each include
a recessed section 22 formed by a stepping down of the outer contour of the
walls 16, 17. The recessed sections 22 on the outer surfaces of the first and
second side parts 11, 12 are sized to correspond to the size and shape of the
cover 40. The recessed sections 22 are also contoured and sized to
accommodate the rotational movement of the cover 40 relative to the first and
second side parts 11, 12. The stepped down features of the first and second side
parts 11, 12 defining the recessed regions 22 are in the form of a rim 23. The rim
23 of each of the first and second side parts 11, 12 includes a front rim portion 24
and a rear rim portion 25. The front rim portion 24 acts as a stop for the front
cover portion 42 cover 40, such that when the cover 40 is in the closed
configuration the front rim portion 24 is in contact with the front cover portion 42.

                                           11
When the cover 40 is rotated from the closed configuration towards the open
configuration, the rear rim portion 25 will act as a stop to the rear cover portion
43. Wherein, when the cover 40 is in the open configuration, the rear cover
portion 43 contacts and rests on the rear rim portion 25.
[0039]       The cover 40 includes a projection 44 adjacent the front cover portion
42. The projection 44 can be used in a similar fashion to a handle, such that a
user can interact with the projection 44 with one of their finger nails to move the
cover 40 between the open and closed configurations.
[0040]       The first and second side parts 11, 12 each include a closing projection
26 which is configured to interact with a recess in the internal wall of the cover
(not shown). The recess may be positioned on the cover 40 on an opposite side
of the cover wall from the projection 44. When the first and second side portions
 11, 12 have been brought together and engage with one another, the closing
projections 26 come together to act as a single closing projection 26. The
interaction between the closing projection 26 and the respective recess in the
cover 40 is such that it provides a small amount of force to retain the cover 40 of
the dispenser 10 in the closed configuration. The closing projection 26 may
interact with the respective recess in the cover 40 by a simple clipping action.
The interaction is preferably such that a user of the dispenser 10 can open the
cover 40 by pushing the projection 44 without requiring an excessive force to be
applied. In a similar manner, an opening projection could be provided on the
dispenser 10 to maintain the cover 40 in an open configuration.
[0041]       The first and second side parts 11, 12, cylindrical member 30 and
cover 40 are all preferably made from suitable substantially rigid materials, such
as plastic material. For example, one or more of the first and second side parts
 11, 12, cylindrical member 30 and cover 40 could be formed form high density
polyethylene (HDPE). In other embodiments, the cylindrical member 30 could be
formed from a type of material that is different from the first and second side parts
 11, 12 and cover 40. For example, the cylindrical member 30 could be formed

                                           12
from a disposable or more easily recyclable material, such as cardboard or other
paper based material. When made from a cardboard or similar material, the
cylindrical member 30 could be formed as a single ring of material. In such
embodiments, the cylindrical member could be part of the roll 50 and could be
disposed of or recycled when all of the putty-like adhesive 51 on the roll 50 has
been dispensed. A refill comprising another roll 50 with the cylindrical member 30
could be purchased and used in the same dispenser 10 by a user.
[0042]      The overall appearance of the dispenser 10 when in the closed
configuration is shown in figures 2 and 3A to 3C. The appearance of the
dispenser 10 as shown is largely circular or wheel-like in appearance. However,
the invention is not restricted to dispensers 10 of this shape and the dispenser
can be any desired size and shape, providing that it meets the requirement of
enabling the roll 50 of putty-like adhesive 51 to be dispensed therefrom.
[0043]      Comprises/comprising and grammatical variations thereof when used
in this specification are to be taken to specify the presence of stated features,
integers, steps or components or groups thereof, but do not preclude the
presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, components
or groups thereof.
