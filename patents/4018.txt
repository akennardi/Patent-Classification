   Detailed Description
35
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming machine
   having components that enable the implementation of a game
                                            9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 7
   having a plurality of feature games where there are also a
   plurality of feature game triggers. The gaming machine is
   configured so that there can be fewer feature game
   triggers than feature games. In one example, there are
 5 three feature games and only two feature game triggers and
   one of the feature games is triggered if both feature game
   triggers occurs. Advantageously, this improves the
   efficiency of triggering feature games. For example, by
   reducing the number of symbols that need to be used as
10 feature game triggers. In an advantageous embodiment, a
   first feature game has a first game play characteristic, a
   second feature game having a second game play
   characteristic, and a third feature game combines the
   first game play characteristic and the second game play
15 characteristic and is conducted if both the first and the
   second feature game triggers occur. This use of both game
   play characteristics in a third feature game makes for a
   clear relationship between characteristics of each of the
   trigger conditions and game play in the respective feature
20 games. Thereby allowing a gaming machine to be provided
   with a plurality of feature games while reducing
   complexity both in terms of the number of triggers that
   need to be provided and, from the perspective of the
   player, the nature of game play.
25
   General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a standalone gaming machine is provided
30 wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
35 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
                                            9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 8
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
 5 architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
10
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
15 gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
   mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
   on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
   Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
20 the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
25 60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
30 outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
35 and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions            (e.g. to
                                             9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 9
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
 5 that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
10 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
15 provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
20 general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
25 A gaming system in the form of a standalone gaming machine
   10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
   includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
30 houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
35 mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
                                             9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 10
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.  A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
 5 the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
10 module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module that is accessed in response
15 to insertion of the player tracking device.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
20 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
25 The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
   liquid crystal display.  The display 14 may any other
   suitable video display unit, such as an OLED display.                       The
   top box 26 may also include a display, which may be of the
   same type as the display 14, or of a different type.
30
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
35 The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
                                             9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 11
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
 5 with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
10 player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
15 for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
20
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
25 mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
30 implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
35 machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
                                              9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 12
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
 5 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
10 database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data

   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
 5 machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.

   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
20 part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
25 management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
30 accounting functions for the Jackpot game.      A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
35 machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
30 may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
35 will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
                                             9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

   Further detail of gaming machine
 5 The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
   a wager which will be evaluated for this play of the game
   and initiates a play of the game. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that a player's wager can be varied
   from game to game dependent on player selections. In most
10 spinning reel games, it is typical for the player's wager
   to be made up of a selection as to how the game outcome
   will be evaluated by specifying what parts of the game
   outcome will qualify for winning outcomes and a multiplier
   that will apply to each winning outcome. For example, a
15 player's wager may be based on how many lines they play in
   each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game  (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
   and an amount per line - e.g. one, two or five credits.
20 Winning outcomes on an activated win line may be evaluated
   based on a pay table that specifies the amount awarded for
   a one credit per line wager multiplied by the amount
   wagered per line.
25 Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
   symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
   display positions being located relative to one another
   such that they form a line.
30 In many games, the gaming machine may award winning
   outcomes which are not strictly limited to the lines they
   have selected, for example, "SCATter" pays are awarded
   independently of a player's selection of pay lines.
35 In embodiments of the invention, the game play mechanism
   is used to select a number of games to be played
   concurrently as well as the wager to be applied to each of
                                            9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 16
   those games.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may select a number of reels to
 5 play or play a fixed number of reels. Games of this type
   are marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by
   Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd and are also known
   as "ways" to win games. The selection of the reel means
   that each displayed symbol of the reel can be substituted
10 for a symbol at one or more designated display positions.
   In other words, all symbols displayed at symbol display
   positions corresponding to a selected reel can be used to
   form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at a
   designated, symbol display positions of the other reels.
15 For example, if there are five reels and three symbol
   display positions for each reel such that the symbol
   display positions comprise three rows of five symbol
   display positions, the symbols displayed in the centre row
   are used for non-selected reels. As a result, the total
20 number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the
   number of active display positions of each reels, the
   active display positions being all display positions of
   each selected reel and the designated display position of
   the non-selected reels. As a result for five reels and
25 fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to win.
   In the embodiment described below, the display positions
   of the symbol display are arranged in a rectangular matrix
   comprising a plurality of columns and a plurality of rows.
30 However, other arrangements are known in the gaming
   industry and could be employed in embodiments of the
   invention. For example, in some arrangements there are
   more symbols in some columns than others, such as 3-4-3-4
   3 arrangement of seventeen display positions corresponding
35 to respective ones of five reels. In such arrangements,
   the columns of four symbols can be arranged so that they
   are off-set or staggered relative to the columns having
                                            9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 17
   three symbols so that the middle two symbols in the
   columns of four symbols share boundaries with two symbols
   of each neighbouring reel.
 5 In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 of
   gaming machine 1 is shown implementing a number of modules
   based on program code and data stored in memory 64.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that one or
   more of the modules could be implemented in some other
10 way, for example by a dedicated circuit.
   Once the player initiates the play of a game by inputting
   a game initiation instruction in via the game play
   mechanism 56 (e.g. by making a wager),  the symbol selector
15 622A of the outcome generator 622 uses the random number
   generator 621 to select a plurality of symbols from symbol
   data 641.
   In an embodiment, the symbols 641 are stored as a
20 plurality of reels 641A.   For example, five reels.                 The
   symbol selector 622A uses a value obtained from the random
   number generator 621 to select a stopping position for
   each of the reels.   The stopping position corresponds to a
   designated one of the symbol display positions.              That is,
25 the reel will be aligned with the stopping position based
   on the selected stopping position on the reels.              In this
   respect, each reel has a defined order symbols.              The
   selected symbols are caused to be displayed by the outcome
   generator 622 on the display 54 under control of the
30 display controller 624.   The selected symbols are
   displayed at respective ones of a plurality of symbols
   display positions.   In one example, the symbol display
   positions are arranged in five columns of four symbols in
   a five by four grid.
35
   The game controller 62 includes an outcome evaluator 623
   arranged to compare the selected symbols against a pay
                                             9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 18
   table 643 on the basis of the player's game play
   instructions.  For example, as described above, to
   determine whether the selected symbol on a paid for play
   line correspond to a winning symbol combination.                The
 5 outcome evaluator 623 also includes a trigger monitor 623A
   which compares the selected symbols against triggers 641B
   to determine whether to trigger one of a plurality of
   feature games.  In the embodiment, each of the triggers
   includes a defined number of designated trigger symbols.
10 In one example, three scattered trigger symbols ("SCAT"
   symbols) will correspond to a trigger.   In a further
   example, additional triggered symbols of the same type
   will lead to conducting a feature game of a different
   length.  In one example, the trigger monitor 623
15 determines whether one or both of a first feature game
   trigger condition and a second feature game trigger
   condition are met. Upon determining that at least one of
   the trigger conditions is met, the trigger monitor causes
   the feature game controller 622B to conduct the relevant
20 feature game based on feature game data 642 stored in
   memory 64.
   In this example, the feature game data defines first,
   second and third feature games.  The first feature game
25 has a first game play characteristic, the second feature
   game has a second game play characteristic, and the third
   feature game combines the first game play characteristic
   and second game play characteristic.   In an embodiment,
   the feature game controller 6224 is configured to conduct
30 the first feature game if only the first trigger condition
   is met, the second feature game if only the second feature
   game trigger condition is met and the third feature game
   if both the first and second feature game trigger
   conditions are met.  Advantageously, this allows a number
35 of feature games to be offered while minimising the
   complexity of the trigger arrangement.   Further, as both
   play characteristics are used in the third feature game;
                                             9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 19
   there is less risk of confusion for the player.             For
   example, without the technique of the embodiment, a player
   who has observed the first feature trigger occurring in
   one instance and resulting in a first game play
 5 characteristic being part of a feature game could be
   confused if the same game play characteristic was not
   present where the first trigger condition occurred in
   conjunction with a second trigger condition. Accordingly,
   the gaming machine reduces the perceived complexity to the
10 user while providing flexibility to have a greater number
   of feature games.  In this respect, it will be noted that
   in this way, the gaming machine may be configured such
   that there is at least one more feature game than feature
   game trigger.
15
   As shown in Figure 6, the memory 64 stores meter data 644
   including credit and win meters so that any awards can be
   added to the win meter and then transfer to the credit
   meter, either when a further game play initiation
20 instructions made or if the player choses to cash out.                      As
   indicated above, awards by the win meter are made based on
   the pay table 643.
   Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a flowchart of a
25 method 700 of operating a gaming machine.     The method 700
   involves receiving a game initiation instruction 710,
   selecting symbols 720, determining whether the selected
   symbols correspond to at least one trigger 730 and if not,
   returning to a wait to receive a further game initiation
30 instruction 710. If the selected symbols do contain at
   least one trigger, the method determines whether it is
   only the first trigger 740 in which case the method
   involves conducting 750 the first feature.      The method
   also involves determining whether the selected symbols
35 contain only the second trigger 760, in which case the
   method involves conducting the second feature 770. In the
   alternative both triggers are contained in the selected
                                            9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                              - 20
   symbol and the method involves conducting 780 the third
   composite feature.
   It will be apparent to the skilled person that a gaming
 5 machine could be configured to conduct more than three
   feature games if desired.   For example, first, second and
   third triggers could be used to trigger additional feature
   games.
10 EXAMPLE
   Referring to Figures 8A - 8C, there is shown an example of
   an embodiment of the invention.   In the example, three or
   more SCAT1 symbols will trigger a free games feature with
15 the game play characteristic that the free games include a
   nudging WILD.  As shown in the exemplary grid of symbol
   display positions 800A, three SCAT1 symbols 801, 802 and
   803 will cause the free games to trigger.      If more than
   three SCAT1 symbols occur, a larger number of free games
20 will be triggered.
   Referring to Figure 8B, the grid of symbol display
   positions 800B includes three SCAT2 symbols 811, 812, 813.
   The occurrence of three SCAT2 symbols will trigger free
25 game feature with bonus prizes appearing on any WILD
   symbols.
   If both three or more SCAT1 symbols and three or more
   SCAT2 symbols appear in the array of symbol display
30 positions as shown in Figure 8C a composite feature game
   is triggered. In this respect, as shown in Figure 8C,
   there are three SCAT1 symbols, 821, 822, 823 and three
   SCAT2 symbols 824, 825 and 826.
35 The composite feature has both the game play
   characteristic of the nudging WILD feature and the game
   play characteristic of bonus prizes appearing on the
                                             9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 21
   WILDs.   A benefit of this arrangement is that WILD symbols
   will appear on the screen more often since they are being
   nudged onto the screen, giving more wins which in turn
   gives more bonus prizes because the more WILDs there are,
 5 the more bonuses are awarded.    Thus, the third feature
   game that is offered is the combination of the nudging
   WILDs and bonus prizes but it is achieved in a way that
   does not overcomplicate the way in which the features are
   triggered.   Thus, it avoids frustration and confusion for
10 the player.
   It will be apparent from the description above, that the
   base game is a part of the game which is carried out each
   time the player makes a wager, typically irrespective of
15 the wager, whereas a feature game will only be carried out
   occasionally when one of the triggers occurs.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a feature
   game involves some additional element of game play which
20 usually only occurs when a trigger condition is met. Types
   of feature games include:  those where a series of free
   game events are awarded such as free games or re-spins
    (where some reels are held while others are re-spun);
   games where the symbols on the reel are changed; and
25 "second screen" games where game play is totally different
   to the base game, for example where the player makes
   selections in a "pick a box type" game.
   Typically, a winning outcome will result in some form of
30 award being made such as an award of credits. Such an
   award may never actually be physically received by a
   player. For example, many gaming systems provide a player
   with a double or nothing gamble feature, where the player
   can double or forfeit their credits before commencing
35 another play of the game or cashing out. Further, as
   credits are fungible, once credits have been added to the
   credit meter it is not possible to distinguish between
                                             9814413_1 (GHMatters) P104801.AU.1 20/12/17

                               - 22
   credits which exist because the player has input cash or
   the like and credits resulting from an award.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
 5 above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
10 description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
15 programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
20 As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
25 a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
30 instructions executable by the processor.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In
35 particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.
