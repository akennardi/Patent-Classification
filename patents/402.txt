   for preparing the compounds of formula 13 and formula 13b as well as salts or stereoisomers
   thereof.
              The methods and intermediates described in the summary of the invention and herein
 0 below, which are useful for preparing the compound of formula 13 or a salt thereof or the
   compounds of formula 13b or salts thereof, represent a significant improvement over previous
   methods. For example, the previously reported methods for the synthesis of the compound of
   formula 13 required a late stage amination of a methoxy purine to provide the corresponding
   amino purine which may introduce higher levels of undesirable side products. This process led to
 5 lower overall yields of the final compound. The methods of the current invention avoid this
   undesirable step as the amine functionality is introduced as part of the purine core from the
   beginning of the synthesis. Previously reported methods also required the isolation of the
   compound of formula 13 from a mixture of diastereomers by chiral chromatography. This method
   of resolution is costly as specialized equipment and significant amounts of production time and
 0 labor are needed to effectively remove the undesired compound (e.g. about 50%) from the product
   mixture. Additionally, the use of this method of resolution of diastereomers in the final stage of
   a synthetic process is inherently inefficient and undesirable because the overall process
   transformation yield (i.e. maximum 50%) is severely impacted. The present synthesis does not
   require such an isolation step as the synthesis described herein utilizes a selected, stereo-defined
25 chiral phosphonamidate (e.g. compound 19) that provides compound 13 as a single diasteromer.
   In addition, literature methods for the synthesis of compound 4a from compound la and 3a
   (wherein all of the protecting groups are benzoyl) utilized the sodium salt of compound 3a. In
   contrast, the present invention describes the synthesis of compound of 4a from compound 3a
   which does not utilize the sodium salt of compound 3a. This modification results in a significantly
30 higher anomeric p/a ratio and thus higher yields. Accordingly, the present invention provides
   improved methods and intermediates for preparing compound 13 and compounds of formula 13b.

 o          The term "aryl" as used herein refers to a ring structure of from 6 to 14 carbon atoms in the
    ring. Aryl includes a single aromatic ring (e.g. phenyl). Aryl also includes multiple condensed
    rings (e.g. bicyclic or multicyclic rings such as naphthyl or anthryl) wherein the condensed rings
    may be aromatic, saturated or partially saturated, provided that at least one of the condensed rings
    is aromatic. Such multiple condensed rings may be optionally substituted with one or more (e.g.
 5  1, 2 or 3) oxo groups on any non-aromatic portion (i.e. saturated or partially unsaturated) of the
    multiple condensed ring. It is to be understood that the point(s) of attachment of a bicyclic or
    multicyclic aryl can be at any position of the ring system including an aromatic or non-aromatic
    portion of the ring. Exemplary aryls include, but are not limited to phenyl, indanyl, naphthyl,
    1,2-dihydronaphthyl and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl.
 .0         The term "heteroaryl" as used herein refers to a ring structure of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms
    and 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur in the
    ring. The sulfur and nitrogen heteroatoms atoms may also be present in their oxidized forms.
    Heteroaryl includes a single aromatic ring with at least one heteroatom (e.g. pyridyl, pyrimidinyl
    or furyl). Heteroaryl also includes multiple condensed rings (e.g. bicyclic or multicyclic rings
25  such as indolizinyl or benzothienyl) wherein the condensed rings may or may not be aromatic
    and/or contain a heteroatom provided that at least one of the condensed rings is aromatic with at
    least one heteroatom. Such multiple condensed rings may be optionally substituted with one or
    more (e.g. 1, 2 or 3) oxo groups on any non-aromatic (i.e. saturated or partially unsaturated)
    portion of the condensed ring. It is to be understood that the point(s) of attachment of a bicyclic
30  or multicyclic heteroaryl can be at any position of the ring system including an aromatic or
    non-aromatic portion of the ring. Exemplary heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to
    pyridyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazolyl, thienyl, indolyl, thiophenyl,

   2 or 3) (CI-C 6)alkyl groups.
            The compound of formula Ia can be converted to a compound of formula 4a (via the
 5 compound 2a) by treatment with a brominating agent (e.g. HBr in acetic acid,
   bromotrimethylsilane or titanium (IV) bromide) followed by N-glycosylation with a compound of
   formula 3a. The bromination and N-glycosylation can be conveniently carried out in a variety of
   polar and nonpolar solvents (e.g. methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, N-methylpyrrolidinone,
   acetonitrile, methyl t-butyl ether, isopropyl acetate or toluene) or combinations thereof The
 0 bromination can be conveniently conducted at a temperature of about 0 "C. The N-glycosylation
   can be conveniently conducted at a temperature of about 60 "C to 70 *C. The document EP
   0428109 describes the preparation of the compound of formula 4a from condensation of the
   compound of formula 2a and the sodium salt of the compound of formula 3a (each R' is benzoyl).
   In contrast, the N-glycosylation of the instant invention can be carried out without converting the
 5 compound of formula 3a to the sodium salt prior to or during the condensation reaction with the
   compound of formula 2a. Since this procedure does not use the sodium salt of the adenine
   derivative 3a it avoids the use of hazardous reagents such as sodium hydride. The procedure also
   resulted in a significantly improved anomeric ratio of 24:1 versus the anomeric ratio of 15: 1
   reported in EP 0428109. Thus, this method represents a significant advantage over the analogous
 0 reaction described in EP 0428109.
             In another embodiment the invention further provides a method for the conversion of a
   compound of formula 4a or a salt thereof to a compound of formula 13 or a salt thereof or a

   hydroxide (e.g. sodium hydroxide). The deprotection step can be conveniently carried out in a
   variety of solvents (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, organic alcohols or water) or combinations thereof. The

            The methods and intermediates described herein below, which are useful for preparing the
    compound of formula 21 or formula 21 c or the compounds of formula 21 b, represent an
    improvement over previous methods. For example, previously reported methods required the
    isolation of the compound of formula 21 from a mixture of diastereomers by chiral
 .0 chromatography. This method of resolution is costly as specialized equipment and significant
    amounts of production time and labor are needed to effectively remove the undesired compound
    (e~g. about 50%) from the product mixture. Additionally, the use of this method of resolution of
    diastereomers in the final stage of a synthetic process is inherently inefficient and undesirable
    because the overall process transformation yield (i.e. maximum 50%) is severely impacted. The
 .5 present synthesis does not require such an isolation step as the synthesis described herein utilizes
    a selected, stereo-defined chiral phosphonamidate (e.g. compound 25) that provides compound 21
    as a single diastereomer. Accordingly, the present invention provides improved methods and
    intermediates for preparing compound 21 as well as compound 21c and the compounds of formula
    21b.

             In cases where compounds identified herein are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable
   acid or base salts, the invention also provides salts of such compounds. Such salts may be useful
   as intermediates, for example, for purifying such compounds. Examples of useful salts include
   those formed with organic acids, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate,
 0 malonate, tartrate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, a-ketoglutarate, and a-glyccrophosphate.
   Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate,
   and carbonate salts.
             Salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by
   reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording an anion.
 5 Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium, or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example
   calcium or magnesium) salts of carboxylic acids, for example, can also be made.
             Scheme 1 illustrates the method that was used to prepare the compound of formula 13
   Scheme 2 illustrates a method that can be used to prepare other isomers of a compound of formula
    13 (e.g. a compound of formula 13b) from the compound of formula 1Oa. Scheme 3 illustrates the
20 method that was used to prepare the compound of formula 19. Scheme 4 illustrates a method that
   can be used to prepare other isomers of a compound of formula 19 (e.g. a compound of formula
   19b). The compound of formula 19 was used as an intermediate to prepare the compound of
   formula 13 as described in Scheme 1. The synthetic methods used in the Schemes 1-4 are those
   methods described in the embodiments of the invention as described herein.
