   RELATED APPLICATION DATA
          This application is a divisional application pursuant to Section 79B of the PatentsAct
 5 1990 of Australian Application No. 2011380015 which corresponds to International
   Application No. PCT/US2011/057182 filed 24 October 2011 in the Australian national

   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
10        The present invention relates to improved HCV antigens and vaccines made
   therefrom, and improved methods for inducing immune responses, and prophylactically
   and/or therapeutically immunizing individuals against HCV.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
15       Applicants are disclosing the co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 13/127,008,
   filed April 29, 2011, the disclosures of which are each incorporated herein by reference.
          Hepatitis C (HCV) is a small enveloped, positive stranded RNA virus that represents a
   major health burden worldwide with more than 170 million individuals currently infected
   [Thomson, B.J. and R.G. Finch, Hepatitis C virus infection. Clin Microbiol Infect, 2005.
20 11(2): p. 86-94]. One of the most successful of all human viruses, HCV preferentially infects
   heptocytes and is able to persist in the livers of up to 70% of all infected individuals
   [Bowen, D.G. and C.M. Walker, Adaptive immune responses in acute and chronic hepatitis
   C virus infection. Nature, 2005. 436(7053): p. 946-52]. It is estimated that up to 30% of
   chronically infected individuals will develop progressive liver disease, including cirrhosis
25 and heptocellular carcinoma (HCC) during their lifetime making HCV infection the leading
   causes of liver transplantation in the world. In addition, HCV and HBV infections are
   implicated in 7 0% of all cases of HCC, which is the third leading cause of cancer deaths
   worldwide [Levrero, M., Viral hepatitis and liver cancer: the case of hepatitis C. Oncogene,
   2006. 25(27): p. 3834-47].
30        Due to the persistent nature of the virus, HCV infection can be extremely difficult and
   expensive to treat. Most infected individuals do not receive treatment. However, those that

                                                     3
   do, pay on average $17,700 to 22,000 US for standard treatment protocols [Salomon, J.A., et
   al., Cost-effectiveness of treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection in an evolving patient
   population. Jama, 2003. 290(2): p. 228-37]. Genotype 1 infection, the most prevalent in
   Europe and North America, has the poorest prognosis with as little as 42% of individuals
 5 responding to standard treatments [Manns, M.P., et al., Peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin
   compared with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin for initial treatment of chronic hepatitis C: a
   randomised trial. Lancet, 2001. 358(9286): p. 958-65].
          Therefore, the high prevalence of infection, lack of effective treatments and economic
   burden of chronic HCV, illustrates the urgent need for the development of novel immune
10 therapy strategies to combat this disease. Currently there is no prophylactic or therapeutic
   vaccine for HCV.
         Understanding the adaptive immunity to this virus is critical for designing strategies,
   such as DNA vaccines, to combat viral infection. Although virus-specific antibodies are
   detected within 7-8 weeks post HCV infection [Pawlotsky, J.M., Diagnostic tests for
15 hepatitis C. J Hepatol, 1999. 31 Suppl 1 : p. 71-9] they do not protect against reinfection
   [Farci, P., et al., Lack of protective immunity against reinfection with hepatitis C virus.
   Science, 1992. 258(5079): p. 135-40; Lai, M.E., et al., Hepatitis C virus in multiple episodes
   of acute hepatitis in polytransfused thalassaemic children. Lancet, 1994. 343(8894): p. 388
   90] and can be completely absent following the resolution of infection [Cooper, S., et al.,
20 Analysis of a successful immune response against hepatitis C virus. Immunity, 1999. 10(4):
   p. 439-49; Post, J.J., et al., Clearance of hepatitis C viremia associated with cellular
   immunity in the absence of seroconversion in the hepatitis C incidence and transmission in
   prisons study cohort. J Infect Dis, 2004. 189(10): p. 1846-55].
          Thus, one of the major challenges in vaccine development for HCV is that unlike other
25 hepatitis viruses, such as Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, where successful antibody-based
   vaccines have been created, protection against HCV infection does not appear to be antibody
   mediated. Although the exact correlates of immune protection remain to be elucidated,
   numerous studies of both acutely infected patients and chimpanzees, have provided
   compelling evidence that strong T helper 1 (Thl) responses directed against the more
30 genetically conserved non-structural regions of the virus are associated with clearance of
   HCV infection. See Missale, G., et al., Different clinical behaviors of acute hepatitis C virus

                                                    4
   infection are associatedwith different vigor of the anti-viralcell-mediated immune
   response.
           J Clin Invest, 1996. 98(3): p. 706-14; and Diepolder, H.M., et al., Possible mechanism
   involving T-lymphocyte response to non-structuralprotein 3 in viral clearancein acute
 5 hepatitis C virus infection. Lancet, 1995. 346(8981): p. 1006-7. Also, importantly, it has
   been shown that localization of HCV-specific T cells to the liver rather than peripheral
   blood is critical for both reduction in viral load and clearance of acute infection. See
   Thimme, R., et al., Determinants of viral clearance andpersistence during acute hepatitis C
   virus infection. J Exp Med, 2001. 194(10): p. 1395-406; and Shoukry, N.H., et al., Memory
10 CD8+ T cells are required for protection from persistent hepatitis C virus infection. J Exp
   Med, 2003. 197(12): p. 1645-55.
           Furthermore, it appears that infected individuals that mount an early, multi- specific,
   intrahepatic CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell response tend to show elimination of
   HCV infection [Lechner, F., et al., Analysis of successful immune responses in persons
15 infected with hepatitis C virus. J Exp Med, 2000. 191(9): p. 1499-512; Gerlach, J.T., et al.,
   Recurrence of hepatitis C virus after loss of virus-specific CD4(+) T-cell response in acute
   hepatitis C. Gastroenterology, 1999. 117(4): p. 933-41 ; Thimme, R., et al., Determinants of
   viral clearance and persistence during acute hepatitis C virus infection. J Exp Med, 2001.
   194(10): p. 1395-406; Grakoui, A., et al., HCV persistence and immune evasion in the
20 absence of memory T cell help. Science, 2003. 302(5645): p. 659-62].
           DNA vaccines have many conceptual advantages over more traditional vaccination
   methods, such as live attenuated viruses and recombinant protein-based vaccines. DNA
   vaccines are safe, stable, easily produced, and well tolerated in humans with preclinical
   trials indicating little evidence of plasmid integration [Martin, T., et al., Plasmid DNA
25 malaria vaccine: the potential for genomic integration after intramuscular injection. Hum
   Gene Ther, 1999. 10(5): p. 759-68; Nichols, W.W., et al., Potential DNA vaccine integration
   into host cell genome. Ann N Y Acad Sci, 1995. 772: p. 30-9]. In addition, DNA vaccines
   are well suited for repeated administration due to the fact that efficacy of the vaccine is not
   influenced by pre-existing antibody titers to the vector [Chattergoon, M., J. Boyer, and D.B.
30 Weiner, Genetic immunization: a new era in vaccines and immune therapeutics. FASEB J,
   1997. 11(10): p. 753-63]. However, one major obstacle for the clinical adoption of DNA

                                                   5
   vaccines has been a decrease in the platforms immunogenicity when moving to larger
   animals [Liu, M.A. and J.B. Ulmer, Human clinical trials of plasmid DNA vaccines. Adv
   Genet, 2005. 55: p. 25-40]. Recent technological advances in the engineering of DNA
   vaccine immunogen, such has codon optimization, RNA optimization and the addition of
 5 immunoglobulin leader sequences have improved expression and immunogenicity of DNA
   vaccines [Andre, S., et al., Increased immune response elicited by DNA vaccination with a
   synthetic gpl20 sequence with optimized codon usage. J Virol, 1998. 72(2): p. 1497-503;
   Demi, L., et al., Multiple effects of codon usage optimization on expression and
   immunogenicity of DNA candidate vaccines encoding the human immunodeficiency virus
10 type 1 Gag protein. J Virol, 2001. 75(22): p. 10991-1001; Laddy, D.J., et al.,
   Immunogenicity of novel consensus-based DNA vaccines against avian influenza. Vaccine,
   2007. 25(16): p. 2984-9; Frelin, L., et al., Codon optimization and mRNA amplification
   effectively enhances the immunogenicity of the hepatitis C virus nonstructural 3/4A gene.
   Gene Ther, 2004. 11(6): p. 522-33], as well as, recently developed technology in plasmid
15 delivery systems such as electroporation [Hirao, L.A., et al., Intradermal/subcutaneous
   immunization by electroporation improves plasmid vaccine delivery and potency in pigs and
   rhesus macaques. Vaccine, 2008. 26(3): p. 440-8; Luckay, A., et al., Effect of plasmid DNA
   vaccine design and in vivo electroporation on the resulting vaccine-specific immune
   responses in rhesus macaques. J Virol, 2007. 81(10): p. 5257-69; Ahlen, G., et al., In vivo
20 electroporation enhances the immunogenicity of hepatitis C virus nonstructural 3/4A DNA
   by increased local DNA uptake, protein expression, inflammation, and infiltration of CD3+
   T cells. J Immunol, 2007. 179(7): p. 4741-53]. In addition, studies have suggested that the
   use of consensus immunogens may be able to increase the breadth of the cellular immune
   response as compared to native antigens alone [Yan., J., et al., Enhanced cellular immune
25 responses elicited by an engineered HIV-1 subtype B consensus-based envelope DNA
   vaccine. Mol Ther, 2007. 15(2): p. 411-21 ; Rolland, M., et al., Reconstruction and function
   of ancestral center-of-tree human immunodeficiency virus type 1 proteins. J Virol, 2007.
   81(16): p. 8507-14].
          DNA vaccines encoding HCV NS3 and NS4 are disclosed in Lang, K.A. et al. Vaccine

           Therefore, there still remains a need for an effective vaccine against HCV. Also, there
   still remains a need for effective methods of treating individuals infected with HCV.Any

   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
20        Figure 1: Dose response for pConNS4B, pConNS5A and pConNS5B. Animals (n=5)
   were immunized with either, 5pig, 12.5ptg or 25tg of either pConNS4B, pConNS5A and
   pConNS5B. Animals received a total of two intramuscular immunizations followed by
   electroporation with each immunization given two weeks apart. Animals were sacrificed one
   week following the last immunization after which the splenocytes were individually isolated
25 and analyzed. The response of each individual animal was determined through the use of an
   IFN-7 ELISpot assay from which the optimum dose of each construct was determined.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
         As used herein, the phrase "stringent hybridization conditions" or "stringent
   conditions" refers to conditions under which a nucleic acid molecule will hybridize another
15 nucleic acid molecule, but to no other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence
   dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize
   specifically at higher temperatures. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about
   5'C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic
   strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH and nucleic
20 acid concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target sequence
   hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium. Since the target sequences are generally
   present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium. Typically, stringent
   conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion,
   typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature
25 is at least about 30' C. for short probes, primers or oligonucleotides (e.g. 10 to 50
   nucleotides) and at least about 60'C. for longer probes, primers or oligonucleotides.
   Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents, such as
   formamide.
         Sequence homology for nucleotides and amino acids may be determined using
30 FASTA, BLAST and Gapped BLAST (Altschul et al., Nuc. Acids Res., 1997, 25, 3389,
   which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) and PAUP* 4.0b10 software (D. L.

                                                  10
   Swofford, Sinauer Associates, Massachusetts). "Percentage of similarity" is calculated using
   PAUP* 4.OMO software (D. L. Swofford, Sinauer Associates, Massachusetts). The average
   similarity of the consensus sequence is calculated compared to all sequences in the
   phylogenic tree.
 5         Briefly, the BLAST algorithm, which stands for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool is
   suitable for determining sequence similarity (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403
   410, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Software for performing
   BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology
   Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identifying high
10 scoring sequence pair (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence
   that either match or satisfy some positive- valued threshold score T when aligned with a
   word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word
   score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for
   initiating searches to find HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both
15 directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be
   increased. Extension for the word hits in each direction are halted when: 1) the cumulative
   alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; 2) the
   cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative
   scoring residue alignments; or 3) the end of either sequence is reached. The Blast algorithm
20 parameters W, T and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The Blast
   program uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see
   Henikoff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1992, 89, 10915-10919, which is incorporated
   herein by reference in its entirety) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=4,
   and a comparison of both strands. The BLAST algorithm (Karlin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
25 Sci. USA, 1993, 90, 5873-5787, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety)
   and Gapped BLAST perform a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences.
   One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability
   (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two
   nucleotide sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered

         When taken up by a cell, the genetic construct(s) may remain present in the cell as a.
   functioning extrachromosomal molecule and/or integrate into the cell's chromosomal DNA.
 5 DNA may be introduced into cells where it remains as separate genetic material in the form
   of a plasmid or plasmids. Alternatively, linear DNA that can integrate into the chromosome
   may be introduced into the cell. When introducing DNA into the cell, reagents that promote
   DNA integration into chromosomes may be added. DNA sequences that are useful to
   promote integration may also be included in the DNA molecule. Alternatively, RNA may be
10 administered to the cell. It is also contemplated to provide the genetic construct as a linear
   minichromosome including a centromere, telomeres and an origin of replication. Gene
   constructs may remain part of the genetic material in attenuated live microorganisms or
   recombinant microbial vectors which live in cells. Gene constructs may be part of genomes
   of recombinant viral vaccines where the genetic material either integrates into the
15 chromosome of the cell or remains extrachromosomal. Genetic constructs include regulatory
   elements necessary for gene expression of a nucleic acid molecule. The elements include: a
   promoter, an initiation codon, a stop codon, and a polyadenylation signal. In addition,
   enhancers are often required for gene expression of the sequence that encodes the target
   protein or the immunomodulating protein. It is necessary that these elements be operable
20 linked to the sequence that encodes the desired proteins and that the regulatory elements are
   operably in the individual to whom they are administered.
         Initiation codons and stop codon are generally considered to be part of a nucleotide
   sequence that encodes the desired protein. However, it is necessary that these elements are
   functional in the individual to whom the gene construct is administered. The initiation and
25 termination codons must be in frame with the coding sequence. Promoters and
   polyadenylation signals used must be functional within the cells of the individual.
         Examples of promoters useful to practice the present invention, especially in the
   production of a genetic vaccine for humans, include but are not limited to promoters from
   Simian Virus 40 (SV40), Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) promoter, Human
30 Immunodeficiency Virus (MV) such as the BIV Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) promoter,
   Moloney virus, ALV, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) such as the CMV immediate early promoter,

                                                  20
   Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) as well as promoters from human
   genes such as human Actin, human Myosin, human Hemoglobin, human muscle creatine
   and human metalothionein.
         Examples of polyadenylation signals useful to practice the present invention,
 5 especially in the production of a genetic vaccine for humans, include but are not limited to
   SV40 polyadenylation signals and LTR polyadenylation signals. In particular, the SV40
   polyadenylation signal that is in pCEP4 plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego CA), referred to as
   the SV40 polyadenylation signal, is used.
         In addition to the regulatory elements required for DNA expression, other elements
10 may also be included in the DNA molecule. Such additional elements include enhancers.
   The enhancer may be selected from the group including but not limited to: human Actin,
   human Myosin, human Hemoglobin, human muscle creatine and viral enhancers such as
   those from CMV, RSV and EBV.
         Genetic constructs can be provided with mammalian origin of replication in order to
15 maintain the construct extrachromosomally and produce multiple copies of the construct in
   the cell. Plasmids pVAX1, pCEP4 and pREP4 from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) contain the
   Epstein Barr virus origin of replication and nuclear antigen EBNA-1 coding region which
   produces high copy episomal replication without integration.
         In some preferred embodiments related to immunization applications, nucleic acid
20 molecule(s) are delivered which include nucleotide sequences that encode protein of the
   invention , and, additionally, genes for proteins which further enhance the immune response

   fragments thereof.
          An additional element may be added which serves as a target for cell destruction if it is
   desirable to eliminate cells receiving the genetic construct for any reason. A herpes
   thymidine kinase (tk) gene in an expressible form can be included in the genetic construct.
10 The drug gangcyclovir can be administered to the individual and that drug will cause the
   selective killing of any cell producing tk, thus, providing the means for the selective
   destruction of cells with the genetic construct.
          In order to maximize protein production, regulatory sequences may be selected which
   are well suited for gene expression in the cells the construct is administered into. Moreover,
15 codons may be selected which are most efficiently transcribed in the cell. One having
   ordinary skill in the art can produce DNA constructs that are functional in the cells.
          In some embodiments, gene constructs may be provided in which the coding
   sequences for the proteins described herein are linked to IgE signal peptide. In some
   embodiments, proteins described herein are linked to IgE signal peptide.
20        In some embodiments for which protein is used, for example, one having ordinary
   skill in the art can, using well known techniques, produce and isolate proteins of the
   invention using well known techniques. In some embodiments for which protein is used, for
   example, one having ordinary skill in the art can, using well known techniques, inserts DNA
   molecules that encode a protein of the invention into a commercially available expression
25 vector for use in well known expression systems. For example, the commercially available
   plasmid pSE420 (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) may be used for production of protein in E.
   coli. The commercially available plasmid pYES2 (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) may, for
   example, be used for production in S. cerevisiae strains of yeast. The commercially available
   MAXBACTM complete baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) may,
30 for example, be used for production in insect cells. The commercially available plasmid
   pcDNA I or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) may, for example, be used for

                                                 22
   production in mammalian cells such as Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. One having ordinary
   skill in the art can use these commercial expression vectors and systems or others to produce
   protein by routine techniques and readily available starting materials. (See e.g., Sambrook et
   al., Molecular Cloning a Laboratory Manual, Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press (1989)
 5 which is incorporated herein by reference.) Thus, the desired proteins can be prepared in
   both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, resulting in a spectrum of processed forms of the
   protein.
          One having ordinary skill in the art may use other commercially available expression
   vectors and systems or produce vectors using well known methods and readily available
10 starting materials. Expression systems containing the requisite control sequences, such as
   promoters and polyadenylation signals, and preferably enhancers are readily available and
   known in the art for a variety of hosts. See e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning a
   Laboratory Manual, Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press (1989). Genetic constructs
   include the protein coding sequence operably linked to a promoter that is functional in the
15 cell line into which the constructs are transfected. Examples of constitutive promoters
   include promoters from cytomegalovirus or SV40. Examples of inducible promoters include
   mouse mammary leukemia virus or metallothionein promoters. Those having ordinary skill
   in the art can readily produce genetic constructs useful for transfecting with cells with DNA
   that encodes protein of the invention from readily available starting materials. The
20 expression vector including the DNA that encodes the protein is used to transform the
   compatible host which is then cultured and maintained under conditions wherein expression
   of the foreign DNA takes place.
          The protein produced is recovered from the culture, either by lysing the cells or from
   the culture medium as appropriate and known to those in the art. One having ordinary skill
25 in the art can, using well known techniques, isolate protein that is produced using such
   expression systems. The methods of purifying protein from natural sources using antibodies
   which specifically bind to a specific protein as described above may be equally applied to
   purifying protein produced by recombinant DNA methodology.
          In addition to producing proteins by recombinant techniques, automated peptide
30 synthesizers may also be employed to produce isolated, essentially pure protein. Such

                                                  23
   techniques are well known to those having ordinary skill in the art and are useful if
   derivatives which have substitutions not provided for in DNA-encoded protein production.
          The nucleic acid molecules may be delivered using any of several well known
   technologies including DNA injection (also referred to as DNA vaccination), recombinant
 5 vectors such as recombinant adenovirus, recombinant adenovirus associated virus and
   recombinant vaccinia.
          Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, intramuscular, intranasally,
   intraperitoneal, intradermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterially, intraoccularly and
   oral as well as topically, transdermally, by inhalation or suppository or to mucosal tissue
10 such as by lavage to vaginal, rectal, urethral, buccal and sublingual tissue. Preferred routes
   of administration include intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal and subcutaneous
   injection. Genetic constructs may be administered by means including, but not limited to,
   electroporation methods and devices, traditional syringes, needleless injection devices, or
   "microprojectile bombardment gone guns".
15        Examples of electroporation devices and electroporation methods preferred for
   facilitating delivery of the DNA vaccines, include those described in U.S. Patent No.
   7,245,963 by Draghia-Akli, et al., U.S. Patent Pub. 2005/0052630 submitted by Smith, et al.,
   the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Also preferred,
   are electroporation devices and electroporation methods for facilitating delivery of the DNA
20 vaccines provided in co-pending and co-owned U.S. Patent Application, Serial No.

   Provisional Applications Ser. Nos. 60/852,149, filed October 17, 2006, and 60/978,982,
   filed October 10, 2007, all of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety.
          The following is an example of an embodiment using electroporation technology, and
25 is discussed in more detail in the patent references discussed above: electroporation devices
   can be configured to deliver to a desired tissue of a mammal a pulse of energy producing a
   constant current similar to a preset current input by a user. The electroporation device
   comprises an electroporation component and an electrode assembly or handle assembly. The
   electroporation component can include and incorporate one or more of the various elements
30 of the electroporation devices, including: controller, current waveform generator, impedance
   tester, waveform logger, input element, status reporting element, communication port,

                                                 24
   memory component, power source, and power switch. The electroporation component can
   function as one element of the electroporation devices, and the other elements are separate
   elements (or components) in communication with the electroporation component. In some
   embodiments, the electroporation component can function as more than one element of the
 5 electroporation devices, which can be in communication with still other elements of the
   electroporation   devices separate   from the electroporation     component.    The use of
   electroporation technology to deliver the improved HCV vaccine is not limited by the
   elements of the electroporation devices existing as parts of one electromechanical or
   mechanical device, as the elements can function as one device or as separate elements in
10 communication with one another. The electroporation component is capable of delivering
   the pulse of energy that produces the constant current in the desired tissue, and includes a
   feedback mechanism. The electrode assembly includes an electrode array having a plurality
   of electrodes in a spatial arrangement, wherein the electrode assembly receives the pulse of
   energy from the electroporation component and delivers same to the desired tissue through
15 the electrodes. At least one of the plurality of electrodes is neutral during delivery of the
   pulse of energy and measures impedance in the desired tissue and communicates the
   impedance to the electroporation component. The feedback mechanism can receive the
   measured impedance and can adjust the pulse of energy delivered by the electroporation
   component to maintain the constant current.
20        In some embodiments, the plurality of electrodes can deliver the pulse of energy in a
   decentralized pattern. In some embodiments, the plurality of electrodes can deliver the pulse
   of energy in the decentralized pattern through the control of the electrodes under a
   programmed sequence, and the programmed sequence is input by a user to the
   electroporation component. In some embodiments, the programmed sequence comprises a
25 plurality of pulses delivered in sequence, wherein each pulse of the plurality of pulses is
   delivered by at least two active electrodes with one neutral electrode that measures
   impedance, and wherein a subsequent pulse of the plurality of pulses is delivered by a
   different one of at least two active electrodes with one neutral electrode that measures
   impedance.
30        In some embodiments, the feedback mechanism is performed by either hardware or
   software. Preferably, the feedback mechanism is performed by an analog closed-loop circuit.

                                                 25
   Preferably, this feedback occurs every 50 p8, 20 pt8, 10 p8 or 1 t8, but is preferably a real
   time feedback or instantaneous (i.e., substantially instantaneous as determined by available
   techniques for determining response time). In some embodiments, the neutral electrode
   measures the impedance in the desired tissue and communicates the impedance to the
 5 feedback mechanism, and the feedback mechanism responds to the impedance and adjusts
   the pulse of energy to maintain the constant current at a value similar to the preset current.
   In some embodiments, the feedback mechanism maintains the constant current continuously
   and instantaneously during the delivery of the pulse of energy.
          In some embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule is delivered to the cells in
10 conjunction with administration of a polynucleotide function enhancer or a genetic vaccine
   facilitator agent. Polynucleotide function enhancers are described in U.S. Serial Number
   5,593,972, 5,962,428 and International Application Serial Number PCT/US94/00899 filed
   January 26, 1994, which are each incorporated herein by reference. Genetic vaccine
   facilitator agents are described in US. Serial Number 021,579 filed April 1, 1994, which is
15 incorporated herein by reference. The co-agents that are administered in conjunction with
   nucleic acid molecules may be administered as a mixture with the nucleic acid molecule or
   administered separately simultaneously, before or after administration of nucleic acid
   molecules. In addition, other agents which may function transfecting agents and/or
   replicating agents and/or inflammatory agents and which may be co- administered with a
20 GVF include growth factors, cytokines and lymphokines such as a-interferon, gamma
   interferon, GM-CSF, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), TNF, epidermal growth factor

15 EXAMPLE
   Example 1
   Design and expression ofpConNS4B, pConNS5A and pConNS5B
          The HCV genotype la consensus sequences for HCV proteins NS4B, NS5A and NS5B
   were generated from 170 different sequences obtained from the Los Alamos National
20 Laboratory HCV Sequence Database. Several modification were then made to the consensus
   constructs in order to enhance their expression and detection, including the addition of IgE
   leader sequence at the C-term and an HA-tag at the N-term of each construct. Additionally,
   each construct was further modified through codon and RNA optimization using
   GeneOptimizerTM (GENEART, Germany) and subcloned in to the clinical expression vector
25 pVAX under the control a CMV promoter. The final constructs were named pConNS4B,
   pConNS5A and pConNS5B (plasmid maps shown in Figures 8A-8C).
          Protein expression of each construct was confirmed through transient transfection of
   human RD muscle cells with each individual construct. RD muscles cells were transiently
   transfected   with   pConNS4B,     pConNS5A       and   pConNS5B      using  Lipofectamine TM
30 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Forty-eight hours following
   transfection, the cells were fixed and permeabilized. Expression of each protein was

                                                 28
   detected with an anti-HA polyclonal rabbit antibody (Invitrogen) followed by a Cy3
   conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen).
          The cells were visualized using confocal microscopy and at 250X magnification
   (images not shown). All three constructs were shown to express, pConNS4B showed the
 5 highest number of transfected cells while pConNS5B showed the least. Transfection with
   the empty vector pVax was used as a control.
   Example 2
   Immunization of C57BL/6 Mice with pConNS4B, pConNS5A and pConNS5B induces strong
10 cellular immune responses
          Once expression of the constructs was confirmed, C57BL/6 mice were immunized in
   order to determine immunogenicity of the constructs. Six to eight week old female C57BL/6
   mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and were maintained in accordance with
   the National Institutes of Health and the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Care and
15 Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. Animals were separated into three different dosing
   groups for each individual construct with five animals per group. The animals were
   immunized intramuscularly with either 5tg, 12.5tg or 25tg of pConNS4B, pConNS5A or
   pConNS5B, followed by electroporation.
          Electroporation was performed using the CELLECTRATM adaptive constant current
20 electroporation device and electrode arrays (Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Blue Bell, PA).
          The animals received a total of two immunizations, two weeks apart and were
   sacrificed one week following the second immunization. The immunogenicity of the
   constructs was determine with the use of IFN-7 ELISpot assays.
          The mouse IFN-7 ELISpot assays were conducted as previously described in Yan, J.,
25 et al., Enhanced cellular immune responses elicited by an engineered HIV-1 subtype B
   consensus-based envelope DNA vaccine. Mol Ther, 2007. 15(2): p. 411-21. The splenocytes
   were stimulated with pools of 15mer peptides over lapping by 8 amino acids and spanning
   the length of each construct. Peptides were synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ),
   resuspended in DMSO and pooled at a concentration of 2 tg/ml/peptide. The splenocytes
30 were plated at a concentration of 200,000 cells per well. Results were adjusted and graphed

                                                 29
   as the average number of spot forming units (SFU) per 1x1O^6 splenocytes. The results of
   can be seen in figure 1.
          The immunogenicity of the constructs correlated well with the constructs' expression
   levels   as  determined   by immunoflorescence.       While   all constructs  were   strongly
 5 immunogenic, responses for pConNS4B was the largest while responses for pConNS5B
   were the least. The optimum dose; for pConNS4B was 12^g (1687 + 237 SFU/10A6
   splenocytes), for pConNS5A was 5jig (1091           + 111 SFU/10A6 splenocytes) and for
   pConNS5B was 12^g (736 + 136 SFU/10A6 splenocytes).
          Once the dosing for each construct was determined, a more detailed analysis of the
10 cellular immune responses induced by each construct was performed. The animals were
   immunized and grouped as previously described. Following sacrifice, the spleens were
   isolated and individually crushed with the use of a Stomacher device. The splenocytes were
   strained with a 40pM cell strainer and treated 5min with ACK lysis buffer (Biosource) to
   clear the RBCs. The splenocytes were resuspended in complete media (RPMI 1640 with
15 2mM/L L-glutamine supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, IX anti-biotic/anti
   mycotic,    and   55pLM/L   p-mercaptoethanol).    Cell  number   was   determined   with   a
   hemocytometer.
          In order to determine the relative contributions of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses
   for each constructs splenocytes were intracellularly stained for IFN-y and visualized with
20 flow cytometry, figure 2. Results of the intracellular cytokine staining correlated well with
   those previously seen with the IFN-y ELISpot assay. Responses for pConNS4B were the
   greatest, while pConNS5B was the least immunogenic. The majority of the IFN-7 responses
   to pConNS4B and pConNS5A was produced by CD8+ T cells, although CD4+ T cells
   specific for each construct were also identified. Interestingly, the majority of the IFN-y
25 response to pConNS5B was CD4+ T cell mediated, with few IFN-y+ CD8+ T cells
   identified.
          The average percentage of IFN-y+ CD4+ T cells for pConNS4B, pConNS5A and
   pConNS5B were 0.50% ± 0.11%, 0.27% ± 0.06% and 0.32% ± 0.11%, respectively, figure
   3A. The average percentage of IFN-y+ CD8+ T cells for pConNS4B and pConNS5A were
30 3.29% ± 1.33% and 0.68% ± 0.22%, respectively, figure 3B.

                                                 30
   Example 3
   Immunization induced NS4B-, NS5A- and NS5B- specific T cells were detected within the
   liver following intramuscularimmunization
          Mice were immunized as previously described in Example 1 , above. One week
 5 following the final immunization, the animals were sacrificed. Following sacrifice, the livers
   were isolated and individually pulverized using a Stomacher machine. The resulting mixture
   was strained and treated 5min with 10ml ACK lysis buffer (Bioscience) in order to clear the
   RBCs. The mixture was pelleted and the hepatocytes were separated from the lymphocytes
   through the use of a 35% percoll gradient. The pelleted lymphocytes were resuspended in
10 complete media. Experiments were performed with and without liver perfusion, and no
   differences were observed.
          T cells were isolated from each liver and were stimulated with over-lapping peptides
   corresponding to each individual construct. Immunization induced HCV-specific T cells
   were identified by IFN-7 expression detected through intracellular cytokine staining and
15 flow cytometry. Each animal was analyzed individually. Interestingly, HCV-specific T cells
   were identified in the livers of all immunized mice. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses
   were detected within the livers of mice immunized with pConNS4B and pConNS5A, with
   only CD4+ T cell responses detected in mice immunized with pConNS5B. The dominant T
   cell responses detected within the liver were the same as those identified within the spleen.
20 Mice immunized with pConNS4B and pConNS5A had strong CD8+ T cell responses within
   the liver, while mice immunized with pConNS5B showed mainly CD4+ T cell responses
   and few CD8+ T cells responses. The CD4+ T cell responses for pConNS4B, pConNS5A
   and pConNS5B were 0.29% ± 0.07%, 0.41% ± 0.09% and 0.41% ± 0.06%, respectively,
   figure 4A. The CD8+ T cell responses for pConNS4B, pConNS5A and pConNS5B were
25 3.73% ± 0.73%, 2.28% ± 0.68% and 0.06% ± 0.02%, respectively, figure 4B.

   3.4 Liver-specific expression of HCV antigens by hepatocytes resulted in increased IFN-y
   production and clearanceof transfected hepatocytes
30        Next we sought to determine whether liver- specific expression of either NS4B, NS5A
   or NS5B proteins could activate the HCV-specific T cells detected within the liver. In order

                                                31
   to induce liver-specific expression of NS4B, NS5A and NS5B, the hepatocytes of
   immunized mice were transfected by administering a tail vein injection of either pConNS4B,
   pConNS5A or pConNS5B as previously described in Ahlen, G., et al., In vivo clearance of
   hepatitis C virus nonstructural 3/4A-expressing hepatocytes by DNA vaccine-primed
 5 cytotoxic T lymphocytes. J Infect Dis, 2005. 192(12): p. 2112-6. The livers were allowed to
   transfect for 48 hours, after which they were harvested and the liver lymphocytes were
   isolated as described in Example 3, above. As mentioned before, immunization induced
   HCV-specific T cells were identified by IFN-y secretion detected through intracellular
   cytokine staining and flow cytometry.

   IntracellularCytokine Staining
          Splenocytes were resuspended in complete media at a concentration of lxi 0 A 6
   cells/100pL and plated in a round bottom 96-well plate. Splenocytes were either stimulated
   with 100tL of either: 1) 2pig/nl pConNS4B, pConNS5A or pConNS5B overlapping
15 peptides, 2) 1pig/ml Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (positive control; Sigma- Aldrich, St.
   Louis, MO) or 3) 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (negative control) all diluted in complete media
   supplemented with GolgiStop and GolgiPlug (BD Bioscience). Splenocytes were stimulated
   for a total of 5 hours at 37C following which the cells were washed three times with PBS
   and stained for viability. Splenocytes were stained extracellularly for surface markers; anti
20 CD4, CD8 for 30min at 4C. Following which splenocytes were permeabilized and washed
   using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution Kit (BD Bioscience) and then stained intracellularly
   with anti-IFN-y and CD3 for 45min at 4C. After staining, splenocytes were fixed with 1%
   paraformaldehyde and stored at 4C until analysis. Specific function was reported as the
   percent function of the peptide stimulated group minus the percent function of the 0.1%
25 dimethyl sulfoxide stimulated group (negative control) for each animal.
   Flow Cytometry Reagents
          The following directly     conjugated   antibodies   were used:     anti-mouse   CD3
   allophycocyanin cyanine dye 7 (APC-Cy7) [clone 145-C 11], anti-mouse CD4- fluorescein
30 isothiocyanate (FITC) [clone H129.19], anti-mouse CD8- peridinin chlorophyll protein 5.5
   (PerCP5.5) [clone 53-6.7], anti-mouse IFN-y- phycoerythryin cyanine dye 7 (PE-Cy7)

                                                   32
   [clone XMG1.2] (all from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Aqua Live/Dead fixable dead
   cell Stain Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used according to manufactor's protocol
   to identify live cells.
          Samples were collected on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes,
 5 NJ). BD CompBeads          (BD Biosciences)       and single fluorochromes        were   used for
   compensation. Data was analyzed using Flow Jo software, version 8.7.1 for Mac, (Tree Star,
   Ashland, OR).
          Following the tail vein injections, a massive increase in the percentage of both CD4+
   and CD8+ HCV-specific T cells was seen in all three immunization groups as compared to
10 the percentage of HCV-specific T cells detected in both spleen and the resting liver, figure 5.
   The percentage of CD4+ HCV-specific T cells was 2.27% ± 0.70%, 2.55% ± 0.70% and
   1.22% ± 0.22% for mice immunized with pConNS4B, pConNS5A and pConNS5B,
   respectively, figure 6A. The percentage of CD8+ HCV-specific T cells was 9.46% ± 1.53%,
   6.98% ± 0.48% and 0.477% ± 0.16% for mice immunized with pConNS4B, pConNS5A and
15 pConNS5B, respectively, figure 6B. The largest fold increase, as determined by the
   percentage of HCV-specific IFN-y-i- T cells in the liver before and after tail vein injection,
   was seen with the CD4+ T cell response. The fold increase in the intrahepatic CD4+ T cell
   response in pConNS4B, pConNS5A and pConNS5B immunized mice was approximately 8,
   6 and 3 fold, respectively. While the CD8+ T cell response remained the dominant response
20 in the liver both before and after tail vein injection, a slightly smaller fold increase was seen
   with the CD8+ T cells response as compared to the CD4+ T cells response. The fold
   increase in the intrahepatic CD8+ T cell response in pConNS4B, pConNS5A and
   pConNS5B immunized mice was approximately 3, 3 and 8 fold, respectively.
         After assessing the intrahepatic HCV-specific IFN-y responses generated by each
25 construct, studies were performed to determine whether immunization had generated
   inhepatic cytotoxic HCV-specific T cell as well. A lobe of liver was obtained from each
   animal in each group and was stained for hepatocyte expression of either NS4B, NS5A or
   NS5B. Cytotoxicity of the intrahepatic T cell response generated by immunization with each
   construct was assessed by the ability of each immunized animal following transfection to
30 clear either NS4B, NS5A or NS5B expressing hepatocytes when compared to transfected

                                                33
   immunization naive controls. Representative confocal images of this staining for each group
   were observed (images not shown).
   Confocal Microscopy
 5        Livers were dissected and biopsies were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde followed by
   overnight cryoprotection in 30% sucrose. Biopsies were immersed in Tissue-Tek OCT
   (Bayer Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA) and were quick frozen in 2-methyl butane on dry ice
   nitrogen. Staining was performed on tissue sections (6pxni) mounted on Superfiost Plus glass
   slides   (Fisher Scientific,  Pittsburgh, PA), and kept at       80'C until use. Before
10 immunofluorescent staining, slides were brought to room temperature and washed three
   times, 10 minutes each in phosphate -buffered saline (PBS), and blocked in PBS containing
   10% normal serum of the species in which the secondary reagent was raised, and 0.1%
   Triton. Primary re-agents were applied to sections and incubated for 1 hour at room
   temperature or overnight at 4'C. The sections were washed three times, 10 minutes each in
15 PBS, and, where necessary, secondary reagents were applied for 30 minutes at room
   temperature. The sections were again washed three times, 10 minutes each in PBS.
          Coverslips were mounted with Prolong Gold mounting media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
   CA) and slides kept in the dark at 4'C until studied and photographed. All staining was
   performed in a humidified environment. Antibodies used were obtained from Invitrogen or
20 alternatively a competitor company that manufacturers antibodies.. All images were
   obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted confocal microscope and analysis and
   quantification of florescence intensities was conducted using Image J software (NIH,
   Rockville, MD).
          Clearance of transfected hepatocytes for each group was quantified by the mean
25 florescent intensity (MFI) of either NS4B, NS5A or NS5B expression normalized by the
   number of hepatocytes present within each field as measured by the MFI of nuclear DAPI
   staining, figure 9. Compared to the naive control, dramatic reductions in the number of
   transfected heaptocytes were seen in animals immunized groups for all three constructs.
   Animals immunized with pConNS4B, pConNS5A or pConNS5B had approximately 9, 3
30 and 2 fold reductions in transfected hepatocyte expression compared to naive controls. The
   amount of clearance observed in each immunization group correlated well with the HCV-

                                                   34
   specific CD8+ T cell response detected within the transfected livers. The largest amount of
   clearance was observed in animals immunized with pConNS4B and the least clearance was
   seen in pConNS5B immunized animals.
          The results provided show that HCV-specific T cell induced through systemic
 5 immunization are recruited into the liver in the absence of liver-specific expression of
   cognate antigen leading to the formation of a large pool of intrahepatic HCV-specific T
   cells. These T cells remain fully functional within the liver suggesting that their recruitment
   to the resting liver may function instead as part of the continual process of immune
   surveillance and may prove to be an important mechanism by which the liver guards against
10 infection. In support of this, in response to liver-specific expression of HCV antigens, this
   population of liver localized HCV-specific T cells were able to rapidly induce IFN-7
   expression and clear transfected hepatocytes. Since it has been previously reported that T
   cell infiltration is not observed until 72 hours following liver transfection (Ahlen et al.,
   supra), the rapid clearance of HCV transfected hepatocytes appears to be likely dependent
15 on the liver localized HCV-specific T cell population present within the liver prior to
   transfection. Additionally, as seen in animals immunized with pConNS5B even a relatively
   small percentage of vaccine- specific responses as measured by IFN-y production was
   sufficient to induce a large 2 fold reduction of transfected hepatocytes within the liver,
   suggesting that small percentages of vaccine-specific as detected in the periphery have the
20 ability to exert massive effects within the liver.
          Liver- induced T cell tolerance can be subverted through systemic immunization and
   that effective liver-specific immunity can be achieved by taking advantage of the ability of
   the liver to both recruit and sequester antigen-specific T cells under resting conditions. This
   unique property of the liver may be exploited to boost HCV-specific responses in patients
25 already infected with the virus, as well as, to create a pool of HCV-specific T cells within
   the livers of naive individual that have the ability to rapidly respond and mobilize upon the
   first signs of infection. Taken together, the findings suggest the recruitment of antigen
   specific T cells to the liver, along with preservation of their effector function within the liver
   may play an important and previously unappreciated role in the process of immune
30 surveillance, which may be exploited for future T cell based HCV vaccines.
