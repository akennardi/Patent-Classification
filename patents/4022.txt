                                                 ABSTRACT
                A gaming machine              (100) and method comprising a
   primary game                     (101) with a plurality of gaming symbols and
 5 a separate bonus indicator. Operation of the bonus
   indicator                   (103) is automatically initiated upon
   commencement of the primary game and play of the bonus
   indicator is of approximately the same duration as play of
   the primary game. The outcome of the bonus indicator may
10 be entirely independent of the outcome of the primary
   game. A positive outcome on the bonus indicator may yield
   either a prize                     for the player or an opportunity to play a
   bonus round game. In its preferred embodiment, the
   invention includes a five-reel                      slot game as the primary
15 game and a                   single-reel    slot game as the bonus indicator.

           GAMING APPARATUS AND METHOD HAVING A SEPARATE BUT
                       SIMULTANEOUSLY       OPERATING BONUS   INDICATOR
 5 FIELD OF THE                INVENTION
           The present invention relates to a gaming apparatus
   and method in which there is a primary or base game and a
   separate symbol or indicator of a bonusing game.
10
   BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           Many existing gaming machines include a primary or
   base game and one or more bonus games wherein the bonus
15 game is initiated when the player reaches a bonus
   triggering event in the primary game of the gaming device.
   These bonus rounds provide players with additional
   opportunities to accumulate winnings and are beneficial
   for attracting and keeping players at gaming machines.
20         In       slot machines with reels, the bonus triggering
   event usually occurs when the player reaches a
   predetermined combination of symbols                  on the reels or when
   a specified bonusing symbol                  is displayed on one or more
   reels. The bonus triggering combination may be the                     same or
25 different             from the predetermined combination that defines
   whether the player has won the primary game. Regardless,
   the   same reels are used to indicate both whether the
   underlying game has been won and whether the player will
   advance to a bonus                round. Thus, the bonus triggering event
30 is not separate from the underlying game.
           Existing patents describe a variety of bonus games.
   These bonus games, however, are almost                   invariably
   triggered and indicated by some event                  occurring in the
   primary game, not by a secondary indicia that serves the
35 sole    function of indicating that a player will go on to a
   bonus round. For instance, U.S. Patents Nos.                    6,033,307,
   6,089,976,              6,461,241,    6,471,208,  6,517,433,   6,533,273,
   5,823,874, 5,848,932, and 5,722,891 all                   describe bonus
   games that are triggered by a qualifying event in the
   994C226_1
        (GHMatter) P88276.AU.4

                                        2
   primary game.
                Other prior art gaming machines do involve the use of
   two different games but, in those inventions, the
   secondary games serve a different purpose and have a
 5 different functionality than the bonus indicator of the
   present invention. Thus, those secondary games are not
   used to indicate whether the player goes on to a bonus
   round, do not operate simultaneously with the primary
   game, and/or do not produce an outcome that is independent
10 of the primary game. U.S. Patent No. 5,393,057 describes a
   primary poker game linked to a secondary bingo game;
   however, the primary and secondary games do not operate
   simultaneously, are not independent of one another, and
   the secondary game is not used to indicate to the player
15 whether she gets to go on to a bonus round. Similarly,
   U.S. Patent No. 5,980,384 describes a primary game linked
   to a secondary game which is played over multiple rounds;
   again, the primary and secondary games do not operate
   simultaneously, are not independent of one another, and
20 the secondary game is not used to indicate to the player
   whether she gets to go on to a bonus round. U.S. Patent
   No. 4,676,506 describes an "odds indicator" that rotates
   simultaneously with the primary game. However, the sole
   purpose of this odds indicator is to provide a multiplier
25 should there be a win in the underlying game;         the odds
   indicator does not indicate that the player gets to play a
   bonus round.
                The presence of a bonus indicator that is separate
   from the primary game creates the appearance of an
30 increased chance of winning. Such a bonus indicator is
   therefore expected to increase player understanding of
   when and how the bonus round is initiated and to increase
   player excitement and participation.
                In accordance with a first aspect of the present
35 invention, there is provided a method for playing a gaming
   machine via a controller, the method comprising:
                playing via the controller a primary game having a
   set of symbols;
                receiving via the controller a wager in the form of
   994C226_1 (GHMatter) P88276.AU.4

                                                   3
   credits;
                in response to receiving wagered credit, 1)
   generating via the controller an outcome from the set of
   symbols, and 2) automatically enabling and initiating via
 5 the controller a separate bonus indicator having a
   different set of symbols, said bonus indicator to operate
   simultaneously with and be non-identical to said primary
   game, to be of approximately the same duration as said
   primary game; and
10              indicating via the controller and independent of said
   outcome of the primary game, a predetermined outcome
   whether a player is entitled to a bonus feature to said
   primary game.
15              A gaming apparatus is also disclosed that comprises:
                a primary game operable upon initiation to provide a
   plurality of symbols as a primary game outcome, said
   primary game having                    (i) a bonus feature,  (ii) a first set
   of symbols                   for determining said primary game outcome, and
20  (iii) a primary game award based on said primary game
   outcome; and
                a bonus indicator separate from and non-identical to
   said primary game, said bonus indicator                     (i) having a
   second set of symbols from which at least one symbol is
25 provided as an indicator outcome for determining an
   awarding of said bonus feature of said primary game upon a
   predetermined indicator outcome,                    (ii) activatable
   automatically upon initiation of said primary game,                      (iii)
   arranged to operate substantially simultaneously with the
30 operation of said primary game and for approximately the
   same duration as said primary game, and                     (iv) arranged to
   indicate, independent of any outcome of the primary game,
   a predetermined result as to whether a player is entitled
   to play a bonus round of at least one additional game so
35 as to accumulate winnings in addition to a said primary
   game award.
                A method of gaming for use with a gaming machine is
   also disclosed, the method comprising:
                wagering credit in a primary game having a bonus
   994C226_1 (GHMatter) P88276.AU.4

                                                     4
   feature;
                initiating said primary game,                said initiating
   including displaying said primary game including a portion
   of a first                   set of symbols;
 5              determining a primary game award based on the portion
   of the first                     set of symbols;  and automatically initiating
   the        operation of a separate bonus indicator when said
   primary game is initiated;
                displaying said bonus indicator including displaying
10 of at least                     one of a second set of symbols,       said
   displaying including providing a predetermined result;
                awarding said bonus              feature based on said second set
   of symbols;
                operating said separate bonus indicator substantially
15 simultaneously with said primary game;
                running said bonus              indicator for approximately the
   same duration as                     said primary game;    and
                indicating said predetermined result                  as to whether a
   player is entitled to said bonus                        feature of said primary
20 game.
                A gaming apparatus is also disclosed that                   comprises:
                a display;
                a primary game having a bonus                feature,    said primary
   game         configured to operate to produce at                 said display a
25 winning primary game outcome;                       and
                a bonus indicator for indicating a predetermined
   result as to whether a player is entitled to play a bonus
   round of at                     least one additional game so as to accumulate
   winnings in addition to a winning of said primary game,
30 and being                   (i) enabled automatically upon initiation of

30
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
                Figure 1 shows a front view of a gaming machine
   constructed in accordance with the present invention.
35 Referring to Figure 1, the gaming machine 100 of the
   present invention comprises a primary game 101 and a
   separate and distinct bonus indicator 103.         This bonus
   indicator 103 may be located on display 102, as shown on
   Fig 1, or it may be placed in a separate location such as
   994C226_1 (GHMatters)P88276.AU.4

                                        6
   in a top box, over the machine or a bank of machines, in
   some other location on the gaming machine or in the
   casino, or on a separate display.
                The primary game 101 may be any type of game,
 5 including card, dice, slot, or other games. Conventional
   input buttons 104 permit a player to make bets, initiate
   the primary game 101, and, when applicable, make other
   game playing choices. Technology that is well-known in the
   art, including a random number generator where applicable,
10 is used to control the outcome of the primary game 101. If
   a player wins the primary game, he may be rewarded with
   money, credits, tokens, or other items of value.
                When a player initiates a primary game 101, the bonus
   indicator 103 is automatically activated. Alternatively,
15 the bonus indicator 103 may only be activated when a
   certain minimum bet is placed by the player. The bonus
   indicator operates at the same time that the underlying
   game is played.
                It is apparent to the player that the two events,
20 play of the primary game and operation of the bonus
   indicator, are occurring substantially simultaneously. The
   primary game will directly yield an immediate reward if
   won;         the bonus indicator, when stopped, will indicate
   whether the player will have an opportunity to potentially
25 accumulate additional winnings during a bonus round of
   some sort or will receive some other secondary award or
   prize. This secondary prize, which may be predetermined or
   random, may consist of credits, money, or casino
   promotional items or messages. The bonus indicator 103 is
30 visually distinct and separate from the primary game 101.
                Operation of the bonus indicator 103 is completed at
   the same time, immediately before, or shortly after play
   of the primary game 101 is completed. Thus, play of the
   primary game and operation of the bonus indicator are
35 events of very similar duration and occur at the same
   time.
                The gaming format of the bonus indicator 103 may be
   different than that of the primary game 101,         such that it
   is apparent to the player that the function of the bonus
   994C226_1 (GHMatter) P88276.AU.4

                                                    7
   indicator 103                     is distinct from that of the primary game
   101.         That          said, however, the bonus indicator may depict      a
   card, dice,                     slot, or other game or indicia. A
   predetermined or random result of the bonus                      indicator 103
 5 will         inform the player that             she has obtained the
   opportunity to receive a secondary prize or participate in
   a bonus round.
                The primary game 101             and the bonus indicator 103 may
   be substantially independent in                      some embodiments of the
10 invention, meaning that it                     is possible for a player to
   attain:                (1) a winning result from both the primary game
   101        and the bonus              indicator 103;  (2) a winning result from
   the primary game 101 but not the bonus indicator 103;                       (3)
   a winning result from the bonus                      indicator 103 but not the
15 primary game 101;                     or (4) a winning result  from neither the
   primary game nor the bonus                     indicator. In other
   embodiments, the outcome of the primary game                      101 may not
   be independent of the outcome of the bonus indicator 103.
   For instance, a positive outcome                      from the bonus indicator
20 103 might only be achieved if there                      is a win in the
   primary game 101.
                The gaming machine of the present invention can be
   produced using electronic components that are conventional
   and in widespread use in the gaming industry. There are
25 many combinations of components which will                      satisfactorily
   produce the desired features. One skilled in the art of
   logic and circuit design can readily make many and varying
   embodiments of the                     invention described herein. The gaming
   machine may be connected to an overall                      casino management
30 system which monitors and controls its operation.
                Figure 2 depicts an embodiment of the primary game
   101        and a bonus indicator 103 of this invention on a
   display 102.                     Referring now to Figure 2,  the primary game
   101        of this embodiment is a slot game consisting of a
35 plurality of reels which may be either mechanical reels                       or
   computer generated images of reels which are displayed on
   a monitor. Each reel contains a plurality of symbols. Any
   recognizable symbol may be depicted on the                      reels,
   including representations of typical                      slot machine symbols,
   994C226_1 (GHMatter) P88276.AU.4

                                          8
   comedians, rock stars, other celebrities, cartoon
   characters, or any of an endless variety of symbols.
   Typically, a random number generator determines the
   outcome of the primary game 101.           If a winning number is
 5 generated for the primary game, the reels will display a
   predetermined winning combination of symbols. Winnings may
   include credits, cash, tokens, or other items of value. A
   preferred embodiment of this invention contains a five
   reel slot game as the primary game 101.
10              In one preferred embodiment, as displayed in Figure
   2, a single reel, which may be either a mechanical reel or
   a computer generated image of a reel, is used as the bonus
   indicator 103. The symbols 105 on the single reel bonus
   indicator 103 may be the same or different from the
15 symbols 106 of the reels of the primary game 101. The
   bonus indicator could also be any of a wide variety of
   other games or symbols, such as a playing card, a roulette
   type wheel, a rolling die, etc. As with the primary game
   101, a random number generator may determine the outcome
20 to be displayed by the bonus indicator 103.           Similarly, a
   random number generator may determine the bonus prize
   amount or said amount may be predetermined.
                The method of the present invention is practiced when
   a player initiates the primary game 101 by placing a wager
25 and/or pressing the appropriate input buttons 104 to begin
   play. By starting the primary game 101, or by placing a
   predetermined minimum bet in the primary game 101,            the
   player automatically activates the bonus indicator 103. In
   a preferred embodiment, the primary game 101 is a five
30 reel slot game and the bonus indicator 103 is a single
   reel. The single reel bonus indicator 103           simultaneously
   spins as the reels of the primary game 101 also spin. The
   primary game is won if a predetermined combination of
   symbols are achieved.            Additionally, the player may
35 achieve a positive outcome from the bonus indicator, which
   means that he will immediately attain a secondary prize of
   any of a wide variety of possible prizes or go on to a
   bonus round.
                In another embodiment, a gaming machine may be linked
   994C226_1 (GHMatters)P88276.AU.4

                                          9
   to other gaming machines to create a bank of hyperlinked
   gaming machines, i.e.,           group of interconnected gaming
   machines that share a common jackpot. In this hyperlinked
   embodiment, each gaming machine contributes toward and
 5 competes for a bonus, such as a progressive bonus, and the
   bonus indicator indicates which of the machines in the
   link, if any, wins the bonus
   prize or round.
                The bonus indicator could also be used to show
10 participation in a linked group of games, such as when the
   games are competing in a tournament. In such an
   embodiment, the first player in the tournament group to
   get a predefined or random indicia on the bonus indicator
   may win one or more prizes, including but not limited to,
15 a random jackpot, an opportunity to play a bonus round,
   and/or a predefined jackpot.
                The preceding examples of possible games and bonus
   indicators are provided only to describe some preferred
   embodiments of the invention. The invention, however, is
20 not limited to the games or symbols described above. Those
   examples are intended to describe the new and unique
   features of the invention, the scope of which is defined
