                                FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0003]      The present invention relates to a method of maintaining, treating and/or
improving cognitive function. In particular, the method relates to administering (R)-7
chloro-N-(quinuclidin-3-yl)benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamide,        or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof, to a patient in need thereof, for example a patient diagnosed with
having Alzheimer's disease, that may derive a benefit therefrom.
                                       BACKGROUND
[0004]      For many, Alzheimer's disease is the number one medical issue facing our
aging society. It is typically thought to be a late onset neurodegenerative disease that
impairs memory and cognitive performance. Symptoms frequently include decreased
functional capacity and negative psychological attributes (e.g., depression, anxiety) in
association with the memory and cognition deficits.
[0005]      The prevalence of dementia in North America is approximately 6 to 10% of
the population, with Alzheimer's disease accounting for a substantial portion of these
cases. This illness represents a steadily growing medical and social problem of our aging
societies around the World. Some believe the main pathological features may relate to
intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, formation of amyloid beta plaques and/or
neurodegeneration of mainly cholinergic and, in later stages, also serotonergic,
noradrenergic, and other neurons, resulting in deficiencies of acetylcholine and other
neurotransmitters. Some theories suggest that the gradual development of an
                                                1

acetylcholine signaling deficiency may be responsible for the early clinical manifestations
of Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, some believe that compounds that improve
cholinergic functioning, such as acetylcholine esterase inhibitors may ameliorate the
cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The most widely used
acetylcholine esterase inhibitor is donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept*).
[0006]      Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor medications are designed to increase
acetylcholine levels, a neurotransmitter that is severely reduced in the brain of patients
with Alzheimer's disease. Rogers reports that treatment with an acetylcholine esterase
inhibitor typically results in an increase of approximately 2.5-3.1 points on the cognitive
subscale of the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS-Cog) from baseline over
placebo (Rogers, 1998). Cummings reports that improvements in cognition modestly
exceed the threshold considered to be clinically relevant and typically last for 6 months
(Cummings, 2001). Therefore, more efficacious drugs are urgently needed to provide
treatment for cognitive impairments such as for patients with Alzheimer's disease.

                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[00123]     An aspect of the invention relates to a method comprising administering to a
patient in need thereof, for an extended period, an effective dose of (R)-7-chloro-N
(quinuclidin-3-yl)benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof. It has been discovered that one or more symptoms associated with a
cognitive impairment and/or the cognitive impairment can be treated and/or improved by
administering to a patient in need thereof, an effective dose of (R)-7-chloro-N
(quinuclidin-3-yl)benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof, for an extended period.
[00124]     There are a number of categories used by diagnosticians and physicians to
characterize the type and/or degree of a cognitive impairment, or probable cognitive
impairment, in a patient. Some of these diagnostic categories include for example
Limited Cognitive Impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment, pre-Alzheimer's disease,
prodromal state of Alzheimer's disease, and Alzheimer's disease inclusive of the many
sub-diagnostic categories of this disease. A diagnosing or treating physician may use one
or more exams/tests to evaluate, characterize and/or diagnose a cognitive impairment, or
probable cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, or probable Alzheimer's
disease, in a patient, which may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the
following: physical exams, lab tests, genetic testing (such as APOE-e4 gene, genes
causing Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease (ADAD) or familial Alzheimer's
disease), neurological exams, neuropsychological testing, cognitive assessment tests,
diagnostic tests, mental status tests, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of
Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Test (e.g.,
ADAS-Cog- 11, ADAS-Cog-13), Category Fluency Test (CFT), Category Naming Test
(CNT), Clinical Dementia Rating scale, Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR
SB), Controlled Oral Word Association Tests (COWAT), Detection Task, Identification
Task, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mini-Cog, Neuropsychiatric Inventory
(NPI), One-Back Task, One-Card Learning Task, Trail Making Test Part A, Trail Making
Test Part B. The physician may also use other indicia, such as medical history, mood
assessment, brain imaging (for example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
Computerized Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (for example
using a radioactive dye, such as Amyvid), Single Photon Emission Computed
Tomography (SPECT) Scan, and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI)),
                                              26

Electroencephalography (EEG), and/or Electrocardiogram (ECG) as aids in diagnosing
Alzheimer's disease. A diagnosing or treating physician may further use one or more of
the above-noted exams/tests to monitor the progression of the cognitive impairment, or
one or more symptoms associated with the cognitive impairment, in the patient while
undergoing treatment, for example to determine the patient's responsiveness to the
treatment, for example efficacy of a particular dose amount in the particular patient, or the
efficacy of the treatment in the particular patient in treating the cognitive impairment or
one or more symptoms associated with the cognitive impairment.
[00125]      An embodiment of the present invention provides a method of treating a
patient in need thereof, comprising: administering to the patient, for an extended period, a
daily dose of (R)-7-chloro-N-(quinuclidin-3-yl)benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamide, or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein the patient has a sub-normal score in an
at least one diagnostic test, for example at least one of the above-noted exams/tests, such
as MMSE, used by a clinician or diagnostician, and wherein the sub-normal score is
relative to the particular diagnostic exam/test.
[00126]      With regard to the use of MMSE testing for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease,
the scale that is generally associated with a diagnosis of: (i) mild stage Alzheimer's
disease is a score of between 20 and 26, for example 20 to 25, or 20 to 24, (ii) moderate
stage Alzheimer's disease is a score of between 10 and 19, for example 12 to 19, or 13 to
19, and (iii) severe stage Alzheimer's disease is a score of below 12, more typically 10 or
below.
[00127]      With regard to the use of ADAS-Cog-13 testing for evaluating or monitoring a
patient diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, a physician may use the patient's previous
ADAS-Cog-13 test score (e.g., set as a baseline for subsequent testing), and if the patient
achieves an improvement in their score (i.e., a decrease in their overall score from a prior
test result), for example an improvement of 2 or greater, such as an improvement greater
than 3, greater than 4, greater than 5, or an improvement of 6 or more, this can be an
indication of the patient deriving a therapeutic benefit and responding positively to a
treatment.
[00128]      With regard to the use of ADAS-Cog-1 1 testing for diagnosing Alzheimer's
disease, some physicians may characterize a patient as having mild-to-moderate
Alzheimer's disease or mild-to-moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's-type with a score
of between 10 and 45, for example, between 15 and 40, such as between 15 and 35,
                                               27

between 15 and 30, or between 20 and 45, and may characterize a patient as having
severe Alzheimer's disease or severe dementia of the Alzheimer's-type with a score of
between 45 and 70, for example, between 50 and 70, such as between 55 and 70, between
60 and 70, or between 50 and 65. Generally, a physician may evaluate the progress of a
patient by using the patient's previous ADAS-Cog-1 1 test score (e.g., set as a baseline for
subsequent testing), and if the patient achieves an improvement in their score (i.e., a
decrease in their overall score from a prior test result), for example an improvement of 2
or greater, such as an improvement greater than 3, greater than 4, greater than 5, or an
improvement of 6 or more, this can be an indication of the patient deriving a therapeutic
benefit and responding positively to a treatment.
[00129]     With regard to the use of CDR-SB testing for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease,
generally a patient scoring >2 may be characterized as having a cognitive impairment, for
example Alzheimer's disease or dementia of the Alzheimer's-type.
[00130]     Alzheimer's disease may include, unless otherwise specified, any of the sub
diagnostic categories used to characterize the type or degree of cognitive impairment in a
patient for treatment purposes. A commonly referenced diagnostic scale for
characterizing the degree of cognitive impairment for a patient with Alzheimer's disease
includes the 3-stage Alzheimer Disease Model. The 3-stages consist of: mild stage (also
referred to as "early Alzheimer's disease" or "mild Alzheimer's disease" or "early stage
Alzheimer's disease" or "mild dementia of an Alzheimer's-type"), moderate stage (also
referred to as "middle Alzheimer's disease" or "moderate Alzheimer's disease" or
"middle stage Alzheimer's disease" or "moderate dementia of an Alzheimer's-type"), and
severe stage (also referred to as "late Alzheimer's disease" or "severe Alzheimer's
disease" or "late stage Alzheimer's disease" or "severe dementia of an Alzheimer's
type"). For patients with a condition that has not progressed to the point of mild stage
Alzheimer's disease, they may be diagnosed as having pre-Alzheimer's disease. It is also
not uncommon for treatment purposes to characterize stages together, such as pre
Alzheimer's disease-to-mild stage Alzheimer's disease, mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's
disease, or moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease. Another useful diagnostic scale that
is used in characterizing the degree of cognitive impairment for a patient having
Alzheimer's disease is the Seven Stage Alzheimer's Disease Model (sometimes known as
the "Seven Stage Global Deterioration Scale" or the "Reisberg Scale"). This diagnostic
scale divides the progression of the cognitive disorder associated with Alzheimer's
                                              28

disease as follows: Stage 1-no Alzheimer's disease (generally characterized by absence of
impairment, no impairment, or normal function), Stage 2-pre-Alzheimer's disease
(generally characterized by minimal impairment, normal forgetfulness, or very mild
cognitive decline), Stage 3-early-stage Alzheimer's disease (generally characterized by a
noticeable cognitive decline, early confusional/mild cognitive impairment, or mild
cognitive decline), Stage 4-early-stage/mild Alzheimer's disease (also referred to as late
confusional/mild Alzheimer's, and generally characterized by moderate cognitive
decline), Stage 5-middle-stage/moderate Alzheimer's (also referred to as early
dementia/moderate Alzheimer's disease and generally characterized by moderately severe
cognitive decline), Stage 6-middle dementia/moderately severe Alzheimer's disease (also
referred to as middle-stage/moderate to late-stage/severe Alzheimer's disease and
generally characterized by severe cognitive decline), and Stage 7-late-stage/severe
Alzheimer's disease (also referred to as severe dementia or failure-to-thrive, and generally
characterized by very severe cognitive decline). It is also not uncommon for treatment
purposes to characterize stages together, such as pre-Alzheimer's disease-to-mild stage
Alzheimer's disease, mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, or moderate-to-severe
Alzheimer's disease. As used herein, unless otherwise specified, Alzheimer's disease
includes all of the above named diagnostic catagories or disease characterizations. It is
also not uncommon for a physician to categorize any one or more of the above noted
states of Alzheimer's disease as being probable, for example, probable mild-to-moderate
Alzheimer's disease or probable severe Alzheimer's disease, when their diagnosis does
not include, for example a physical biopsy or other definitive analysis.
[00131]      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is considered by some to be an
intermediate stage between normal aging and the onset of Alzheimer's disease. For
example, MCI may be characterized by persistent forgetfulness, but may lack some or
many of the more debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Another set of criteria
that may characterize a patient as having mild cognitive impairment suitable for treatment
includes a patient that meets the following: 1) memory complaints corroborated by an
informant, 2) objective memory impairment for age and education, 3) normal general
cognitive function, 4) intact activities of daily living, and 5) the patient does not meet
criteria for dementia. In general, a patient characterized as having mild cognitive
impairment may not yet have a clinical cognitive deficit. Mild cognitive impairment may
also be distinguished from senile dementia in that mild cognitive impairment involves a
                                               29

more persistent and troublesome problem of memory loss for the age of the patient. On
the clinical diagnostic scale, mild cognitive impairment is followed, in increased severity,
by Alzheimer's disease.
[00132]      Limited Cognitive Impairment (LCI) describes a cognitive impairment (i.e.,
symptoms or conditions), which precedes mild cognitive impairment on a clinical
diagnostic scale, and includes any chronic or temporary impairment in cognition, learning
or memory that prevents or reduces the ability of a patient from achieving their individual
potential in these areas. For example, LCIs may include minor impairments to memory
associated with focus and concentration (e.g., accuracy and speed of learning and

[00247]      Responder Analysis: PK/PD Effects:
[00248]      The response by plasma level of Test Compound was also investigated. A
'responder' definition of> 3 pt ADAS-Cog effect was utilized. The plasma levels of
responders and nonresponders informed a logistic regression model. A significant
relationship (p  = 0.003) in plasma level and likelihood of being a responder was observed,
suggesting that a significant plasma level/exposure response relationship exists for Test
Compound. Figure 12 illustrates the mean plasma concentration levels (including the
95% confidence levels and the measured extremes) of Test Compound, and Figure 13
illustrates the Exposure Response analysis, using plasma concentration levels of Test
Compound and ADAS-Cog-13 changes. The relationship between dose and likelihood of
clinical response, as defined by either an ADAS-Cog effect > 3 points, or > 2 points, is
summarized in Table 19:

[00249]      The ADAS-Cog (> 3 points) results were evaluated via a logistic regression
analysis, and a significant effect was observed when comparing against placebo (p:=
0.0034), and these results were not affected by age, baseline severity, continent or
baseline treatment (i.e., "add-or" vs. "de novo" treatment).

Testing Methods:
[00250]     Cognitive Part of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog-1 1)
[00251]     The ADAS-cog-1 1 test employed herein is based on the procedure developed
in the adapted version of the Administration and Scoring Manual for the Alzheimer's
Disease Assessment Scale, 1994 Revised Edition, Richard C. Mohs, Ph.D., C 1994 by
The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, manual modified by Donald Connor, Ph.D., and
Kimberly Schafer, M.S. (3/98).
[00252]     The ADAS-cog-11 test includes the following test items: (1) Word Recall, (2)
Naming Objects/Fingers, (3) Commands, (4) Construction Praxis, (5) Ideational Praxis,
(6) Orientation, (7) Word Recognition, (8) Remembering Test Instructions, (9) Spoken
Language Ability, (10) Word Finding Difficulty, and (11) Comprehension.
[00253]     The ADAS-cog-1 1 total score ranges from 0 to 70 (higher scores indicate
more severe impairment). A decrease from baseline indicates improvement.
[00254]     Cognitive Part of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog-13)
[00255]     The ADAS-Cog-13 is identical to the ADAS-Cog-1 1 assessment group (see
above), with the addition of test items: Delayed Word Recall, and Digit (Number)
Cancellation.
[00256]     The ADAS-cog-13 total score ranges from 0 to 85 (higher scores indicate
more severe impairment). A decrease from baseline indicates improvement.
[00257]     Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes CDR-SB
[00258]     The CDR-SB test employed herein is based on the procedure developed by
Hughs CD, Berg L, Danziger WL, Coben LA, and Martin RL. "A new clinical scalefor
the stagingof dementia"; Br J Psychiatry. 1982; 140:566-572, and provides an assessment
of six (6) dimensions: Memory, Orientation, Judgment and Problem Solving, Community
Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care.
[00259]     Each of the six CDR dimensions are scored separately with well-defined
anchors from 0 to 3.0 (no impairment to severe illness). The total sum of boxes ranges
from 0 to 18. Higher totals indicate more severe impairment. A decrease from baseline
indicates improvement.
[00260]     Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
[00261]     The MMSE test employed herein is based on the procedure developed by
Folstein, M., Folstein, S., McHugh, P. Mini-Mental State: "A PracticalMethodfor
                                             65

Gradingthe Cognitive State of Patientsfor the Clinician";Journal of Psychiatric
Research 1975, 12:189-98.
[00262]     The MMSE test assesses and/or evaluates memory, orientation, recognition,
attention, concentration, language, and praxis. The MMSE total score ranges from 0 to
30 points. Lower scores indicate a lower level of functioning. An increase from baseline
indicates improvement.
[00263]     Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)
[00264]     The COWAT test includes (1) asking the subject to name words beginning
with a specific letter (e.g., F,A,S), (2) each of 3 trials is timed for 60 seconds, and (3) the
score is calculated by the number of new words beginning with the assigned letter.
[00265]     Category Fluency (Naming) Test (CNT or CFT)
[00266]     The CNT test includes (1) asking the subject to name as many animals as
possible within 60 seconds, and (2) the score is calculated by the number of distinct
animals named.
[00267]     Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI):
[00268]     The NPI test employed herein is based on the procedure developed by J.L.
Cummings and colleagues (UCLA), Neurology 44: 2308-2314, 1994.
[00269]     The NPI assesses and/or evaluates 12 domains: (1) Delusions, (2)
Hallucinations, (3) Agitation/Aggression, (4) Depression/Dysphoria, (5) Anxiety, (6)
Euphoria, (7) Apathy, (8) Disinhibition, (9) Irritability/Lability, (10) Aberrant Motor
Behavior, (11) Night-Time Behaviors, and (12) Appetite and Eating Change.
[00270]     Only the first 10 domains are scored separately.
[00271]     Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Group - Activities of Daily Living
Scale (ADCS-ADL, or sometimes referred to as ADCS-ADL-23):
[00272]     The ADCS-ADL-23 test employed herein is based on the procedure developed
by Galasko D, Bennett D, Sano M, et al., Alz Dis Assoc Disord (1997) 11(2): S33-S39.
[00273]     The ADCS-ADL test assesses the actual performance of specific actions and
behaviors by a patient as observed by a caregiver/informant.
[00274]     Composite Scores - Three composite scores were calculated: (1) Composite
Cognition Score (ADAS-cog Word Recall, Word Recognition, and Orientation, COWAT
and CFT); (2) Memory Composite Score (ADAS-cog Word Recall, Word Recognition,
and Orientation); and (3) Executive Function Composite Score (COWAT and CFT).
                                               66

[00275]      The composite score is only computed when all test scores are available.
Calculations for the Composite Score will be made in the following way: (a) the mean
and standard deviation (SD) of all individual Baseline scores is calculated for each test;
(b) for each subject, the difference from the group mean Baseline scores is computed for
each visit (score at visit - mean Baseline score) for each subject for each test; (c) for any
test for which a negative difference score indicates an improvement in performance the
difference from mean Baseline score is reversed (multiplied by -1), so that all outcome
variables are in a uniform direction; (d) for each subject, the difference from the group
mean Baseline is standardized by dividing the difference score by the relevant group
Baseline SD for each test; (e) a combined cognition score is calculated by taking the
average of the standardized scores across the tests; (f) for each subject, the mean and SD
of the Baseline combined cognition scores is calculated; (g) the composite score is
calculated by computing the difference from the group mean Baseline combined score
(Post-Baseline visit combined score - Baseline mean combined score) and dividing it by
the SD of the group Baseline combined scores; and (h) if one of the tests is not completed
(i.e., missing) at Baseline and therefore does not contribute to the Baseline score, it will
not be included in the composite calculations for any other visit for a single subject.
