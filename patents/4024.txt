   application number <removed-apn>, which is in turn a divisional application from Australian
   Patent Application No. 2014203483, which is in turn a divisional application of
   Australian Patent Application No. 2008226814, filed on 12 March 2008, the contents of
   which are to be taken as incorporated herein by reference. Australian Patent Application
   No. 2008226814 claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/906,473, filed

                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]             The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of substituted
   heterocycle fused gamma-carbolines, intermediates useful for producing them, and a
   method for producing such intermediates.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]             Substituted heterocycle fused gamma-carbolines are useful as agonists or
   antagonists of 5-HT2 receptors, particularly 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, in treating
   central nervous system disorders, including obesity, anxiety, depression, psychosis,
   schizophrenia, sleep disorders, sexual disorders, migraine, conditions associated with
   cephalic pain, social phobias, and gastrointestinal disorders such as dysfunction of the
   gastrointestinal tract motility.
[0004]             Traditional methods for the preparation of enantiomerically pure substituted
   heterocycle fused gamma-carbolines involve Fischer indole cyclization of aryl hydrazine
   (e.g.,   dihydroquinoxalin-1-(2H)-amine,      2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazin-4(3H)-amine      or   2H
   benzo[b][1,4]thiazin-4(3H)-amine) with suitably substituted cyclic ketones (e.g., piperidin
   4-one) to afford tetracyclic indole compounds (e.g., 1,3,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-1H-pyrido
   [3',4':4,5]-pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]quinoxaline). This indole core is then reduced to afford the cis
   or trans tetracyclic dihydroindole (i.e., cis or trans tetracyclic indoline) product, which
   requires exhaustive purification procedures such as chiral column chromatography to afford
   enantiomerically pure product.      This method as a whole is inefficient because excess
   reagents and reaction intermediates are required to produce
                                                  1

   racemic products, wherein such product is purified at the final step to give a 25-50% yield
   at best. There is thus a need for a more efficient process to make enantiomerically pure
   substituted heterocycle fused gamma-carbolines.
[0004a]         The discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is
   included in this specification solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present
   invention. It is not suggested or represented that any or all of these matters formed part of
   the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present
   invention as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application.
[0004b]         Where the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or "comprising" are
   used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as specifying the
   presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not precluding the
   presence of one or more other features, integers, steps or components, or group thereof.

   treating Compound of Formula 2E with a mono or bi-dentate ligand known to ligate
   with transition metal catalysts. Examples of such ligand include, but are not limited to
   ligands disclosed above in Method 1F. In a preferred embodiment, the ligand of
  Method IF or 2F is optionally substituted 1,2-diamine ligands. In an especially
  preferred embodiment, said ligand is N,N'-dimethyl-1,2-diaminoethyane, trans-N,N'

  cyanoborohydride); boranes (e.g., BH 3 -THF); or organoboranes (e.g.
  bis(benzyloxy)borane). Alternatively, such conversion may also be accomplished
  through catalytic hydrogenation by using hydrogen in presence of a catalyst (e.g.
  palladium on carbon, palladium oxide, etc.); Wolff-Kishner reduction by heating the
  ketone with hydrazine hydrate in the presence of a base such as sodium or potassium
  hydroxide (See Todd, Org.React. 4, 378-422 (1948)); or Clemmensen reduction by
  heating the ketone with zinc amalgam and aqueous mineral acid such as hydrochloric
  acid (See Vedejs, Org. React. 22, 401-422 (1975)). Other reagents that may also
  accomplish such reduction include triisopropyl phosphate, copper in the presence of

[00361             The deprotection conditions for the protective groups of Method 1I or 21
  necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group and may involve acid or base
  catalysis or catalytic hydrogenation. Thus, for example, wherein the protecting agent is
  an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group (e.g., ethoxycarbonyl) or an
  aroyl group, deprotection may be accomplished for example, by hydrolysis with a base
  such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium, potassium or sodium hydroxide.
  Alternatively, an acyl protecting agent such as a t-butoxycarbonyl group may be
  removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or
  phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid. An arylmethoxycarbonyl protecting agent such
  as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over
  acatalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid such as boron
  tris(trifluoroacetate). For further examples of reagents useful for said deprotection step,

  functional group in a molecule from one oxidation state to a lower oxidation state. The
  term "reducing agent" or "reductive agent" refers to any compound or complex that is
  known in the field for its effects in converting a functional group in a molecule from
  one oxidation state to a lower oxidation state. The reduction may be achieved via a
  direct electron, hydride or hydrogen-atom transfer. Typical reducing agents useful for
  Methods IC include metal hydrides (e.g., lithium aluminum hydride, sodium
                                                80

    (e.g., Raney nickel, palladium on chracoal, nickel boride, platinum metal or its oxide,
    rhodium, ruthenium and zinc oxide, pentacyanocobaltate(II) Co(CN)53~). Catalytic
    hydrogenation is typically carried out at room temperature and above atmospheric
    pressure, but higher temperature and pressure may be required for more resistant double
    bonds. Other reducing agents useful for converting double bonds to single bonds
   include silane and acid; sodium cyanoborohydride and acid; zinc and acid; sodium and
   liquid ammonia; sodium in ethanol; and borane-triethylamine. Typical reducing agents
   useful for reducing a ketone to a methylene as in Methods 1H include but are not
   limited to metal hydrides (e.g., diisobutyl aluminum hydride (DIBAL), sodium bis(2
   methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride (Red-Al) or sodium cyanoborohydride); boranes
   (e.g., BH 3 -THF); or organoboranes (e.g. bis(benzyloxy)borane). Alternatively, such
   conversion may also be accomplished through catalytic hydrogenation by using
   hydrogen in presence of a catalyst (e.g. nickel, palladium on charcoal, nickel boride,
   platinum metal, platinum oxide, palladium oxide, rhodium oxide, ruthenium oxide or
   zinc oxide); Wolff-Kishner reduction by heating the ketone with hydrazine hydrate in
  the presence of a base such as sodium or potassium hydroxide (See Todd, Org. React. 4,
  378-422 (1948)); or Clemmensen reduction by heating the ketone with zinc amalgam
  and aqueous mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid (See Vedejs, Org. React. 22, 401
  422 (1975)). Other reagents that may also accomplish such reduction include
  triisopropyl phosphate, copper in the presence of sulfuric acid and tin in the presence of
  hydrochloric acid. For further examples of reducing agents, see "Advanced Organic
  Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure" by Jerry March, p. 771-790, John
  Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Fourth Edition).

     resulting clear solution is stirred at 500 C for several minutes and ether (80mL) is added
     dropwise. The resulting solution is cooled to room temperature and the white
     precipitate (R-Mandelate sale, 3.7g) is filtered off. HPLC analysis shows >99%ee. The
     filtrate is concentrated, treated with IN sodium hydroxyide (1OOmL) and is extracted
     twice with dichloromenthane (2x5OmL). The dichloromethane layers
                                                                               are combined,
     washed with brine (2x200mL) and dried with sodium sulphate. The dichoromethane
     solution is concentrated to an oil (5.59g) and is redissolved in methanol (90mL) at
    50'C. (S)-(+)-mandelic acid (3.53g, 23.2mmol) is added in portions. The resulting
    clear solution is stirred at 50*C for several minutes and ether (45mL) is added dropwise.
    The resulting solution is cooled to room temperature and the white precipitate (S
    Mandelate salt, 4.19g) is filtered off. HPLC analysis shows >99%ee. R-Mandelate:
    [a]D2 5 = -98.1, S-Mandelate: [a]D25 = +102, solvent: DMSO. Alternatively, the
    resolution may be carried out in a mixutre of methanol and t-butylmethylether (MTBE).

   pyrido[4,3-b]indole may be separated by dissolving racemate 6-bromo-2,3,4,4a,5,9b
   hexahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (9.61g, 38.0mmol) in methanol (l90mL) at 50*C
   and adding (S)-(+)-Mandelic acid (5.78g, 38.Ommol) in portions. The resulting clear
   solution is stirred at 50*C for several minutes and ether (95mL) is added dropwise. The
   resulting solution is cooled to room temperature. The white precipitate (S-Mandelate
   salt, 4.lg) is filtered off. HPLC analysis shows >99%ee.
[0080]               Enantiomeric separation of [4aS, 9bRI-6-bromo-2,3,4,4a,5,9b
  hexahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole may also be carried out by dissolving Racemic 6
  bromo-2,3,4,4a,5,9b-hexahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (1710 gm "as is," 1570gm by
  theory, 6.21 mol) in methanol (24 1)by warming to 40-50 0 C (under nitrogen). To the
  mixture is added (R)-(-)-Mandelic acid (944 g, 6.2 mol) in one portion. The power to
  the heating mantle is turned-off and MTBE (13L) is charged to the mixture. The
  resulting solution is allowed to cool to room temperature with stirring and aged for 30
  40hours at 15-25 0 C with stirring. The product is isolated by filtration as a white to off
  white precipitate and allowed to air dry at ambient temperature overnight. This affords
  580 gm (23%) of the Int-2 R-Mandelate salt. Chiral HPLC analysis shows the
  undesired slower moving enantiomer is present as a single peak (>99%ee).

 [00811              The filtrate is concentrated, diluted with water (25 L), stirred and treated
    with 50% NaOH (800ml) to a pH of-14 as measured by pH paper. The free base is
    extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 17L and I x 6L). The DCM layers are combined,
    dried (Na 2SO 4 ) and concentrated to afford a solid free base (-1150 g). The free base is
   dissolved in methanol (17 L) by warming to 40-50*C under N 2 and (S)-(+)-Mandelic
   acid (692 g, 4.55 mol) is added. The heating mantle is turned off and to the solution is
   added MTBE (8.5 L) in one portion. The resulting solution is allowed to cool to room
   temperature with stirring and aged for 30-40 hours. The product is isolated by filtration
   as a white to off-white precipitate and air dried at ambient temperature overnight. This
   afforded 828 gm (33%) of S-Mandelate salt. Chiral HPLC analysis showed the faster
   moving enantiomer is present (>99%ee) with two other impurities present at -1% each
   (which elute just before the undesired enantiomer). R-Mandelate: [cc]D 25= -98.1,S
   Mandelate: [a]D 25 = +102, solvent:DMSO (about 10 mg in 3 ml DMSO). Chiral HPLC
  conditions: ChiralPak AD-H, 250 x 4.6 mm, 30% IPA in hexanes containing 0.1%
  diethylamine, flow 0.8 ml/min, UV detection at 254 nm. Samples are prepared by
  sonicating the salt in IPA.

  pyrido[4,3-b]indole are dissolved separately in 100% ethanol with stirring (optionally
  with low heating) and then filtered through a 0.4 pm filter. The feeds are injected
  separately at 25mL volume and eluted with 100% Ethanol at a flow rate of 150mL/min
  at 25*C. Alternatively, 420g of racemic 6-bromo-2,3,4,4a,5,9b-hexahydro-1H
  pyrido[4,3-b]indole is similarly dissolved, filtered and injected at 55mL volumn onto a
  CHIRALPAK@ AD@ column, 20pm, 11cm ID x 25cm L with a flow rate of
  400mL/min. The products are detected at an ultraviolet wavelength of 330nm. The
 products are collected and the solvents are evaporated on rotary evaporators at 40*C and
 under a vacuum of 50-70mbar. The products are analyzed through chiral HPLC
 analysis by using an AD-H 4.6mm ID x 250mm column at 30*C column temperature,

    mmol), Na 2 CO 3 (2.88 g, 27.17 mmol), and 25 mL of THF. To the yellow reaction
    mixture at 25 0C (heating block temperature) is added a solution of ethyl chloroformate
    (1.64 g, 15.11 mmol) in 5 mL of THF dropwise over ca 70 minutes. The batch is
    stirred at 25 "C for another 10 min, and is checked by HPLC. Less than 2% of the
    starting material is observed by HPLC, and the desired product is registered at ca. 98%.
   To the batch is added 12.5 mL of EtOH, and the batch is concentrated under reduced
   pressure to remove ca. 30 mL of solvent (mostly THF). To the batch is then added 37.5
   mL of H20, and the resultant mixture shows pH >9 by pH paper. The yellow mixture is
   then stirred at rt for ca. 1 h, and is filtered. The solid is rinsed with 25 mL
                                                                                   of H2 0.
   After drying in a vacuum oven at 58 "C for ca. 16 h, 3.9442 g of a yellow solid is
   obtained (98% yield). 1H NMR of the solid conformed, and showed no (s)-mandelic
   acid. HPLC analysis of the product shows the desired product at >99% purity. LC-MS
   showed a peak with M/e = 326 (M+1).
