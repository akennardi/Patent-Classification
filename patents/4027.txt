    WO 2013/091897                                                        PCT/EP2012/005363
      Combination of a compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal enzyme and
                            Ambroxol and/or a derivative of Ambroxol
The present invention is related to a combination comprising a first constituent and a second
constituent, use of the combination, a pharmaceutical preparation comprising a first
constituent, a second constituent, optionally a further constituent, use of a pharmaceutical
preparation for the manufacture of a medicament, a method for the treatment of a disease and
a method for increasing activity of a lysosomal protein having reduced activity.
Lysosomal storage diseases, also referred to herein as lysosomal storage disorders or LSDs,
are a group of rare inherited metabolic disorders that result from defects in lysosomal function
(Winchester B, et al. (2000), Biochem. Soc. Trans. 28 (2): 150-4). AN LSD results when a
specific organelle in the body's cells - the lysosome - malfunctions. The lysosome processes
unwanted material via the activity of proteins, such as enzymes, into substances that the cell
can utilize. Some of the more prominent LSDs are Pompe's disease and Fabry disease.
LSDs are caused by lysosomal dysfunction usually as a consequence of reduced or absent
activity of a single protein, such as a lysosomal enzyme, which is required for the metabolism
of lipids, glycoproteins or mucopolysaccharides.
Like other genetic diseases, individuals typically inherit an LSD from their parents.
Individually, an LSD occurs with frequencies of less than about 1:100,000 to 1:250,000,
however, as a group the incidence is about 1:5,000 - 1:10,000. The overall majority of these
disorders are autosomal recessively inherited; only a few are X-linked inherited, such as
Fabry disease and Hunter syndrome.
Although each disorder results from different gene mutations that translate into a deficiency
or reduction of a lysosomal protein's activity they all share a common biochemical
characteristic - nearly all lysosomal disorders originate from an abnormal accumulation of
substances inside the lysosome which is due to a deficiency or reduction of the particular
lysosomal protein's activity.

    WO 2013/091897                                                       PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                  2
LSDs affect mostly children and they often die at a young and unpredictable age, many within
a few months or years of birth. Many children die of this disease following years of suffering
from various symptoms of their particular disorder. The symptoms of LSDs vary, depending
on the particular disorder and other variables like the age of onset, and can be mild to severe.
They can include developmental delay, movement disorders, seizures, dementia, deafness
and/or blindness. Some people with an LSD have enlarged livers (hepatomegaly) and
enlarged spleens (splenomegaly), pulmonary and cardiac problems, and bones that develop
abnormally.
There are up to now no causative cures for LSDs available. Therapies which have been tried
with different success at least in animal models comprise enzyme replacement therapy, bone
marrow transplantation, substrate reduction therapy, gene therapy and pharmacological
chaperone therapy. Although the experimental technique of gene therapy may offer such cures
in the future, therapies available at present are mainly symptomatic.
In enzyme replacement therapy, also referred to herein as ERT, recombinantly expressed or
synthetized enzyme is administered intravenously which compensates for the deficiency of
the affected enzyme. Cell receptors mediate the uptake of the recombinant enzyme. The
constant need for treatment, the costs associated therewith and particularly the dependence on
cell receptor mediated uptake are disadvantageous in ERT.
Bone marrow transplantation also referred to herein as BMT, has been supposed as a therapy
for the treatment of LSDs. However, the efficacy and effectiveness of this therapy is in doubt
or may be insufficient, as it is still not known whether the number of cells transferred by BMT
will provide enough of the missing enzyme to successfully treat patients suffering from an
LSD in general.
In substrate reduction therapy, also referred to herein as SRT, upstream inhibition of
biological pathways results in reduction of substrate produced for the enzyme to process. In
SRT adverse effects may result from an influence of the applied substances on other cellular
processes.

   WO 2013/091897                                                       PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               3
Pharmacological chaperone therapy, also referred to herein as PCT, is a technique used to
stabilize the lysosomal protein having reduced activity produced by patients and was
examined for certain LSDs.
PCT is based on the use of chaperone molecules that assist the folding of mutated enzymes
and improve their stability and lysosomal trafficking.
In Pompe disease it was shown for deoxynojirimycin, an iminosugar also referred to herein as
DNJ, to increase acid a-glucosidase activity, the mutated enzyme in Pompe disease (Parenti
G. et al., Mol Ther. 2007 Mar;15(3):508-14. Epub 2007 Jan 9).
In Fabry disease, which is caused by mutations of lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A, also
referred to herein as GLA or a-Gal A, 1-Deoxygalactonojirimycin, also referred to herein as
DGJ, AT 1001 or Migalastat, an inhibitor of GLA serves as a pharmacological chaperone and
enhances the activity of the mutated enzyme (Asano N. et al., Eur J Biochem. 2000 Jul;
267(13):4179-86).
Iminosugars such as DGJ or DNJ may thus be selectively used as pharmacological
chaperones to assist rearrangement of lysosomal proteins having reduced activity, such as
mutant lysosomal proteins, and allow the treatment of patients with an LSD such as Fabry
disease or Pompe disease. Pharmacological Chaperone administered in an effective dose can
cause an increase of mutation reduced enzyme activity. Nevertheless, a person skilled in the
art will acknowledge that the administration of pharmacological chaperones, such as
iminosugars, such as for example Isofagomine applied in Gaucher's Disease, have to be
exactly dosed, for example in a scheme where dosing is followed by a withdrawal period that
enables the cell and enzyme to temporarily get rid of the inhibitor to display beneficial effect
(Khanna et al; FEBS Journal 277 (2010) 1618-1638). It will be also acknowledged that to
distinguish between inhibitory and subinhibitory concentrations is difficult and needs to be
evaluated in in vivo studies. While treating Fabry's disease, i.e. mutant GLA in a cell-free
environment, dosages far below 1p M are already inhibiting (Asano et al., supra). Asano and
colleagues demonstrated a decrease of GLA activity in patient lymphoblasts while exceeding
concentration of 10 M DGJ. In a cell culture based GLA overexpression system
concentrations up to 1mM (Wu et al., Hum Mutat, 2011 Aug; 32(8):965-77) are tolerated
without any detectable inhibition of the tested mutant enzyme. However, it is important to

    WO 2013/091897                                                        PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                 4
note that a washout period is also included in the therein described experimental setup, i.e.
two hours prior to the conduction of the assay the medium containing the Pharmacological
Chaperone is removed, which is indicative for a disturbance of the assay by high
concentrations of iminosugars, i.e. inhibition. In accordance therewith it will be also
acknowledged that a therapy using higher doses is hard to establish in patients and therefore
needs to be considered carefully in clinical trials where lOM are acknowledged as to be a
clinically achievable concentration.
Pharmacological chaperone therapy aims to restore the activity of a lysosomal protein having
reduced activity. Nevertheless the development of pharmacological chaperon treatment of
LSDs is still at an early stage. Its strong dependence on the particular patient which is to be
treated, more specifically the particular LSD and its particular cause, for example, a particular
mutation of the specific lysosomal protein, affect efficacy and effectiveness of said therapy.
Furthermore the successful administration of pharmacological chaperones against LSDs is
hampered by the inhibitory effect and potential toxicity when high doses of pharmacological
chaperones are administered (Wu et al., supra; Asano et al., supra and Khanna et al., supra).
The problem underlying the present invention is to provide a means for the treatment of
LSDs, and methods for the treatment of LSDs.
It is a further problem underlying the present invention to enhance protein activity of a
lysosomal protein having reduced activity.
It is a still further problem of the present invention to enhance the efficacy and effectiveness
of a pharmacological chaperone therapy in the treatment of LSDs.

step c):        administering to the subject the first constituent prior to, concomitantly with or
after the second constituent.
The present inventors have surprisingly found that the combined use of a compound having
the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein having reduced activity and Ambroxol or a
derivative of Ambroxol is suitable for the treatment of LSDs such as Fabry disease and
Pompe disease. In such combination, preferably the compound having the ability to rearrange
a lysosomal protein having reduced activity is a chaperone, preferably a pharmacological
chaperone.
More specifically, the present inventors when conducting experiments in a cell culture system
which is an acknowledged model for LSDs and Fabry disease in particular (Ishii et al.;
Biochem. J. (2007) 406, 285-295; Shin et al.; Pharmacogenet Genomics. Sep 2008; 18(9):
773-780; Parenti G et al., Mol Ther. 2007; 15:508-14; Okumiya T et al., Mol Genet Metab
2007 Jan;90(1):49-57) have found that when DGJ of Galactose is administered together with
Ambroxol the activity of mutant alpha-galactosidase A is surprisingly and unexpectedly
increased compared to the effect arising from administering DGJ or Galactose only.
When conducting further studies the present inventors also found that when NB-DNJ is
administered together with Ambroxol the activity of mutant acid a-Glucosidase is surprisingly
and unexpectedly increased compared to the effect arising from administering NB-DNJ only.
In connection therewith it is particularly noteworthy that, as also found by the instant
inventors, administering Ambroxol alone, i.e. without DGJ, does not exhibit any enhancing
effect on alpha-galactosidase A activity in alpha-galactosidase A mutants frequently resulting
in Fabry disease, and that administering Ambroxol alone, i.e. without NB-DNJ does not
exhibit any enhancing effect on acid a-Glucosidase activity in acid a-Glucosidase mutants
frequently resulting in Pompe disease.

   WO 2013/091897                                                          PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                59
It is the merit of the present inventors having found that administering a combination
according to the present invention is advantageous over the enhancement of the activity of the
lysosomal protein having a reduced activity with a compound having the ability to rearrange a
lysosomal protein alone. More particularly, administering Ambroxol and/or a derivative of
Ambroxol in combination with said compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal
protein further enhances the activity of the lysosomal protein having reduced protein activity
compared to administering said compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein
alone. Thus administration of a combination of the present invention is advantageous over the
administration of the compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein alone in
that further enhancement of the activity of the protein having reduced activity is achieved
and/or a significantly lower amount of the compound having the ability to rearrange a
lysosomal protein may be administered to a patient still resulting in the same or similar
beneficial effect of treatment as if the compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal
proteins is administered alone at a higher concentration or in a higher amount.
More particularly, it is the merit of the present inventors having found that the combined use
of a pharmacological chaperone and Ambroxol and/or a derivative of Ambroxol is suitable for
increasing the activity of a mutant protein in the treatment of an LSD such as Fabry disease
compared to the application of said pharmacological chaperone alone. The amount of
pharmacological chaperone administered to a subject can be reduced if the pharmacological
chaperone is administered as the first constituent of the combination according to the present
invention and will result in the same or similar level of activity or a higher level of activity of
the lysosomal protein as if the pharmacological chaperone is administered alone in a higher
amount.
Furthermore, it will be acknowledged by a person skilled in the art that any feature,
advantage, embodiment of and any statement made herein in relation to a combination of the
present invention equally applies to a pharmaceutical preparation according to the present
invention, a method according to the present invention, a use according to the present
invention, and vice versa.

    WO 2013/091897                                                         PCT/EP2012/005363

Furthermore, it will be acknowledged by a person skilled in the art that any feature,
advantage, embodiment of and any statement made herein in relation to any aspect of the
present invention equally applies to each and any of the other aspects of the present invention.
The term "reduced activity" of a lysosomal protein as used herein preferably means that the
activity of a lysosomal protein, e.g. a lysosomal protein being a lysosomal protein mutant
resulting from a mutation, is reduced compared to a control, such as a control protein, for
example said protein without such mutation. In an embodiment such reduced activity is the
activity of an enzyme which is reduced due to a mutation of said enzyme compared to an
activity of said enzyme without such mutation and wherein, preferably, said reduced enzyme
activity results in a disease, e.g. an LSD, such as Fabry's disease.
It is a further advantage of the combination according to the present invention that the activity
of a lysosomal protein having a reduced activity, wherein treatment with a pharmacological
chaperone alone does not result in an increase of activity of the lysosomal protein mutant
sufficient to treat a subject, can be elevated to a level sufficient for the treatment, preferably
therapeutic treatment of the subject. In other words, in particular lysosomal protein mutants
wherein the treatment with a particular pharmacological chaperone results in an increase of
activity of the lysosomal protein mutants the increase is too low to treat the subject. If the
pharmacological chaperone is administered as a first constituent of the combination according
to the present invention the increase of activity of the lysosomal protein mutant can be
sufficient to treat the subject.
A sufficient treatment as used herein preferably is a treatment which results in elevating
and/or increasing the activity of a lysosomal protein having a reduced activity due to a
mutation, i.e. a lysosomal protein mutant, to a level of 20%, preferably of 25%, of the activity
of the lysosomal protein not having the mutation and preferably determined in the absence of
treatment. In an embodiment, such sufficient treatment results in a therapeutic effect
indlcuding, but not limited to, treatment of the LSD from which the subject suffers or at least
amelioration of the symptoms of the subject suffering from the LSD.
It will be immediately acknowledged by a skilled person that various methods for determining
the activity of a protein, such as the activity of an enzyme, and thus determining whether said

    WO 2013/091897                                                       PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                61
activity is reduced compared to a control such as a protein without mutation(s) which result(s)
in such reduced activity, are known to a person skilled in the art and particularly depend on
the protein the activity of which is determined and, preferably, compared to a control. For
example, determining the activity of a-galactosidase A and/or a-glucosidase is described as
enzymatic measurement of a-galactosidase A and a-glucosidase in Example 1 herein,
respectively. In order to determine the activity of p-Hexosaminidase A/B and/or whether said
activity is reduced preferably the assay as described in Wood et al. is used (Wood, S and
Macdougall, BG Am J Hum Genet 28:489-495, 1976). In order to determine the activity of
beta-galactosidase and/or whether said activity is reduced preferably the assay as described in
Yang et al. is used (Yang et al., Journal of Biomedical Science 2010, 17:79).
It will be acknowledged by a person skilled in the art that in certain diseases resulting from
reduced activity of a lysosomal protein typically resulting from a mutation of said lysosomal
protein, the administration of Ambroxol alone results in an enhancement of the activity of
a/the mutant lysosomal protein. It is thus important to understand that the present invention is
based on the finding that the effect of a compound having the ability to rearrange a protein
having reduced activity, such as a pharmacological chaperone, is enhanced when administered
together with Ambroxol and/or a derivative of Ambroxol, wherein the administration of
Ambroxol and/or a derivative of Ambroxol is not enhancing the activity of the protein having
reduced activity when administered alone. The administration of said combination is thus
advantageous over the administration of said compound having the ability to rearrange a
protein having reduced activity alone in that Ambroxol enhances the activity of said
compound.
In connection therewith it will be acknowledged by a skilled person that any derivative of
Ambroxol and/or bromhexine enhancing the activity of a/the protein having reduced activity
when administered in combination with said compound having the ability to rearrange a/the
protein having reduced activity is suitable for the practicing of the instant invention and is,
accordingly, encompassed by the present invention.
A compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein having reduced activity as
used herein preferably means a small molecule which reversibly binds to the lysosomal
protein having reduced activity, said binding resulting in an increase in the reduced activity,

    WO 2013/091897                                                     PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                  62
i.e. said binding resulting in an activity which is higher compared to the activity of the
lysosomal protein without the compound having the ability to rearrange a/the lysosomal
protein having reduced activity. Preferably, said binding corrects a folding defect of the
protein having reduced activity through a stabilization effect. More preferably, said binding
prevents degradation of said protein. A small molecule as used herein preferably is a small
molecule according to Lipinski's rule of five. In an embodiment of the combination according
to the present invention the compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein
having reduced activity preferably is a chaperone and more preferably is a pharmacological
chaperone. In a preferred embodiment of the combination according to the present invention a
compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein, wherein the lysosomal protein
has a reduced activity, is capable of increasing and/or elevating the reduced activity. In a
further embodiment a compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein is a
compound which is capable of increasing and/or elevating the reduced activity irrespective of
whether or not said compound has the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein, i.e. the activity
of the lysosomal protein is higher when the compound is present compared to the activity of
the lysosomal protein when the compound is not present.
A person skilled in the art will acknowledge that a pharmacological chaperon, such as an
iminosugar, e.g. DGJ or DNJ, interacts with a specific enzyme and/or a specific enzyme
having a mutation. The use of pharmacological chaperones in the treatment of LSDs is
summarized in, e.g., Parenti et al., (Parenti et al., 2009 EMBO Mol Med 1, 268-279).
For example, NB-DNJ but not NB-DGJ effects folding of beta-Glucocerebrosidase (Butters
TD et al., Glycobiology 2005, 15:43R-52R). However, sphingolipid synthesis can be inhibited
by both drugs. Furthermore, DNJ is often used as negative control for testing putative drugs
and it has no effect on enhancing protein activity in Fabry (Fan et al. 2003, Methods in
Enzymology, Vol. 363, p. 412-420) or Gaucher. Interestingly, Parenti et al. showed an effect
of DNJ in enhancing protein activity in Pompe's disease (Parenti et al. 2007 Mol Ther. 2007
Mar;15(3):508-14. Epub 2007 Jan 9).
Further examples for the specific interaction of pharmacological chaperons are described in
Butters et al. (2005, supra) and Parenti et al. (2009, supra).

    WO 2013/091897                                                         PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                 63
The present inventors assume, without wishing to be bound by any theory, that the specific
interaction and non-interaction, respectively, of pharmacological chaperons with lysosomal
protein mutants is due to a stereochemical hindrance, for example with L-sugars or with DNJ,
which prevents access to the active site of the lysososmal protein. Accordingly, rearrangement
of the lysosomal protein mutant is or is not possible and thus enhancement of transport and/or
activity is or is not prevented. The instant inventors further assume that due to interaction of
the pharmacological chaperone with the active site of the lysosomal protein a rearrangement
of the lysosomal protein is induced leading to a stabilization of the lysosomal protein mutant,
similar to wild type. Thus the mutant lysosomal protein being no longer misfolded or less
misfolded is no longer recognized by the cellular degradation machinery and accordingly and
preferably escapes early degradation. As a result transport into the lysosome is enhanced.
Applying different assays and methods Yam et al. (Yam et al., supra) and Ishii et al. (Ishii et
al., supra) both showed accumulation of the enzyme after treatment in the lysosome in Fabry.
In addition, it is important to understand that a disease which results from a lysosomal protein
having a reduced activity and wherein the reduced activity is due to a mutation of the
lysosomal protein may actually be the result of different mutations, i.e. different subjects may
suffer from the same disease having different mutations of the lysosomal proteins. By way of
example, more than 400 mutations which result in Fabry's disease are known to date. In
connection therewith a person skilled in the art will immediately acknowledge that for
successful treatment of such disease the reduced activity of the lysosomal protein having
reduced activity has to be increased. More particularly, the particular lysosomal protein
mutant has to be a mutant responsive for the treatment with a compound having the ability to
rearrange a lysosomal protein having a reduced activity, such as a pharmacological
chaperone. A "responsive mutant" as used herein preferably means a lysosomal protein
having a particular mutation, wherein the lysosomal protein has a reduced activity due to the
mutation and wherein the compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein
having a reduced activity is suitable for or is increasing and/or enhancing the reduced activity
so that the activity of the lysosomal protein is increased.
In an embodiment of the combination and/or pharmaceutical preparation according to the
present invention the activity of the lysosomal protein is reduced due to a mutation. In a
further embodiment of the present invention the mutation is a mutation responsive to a/the

                                                  64
compound having the ability to rearrange the lysosomal protein, wherein the lysosomal
protein has a reduced activity. In an embodiment of the combination and/or the
pharmaceutical preparation according to the present invention the compound having the
ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein, wherein the lysososmal protein has a reduced
activity, is suitable for and/or is capable of increasing the activity of the lysosomal protein.
A person skilled in the art will thus also acknowledge that a compound having the ability to
rearrange a protein having reduced activity may be specifically effective in enhancing the
activity of a specific protein in a specific disease. In other words a certain compound having
the ability to rearrange a protein having reduced activity, such as a certain pharmacological
chaperone, may be administered in a certain disease as said pharmacological chaperone
enhances the activity of a certain protein having reduced activity in said certain disease.
In an embodiment of the compound according to the present invention a compound having the
ability to rearrange a protein having reduced activity is an active site-specific chaperone.
The following table 1 is taken from Fan et al. (Fan JQ et al., Biol Chem. 2008 Jan;389(l):1
11.) and comprises a list of exemplary active site-specific chaperones, also referred to herein
as ASSC, and the respective LSD, wherein the activity of the respective affected protein
having reduced activity may be enhanced upon treatment with the indicated ASSC.

Additionally, Sawkar et al. (Sawkar, A. R. et a., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002, 99,
15428-15433)     showed that NB-DNJ and NN-DNJ              can function as pharmacological
chaperones in Gaucher's disease.
A person skilled in the art will acknowledge that in an embodiment an LSD is characterized
by a lysosomal dysfunction which results from genetic mutation(s) usually leading to a
reduced activity, including deficiency of protein activity, of a protein such as an enzyme, a
membrane transport protein, a trans-membrane protein or a soluble non-enzymatic protein
preferably required for or involved in the metabolism of lipids, glycoproteins or
mucopolysaccharides. Said protein having reduced activity preferably is a lysosomal protein
and the reduced activity thereof more preferably results from misfolding of the protein.
Correcting said misfolding of said protein by rearrangement which comprises stabilization of
said lysosomal protein having reduced activity, results in an enhancement of said reduced
protein's activity and is, in an embodiment of the invention, thus suitable for the treatment of
a disease, preferably an LSD.
In molecular biology, chaperones are proteins that assist folding or unfolding and assembly or
disassembly of other macromolecular structures, such as proteins, but do not occur in these
structures when the latter are performing their normal biological functions. Nevertheless,
chaperones are not strictly concerned with protein folding. Moreover, a chaperon may assist
in the assembly of, e.g., nucleosomes from folded histones and DNA, and such assembly
chaperones, especially in the nucleus, are concerned with the assembly of folded subunits into
oligomeric structures.
Chaperones as preferably used herein do not necessarily convey steric information required
for proteins to fold. One major function of chaperones is to prevent both newly synthesized
polypeptide chains and assembled subunits from aggregating into nonfunctional structures. It
is for this reason that many chaperones, but by no means all, are also heat shock proteins
because the tendency to aggregate increases as proteins are denatured by stress. Many
chaperones are heat shock proteins, that is, proteins expressed in response to elevated
temperatures or other cellular stresses. The reason for this behavior is that protein folding is
severely affected by heat and, therefore, some chaperones act to repair the potential damage
caused by misfolding.

    WO 2013/091897                                                       PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               67
The term "affected" as used herein preferably means "to change" or "being changed" and
more preferably refers to a changed behavior, structure, activity or condition. For example, an
affected protein may be affected in such that its activity is changed, i.e. increased or
decreased, or as a further example an affected protein may be affected in such that its
structure or sequence is changed compared to the protein's structure or sequence in an
unaffected stage. The term "to affect" refers to herein preferably to an influence which a
change has on something else. Thus said protein being affected in a disease means that said
changed activity and/or structure or sequence is changed compared to the activity and/or
structure or sequence of said protein in a healthy patient. In a preferred embodiment thereof,
the change goes along with a change in the condition of a subject the metabolism of
lysosomal protein of which is affected; more preferably such change goes along with a
disease or a predispotion of a disease.
Other chaperones are involved in folding newly made proteins as they are extruded from the
ribosome. Although most newly synthesized proteins can fold in the absence of chaperones, a
minority strictly requires them.
Other types of chaperones are involved in transport across membranes, for example
membranes of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes. Bacterial
translocation-specific chaperones maintain newly synthesized precursor polypeptide chains in
a translocation-competent (generally unfolded) state and guide them to the translocon.
Molecular chaperones as used herein are preferably involved in protein folding and provide
other functions in addition to stabilization. Molecular chaperones recognize unfolded protein
elements such as exposed hydrophobic patches and bind to unfolded proteins and prevent
aggregation or provide stabilization during folding, after which the folded protein dissociates.
Molecular chaperones also direct proteins that do not fold correctly to degradation pathways.
Chemical chaperones, as used herein, preferably induce stabilizing effects by non-specific
binding. Chemical chaperones include but are nto limited to glycerol.

   WO 2013/091897                                                        PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               68
Chaperon functions also comprise among others assistance in protein degradation, bacterial
adhesion activity and responding to diseases linked to protein aggregation.
Protein misfolding is recognized as an important pathophysiological cause of protein
deficiency or reduced activity in many genetic disorders, especially in LSDs. Inherited
mutations can disrupt native protein folding, thereby producing proteins with misfolded
conformations. These misfolded proteins are consequently retained and degraded by
endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, although they would otherwise be catalytically
fully or partially active. Lack of protein function or reduced activity of lysosomal proteins
results in substrate accumulation, impaired transport of ions or molecules, and disruption of
biosynthetic pathways.
Recently, it was found that potent competitive inhibitors for enzymes associated with LSDs
enhance the activity of such enzymes in cells when administered at concentrations lower than
that normally required to inhibit the intracellular enzyme activity. The effect is particularly
significant on certain defective or mutant enzymes, but also occurs in cells containing the
normal enzyme type, preferably the non-defective enzyme and/or the non-mutant enzyme.
The use of such pharmacological chaperones, such as DGJ, in PCT of an LSD preferably
results from stabilizing the lysosomal mutant protein having reduced activity by the selective
binding of the pharmacological chaperone to said mutant protein in its misfolded state. More
preferably, said binding results in a more stable state of the protein and increased stability
leads to decrease in degradation by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. A
pharmacological chaperone is preferably an active site-directed competitive inhibitor or a
specific-site chaperone. Such active site-specific chaperones preferably act as reversible
inhibitors that efficiently bind the mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitate
folding and/or stabilization of the mutant protein resulting in more protein being processed
and transported to the correct location, for example the lysosome. The pharmacological
chaperone thereby preferably acts as a reversible binder and dissociates in the correct location
where a higher level of residual protein activity is achieved. Nevertheless, a person skilled in
the art will acknowledge that high concentrations of pharmacological chaperones will result in
an inhibitory effect on the activity of the mutant protein (Asano et al., supra; Khanna et al.,
supra).

    WO 2013/091897                                                       PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                69
Accordingly, pharmacological chaperones are preferably applied in a sub-inhibitory
concentration, wherein the stabilization of the mutant protein after rescue from the
endoplasmatic reticulum preferably also results in a longer half-life of the mutant protein.
Specific-site chaperones in contrast to active site chaperones do not bind the active site of the
mutant protein. Therefore specific-site chaperones may remain bound to the mutant protein as
long as the function of said protein is not inhibited.
Pharmacological chaperones used in the combination of the present invention preferably have
at least one pharmaceutical characteristics selected from the group comprising low toxicity,
good solubility and brain-barrier penetration.
Pharmacological chaperones as used herein are preferably selected from the group comprising
sugars and iminosugar and derivatives of the sugars and iminosugar as well as pharmaceutical
acceptable salts thereof.

   WO 2013/091897                                                         PCT/EP2012/005363

A person skilled in the art will acknowledge that the symptoms of LSDs vary, depending on
the particular disorder or disease, and other variables like the age of onset, and can be mild to
severe. They can include developmental delay, movement disorders, seizures, dementia,
deafness and/or blindness. Some people with an LSD have enlarged livers (hepatomegaly)
and enlarged spleens (splenomegaly), pulmonary and cardiac problems, and bones that grow
abnormally.
For the diagnosis of an LSD the majority of patients are initially screened by an enzyme
assay, which is the most efficient method to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. In other cases, for
example, in some families where the disease-causing mutation(s) is/are known and in certain
genetic isolates, mutation analysis may be performed. In addition, after a diagnosis is made by
biochemical means, mutation analysis may be performed for certain disorders.
Representative, not-limiting examples of LSDs are described in the following.
Fabry disease, also referred       to herein as Fabry's disease, Anderson-Fabry           disease,
angiokeratoma corporis diffusum and alpha-galactosidase A deficiency, is a rare X-linked
inherited   LSD, which can cause a wide range of systemic symptoms (James, William D.;
Berger, Timothy G.; et al. (2006). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology.
Saunders Elsevier. p. 538, ISBNO-7216-2921-0).            A deficiency of the enzyme alpha
galactosidase A, also referred to herein as a-GAL A, GAL, GLA or alpha-Gal A, due to
mutation causes a glycolipid known as globotriaosylceramide, also referred to herein as Gb3,
GL-3, or ceramide trihexoside to accumulate within the blood vessels, other tissues, and
organs (Karen JK et al., 2005 Dermatol. Online J. 11 (4): 8). This accumulation leads to an
impairment of their proper functioning. The DNA mutations which cause the disease are X
linked. The condition affects hemizygous males, as well as homozygous, and potentially
heterozygous females, so called carriers. Whilst males typically experience severe symptoms,
women can range from being asymptomatic to having severe symptoms. This variability is
thought to be due to X-inactivation patterns during embryonic development of the female
(James, William D. supra).

    WO 2013/091897                                                        PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               73
 Symptoms are typically first experienced in early childhood and can be very difficult to
understand; the rarity of Fabry disease to many clinicians sometimes leads to misdiagnoses.
Manifestations of the disease usually increase in number and severity while at individual ages.
Kidney complications are a common and serious effect of the disease; renal insufficiency and
renal failure may worsen throughout life. Proteinuria which causes foamy urine, is often the
first sign of kidney involvement. End stage renal failure in males can typically occur in the
third decade of life, and is a common cause of death due to the disease.
Fabry disease is indicated when associated symptoms are present, and can be diagnosed by a
blood test to measure the level of alpha-galactosidase activity. Chromosomal analysis of the
alpha-galactosidase A gene is the most accurate method of diagnosis, and many mutations
which cause the disease have been noted.
Naturally, a-Gal A is likely to be present only at very low levels in the blood, particularly in
males. In females, owing to X-inactivation patterns, levels are commonly normal even if the
patient is not asymptomatic.
Glycogen storage disease type II, also referred to herein as Pompe disease, Pompe's disease
or acid maltase deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder which damages
muscle and nerve cells throughout the body. It is the only glycogen storage disease with a
defect in lysosomal metabolism.
Pompe disease is caused by an accumulation of glycogen in the lysosome due to deficiency of
the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme, which is a lysosomal hydrolase. The enzyme
degrades alpha -1,4 and alpha -1,6 linkages in glycogen, maltose and isomaltose and is
required for the degradation of 1-3% of cellular glycogen. The deficiency of this enzyme
results in the accumulation of structurally normal glycogen in lysosomes and cytoplasm in
affected individuals. The build-up of glycogen causes progressive muscle weakness
(myopathy) throughout the body and affects various body tissues, particularly in the heart,
skeletal muscles, liver and nervous system. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may
interrupt normal functioning of other organelles and lead to cellular injury.

    WO 2013/091897                                                       PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                74
The enzyme deficiency is caused by a mutation in a gene, namely acid alpha-glucosidase, also
referred to herein as acid maltase, on long arm of chromosome 17 at 17q25.2-q25.3 (base
pairs 75,689,876 to 75,708,272). The number of mutations described in 2010 was 289 with 67
being non-pathogenic mutations and 197 being pathogenic mutations. The remainder is still
being evaluated for their association with disease. Most cases appear to be due to three
mutations. A transversion (T -       G) mutation is the most common among adults with this
disorder. This mutation interrupts a splicing site.
Pompe disease associated symptoms include severe lack of muscle tone, weakness, an
enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and an enlarged heart cardiomegalyy). Mental function is not
affected. Development appears normal for the first weeks or months but slowly declines as
the disease progresses. Swallowing may become difficult and the tongue may protrude and
become enlarged. Most children die from respiratory or cardiac complications before 2 years
of age.
Juvenile onset symptoms appear in early to late childhood and include progressive weakness
of respiratory muscles in the trunk, diaphragm and lower limbs, as well as exercise
intolerance. Intelligence is normal.
Adult onset symptoms also involve generalized muscle weakness and wasting of respiratory
muscles in the trunk, lower limbs, and diaphragm. Many patients report respiratory distress,
headache at night or upon waking, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and proximal muscle
weakness, such as difficulty in climbing stairs. Intellect is not affected. A small number of
adult patients live without major symptoms or limitations.
Pompe's disease is one of the infiltrative causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy. The infantile
form usually comes to medical attention within the first few months of life. The usual
presenting features are cardiomegaly (92%), hypotonia (88%), cardiomyopathy (88%),
respiratory distress (78%), muscle weakness (63%), feeding difficulties (57%) and failure to
thrive (53%). The main clinical findings include floppy baby appearance, delayed motor
milestones and feeding difficulties. Moderate hepatomegaly may be present. Facial features
include macroglossia, open mouth, wide open eyes, nasal flaring (due to respiratory distress),
and poor facial muscle tone. Cardiopulmonary involvement is manifest by increased

                                               75
respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles for respiration, recurrent chest infections, decreased
air entry in the left lower zone (due to cardiomegaly), arrhythmias and evidence of heart
failure. Median age at death in untreated cases is 8.7 months and is usually due to
cardiorespiratory failure.
The usual initial investigations of this form of the disease include chest X ray,
electrocardiogram and echocardiography. Typical findings are those of an enlarged heart with
nonspecific conduction defects. Biochemical investigations include serum creatine kinase
(typically increased 10-fold) with lesser elevations of the serum aldolase, aspartate
transaminase, alanine transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase. Diagnosis is made by
estimating the acid alpha glucoside activity in either skin biopsy (fibroblasts), muscle biopsy
(muscle cells) or in white blood cells. The choice of sample depends on the facilities available
at the diagnostic laboratory.
In various embodiments of the combination according to the present invention the disease is
different from a lysosomal storage disease. In an embodiment of the combination according to
the present invention the disease different from a lysosomal storage disease is a disease
associated with an LSD. In an embodiment of the combination according to the present
invention the disease different from a lysosomal storage disease is a neurodegenerative
disorder. In an embodiment of the combination according to the present invention the
neurodegenerative disorder is selected from the group comprising Parkinson's disease. In
connection therewith it has to be understood that it has been recently discovered that there is a
link between mutations in lysosomal enzymes and neurological disorders different from a
lysosomal storage disease.
As one example there is a well-established link between mutations in the glucocerebrosidase
gene and Parkinson's disease. More specifically, although Parkinson's disease results from
accumulation of synuclein, mutations of the glucocerebrosidase gene occur in Parkinson
patients with a frequency that is 6-fold increased (Sidransky et al., NEJM, 2009).
Accordingly, Parkinson's disease is a disease associated with an LSD, more particularly with
Gaucher's disease. More particularly, it has been shown that beta glucocerebrosidase co
localizes with alpha synuclein, which is the plaque forming material in Parkinson's disease.
(Sidransky et al., NEJM, 2009). The present inventors thus currently assume that the

                                               76
misfolding of mutant glucocerebrosidase in Gaucher may enhance accumulation of synuclein.
Accordingly, the combination according to the present invention wherein the first constituent
is a compound having the ability to rearrange mutant glucocerebrosidase, wherein the mutant
glucocerebrosidase has a reduced activity, and wherein the second constituent is Ambroxol
and/or a derivative of Ambroxol is suitable for or is for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
In an embodiment of the present invention the combination according to the present invention
wherein the lysosomal protein is affected in a disease, the disease is a disease different from
an LSD, preferably the disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, more preferably the disease is
a disease associated with an LSD. In an embodiment of the combination according to the
present invention the lysosomal protein is glucocerebrosidase and the disease preferably is
Parkinson disease.
Parkinson's disease also referred to herein as Parkinson disease or PD, is a degenerative
disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs the sufferer's motor skills, speech,
and other functions (Jankovic J et al., April 2008, J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. 79 (4):
368-76).
Parkinson's disease also referred to herein preferably as PD, belongs to a group of conditions
called movement disorders.
Parkinson's disease is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical
movement (bradykinesia) and a loss of physical movement (akinesia) in extreme cases. The
primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal
ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is
produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain, specifically the substantia nigra.
Secondary symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language
problems. PD is both chronic and progressive. PD is the most common cause of chronic
progressive Parkinsonism, a term which refers to the syndrome of tremor, rigidity,
bradykinesia and postural instability. While many forms of Parkinsonism are idiopathic,
"secondary" cases may result from toxicity most notably of drugs, head trauma, or other
medical disorders.

    WO 2013/091897                                                        PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                 77
The term Parkinsonism is used for symptoms of tremor, stiffness, and slowing of movement
caused by loss of dopamine. "Parkinson's disease" is the synonym of "primary Parkinsonism",
i.e., isolated Parkinsonism due to a neurodegenerative process without any secondary
systemic cause. In some cases, it would be inaccurate to say that the cause is "unknown",
because a small proportion is caused by genetic mutations. It is possible for a patient to be
initially diagnosed with Parkinson's disease but then to develop additional features, requiring
revision of the diagnosis (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Clinical
guideline 35: Parkinson's disease. London, June 2006).
The usual anti-Parkinson's medications are typically either less effective or completely
ineffective in controlling symptoms; patients may be exquisitely sensitive to neuroleptic
medications like haloperidol, so correct differential diagnosis is important. Essential tremor
may be mistaken for Parkinson's disease, but lacks all other features besides tremor, and has
particular characteristics distinguishing it from Parkinson's disease, such as improvement with
beta blockers and alcoholic beverages. PD is not considered to be a fatal disease by itself, but
it progresses with time. The average life expectancy of a PD patient is generally lower than
for people who do not have the disease. In the late stages of the disease, PD may cause
complications such as choking, pneumonia, and falls that can lead to death. The progression
of symptoms in PD may take 20 years or more. In some people, however, the disease
progresses more quickly. There is no way to predict what course the disease will take for an
individual person. With appropriate treatment, most people with PD can live productive lives
for many years after diagnosis. There are some indications that PD acquires resistance to drug
treatment by evolving into a Parkinson-plus disorder, usually Lewy body dementia, although
transitions to progressive supranuclear palsy or multiple system atrophy are not unknown
(Apaydin H. et al., January 2002, Archives of Neurology 59 (1): 102-12; Spanaki C. et al.,
October 2006, Neurology 67 (8): 1518-9.).
Niemann-Pick diseases are genetic diseases which are classified in a subgroup of LSDs called
sphingolipidoses or lipid storage disorders in which harmful quantities of fatty compounds, or
lipids, accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and brain. In the classic infantile
type A variant, a missense mutation causes deficiency of sphingomyelinase. Sphingomyelin is
a component of cell membrane including the organellar membrane and so the enzyme
deficiency blocks degradation of lipid, resulting in the accumulation of sphingomyelin within

    WO 2013/091897                                                        PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               78
lysosomes in the macrophage-monocyte phagocyte lineage. Affected cells become enlarged,
sometimes up to 90 microns in diameter, secondary to the distention of lysosomes with
sphingomyelin and cholesterol.
Symptoms are related to the organs in which the fatty compounds or lipids accumulate.
Enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) may cause reduced appetite,
abdominal distension and pain as well as thrombocytopenia secondary to splenomegaly.
Sphingomyelin accumulation in the central nervous system, including the cerebellum, results
in unsteady gait (ataxia), slurring of speech (dysarthria) and discoordinated swallowing
(dysphagia). Basal ganglia dysfunction causes abnormal posturing of the limbs, trunk and face
(dystonia) and upper brainstem disease results in impaired voluntary rapid eye movements
(supranuclear gaze palsy). More widespread disease involving the cerebral cortex and
subcortical structures is responsible for gradual loss of intellectual abilities causing dementia
and seizures. Sleep related disorders are also seen, including gelastic cataplexy, which means
a sudden loss of muscle tone associated with laughter, and sleep inversion, which means
sleepiness during the day and wakefulness at night.
Treatments for Niemann-Pick disease are limited with care being mostly supportive.
Anecdotally, organ transplant has been attempted with limited success. Future prospects
include enzyme replacement and gene therapy. Bone marrow transplant has been attempted
for Type B. Supportive care through nutrition, medication, physical therapy and being
followed by specialists can help with quality of life.
The drug Zavesca comprising Miglustat as an active ingredient, provided by Actelion, has
been approved at least in the European Union for the treatment of progressive neurological
manifestations in adult patients and pediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease, also
referred to herein as NPC.
In an embodiment of the lysosomal protein having reduced activity, said lysosomal protein is
affected in an LSD.
A person skilled in the art will know other LSDs which can be treated with PCT and to which
the combination according to the present invention may be applied.

In an embodiment of the present invention, wherein an LSD is an LSD having a defective
degradation of a sphingolipid component, it will be understood by a person skilled in the art
that wherein a degradation of a sphingolipid component is defective, preferably also the
degeneration of several sphingolipid components may be defective.
In a preferred embodiment the lysosomal protein is selected from the group comprising an
enzyme, a membrane transport protein, a trans-membrane protein or a soluble non-enzymatic
protein. Preferably, the reduced activity is reduced as a result of at least one mutation within
the nucleotide sequence of a gene coding for the lysosomal protein. The gene product of said
mutant gene is more preferably the protein having reduced activity. Most preferably said
reduced activity results in an LSD and/or the reduced activity is reduced due to a mutation of
the amino acid sequence of the lysosomal protein.
In a still further preferred embodiment of the lysosomal protein being an enzyme said
lysosomal enzyme is selected from the group comprising a lysosomal hydrolase and a
phosphotransferase.
In   an embodiment       of the combination       according   to the present      invention  the
phosphotransferase is selected from the group comprising N-acetylglucosamine-1- phosphate
transferase.
In an embodiment of the combination according to the present invention the lysosomal
storage disease is a lysosomal storage disease having a defective degradation of a glycan
portion of a glycoprotein. In connection therewith it will be acknowledged that N
glycosylated proteins, in principle, can be affected by a lack of or a reduction of degradation
resulting in lysosomal storage. In case of aspartylglucosaminuria, for example, Asn-GlcNAc
units accumulate in the lysosome, whereas in case of manosidase the oligosaccharides
Man(al    -  3)Man(pl    -  4)GlcNac, Man(al -      2)Man(al -     3)Man(pl -- 4)GlcNac and
Man(al    -+ 2)Man(al   -+  2)Man(al -* 3)Man(P1 -+     4)GlcNac are formed (DeGasperi R et

    WO 2013/091897                                                        PCT/EP2012/005363

al., J Biol Chem 1991, 266:16556-16563.). It will be understood that in the latter case high
mannosylated proteins are affected with preference. As to fucosidosis, fucose containing
sugars are degraded. It will be understood that fucose is a sugar which is capable of forming
the last moiety of a chain or is capable of linking two different sugars.
A person skilled in the art will acknowledge that, for example, lysosomal proteins, secretory
proteins and membrane proteins, such as adhesion proteins and/or transporter proteins, can be
glycosylated.
In an embodiment of the combination according to the present invention the lysosomal
storage disease is a lysosomal storage disease having a defective degradation of polypeptides.
In connection therewith it will be understood that Cathepsin K is a cysteine protease.
Accordingly, all proteins comprising a cysteine residue and a nearby amino acid having a
basic side chain are candidates for degradation by Cathepsin K. It will also be acknowledged
that Cysteine proteases carry out various tasks in different physiological processes of the cell.
In an embodiment of the combination according to the present invention the lysosomal
storage disease is a lysosomal storage disease having a defective degradation or transport of
cholesterol, cholesterol esters and/or other complex lipids. A complex lipid as used herein
preferably refers to lipids comprising lipofuscine. In connection therewith it will be
understood that lipofuscine accumulates in NCLs and comprise a protein moiety, a lipid
moiety, preferably a sugar and preferably metal ion, wherein the lipid moiety results from
oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids.
In an embodiment of the combination according to the present invention the lysosomal
storage disease is a lysosomal storage disease having multiple deficiencies of lysosomal
enzymes. In an embodiment the lysosomal storage disease having multiple deficiencies of
lysosomal enzymes is selected from the group comprising galactosialidosis, Danon Disease
(LAMP2), pycnodysostosis (Cathepsin K), multiple sulfatase deficiency (Fgly-Generating
Enzyme), GM2 gangliosidosis (GM2-Activator), mucolipidosis type II and mucolipidosis
type III (N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase).       In connection therewith ,,multiple
deficiencies" as used herein preferably means at least two deficiencies of at least two different
enzyme activities in the lysosome, preferably of at least two different enzymes. As an

                                                82
example, the gene CTSA is mutated in galactosialidosis. CTSA encodes Cathepsin A (CatA),
which is a factor forming complex(es) with other lysosomal hydrolases (beta-galactosidase).
In other words, CatA is important for the functioning of different hydrolases. If not present
various degradation processes will not function properly. Accordingly, multiple deficiencies
are caused. In case of mucolipidosis the same principle applies: In mucolipidosis II the
enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase         is mutated, which is responsible for
marking lysosomale enzymes for their transport into the lysosome. The mutation in said gene
leading to a reduced activity of the protein/gene product results in multiple deficiencies of
enzyme activities which occur in the lysosome. In other words, the mutated genes the
mutation of which results in multiple deficiencies assist other enzymes in correct processing
and assist said enzymes in their catalytic function, respectively.
In an embodiment of the combination according to the present invention the lysosomal
protein is an enzyme, more preferably, the enzyme is selected from the group comprising
mutant a-galactosidase A preferably resulting in Fabry disease, mutant acid a-glucosidase

Ambroxol,      also    referred  to   herein    as   2-amino-3,5-dibromo-N-[trans-4-hydroxy

surfactant secretion in lung and for decreasing mucus viscosity (Disse, B.G. et al., 1987, Eur.
J. Respir. Dis. 153, 255-262). Ambroxol has been reported to protect alpha-I -proteinase

Winsel, K. and Becher, G., 1922, Eur. Resp. J. 5, 289). Furthermore, pulse radiolysis
experiments showed that Ambroxol is a good scavenger of the primary water radical species,
particularly e aq an -OH radicals (Tamba, M. and Torreffiani, A. 2001, Rad. Phys. And Chem.

Ambroxol as used herein, preferably has the formula according to formula (I):

Ambroxol is the active ingredient of Mucosolvan, Ambrosan or Mucoangin. The compound is
a mucoactive drug with several properties including secretolytic and secretomotoric actions
that restore physiological clearance mechanisms of the respiratory tract which play an
important role in the body's natural defense mechanisms. It stimulates synthesis and release
of surfactant by type II pneumocytes. Surfactants act as anti-glue factors by reducing the
adhesion of mucus to the bronchial wall, in improving its transport and in providing
protection against infection and irritating agents (Sanderson RJ et al. Respir Phys 1976; 27:
379-392.; Kido H et al. Biol Chem 2004; 385: 1029-1034). Furthermore, Ambroxol is
indicated as secretolytic therapy in bronchopulmonary diseases associated with abnormal
mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport. It promotes mucus clearance, facilitates
expectoration and eases productive cough, allowing patients to breathe freely and deeply
(Malerba and Ragnoli, Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol 2008; 4(8): 1119-1129). There are
many different formulations developed since the first marketing authorization in 1978. A
major product is the syrup with two concentrations of the compound, 30 mg/ml and 315
mg/ml, which can be given in adults and children from the age of 1 year on and even from
infant in the latter concentration. Other formulations are tablets containing 30 mg or 60 mg,
and a pastille to be sucked with 15 mg Ambroxol. There is also a sustained release form with
75 mg to be given once a day. Ambroxol is also available as dry powder sachets, inhalation
solution, drops and ampoules as well as effervescent tablets. Ambroxol also provides pain

                                                103
relief in acute sore throat. Pain in sore throat is the hallmark of acute pharyngitis (de Mey et
al., Arzneimittelforschung 2008; 58(11): 557 - 568).
Ambroxol is a very potent inhibitor of the neuronal Na* channels (Weiser T., Neurosci Lett.
2006; 395: 179 - 184). This property led to the development of a lozenge containing 20 mg of
Ambroxol. Many state-of-the-art clinical studies (de Mey et al., supra) have demonstrated the
efficacy of Ambroxol in relieving pain in acute sore throat, with a fast onset of action and a
long duration of effect of at least 3 hours. Additional anti-inflammatory properties of
Ambroxol are of clinical relevance since treatment lead to a marked reduction of redness of
the patient's sore throat.
Lysosomal protein having reduced activity, such as mutant lysosomal hydrolases, such as
alpha-galactosidase A affected in Fabry disease or acid a-glucosidase affected in Pompe
disease form a heterogeneous group of enzymes and moreover pharmacologic chaperones
such as DGJ or NB-DNJ, specifically act only in relation to a certain LSD, i.e. in relation to a
particularly specific enzyme as has already been outlined above.
Moreover, DGJ treatment does also not address all mutations of alpha-galactosidase A (alpha
Gal A) related to Fabry disease, which inhibits the broad application of the compound in
clinical use. This was shown when Fabry patient-derived T-cells were grown in the presence
of DGJ. Alpha-Gal A activity increased to more than 50% of normal in several mutations but
was unaffected in others. (Shin SH et al., Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2008 Sep; 18(9):773
80.).
It is therefore a common believe in the field of LSDtherapy that the response of a certain
mutant enzyme affected in an LSD to a certain pharmacological chaperone is dependent on
the affected enzyme, on (a)certain mutation(s) of the enzyme and thus on the certain patients
(Wu et al., supra).
It is thus the merit of the present inventors having found that the combined use of a
pharmacological chaperone and Ambroxol is suitable for increasing the activity of a mutant
protein in the treatment of an LSD such as Fabry disease compared to the application of said
pharmacological chaperone alone.

    WO 2013/091897                                                      PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               104
At least insofar the present invention turns away from the teaching of prior art in that
administering Ambroxol according to the present invention is useful independent from the
particular   LSD    and the particular pharmacological     chaperone   in that Ambroxol      is
administered in addition to a pharmacological chaperone specific for the particular treated
disease causing an increase of the activity of a mutant enzyme compared to the administering
of said pharmacological chaperone alone, although, preferably, Ambroxol is not causing an
increase of the activity of said mutant enzyme when administered alone.
A person skilled in the art will immediately acknowledge that the combination according to
the present invention is able to extend the use of a compound having the ability to rearrange a
lysosomal protein having reduced activity, such as a pharmacological chaperone, e.g. an
iminosugar such as DGJ, to a wider range of indications as if administered alone in that the
treatment with the combination according to the present invention allows the treatment of the
protein having reduced activity due to (a) particular mutation(s) which may be only
insufficiently treated with the compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein
having reduced activity, such as DGJ, alone. More specifically, the additional application of
Ambroxol, Bromhexine and/or a derivative thereof comprised in the combination of the
present invention may enhance the activity of the mutant protein having reduced activity to a
level sufficient to prevent the patient from having symptoms, from the onset of the disease or
at least for suffering from less severe symptoms. In contrast, the responsiveness of a mutant
protein having said particular mutation to the treatment with DGJ alone may not be sufficient
to induce a therapeutic effect.
Valenzano et al. (Valenzano et al., Assay Drug Dev Technol. 2011 Jun;9(3):213-35), for
example, describe that in most LSDs, 1% to 6% of normal activity has been estimated to be
sufficient to delay or prevent disease onset or to yield a more mild form of the disease. For
instance, 1/-2%of normal a-iduronidase activity has been reported in mild cases of MPS I
(Hopwood and Muller, Clin Sci (Lond). 1979 Sep;57(3):265-72) ; <1% of normal GCase
activity has been reported in mild Gaucher disease (Desnick RJ and Fan JQ, In: Futerman
AH, editor; Zimran A, editor. Gaucher Disease. CRC Press; Boca Raton, FL: 2006. p. 544);
6% of normal p-galactosidase activity has been reported in late-onset GM1 gangliosidosis
(Suzuki Y et al., Perspect Med Chem. 2009;3:7-19); 2-4% of normal           p-hexosaminidase

    WO 2013/091897                                                         PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                 105
activity has been reported in the adult form of GM2 gangliosidosis (Conzelmann et al. Am J
Hum Genet. 1983 Sep;35(5):900-13); and 10% of normal enzyme activity seems to prevent
GMI and GM2 gangliosidoses altogether (Leinekugel P. et al., Hum Genet. 1992;88:513
523; Mahuran DJ., Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999;1455:105-138).
It will thus be acknowledged by a person skilled in the art that 10%, preferably 20% and more
preferably 25% of protein activity compared to wild type protein activity is considered to be
sufficient for a therapeutically effective treatment, i.e. a treatment sufficient to induce a
therapeutic effect, and/or an enhancement of the activity of the mutant protein having reduced
activity to a level sufficient to prevent the patient from having symptoms, from the onset of
the disease or at least for suffering from less severe symptoms.
For example, enhancing the activity of a mutant protein compared to wild type protein
activity to 5% by administering DGJ alone, the activity of the mutant protein being 1%
without any treatment, will not be sufficient to prevent the onset of disease, i.e. the treatment
will not be therapeutically effective. By contrast, the application of the combination according
to the present invention, going along with additional application of Ambroxol, bromhexine
and/or a derivative thereof may further enhance the mutant protein's activity to 20%, thus
being therapeutically effective and prevent the patient from suffering from symptoms, or at
least may cause less severe symptoms.
In other words, the present inventors found that applying DGJ and Ambroxol in combination
according to the present invention is able to increasethe activity of mutant protein measured in
accordance with the cell-culture system as described herein to a level which would prompt a
skilled clinician to evaluate the patient's health status as "healthy", i.e. having an activity of
mutant protein which usually does not result in symptoms otherwise caused by the mutant
protein's reduced activity, whereas the treatment with DGJ alone results in protein activity of
the mutant protein which would prompt the skilled clinician to evaluate the patient's health
status as being ,,unclear" or as "diseased".
The present inventors also surprisingly observed an increase in the activity of a mutant protein
upon treatment with the combination according to the present invention compared to the

    WO 2013/091897                                                        PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                106
activity of the mutant protein upon treatment with the compound having the ability to
rearrange a lysosomal protein having reduced activity alone.
It is commonly known in the art that a certain protein having reduced activity due to a certain
mutation will respond better to the treatment with a compound having the ability to rearrange
a lysosomal protein having reduced activity than other proteins having other mutations. The
effectiveness of treatment may thus allow distinguishing between responsive mutations and
non-responsive mutations of the protein having reduced activity.
The present inventors observed that more responsive mutations, i.e. proteins having mutations
where the enhancement of protein activity due to administration of the compound having the
ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein having reduced activity was higher, also exhibited a
stronger effect in further enhancing the activity of said protein having said certain mutation by
applying the combination according to the present invention. Insofar, restoration of the
activity of a lysosomal protein the activity of which is reduced in a disease and more
specifically a lysosomal storage disease to an activity of at least 10 %, preferably at least 20
% and more preferably at least 25 % of the lysosomal protein of wild type and/or of the
lysosomal protein in a healthy subject, is preferably regarded as a treatment, preferably as a
treatment of the disease.
For example, and as may also be taken from Fig. 3 and Example 3 of the instant application,
a stronger effect in further enhancing the activity of certain GLA mutations, which exhibit a
strong responsiveness to treatment with DGJ alone (see also table 3), could be seen when
applying the combination according to the present invention. More specifically, said certain
GLA mutations are, for example, E59K (14.2-fold), A156V (3.9- fold) and R301Q (5.6- fold)
whereas the effect in enhancing the activity of mutant proteins was less strong with regard to
proteins less responsive to DGJ treatment. R356W (3.7-fold) and R363H (1.8-fold)
additionally show a relatively strong residual activity, i.e. high protein activity without
treatment.
In connection therewith it is important to note that other studies, e.g. related to the treatment
of Gaucher's disease with ryanodine receptors (RyRs), already considered an increase of 1.3-

    WO 2013/091897                                                           PCT/EP2012/005363

fold compared to the residual activity of the mutant enzyme as being clinically relevant
(Wang et al., ACS Chemical Biology, 2011).
Furthermore, Wu et al. (Wu et al., supra) showed that a protein having a particular mutation
and being responsive to the treatment with a pharmacological chaperone in vitro was not
responsive when tested in a patient having said mutant form of the protein, whereby the
patient was treated with        I OgM DGJ, and whereas in all other patients tested, the
responsiveness of the mutations of said patients tested in the HEK cell culture system
represented the responsiveness in clinical application.
It is thus a preferred embodiment of the combination of the present invention that the activity
of the protein having reduced activity is reduced due to a mutation of said protein, wherein
the mutation is responsive to the treatment with a compound having the ability to rearrange
the lysosomal protein having reduced activity when administered alone, i.e. the activity of the
protein having reduced activity is enhanced due to the treatment with a compound having the
ability to rearrange the lysosomal protein.
In a more preferred embodiment of the combination of the present invention the protein
having reduced activity is responsive to the treatment with a compound having the ability to
rearrange the lysosomal protein having reduced activity in a patient, wherein the enhancement
of the activity of said protein results in a protein activity of preferably 5% and most preferably
10% compared to the wild type protein activity.
As Ambroxol is widely used in connection with different diseases and symptoms including
acute pain, such as toothache, postoperative pain or herpes zoster induced pain, as well as
cranial infection, stroke, bums, pancreatitis or trauma, colic and headache, a person skilled in
the art will acknowledge that a dosage applied in the treatment of a patient suffering from or
being at risk of suffering from a lysosomal disease, such as Fabry disease will take into
consideration the already approved dosages to be administered in connection with said
diseases for which Ambroxol has been approved by health authorities. Accordingly, dosages
of Ambroxol preferably range from 30 to 4000 mg per day as described in US patent
application 11/856280 using e.g. Ambroxol tablets comprising 150-1200 mg as essentially
described in US patent application 10/888362 filed July 9, 2004 by Boehringer Ingelheim

    WO 2013/091897                                                         PCT/EP2012/005363

International GmbH or a lozenge as described in US patent 6,663,889 filed April 23, 2002 by
Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH. A person skilled in the art will also acknowledge
that up to 20g of Ambroxol per patient is applied for detoxification of patients suffering from
liver failure.
In the cell culture system preferably used in connection with the present invention an amount
of Ambroxol that results in an increase of alpha-galactosidase A activity is preferably in a
range of 20 to 60pM, preferably 4OpM, in order to achieve a stable effect, and may also be
taken from Fig. 2 and Example 3 as described herein.
A person skilled in the art will further acknowledge that a dosage to be administered to a
patient in order to treat a particular LSD, whereby said patient is suffering from or is at risk of
developing the same, will depend on the particular LSD to be treated as well as on the
particular combination according to the present invention and more particularly on the
particular compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein having reduced
activity such as a particular chaperone, and on the particular derivative of Ambroxol such as
bromhexine or Ambroxol contained in said composition, and on the particular condition of the
patient to be treated. Accordingly, a person skilled in the art will apply a dosage of Ambroxol
in the light of what has been outlined above, starting from a low dosage of Ambroxol and
varying said dosage depending on the success of treatment, whereby the success of treatment
may be monitored and controlled by regularly assessing the activity of the lysosomal protein
having reduced activity affected in the particular LSD.
When conducting experiments in the cell culture system as outlined herein the present
inventors have also found that when DGJ is administered together with bromhexine instead of
Ambroxol, the activity of alpha-galactosidase A is also increased compared to the effect
arising from DGJ alone.
In connection therewith it is important to note that Leet et al. (Lee et al. Pharmacol Res. 2004
Jan;49(l):93-8) showed that a maximum concentration of Ambroxol in human plasma as high
as 61.5 ng/ml could be achieved which corresponds to 0.15pM. With regard to Bromhexine
Bechgaard et al. (Bechgaard et al. Biopharm Drug Dispos. 1982 Oct-Dec;3(4):337-44)
disclose a concentration of bromhexine of 0.O8pM. A person skilled in the art will

    WO 2013/091897                                                          PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                  109
acknowledge that when administering a 32 mg tablet (77.6pmol) an intestinal absorption of
22-27% occurs. Referring to the blood volume and after substraction of loss by first pass
metabolism this should result in approximately 0.7pM, i.e. which refers to a 10-fold increase.
In clinical trials 10pM DGJ have been acknowledged as to be a clinically achievable
concentration (Wu et al., 2011, Hum Mutat).
A person skilled in the art will acknowledge that Ambroxol is a metabolite of bromhexine.
Bromhexine,           also         referred        to        herein       as       2,4-dibromo-6
 {[cyclohexyl(methyl)amino]methyl} aniline is a mucolytic agent used in the treatment of
respiratory disorders associated with viscid or excessive mucus. Bromhexine as referred to
herein preferably has the formula:
                                         aN       CH3
                                                             Br

                                                      Br        (II)
In addition, bromhexine has antioxidant properties. Bromhexine thus supports the body's own
natural mechanisms for clearing mucus from the respiratory tract. It is secretolytic, i.e. it
increases the production of serous mucus in the respiratory tract and makes the phlegm
thinner and less sticky. This contributes to a secretomotoric effect, i.e. it helps the cilia - tiny
hairs that line the respiratory tract - to transport the phlegm out of the lungs. For this reason it
is often added to some antitussive (cough) syrups.
Bromhexine is a synthetic derivative of the herbal active ingredient vasicine. It has been
shown to increase the proportion of serous bronchial secretion, making it more easily
expectorated. Bromhexine also enhances mucus transport by reducing mucus viscosity and by
activating the ciliated epithelium. In clinical studies, Bromhexine showed secretolytic and
secretomotoric effects in the bronchial tract area which facilitates expectoration and eases
cough. It is indicated as "secretolytic therapy in bronchopulmonary diseases associated with

    WO 2013/091897                                                       PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               110
abnormal mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport". Bromhexine is contained in
various formulations, high and low strength syrups 8mg/5ml, 4 mg/5ml, tablets and soluble
tablets (both with 8 mg bromhexine) and solution for oral use 10 mg/ 5 ml. The posology
varies with the age, but there are products for all age groups from infant on. Bromhexine is a
well-established and well tolerated product in its known indication. A skilled person will
agree that a dosage schedule of 8-16 mg administered three times per day will serve as a good
starting point for a therapy, wherein the combination of the present invention will be applied.
It is particularly noteworthy that the use of Ambroxol and/or a derivative thereof, such as
bromhexine in connection with the present invention is advantageous for the clinical
application of the combination of the present invention in that Ambroxol and bromhexine
constitute well tolerated drugs approved for other clinical uses.
Application of high concentrations of pharmacological chaperones is known to result in an
inhibitory effect on the mutant protein's activity and may also exhibit toxicity. As will also be
described herein in connection with Figures 5A and 5B the combined use of a dose of a
pharmacological chaperone, preferably a sub-inhibitory dose, and Ambroxol and/or a
derivative such as bromhexine is of further advantage as substantially lower doses of the
pharmacological chaperone may be used in order to achieve the same effect. In other words,
the treatment with a combination of the present invention is able to substitute the application
of a high dose of the pharmacological chaperone in order to achieve the same effect, i.e. the
same increase in mutant enzyme activity.
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the combination of the present invention
comprises a compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein having reduced
activity and Ambroxol and/or a derivative of Ambroxol. In a further preferred embodiment
said derivative of Ambroxol is bromhexine. It is thus also an embodiment of the present
invention that a combination according to the invention comprises bromhexine and
Ambroxol; Ambroxol; bromhexine; Ambroxol and bromhexine and optionally at least one
derivative of bromhexine other than Ambroxol; Ambroxol and/or at least one derivative of
bromhexine other than Ambroxol and/or bromhexine; and/or at least one derivative of
bromhexine other than Ambroxol and/or bromhexine.

composition according to the present invention a derivative of bromhexine and/or Ambroxol,
or the compound having the ability to rearrange a lysosomal protein having reduced activity is
a pharmaceutically active and pharmaceutically acceptable derivative. In other words, the

A subject as referred to herein preferably means an individual, preferably a human, to which
the combination according to the present invention and/or pharmaceutical preparation
according to the present invention and/or compound having the ability to rearrange the
lysosomal protein according to the present invention and/or Ambroxol and/or a derivative
thereof according to the present invention is to be administered and/or is administered and/or
has been administered independent from the health status of the individual and/or the genetic
status of the individual. In an embodiment of the various aspects of the present invention a
subject is a patient. Patient as used herein preferably means a subject, wherein the subject is
suffering from or is at risk of suffering from a disease.
In an embodiment of the combination according to the present invention the combination is
for use in a method of personalized therapeutic treatment of a subject. In connection therewith
it has to be understood that a skilled clinician will categorize a patient's health status, such as
the status of a human male, to be "ill" if, for example, a value of GLA activity is determined
in a sample from said patient which is lower than a cut-off value of 5 nmol MU/mg total
protein/h. It will be acknowledged by a skilled person that the decision whether or whether
not the combination according to the present invention will be administered to a patient is
preferably solely dependent on the genetic status of the patient, i.e. the particular mutation of
the respective lysosomal protein. More particularly such method of personalized therapeutic
treatment of a subject preferably comprises the following steps:

    WO 2013/091897                                                        PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               118
step a):        determining whether in a sample of the subject the lysosomal protein has a
reduced activity, preferably such reduced activity results from one or more mutation being
contained in the lysosomal protein compared to the wild type lysosomal protein;
step b):        identifying a compound having the ability to rearrange the lysosomal protein
having reduced activity, and wherein the compound is suitable for or is increasing the reduced
activity of the lysosomal protein; and
step c):        administering to the subject the pharmaceutical preparation, wherein the first
constituent is the compound suitable for or increasing the reduced activity of the lysosomal
protein identified in step b) and wherein the second constituent is Ambroxol and/or a
derivative of Ambroxol.
Accordingly, if a patient shows less than 5 nmol MU/mg/hr GLA activity said patient has to
have a "responsive mutation" such as one disclosed in table 3 herein,        whereas the health
status of a patient having a value of GLA activity of more than 5 nmol MU/mg total protein
but less than 10 nmol MU/mg total protein/h will be categorized to be "unclear".
If, according to the invention a protein, polypeptide or peptide, including but not limited to an
enzyme, is said to have a mutation, this preferably means that the amino acid sequence of the
protein, polypeptide or peptide is changed, more preferably changed compared to the amino
acid of the wild type amino acid sequence and/or the amino acid sequence of a healthy
subject.
It is within the present invention that each and any compound disclosed herein constitutes
another aspect of the present invention.
In an embodiment, the term "wherein the lysosomal protein has a reduced activity" means
"wherein the lysosomal protein has reduced activity".
As preferably used herein, reference to a range defined by an upper limited and a lower limit
discloses each and any integer contained within the upper limit and the lower limit including
the upper limit value/figure and the lower value/figure. For example, 1 to 6 carbon atoms

4MU-a-D-galactopyranoside (4MU-a-Gal, 2 mM) in 0.06 M phosphate citrate buffer (pH 4.7)
with some adaptations from the original method described by Desnick et al. (J Lab. Clin Med
81: 157, 1973). Enzyme reactions were terminated after 1 hr of incubation at 37*C by the
addition of 0.2 ml of 1.0 M glycine buffer (pH 10.5), prepared by adjusting the pH using 1.0
M NaOH. The released 4MU was determined by fluorescence measurement at 360 and 465
nm as the excitation and emission wavelengths respectively in a micro plate fluorescence
reader (Tecan, Minnedorf, SWITZERLAND). The measured enzyme activity was first
calculated as nm MU/mg protein/hr and normalized to one hundred percent wild-type activity.

Enzymatic measurement of u-glucosidase
Sample preparation was carried out analogously to the a-galactosidase A recordings. As
substrate, a 1.3mg 4-Methylumbelliferyl-a-D-Glukopyranoside/ml solution (in sodium acetate
buffer, pH 4.0) was used and 5ig sample/reaction were added. The reaction was incubated for
60 minutes at 37*C and stopped with IM Glycine-NaOH, pH 10.5. The released 4MU was
determined by fluorescence measurement at 360 and 465 nm as the excitation and emission

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis for the detection of a-Gal A protein was performed using a
commercially available rabbit anti-a-Gal A polyclonal antibody ([H-104] Santa Cruz)
Furthermore, a mouse GAPDH monoclonal antibody ([6C5] abcam) was used as an internal
loading control.
HEK293H cell lysates were generated by aspirating the media off the 24 well culture plates,
washing the cells once with 1 x PBS (Biochrom AG) and applying 200 pl ice cold RIPA
buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche) to the cells prior to a 20
minute incubation on ice. The cells were then rinsed off from the wells, transferred to micro
centrifuge tubes and spun at 14000 x g for 10 minutes at 4*C to pellet the cell debris. The
supernatant was used for the analysis. After the determination of protein concentration, 50 pg
protein were mixed with a suitable volume of 5 x Laemmli loading buffer, boiled for 5
minutes on a thermo shaker (Eppendorf), centrifuged at 14000 x g for 10 minutes at 4*C and
loaded on a Criterion precast 4-15% Tris-HCI gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred
electorophoretically to    a Nitrocellulose      (Amersham    Hybond     ECL) membrane       (GE
Healthcare). The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk in TBS
Tween 20 [10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) with 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20] at room
temperature for 1 hour, and then treated with a primary antibody against GAPDH diluted
 1:10000 in a milk/blot solution [3% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk in TBS-Tween 20] at
4*C overnight. After the blot was washed three times with excess TBS-Tween 20, the
membrane was treated for 1 h at room temperature with a primary antibody against a-Gal A
diluted 1:500 in the 3% milk/blot solution. After another wash procedure, a secondary
antibody mix of an Alexa Fluor labeled 680 anti-rabbit IgG antibody produced in goat
(Molecular Probes) and an IRDye800 conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody produced in goat
(Rockland) both diluted 1:10000 in the 3% milk/blot solution was applied to the membrane.
Following extensive washing with TBS-Tween 20, protein bands were visualized with an
Odyssey Infrared Imager (Li-Cor) and quantified using the Odyssey software.

Inhibition of agalsidase alfa (Replagal*, Shire Pharmaceuticals)
Replagal was diluted to 10nM in citrate-phosphate-buffer (0.06 M) adjusted to different pH
values (4.5; 6.7). Subsequently, different concentrations of the compounds (DGJ, Ambroxol)
were    added   ranging from    0-1mM.     Finally, the substrate   4-methylumbelliferyl-a-D
galaktopyranosid (1 mM) was added to start a 15- minute incubation in a water bath at 37 0 C.
The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200pil glycine-NaOH-buffer (IM, pH 10.5).
Fluorescence measurement was carried out in a micro plate fluorescence reader (Tecan,
Minnedorf, SWITZERLAND) according to the method above.
Example 2:     Effect of Ambroxol on GLA enzyme activity
Various GLA mutants indicated in Fig. 1 were prepared as described in Example 1. To the
enzyme preparation for the individual mutant 40 pM Ambroxol was given. The results are
indicated in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1 is a diagram indicating GLA enzymatic activity for wild type GLA and indicated
mutant GLA forms with and without Ambroxol. The activity was normalized with the activity
observed for wild type GLA having been set as 100 %.
The experiment was conducted as described in Example I at least 3 times; statistical analysis
was carried out using two-sided student's T-test. Error bars are indicated as standard error of
the mean using the Excel Software (Microsoft, Redmont, Washington, USA). p-values are
p<0.05; **-p<0.01; ***=p<0.005
As may be taken from Fig. 1, the addition of Ambroxol resulted in an increase in enzyme
activity of the GLA of the wild type. In contrast thereto, Ambroxol had no effect on the
mutant forms of GLA.
The present inventors used the system established by Asano et al. (Asano et al., 2000 supra)
and could reproduce the results with regard to the enhancing effect of DGJ when administered
alone. More importantly, the present inventors also found that GLA is not inhibited by
Ambroxol in said cell free assay.

All mutants were tested with regard to DGJ-responsiveness as referenced in table 3. No
reference indicates the mutation is exclusively tested in the hands of the present inventors. An
additional effect of the administration of the combination according to the present invention,
i.e. Ambroxol in combination with DGJ, was considered significant when *p<0.1, **p<0.05,
***p<0.01, ****p<0.005. For some mutations the additive effect of Ambroxol has only been
repeated twice resulting only in a trend of increased enzyme activity indicated by the symbol
(*). In table 3 an ,,X" in the column ,,non-responder, own data" is indicative for mutations
where the results of the experiments conducted by the instant inventors is different to at least
one of the indicated references with regard to the application of DGJ alone.
Example 3:     Dose-dependent efficacy of Ambroxol
In order to determine the dose-dependent efficacy of Ambroxol on the enzyme activity of
wild type GLA, wild type GLA was exposed to various titers of Ambroxol.

    WO 2013/091897                                                      PCT/EP2012/005363
                                              134
The results are indicated in Fig. 2 which is a diagram indicating the relative activity of wild
type GLA at various concentrations of Ambroxol with the activity of GLA without Ambroxol
being set as 100 %.
As may be taken from Fig. 2, the enzyme activity of wild type GLA increases with increasing
titers of Ambroxol. Furthermore, it is important to note that Ambroxol is not inhibiting wild
type GLA. There seems to be a local maximum or potentially saturation at or beyond an
Ambroxol titer of > 60 pM. The EC 50 was determined to be 21.2 JIM.
In connection therewith it is important to note that in contrast to mutant GLA the activity of
wild type GLA may be increased upon addition of Ambroxol which may be taken from Fig. 1
and Fig. 2.
Example 4:      Synergistic effect of combined use of DGJ and Ambroxol on enzyme
activity of GLA mutants
The enzyme activity of various mutant forms of GLA was determined upon exposure of the
mutant forms of GLA to (a) none of DGJ and Ambroxol, (b) 20 pM DGJ, or (c) 20 pM DGJ
and 40 pM Ambroxol.
The result is indicated in Fig. 3.
As may be taken from Fig. 3, all mutants of GLA which showed a beneficial effect on DGJ
treatment also responded to Ambroxol when both DGJ and Ambroxol were added to the
growth medium together.
A person skilled in the art will acknowledge that the assay described herein may be used to
identify particularly well responding mutants. Because of this, the use of Ambroxol in
combination with DGJ will be therapeutically effective/advantageous for patients responding
to DGJ treatment. More precisely, for all patients DGJ treatment has been approved to
enhance Gal A activity, additional treatment with Ambroxol can only be of an even higher
benefit.

    WO 2013/091897                                                           PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                135
In connection therewith it is important to note that for all mutant enzymes tested an increased
activity was measured upon application of Ambroxol in addition to the pharmacological
chaperone compared to the application of the pharmacological chaperone alone. This proves
the existence of a clear tendency which underlines the advantage of the combination
according to the present invention compared to the application of the pharmacological
chaperone alone. A person skilled in the art will thus immediately acknowledge that an
increase in mutant enzyme activity upon administration of the combination according to the
present invention has not to be necessarily significantly elevated compared to the
administration of the pharmacological chaperone alone as, on the one hand, in clinical
application the enhancement of mutant enzyme activity to only a low degree may already
result in preventing symptoms or disease as has been outlined above. On the other hand, a
person skilled in the art will also acknowledge that even if the application of the combination
of the present invention is not leading to significantly higher activities of mutant enzymes, the
combination of the present invention may still be advantageous over applying the
pharmacological chaperone in that the significant costs usually related to pharmacological
chaperone therapy may be lowered if the additional application of Ambroxol according to the
present invention can substitute for a certain amount of pharmacological chaperone applied,
still achieving the same or similar clinical benefit for the patient treated.
A Western Blot analysis was performed as described in Example 1 and the result is indicated
in Fig. 4. As may be taken therefrom, the stabilizing effect of DGJ is enhanced/improved by
Ambroxol. Ambroxol contributes to the higher amount of a Gal A in the cell. While being
stabilized the enzyme is no longer depleted from the cells by the endoplasmic reticulum
degradation machinery. The higher amount of protein/enzyme accompanies/correlates with
the higher activity measured.
It can be taken therefrom that the application of the combination according to the present
invention compared to application of DGJ alone leads to a higher amount of Gal A in the
respective cell. It will be acknowledged by a person skilled in the art that the mutation of Gal
A such as the ones of Fig. 4 do not lead to reduced expression of GalA. Rather, the mutant
Gal A is subject to a more rapid degradation, preferably due to misfolding of the protein. It is
assumed by the present inventors that application of DGJ and/or Ambroxol has no effect on
the level of protein expression of the lysosomal protein. More particularly, the combination

    WO 2013/091897                                                         PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               136
according to the present invention seems to counteract, like a chaperone, preferably a
pharmacological chaperone, the more rapid degradation, more preferably such counteracting
occurs through stabilizing the mutant protein and thus leading to a less rapid degradation of
the protein. It can be taken from Figure 4 and more particularly from the elevated amount of
protein level which can be detected that Ambroxol applied in combination with DGJ results in
a stabilization of the mutant protein and/or results in less rapid degradation
Example 5:      A combinational treatment of endogenous GLA mutants can substitute for
high DGJ doses
The enzyme activity of mutant forms of GLA was determined upon exposure of the mutant
forms of GLA to (a) different concentrations of DGJ and to 40 pM Ambroxol or (b) different
concentrations of DGJ and no Ambroxol as described in Example 1.
The results are indicated in Fig. 5.
More particularly, Fig. 5A shows a diagram indicating a dose-response relationship of GLA
activity of GLA mutant form A156V; and Fig.5B shows a diagram indicating a dose-response
relationship of GLA activity of GLA mutant form R301G.
As may be taken from Figs. 5A and B, treatment with 40 gM Ambroxol in addition to
treatment with DGJ alone enhances GLA activity.
It can immediately be seen, that an increase of 3.8-fold of GLA[A1 56V] activity is achieved
by application of 8 pM DGJ and 40 pM Ambroxol, whereas treatment with as much as 20pM
DGJ has to be applied in order to reach the same increase in mutant enzyme activity without
the additional treatment of Ambroxol, which is emphasized by the horizontal and vertical
dotted line.
In other words, approximately half of the concentration of DGJ, namely 8.9 pM, has to be
applied, if 40 pM Ambroxol are applied in addition, to reach the same effect as if 20 pM DGJ

    WO 2013/091897                                                      PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               137
is applied alone. The absolut measures of said assay are approximately 300 nmol MU/mg
total protein/h.
That there is a synergistic effect which arises from the combined use of both DGJ and
Ambroxol is evident from the fact that alpha-galactosidase A activity is increased up to 8-fold
in Al 56V mutant (Fig. 5A) when both 20 pM DGJ and 40 pM Ambroxol are administered,
whereas said activity is only increased to 4-fold of untreated GLA[A156V] activity in case of
20 pM DGJ administration only.
It can be immediately seen, that a 4.1-fold increase of GLA[R30 1G] activity is achieved by
application of 20 pM DGJ and 40 pM Ambroxol, whereas treatment with 20 pM DGJ without
additional treatment with Ambroxol results only in an increase of GLA activity of 2.8-fold
which is emphasized by the horizontal and vertical dotted line.
In connection therewith it is important to note that the absolute value of GLA activity was
determined to be 3.70.4 mnol MU/mg total protein/h. A skilled clinician will categorize a
patient's health status, such as the status of a human male, to be "ill" if a value of GLA
activity is determined in a sample from said patient which is lower than a cut-off value of 5
nmol MU/mg total protein/h. It will be acknowledged by a skilled person that the decision
whether or whether not the combination according to the present invention such as ABX/DGJ
will be administered to a patient is preferably solely dependent on the genetic status of the
patient, i.e. the particular mutation of the respective lysosomal protein. More particularly,
method of personalized therapeutic treatment of a subject would comprise the following steps:
step a):         determining whether in a sample of the subject the lysosomal protein has a
reduced activity, preferably such reduced activity results from one or more mutation being
contained in the lysosomal protein compared to the wild type lysosomal protein;
step b):          identifying a compound having the ability to rearrange the lysosomal protein
having reduced activity, and wherein the compound is suitable for or is increasing the reduced
activity of the lysosomal protein; and

    WO 2013/091897                                                         PCT/EP2012/005363
                                                138
step c):        administering to the subject the pharmaceutical preparation, wherein the first
constituent is the compound suitable for or increasing the reduced activity of the lysosomal
protein identified in step b) and wherein the second constituent is Ambroxol and/or a
derivative of Ambroxol.
Accordingly, if a patient shows less than 5 nmol MU/mg/hr GLA activity said patient has to
have a "responsive mutation" such as one disclosed in table 3 herein, whereas the health
status of a patient having a value of GLA activity of more than 5 nmol MU/mg total protein
but less than 10 nmol MU/mg total protein/h will be categorized to be "unclear".
In other words, the present data demonstrate that applying DGJ and Ambroxol in combination
according to the present invention is able to raise the activity of mutant protein, as measured
in the cell-culture system used herein, to a level which would prompt a skilled clinician to
evaluate the patient's health status as "healthy", i.e. having an activity of mutant protein
which usually does not result in symptoms otherwise caused by the mutant protein's reduced
activity, whereas the treatment with DGJ alone results in protein activity of the mutant protein
which would prompt the skilled clinician to evaluate the patient's health status as being
,,unclear".
It is important to note that in the herein described cell-culture system, a concentration of DGJ
as low as 4.72pM if applied in combination with 40pM Ambroxol is sufficient to elevate the
mutant protein activity to a level which is only reached if as much as 20PM DGJ is applied, if
DGJ is applied alone. In other words, this means that approximately only 25% of the
concentration of DGJ has to be applied if applied in combination with 40pM Ambroxol
compared to the concentration of DGJ which has to be applied to reach the same increase of
protein activity if DGJ is applied alone.
From this follows that the combination of the present invention is particularly useful in the
treatment of those LSDs and more specifically those forms of Fabry disease involving mutant
forms of GLA where the chaperone and more specifically DGJ alone is not sufficiently
effective.

   WO 2013/091897                                                      PCT/EP2012/005363
                                              139
Example 6:     Similar effects for Ambroxol and Ambroxol derivative Bromhexine
In this example the effect on enzyme activity of mutant forms of GLA of Ambroxol and its
derivative Bromhexine when combined with DGJ was compared.
The experiment was conducted as described in Example 1.
The results are shown in Fig. 6.
As is evident from Fig. 6 Ambroxol and Bromhexine perform similarly on the mutant GLAs.
In accordance with the results obtained by treatment with Ambroxol alone, see Example 2
herein, no effect could be seen by a treatment using bromhexine alone; and treatment with the
chaperone DGJ alone increased alpha-Galactosidase A activity. However, upon treatment
with a combination of chaperone DGJ and Ambroxol or a combination of chaperone DGJ and
Bromhexine, the enzyme activity of mutant forms of GLA could be significantly increased.
As may be taken from Fig. 6 the treatment with DGJ alone always lead to a highly significant
increase in protein, i.e. enzyme activity compared to "no treatment". There was no significant
differnece between protein activity measured after application of a combination of Ambroxol
and DGJ compared to protein activity measured after application of a combination
Bromhexine and DGJ. Protein activity measured after application of a combination of
Ambroxol and DGJ compared to protein activity measured after application of DGJ alone was
significant for the mutant proteins having mutations E59K, A156V (see also Fig. 3) and
G328A.
Example 7:     Similar effects for Ambroxol and NB-DNJ in Pompe disease
In this example the effect on enzyme activity of mutant forms of acid a-glucosidase of
Ambroxol and its derivative Ambroxol when combined with NB-DNJ were compared.
The experiment was conducted as described in Example 1.

    WO 2013/091897                                                     PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               140
The results are indicated in Fig. 7.
As is evident from Fig. 7 and analogous to what has been outlined above in connection with
the combination according to the present invention and Fabry's disease (see Figs. I to 6) the
application of the combination according to the present invention enhances the activity of the
respective   mutant protein in Pompe's disease         compared to the application     of the
pharmacological chaperone alone. More specifically, the application of 20 pM NB-DNJ in
combination with the application of 40gM Ambroxol enhanced the activity of acid a
glucosidase compared to the application of 20 gM NB-DNJ alone.
More particularly, the enzyme activity of mutations Y455F, P545L and L552P was
significantly increased by NB-DNJ and the combined treatment according to the present
invention using both NB-DNL and Ambroxol. Said mutations showed a tendency for higher
activities  when additionally treated      with Ambroxol. However,      only L552P showed
significance after 4 experiments.
Most importantly, Y575S       showed a clear tendency to be responsive only towards the
combination of the present invention.
It is important to note that Ambroxol administered alone is not leading to an enhancement of
the activity of mutant acid a-glucosidase.
Example 8:      Inhibitory effect of DGJ is not affected by Ambroxol
Wild type a-galactosidase A (Replagal*, agalsidase alfa) was incubated with different
concentrations of DGJ and with either no or a constant concentration of 40pM Ambroxol. The
result is shown in Figure 8.
More particularly, Fig. 8 shows that the inhibitory effect of DGJ on enzyme activity remains
unchanged by Ambroxol.

    WO 2013/091897                                                    PCT/EP2012/005363
                                             141
It can be taken therefrom that Ambroxol has no effect on the inhibition of WT a
galactosidase A by DGJ. The IC50 was determined to be unchanged in both applications
(0.07pM). Inlay diagram (upper right) shows the effect of addition of Ambroxol only at two
differnet pH values (pH 4.5 and pH 6.7). No reduction of the enzyme activity could be
detected.
It may be taken therefrom that Ambroxol alone displays neither an inhibitory nor a
stimulating effect on the wild type enzyme.
Example 9:     Effect of candidate compounds on the activity of a-galactosidase A mutant
A156V
Different compounds which are also referred to herein as candidat compounds or derivatives
of Ambroxol and Bromhexine, respectively, were tested in combination with DGJ as to their
effect on a-galactosidase A mutant A156V activity.
The results are shown in Fig. 9A, Fig. 9B and Fig. 10.
More particularly, Figs. 9A and 9B are diagrams indicating the activity of acid a
galactosidase A mutant A156V; the y-axis indicated the activity of a-galactosidase A mutant
A156V normalized to one hundred percent wild-type (WT) a-galactosidase A activity in the
absence or presence of treatment with Ambroxol (ABX), bromhexine (BHX) or the various
compounds as indicated on the x-axis in combination with 20 pM the pharmacological
chaperone DGJ.
It can be taken therefrom that particuarly compounds SF-54B and SF-55C show a high
increase in mutant enzyme activity when applied in combination with DGJ, whereby the
concentration of SF-54B and SF-55C is lOpM and 4OpM, respectively. Most important,
application of compound SF-80 when applied at a concentration as low as 1p M in
combination with DJG resulted in an increase in mutant enzyme activity as high as if
Ambroxol was applied at a concentration of up to 1OpM in combination with DGJ.

   WO 2013/091897                                                       PCT/EP2012/005363
                                               142
Fig. 10 is a panel of diagrams showing the activity of a-galactosidase A mutant Al 56V. The
y-axis indicates the activity of a-galactosidase A normalized to one hundred percent of wild
type (WT) a-galactosidase A activity in the absence of treatment with pharmacological
chaperone DGJ and increasing concentrations of Ambroxol (ABX), Bromehexine (BHX) or
the compounds indicated on the x-axis in combination with the pharmacological chaperone
DGJ. On the x-axis the concentration of the compound is indicated. The experiment was
carried out at least 3 times as described in Example 1 (except for Figs. I OE and 1OF, as
indicated in the figure). Error bars are indicated as standard error of the mean (or standard
deviation when N<3) using the Excel Software (Microsoft, Redmont, Washington, USA). p
values are *= psO,05; **=p<0,01; ***=p<0,005. The indicated stars show the significances of
treatment with DGJ alone compared to the treatment with a combination of ABX, BHX or the
named compound and DGJ. BHX (B) and especially SF-55C (D) showed a toxic effect on the
cells in a concentration of 80pM.
It can be taken therefrom that compounds SF-54B, SF-55C, SF-150B and SF153B show a
high increase in mutant enzyme activity when applied in combination with DGJ.
Example 10: Effect of candidate compounds effect on the activity of a-galactosidase A
mutants Y455F and L552P
Different compounds which are also referred to herein as candidate compounds or derivatives
of Ambroxol and Bromhexine, respectively, were tested in combination with DNJ for the
effect on the activity of a-galactosidase A mutants Y455F and L552P, respectively.
The results are shown in Fig. 11 A and Fig. 11 B.
Figs. 11 A and 11 B are diagrams indicating the activity of acid a-glucosidase. The design is
similar to Fig 7A and 7B, the iminosugar used in these experiments is DNJ. The diagram in
figure 11 A shows the effect on mutant acid a-glucosidase activity after addition of 20pM
DNJ alone and 20pM DNJ with 40pM Bromhexine (BHX) or a derivative compound thereof.
The diagram in Fig. 1 11 B shows the effect on mutant acid a-glucosidase after addition of
20pM DNJ alone and 20pM DNJ with 40gM of three Ambroxol (ABX)-like compounds. The
experiments were carried out at least 3 times (unless otherwise indicated). Error bars are

                                                143
indicated as standard error of the mean (or standard deviation when N<3) using the Excel
Software (Microsoft, Redmont, Washington, USA). p-values are *= p<0,05; **=p 0,01;
***=p<0,005.
It can be taken therefrom that the increase in the activity of acid a-glucosidase of mutant
Y455F is comparable when DNJ is applied alone or when Bromehexine, compounds SF-54B,
SF-55C and SF-124B, respectively, are applied in combination with DNJ. Most importantly,
the increase in the activity of mutant Y455F is higher when DNJ is applied in combination
with SF -150B and SF-153B compared to the effect arising from DNJ only.
It can also be taken therefrom that the increase in the activity of mutant L552P is higher when
compounds SF-124B, SF-150B and SF-153B, respectively are applied in combination with
DNJ compared to the effect arising from DNJ only.
