                         FOR USE WITH A SURGICAL TOOL
 [0001]         The entire content of the complete specification
of      Australian          patent      application          no.     2013266240         as
originally filed is incorporated herein by reference.
                              Field Of The Invention
 [0001A]        The invention is related generally to a surgical
instrument. More particularly, the invention is related to
a   powered       surgical         instrument      having      a   tool   unit     and    a
separate       battery         and    control    module       connectable         to  the
tool nit to energize and control the tool unit.
                          Background Of The Invention
 [0002]         Powered surgical instruments are often used In
surgical        procedures           such    as     orthopedic         surgery.       The
surgical instruments can be of many types such as a rotary
drill, reamer, wire driver, sagittal saw, oscillating saw,
reciprocating saw, ultrasonic device, etc. Typically, the
surgical       instrument           includes     a   housing        or  a   shell     The
housing holds             the    tool   power generating            components       that
outputs the energy applied to the surgical site. The tool
may      be a     drill       bit,     bur,    saw,    ultrasonic         cutting       or
cauterizing          tip,     etc.     An  energy     application,          such     as   a
drill bit, a saw blade, a bur, an electrode or ultrasonic
Lip extends forward from the housing.
 [0003]         Some powered surgical tools are energized by a
battery      that       is   attached      to   the   housing.         Typically      the
battery      includes          its    own   case    or   housing.       One     or   more
rechargeable cells are disposed in the battery housing. A
battery for charging this type of tool is disclosed in the
Applicant's PCT App. No. PCT /US2012/064764, the contents
or which are explicitly incorporated herein by reference.
                                             1

 [0004]        The use of a battery eliminates the need to provide a
power       cord connected to an external power source.                          The
elimination of the power cord offers several benefits over
corded surgical instruments.                   Surgical personnel using t1his
type of Instrument do not have to concern themselves with
either sterilizing             a cord so that it           can be brought         into the
sterile         surgical   field    surrounding the pat ent or ensuring
that,       during     surgery,   an unster        lized cord is        not
inadvert ertlY introduced in               _o  the surgical field.               Moreover,
the elimination of the cord results                     in   the like elimination
of t-he t ripping and tangli ng hazard,                    physical     clutter,        and
field-of-view blockage              that the cord otherwise               brings to a
surgical procedure.              Specifically,         when pul ed or tangled
during the surgical procedure,                    the cord can become
unste         lized,    can be pulled from the hands of the user,                        and
can be fully or partially disconnected fr om a power socket
thereby ceasing operation                 of the instrument           and/or creating
a potential for electrically                  shocking the patient.               Also,
the cord 1            prone to increased failure             relative      to other
components of the instrument when subjected to steam
sterilization,           such as with an autoclave.
 [0005]            A powered surgi cal tool also includes a manually
actuLated switch or trigger.                  The practitioner          using the tool
actuates th's           switch to control both the on/off state                       and
toe operating state of the tool.                      The   state of the trigger
is    motored          by a control circuit.            If   the tool is         battery
powered,         this   control   circuit      is   typically       in  the tool
         housin.It is     however     known at least in            the field of non
surgic a         tools   to place this        controller       in   th.e battery
housing.           :Based on the state        of the trigger this             control
circuit         selectively; applies energization                signals from the
cells       integral with the battery to the tool power generating
ci          t      The control    circuit      thus controls the energization

of the tool power generating circuit,           The inventors'
Assignee's US Pat.     No.  7,638,958,   the contents    of which are
incorporated herein by reference discloses one such battery
powered surgical tool.
 [0006]     The battery powered motorized surgical tools used
Loday are relatively large in mass,        1 .3  kg or more including
the batterV.     The motors internal to these tools tend to
output a minimum of 125 Watts of power.           These tools are
used for     p-l  cions where significant amounts of power are
required.    These applications include large bone resection
and removal procedures as part of knee or hip replacement
procedure.   These tools are also used for drillirng and
reaming bores into large bone such as femur.
 [0007]     Available battery powered surgical tools generally
work well for the purposes for which they are intended.
However,   to date,  it   has proven difficult to provide a
motorized battery powered motorized surgical tool that
outputs   power in  the rance   of 25 to 125 Watts.       These tools
are used for such applications where a relatively           small
application of- power is     required in order to perform a
delicate task.     These types of procedures       include
osteotimies and fracture fixatlons.         Typically these tools
weight 150 grams or less.       Manv of these tools being small
in   size are elongated in    structure,   shaped like an oversized
pen or pencil.     This allows the practitioner       holding the
tools to hold the tool like pencil.        This allows the
practitioner to by moving the thumb and. f
prec-sely position      the tools so that the tool      can perform
the desired task.
 [0008]     One reason that it     is  difficult to provide this
type of battery powered tool is        that it   has proven difficult
to provide package the components forming the tool as well

as the attached battery, in a unit the practitioner can,
with minimal strain hold between the thumb and forefinger.
                         SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

 [0008F]            According         to     a    sixth        aspect       of    the    present
invention            there      is    provided          an     assembly        comprising:         a
module according to the first, third or fifth aspect;                                           and
said tool unit or tool.
 [0009]             This     invention         is    related to           a new and useful
powered surgical tool assembly. The tool assembly of this
comprises both a tool and battery unit that are relatively
light        in weight and that are designed to minimize
                                                  4B

ergonomic stress of the practitioner using the tool.
 [0010]          This      invention          consists        of    an    assembly         that
includes a tool unit and a battery and control module. The
tool unit is removably attached to the battery and control
and    module.        The     tool      unit     includes        a    power     generating
unit, a unit that converts electrical energy into a form
in    which     the    energy       can be       applied       to a     site      on   living
tissue       in   order       to   perform         a    desired       medical/surgical
task.      Typically            the       energy        is    applied         through         an
applicator that is attached to or part of the tool unit.
Often the tool unit includes a coupling assembly that both
releasablv holds the                  energy applicator to the                    tool     unit
and    releasably            connects         the      applicator         to    the      power
generating unit.
 [0011]          The    battery         and    control      module       (BCM)      includes
one or more cells for hold charge that                               is applied to the
tool    power      generating           unit.      Also    internal         to   the     BCM    a
tool    unit      controller           that     regulates        the    application           of
power    to     the    tool     unit.        The   BCM also         includes       either       a
trigger assembly or a tool sensor. The trigger includes a
manually operated member the practitioner manipulates                                         to
control the actuation of the tool                          .   The tool sensor even
though        not     internal           to     the      tool      generates          signals
representative of the operating state of the tool. Based
on the     state       of the      trigger and/ or the                 output from the
tool sensor, the tool unit controller

regulates the outputting of current from the cells                     to the
tool power generating unit.
[0012]      In many but not all         versions of the         invention the
BCM includes both a trigger and the tool sensor.
[0013]      it is   a further feature of this invention that
when the tool unit and BCM are assembled together,                     the
assembly imposes minimal physical               strain    on the person using
the assembly.     This is   accomplished in             some versions    of the
invention by forming the tool unit so that tool unit has an
elongated pencil like shape and by providing a BCM that when
attached to the tool includes at              least     one battery that is
located rearward of the proirma               end of the tool.
[0014]      it is   a further feature of this invention that
both the tool unit and BCM are able to withstand the harsh
environment of autoclave       sterilization.             Specifically
exposure to an atmosphere saturated with steam                    (water vapor)
                                           0
at temperatures     in excess of 125 C at pressures of 2 bar.
This is   accomplished in    part by providing             compliant seals
around the electrical      pins that project             out from the BCM.
[0015]      In many but not all         versions of this         invention,
the tool unit motor functions as the tool power generating
unit.   In  these versions of the invention,                the BCM includes
sensors that provide data regarding tile magnetic rotational
position of the motor rotor.            Plural        sensors are provided.
The tool unit controller internal to the BCM selectively
employs these sensor signals to provide a hiohl                     accurate
indication of the rotational           position of the rotor.            Based.
on these position data,      the tool unit controlled               is  able to
precisely regulate the sourcing of current by the cells                     to
the winding of the motor.
[0016]      The cell or cells        internal to the BCM is /a re
rechargeable.     The BCM is     further designed so that BCM pins
over which charge is      outputted from the cell/cells                to the
                                        5

tool power generating unit also function as the pins over
which charging current is      applied to the cell/cells      for
storage.
[0017]     A further feature of      the assembly of this
invention is    that when the charger to which the BCM is
coupled performs more tasks that       just  the charging of the
cells.   Specifically,     the charger is   further able to test
the tool unit controller internal to the BCM.            This testing
ensures that,    when the BCM is   attached to a new tool unit,
the tool unit controller is      correctly   sourcing current.

                  DETAILED   DESCRIPTION  OF THE INVENTION
I.       FIRST EMBODIMENT
 [00100]       Referring to the Figures,      wherein like   numerals
indicate like parts throughout the several views,               a powered
surgical      tool assembly 10 is     generally shown for use in
surgical procedures         such as orthopedic surgery.       in  certain
embodiments,       the surgical tool assembly has a pencil-grip
configuration        to allow a user to hold and grip the surgical
tool assembly like         a pencil.     With reference to Figures 1
and 2,     the surgical tool assembly 10 includes a tool unit 12
and a battery and control module 14.             Battery and control
module      (BCM)  14 releasably engages the tool unit 12.          The
BCM 14 provides the power that energizes the tool unit               12.
Battery and control module 14 also controls the application
of the energization signals to the tool unit 14.
 [00101]       The representative tool unit 12       shown in    Figures 1
and 2 is      a sagittal    saw configured to hold and drive an
energy applicator 17.           Here energy applicator 17 is      a
sagittal      saw blade for cutting bone,      ligaments,   or other
tissue.       The saw blade can be used to cut small bones,          such
as bones in       a hand or foot.     Generally the device component
integral with the tool unit that           is applied to the
medical/surgical         site is  known as an energy applicator.
                                       12

 [00102]          In  other embodiments,              tool unit 12 may be a rotary
drill,      reamer,      wire driver,         oscillating           or reciprocating
saw,      ultrasonic device or photonic device.                          Likewise,    the
energy applicator may be a drill                       bit,      bur,  saw,  reamer,
grinding disc,           ultrasonic cutting or catheterization                      tip,
laser,      etc.      The type of tool used is                   not intended to limit
the present invention.
 [00103]          With continued reference                  to Figures 1 and 2,          in
the embodiment            shown,    the tool unit 12 includes a head 16
for supporting the energy applicator 17.                              The head 16 may be
like that shown in             U.S.      Patent No.         7,833,241     to Gant,
entitled,         "Surgical Saw Blade Coupler,"                     hereby incorporated
by reference.            As disclosed therein,                 the head 16 is moveable
between an open position in                   which the saw blade may be
removed,        exchanged or inserted,                and a closed position.               In
other embodiments,             the head 16 may be a collet                  for receiving
a drill       bit    or bur,    or another energy applicator.
 [00104]          A power generating unit                 18    (shown as a dashed
component in          Figure 2)       is   operatively coupled to the energy
applicator          17 to actuate the energy applicator                     17.   In    the
depicted version of the invention,                         power generating unit 18
is    a motor.        The power generating unit 18                    can rotate the
energy applicator 17,               oscillate         the energy applicator 17 or
reciprocate          the energy applicator                17.     In  other embodiments,
the power generating unit 18 may be a piezoelectric power
generating unit,            laser,      an RF generator,             or device
electrical          energy into signals that heat or vibrate the
energy applicator 17.
 [00105]          With reference to Figures 2-4,                     a casing 20
sealingly encloses the power generating unit 18 and supports
the head 16.           The casing 20 is             formed of metal or
alternatively          is    formed of medical              grade plastic      such as,
for example,          polyether       ether ketone            (PEEK)   or
                                                13

polyphenylsulfone.             The tool unit 12 is            conf gured to remain
operational after multiple cycles of sterilization.
Accordingly        ,  the head 16,     power generating                18,   and.
casing 20 are formed of materials able to withstand repeated
sterilization.            As used herein,        types of sterilization          can
include        steam    (such as with the use of an autoclave),                 gas
plasma,        ethylene oxide       (ETO) ,  hydrogen peroxide,         and/or high
pH solutions.
 [00106]          Battery and control module             14 includes a
housing 22.           The housing 22 defines a void space 24                  (see
cross-section          of Figure 4).        The housing 22 isolates            the
void space 24 from the physical                  environment       external to the
housing 22.           As  the BCM 14 is      subjected to the same
sterilization          process/processes         to which the tool unit 12 is
subjected without adversely affecting                     the components
internal to the BCM.
 [00107]           At least    one rechargeable          cell 38 is    disposed in
the void space           24 of the BCM 14.          Cell 38     is  typically a
lithium ion,          nickel cadmium,       or nickel-metal hydride cell.
The rechargeable            cell may be a capacitor or a micro fuel
cell.        Rechargeable      cell   38 powers the power generating unit
18.       In   the depicted version of the invention the BCM has
two cells         38.     As seen in     Figure     16,   cells    38 are series
connected together.
 [00108]          A tool unit controller           40 is    disposed in     the void
space 24 of the housing 22.                 Tool unit controller           40 is
powered by the rechargeable               cells     38.     Tool unit
controller         40 regulates the application               of energization
signals        from the rechargeable         cells     38 to the tool power
generating unit 38.              The tool unit controller            40 thus
regulates         the actuation of tool unit 12.                As set forth
further below,           the energization        signals are sourced through
and return over BCM contacts                76,    77,  e.g.,     male contacts
                                            14

shown     in  Figure 7,     and tool unit contacts            74,  75,  e.g,,
female contacts        shown in       Figure 2,      as set forth further
below.       Specifically,       as set forth further below, the BCM 14
includes      three BCM contacts         76 that connect with three tool
unit contacts      74,   respectively,          on the tool unit 12        to
transmit power from the BCM 14 to the tool unit 12.                          The BCM
14    includes two BCM contacts           77 that connect with two
unit contacts      75,   respectively,          on the tool unit to exchange
other types of signals.               These other signals are data and
command      signals.    It    should be appreciated that the tool
unit 12 can include any number of tool unit contacts 74,                         75
and the BCM 14       can include any number of BCM contacts 76,
77,     respectively.
 [00109]       Tool unit controller           40 includes a circuit         board
42.     A controller    44    (Figure 16)       is   mounted on the circuit
board 42.       The controller 44 includes               a processor     (not
identified)      and memory        (not numbered)         such as non-volatile
random access memory            (NOVRAM).      As set forth further below,
the controller       44 can also include one or more of a
plurality      of sensors.        For example,        the sensors can sense
conditions of the rechargeable                cell    38,   position   and/or
state of the power          generating unit 18,            temperature of
components,      engagement       of the tool unit 12 with the BCM 14,
and/or status of a user-actuated                   switch 56.
 [00110]       Switch 56 is       attached to BCM housing 22.
Switch 56 is      actuated by the practitioner                to control
operation of tool unit power generating unit 18.                        In   the
embodiment shown,        switch 56 is         a trigger that moves relative
to the housing 22.           In   this   embodiment,        the trigger pivots
relative      to the housing 22.
 [00111]       Housing 22 includes upper shell                26 and lower shell
28 sealed together to form the void space 24 therebetween.
Upper shell 26 and lower shell 28 are typically sealed
                                           15

together by laser or ultrasonic welding,         but it    is
appreciated  that the housing 22 can include any number of
sections  sealed together using other methods such as
adhesive bonding,     solvent fusing,    welding,   etc.     With
reference  to Figure 5,      a portion of the void space 24
includes  cavities 29 defined by the upper shell 26 and the
lower shell 28.
 [00112]   Lower shell 28,      as shown in   Figures   5-8,    is    formed
to have an upwardly directed        surface 27.   Upper shell 26,             as
shown in  Figures    9-12,   present corresponding downwardly
directed surfaces     30.    When the BCM 14 is   assembled
shells 26 and 28 are placed together         so that surfaces         27 and
30 abut.   Shells 26 and 28 are welded or otherwise             secured
together along the interface between surfaces           27 and 30.            In
the embodiment    shown in    the Figures,   the upper    shell 26 and
the lower shell 28 are sealed directly         to each other,         i.e.,
in  direct contact,    except along the chassis 46,        as shown in
Figure 4 for example,      in  which case the upper     shell 26 and
the lower shell 28 are both sealed along the chassis 46.                      In
other words,   along this     portion,  the upper shell 26 and the
lower shell 28 are sealed to each other by sealing to the
intermediately disposed chassis 46.          Upper shell 26 and/or
lower shell 28 can also include interlocking projections                    34
and/or can include aligned holes 36 for being fastened,
heat-staked,   etc.,   to lock the upper shell 26 and the lower
shell  28 together.
 [00113]    As best shown in      Figures  3 and 9,   the upper shell
26 includes blocks 33.        As best shown in   Figures      5 and 6,
the lower shell 28 includes        cutouts 35 receiving the blocks
33,  respectively.     Fasteners    37 extend through holes 39 in
the lower shell 28 and engage the upper shell           26.
 [00114]    Shells 26,     28 are formed of medical grade plastic
such as,  for example,     polyether   ether ketone    (PEEK)      or
                                    16

polyphenyisulfone,           or alternatively             are formed of metal.
However,        it   is  appreciated     that the housing 22 can be formed
of any type of suitable material without departing                               from the
nature of the present invention.                      The BCM 14 is      also
configured to remain operational after                       multiple cycles of
sterilization           and cleaning and thus is             configured to
withstand repeated sterilization.
 [00115]           Housing 22 permanently encloses the rechargeable
cell      38 in    the void space 24.            in   other words,     once
assembled to form the void space 24,                       the housing 22 is
configured to retain the rechargeable                       cell 33   for the useful
life      of the BCM 14.       Power source            38 is  configured to be
recharged while retained in                the void space 24,          i.e.,        without
removing the rechargeable              cell      38    from the housing 22.
 [00116]           Data identifying tool unit 12 is               read from a
memory module           (not shown),     such as NOVRAM,         disposed on the
tool unit 12.            The memory module          is    configured to be read by
the controller           44 when the tool unit 12 engages the BCM 14
through one or more battery and control module contacts                                 77,
e.g.,       male contacts,     and tool unit contacts              75    eg.,        female
contacts,         as set   forth further below.              This can be
accomplished through a separate                    channel or electrical
connection,          e.g.,  direct electrical             communication or
wireless       communication,       established when the tool unit                    12
engages the BCM 14.            The tool identification              data      is
transmitted over this           channel to the controller                 44.       The
controller          44 then accesses the corresponding operating
parameters          from memory and operates the power generating
unit 18 accordingly.
 [00117]           BCM 14 is   designed to receive different types of
tool units          12.   These tool units include units designed to
drive a       rotary drill,     a reamer,          wire,    reciprocating         saw,    an
oscillating          saw or a sagittal         saw.       The data controller           44
                                              17

reads fron the tool unit memory is                     used by the tool unit
controller 40 to contfigure the BCM 14 specifically for that
tool unit 12.
 [00118]          The tool unit controller              40 includes components
 (not illustrated) for providing input in                     addition to the
input received from switch 56.                     For example,    the tool unit
controller        40 can include a radiofrequency               transceiver     for
receiving a radiofrequen cy signal to control the speed of
the power generating unit                18.      The radiorrequency     signal can
be generated as a function                of the depression of a foot pedal
 (not shown)       .      This foot pedal is         depressed by the
practitioner           to,    for example,      control the operation      of tool
unit 12      .   Tool unit controller             40 can include a
piezoelectric            pickup for voice         activation by the userof         the
surgical        tool assembly.          The tool unit corItwol'er        40 can
also communicate with a hospital                     information network.
 [00119]          The depicted BCM 14,             as shown in   Figures 3-4,
includes        a chassis 46.         Chassis      46 supports the circuit
board 42.         Chassis 46 is         mounted to the housing 22.          In   this
version of the invention,                the outer perimeter of chassis 46
is    sandwi ched between           the   upper 26 and lower       28 shells.
Chassis 46           s formed wi L       notches      48 that receive the
circuit        board 42.        Protr usions 50 on the chassis 46 engage
toe hausing           22.     Specificall,        the protrusions     0  are seated
in    cutouts 35           formed in  the     oer     shell 28.     ddit ionally,
the chassis          46 and. shells define aligned holes             52 for being
fastened,        heat---staked,      etc.     to interlock the uper        shell
26,     chassis      46,    and lower shell        28 together.     As shown in
F igure 13,       the chassis 46 can define a cutout                51 for fitting
around the rechargeable cell                  38.
 [00120]         Tool unit controller             40 includes at least one
sensor       69,  shown in       Figures     3 and 4,     for measuring a
condition        associated. with an operating g state            of the power
                                               18

generating-unit        18 of the tool unit 12.             For example,         in
versions of the invention in             which the tool power generating
unit is     a motor,      sensor 69 monitors and generates output
signals representative             of the rot ational position o              the
tool rotor.         One such sensor capable of           generating       signals
representatives oF this rotor rotational position                      is   a Hall
effect sensor.         A Hall effect       sensor generates          signals that
vary wit h the sensed magnetic field.                  The magnetic       field
adj acent a motor rotor is            a fun ct ion of the rotational
position      of the rotor.         Other sensors may generate            sensor
signals as a function           of the operating rate of the power
generating unit; the temperature of a component                       of the tool
generating unit;         the voltage apolied across             or the current
applied       o  t    power generating unit.            The sensors may also
measure     a specific spectrum of liqht              that the tool unit 12
emits as a function of the operating                  state of the power
generating      unit
 [00121] The tool unit controller                4n of Figure 3 includes two
sensors     69.     Each of these sensors is           a HaIl     effect    sensor
that outputs an analog             signal of the magnetic          field sensed
by the sensor.         Two sensors are provided because the output
                                 1
signals     from plural Ha           effect     sensors is     typically what is
needed to provide an accurate representation                      of motor rotor
position.       Sensors 69 are disposed within housing void space
24 of the housing 22 so as to be isolated from the external
environment.         Sensors    69 thus measure the operating state                 of
the power generating uni              18 through the ca               20 of the
tool unit 12 and the hoi                 22 of the BCM 14l.
 [00122] As best shown         -in Fig ures 3 and 4.,       in   the depicted
veron       of the invention switch 56 is              pivota'lly mounted to
the housing 22.          The lower shell          28 of the BCM 14 defines          a
pocket     58.     Switch 56 includes        is    mounted to BCM housing 22
by a connector        60.    While not specifically            identified it       can
                                          19

be seen that the connector        has a ring-shaped head.             A
rectangular shaped body,        also not identified,       extends
downwardly from the head.         Connector 60 is      further       shaped so
that head and body lie       in  planes     that are perpendicular            to
each other.       The connector   60 is     seated in  lower shell
pocket    58.    Connector  60 is  formed so that a notch            5Y7
extends    side to side through the major faces of the
connector head.        A pin 62 extends through notch           57 in      the
connector     60.   The opposed ends of pin        62 seat in       opposed
bores    73 formed in    the lower shell 28       (one bore 73
identified) .      Bores  73 extend into notch 57.         Connector          60
is    thus pivotally connected to the lower shell 28.
 [00123]      Switch 56 includes a lever 64.          The proximal end
of lever 64 is      seated in   a closed end bore formed in
connector     60.    (Here proximall"    is   understood to mean
towards the practitioner        holding the tool assembly            10,    away
from the site      to which the energy applicator 17 is              applied.
"Distal" is      understood to means     away from the practitioner
holding the tool assembly 10,          towards the site      to which the
energy applicator is       applied.)     The bore in     the connector
 (not identified)      extends inwardly      from the outer
circumferential       surface of the head of the connector               60.
Connector 60 is       mounted to the lower shell 28 so the bore
extends distally       forward.   A finger pad 65 is       fixed to the
opposing distal       end of the lever 64.       The finger pad 65 is
configured to receive a finger of the practitioner.
Depression of the finger pad 65 exerts rotational                   force on
the lever 64 and connector        60.
 [00124]      A spring 66,   such as a coil spring,        is    disposed in
notch 58.     Spring 66 is   disposed about a pin 67.            Pin 67       is
fixed at the proximal       end into a bore that opens into the
distally     directed face of the lower shell         28.    The distal
portion of pin 67 extends through an elongated                slots      slot    59
                                      20

formed   in  the body of connector      60.    Spring 66       is  thus
compressed at one end between        the distally         directed face of
shell and at. the opposed end between the proxirmaIy directed
surface    of the body of  connector      60.    The force spring           66
imposes on connector     60 nrges the connector body away from
lower shell 28.     This force   is    transferred through the
connector    60 so as that,  in the absence of the application
of an overriding    manual  force,     the switch finger pad 65 is
iormaiy p voted     away from the underlying tool unit 12.                     It
should be appreciated that switch 56 is             physically       isolated
   rm void space 24 internal to the BCM 14.                  n ot her words,
no po oron of the input device         56 ext ends      i  Lo the void
space 2)4 .
 [00125]     Internal  to the BCM 14      there is     at east       one
sensor   68 that monitors the state,         the position,        of
switch   56.   In some versions of the invention              sensor 68 a
senso-r  sensitive  to local magnetic fields.              One specific
type of sensor that may be employed is             a Hall     sensor.       In
these versions of the invention,         a magnet       i s mounted to one
of the movie ng components of the switch 56.               In  the depicted
version of the invention a magnet           61 is   mounted to the end
of the connector    60 spaced from the connector head.                   Sensor
68 measures the relative     position of the body of the
connector    60 according  to any suitable method,             such as
measuring magnetic field     strength or direction             between toe
sensor   68 and the connector    60 as the switch Is             depressed.
It  should be appreciated that the material forming the
shells 26 and 28 is     material through which the magnetic
fields are able to flow with attenuation and distortion
levels that do not affect the ability            of the sensor 68 to
output signals representative        ot   switch position.
 [00126]     The signal output by sensor          68 is    applied to tool
unit controller    60.   The tool unit controller,             uses the
                                    21

signal     from sensor 68 to determine the practitioner-desired
operating state for tool assembly 10.                   In  the embodiment
shown,    the magnetic field          is   sensed through     cowl portion of
the la wall of the upper shell 26 without                   requiring any
mechanical       penetration     through the wall.          Alternatively,     the
sensor 68 may measure the position of the connector                      60
relative      to the housing 22 in           any suitable fashion.
 [00127]       As best shown in          Figure 3,   sensor 68 and sensors
69 are mounted on the chassis 46 in                 the housing 22.       The
sensor 68 and sensors           69 are disposed entirely within the
void space 24 of the housing 22 such that the sensor 68 and
sensors      69 are completely isolated from the environment
external      to the housing 22.
 [00128]       it   is   appreciated that the BCM 14 can include more
tnan one input device.             For example,      in   such a situation,
one input device can control               the head 16 in     a forward
direction and the other input device can control the head 16
in    a reverse direction.          As another example,        one input
device can control speed of the head 16 and the other input
device can control direction of the head 16.                    When the BCM
14    includes more than one input device,                the tool unit
controller        40 can include at least          one sensor 68 for eacn
input device.          It  is  also appreciated that,         while the input
device 56 is        shown in    the figures as a trigger,          the input
device 56 can be any type of input device such as buttons,
dials,    etc.,     that communicate with the controller             44.
 [00129]       As set     forth above,       housing 22 sealingly encloses
the rechargeable          cell 38 and the tool unit controller              40 in
the void space 24 .           Housing     22 also supports the input
device 56 external to the void space 24 with respect to
sensor     68 and sensors       69.      This configuration allows the BCM
14 to remain operational            after      multiple cycles of
                                            22

sterilization with high temperature and pressurized steam
with the use of an autoclave.
 [00130]      Battery and control module housing 12 is       designed
to releasably receive the tool unit 12.          As seen if   Figures
2-4,    the BCM lower shell 28 Is      shaped to define a cavity 70
configured to receive the casing 20 of the tool uni            12.
Toe casing 20 of the tooi unit 12 and/or the housing 22 of
the BCM 14 include locking features 72 for releasably
engaging the holding the casino in         the cavity.    The locking
   features       n be releasable detents that interact with
corresponding       tent pockets,
                  dneo               snap-lock features,    and the
like.     The locking features 72 can also include one or more
buttons     (not shown)   for releasing the casino 20 from the
Cavity 70.
 [00131]      Tool unit 12 and BCM 14 are configured to be- in
electrical communication with each other when the tool unit
12 is    engaged with the SCM 14 in      the cavity 70.
Accordingly,     tool unit 12 includes tool unit contacts 74,         as
shown in     Fgrmre 2,   and BCM 14 includes BCM contacts 76,      as
shown in     Figure 7.    When the tool unit 12 is    engaged with
the ECM 14 in     the cavity 70,   the tool unit contacts 74 and
the 2CM contacts       76 are al gned such that the tool unit
contacts     74 are in   contacL with and communicate with the -CM
contacts     76, respectively.    The tool unit contacts 74 are
typically y female contacts and the BCM contacts 76 are
typically male contacts that engage the female contacts when
the tool unit 12 is       engaged with the BCM 14.      For example,
the tool unit contacts 74 can be sockets and BCM contacts 76
can be pins that are enoaoeable with the sockets.            However,
it    should be appreciated that the tool unit contacts 74 and
the BCM contacts 76 can be any type ot corresponding
contacts without departing from the nature of the present
invention.
                                    23

[00132]      From Figures 1 and 4 itshould                 be understood that
when the tool unit 12 is             attached to BCM 14,          the proxima]
section of tool unit 12 is               disposed under one of the
cells   38.    As a result         of this       design feature of tool
assembly 10 an appreciable portion of the mass of the
assembly 10 is         located approximately           3 to 5 cm proximally
from finger pad 65.              This facilitates       the use and
manipuIation       of the tool assembly like a pencil,                  paint brush
or other elongat ed implement.                  More particularly       the tool
can be held so that            the disal         end of the tool unit rest s on
the side surface of the middle finger while the section of
the assembly in          which the assembly center of gravity is
located rests either on the web between the thumb or the
forefinger or immediately behind this                   portion of the hand.
Given this      location of the center of gravity of the tool
assembly 10,       the practitioner does not have to exert
appreciable ef-fort          to,   with the t-humb and mi dd e fi nqe r,
hold the assembly in             the desired position.
[00133]      Contributing          to the ergonomic ease of usi nq the
tool is   i-hat finger pad 65 is              located a sho-rt distance
forward of th          center of g-avity.            This makes     i    possible to
with mii    ma:    ergonomic effort use- the foref anger to control
the actuation         of switch 56.           It   should likewise be
appreciate ed t hat with the tool unit,                not in c ld'n      the
energy al        it -or    17,    extends approximately 6 to 9 cm
forward of the BCM hou sing 22.                   This means that the portion
of the tool the practitioner                manipulates with the thumb and
forefincer are small in             volume,       at least  in  comparison to
the proximal portion of the assembly                   10.
[00134]      It    is    appreciated that the tool unit 12 and the
BCM 14   shown in        the    figures include a total         of ffive tool
unit contacts         74,  75 and five corresponding battery and
control   module contacts 76,             77,     respectively.       As set forth
                                             24

above,     in   such a configuration,            for example,    three of the
tool unit contacts 74 and a corresponding three of the BCM
contacts       76 are the contacts over which energization signals
are sourced to and returned from the tool power generating
unit.      The other two of the tool unit contacts                  75 and the
other two of the BCM contacts 77 are the contacts over which
the controller        44 reads data        from the tool unit memory.             In
an alternative embodiment,             the tool unit 12 and the BCM 16
can each include a sixth corresponding                     BCM contact used as a
logic power connection            (e.g.,    3.3 V),      which would allow for
a bidirectional        data line.       It    is   appreciated that the tool
unit 12 and the BCM 14 can include any number of tool unit
contacts       74 and BCM contacts         76,    respectively,     without
departing from the nature of the present invention.
 [00135]        Tool unit contacts         74,    75 extend through the
casing 20 and are in           communication with the power generating
unit 18.        Battery and control module              contacts   76, 77 are in
communication with the rechargeable                   cell   38, through the
controller       44.   The BCM contacts           76,   77 extend through the
housing 22.         Battery and control module contacts 76,                 77 are
in  electrical       contact with the tool unit contacts 74,                 75
when the tool unit 12 is            received by the housing 22 of the
ECM 14.        This electrical      contact allows the BCM 14 to
energize the power           generating unit 18 of the tool unit               12.
 [00136]        The BCM contacts       76,    77 are sealed to the housing
22.     Specifically,        seals   (not shown)       are typically disposed
between      the BCM contacts       76,    77 and the housing 22.           The
seals can be,        for example,      0-rings,       energized    seals,
gaskets,       elastomeric compound,          etc.     These seals are
configured to maintain           sealing capability after            multiple
cycles of sterilization.
 [00137]        The BCM housing 22 encloses the void                space 24
except for the area through which the BCM contacts                       76
                                           25

extend.   As set forth above,         seals are disposed between       the
BCM contact 76,     77 and the housing 22.
 [00138]   As shown in     Figure 4,       the BCM contacts 76,     77 are
disposed in    the cavity 70 and,         more specifically,    are
disposed at an end of the cavity 70 .             Tool unit contacts     74,
75 are disposed at a corresponding             end of the tool unit 12
to align with the BCM contacts            76,  77 when the tool unit 12
is  engaged with the BCM 14 in          the cavity 70.
 [00139]   Battery and control module            14 can be
interchangeably used with multiple types of tool units 12.
For example,    the BCM 14   can be interchangeably         used with
separate  tool units     12 having different        types of heads    16 or
that hold different types of tools.              Similarly,  the tool
unit 12 can be interchangeably            used with similar BCMs 14.
For example,    one SCM 14 that has a rechargeable           cell   38 that
requires  recharging,     e.g.,    a drained rechargeable battery,
can be replaced with another BCM 14 that has charged
rechargeable    cell 38.
 [00140]   Battery and control module            contacts  76 are
configured to couple with a recharging unit              (not shown)   to
recharge  the rechargeable       cell     38.   Specifically,   the cavity
70  can receive the recharging unit when the cavity 70 is
unoccupied by a tool unit 12.             The recharging unit is
configured to be received in          the cavity 70 and engage the
ECM contacts    76.   In  other words,        the recharging unit
includes  recharging contacts oriented to engage the BCM
contacts  76 when the recharging unit is            received in   the
cavity 70.     Specifically,     the recharging unit engages at
least two of the BCM contacts 76 that communicate with the
power generating unit 18 when the tool unit 12 is               engaged
with the BCM 14 .
 [00141]   A charger,     not illustrated        and not part of this
invention,   is  used to charge cells          38 internal  to the
                                       26

BCM 14.       Charges that can be used to charge the cells                    are
versions of the charges disclosed                  in   Applicant' s Assignee' s
US    Pat.   No.  6,018,227 and its          US  Pat,    Pub        UNo.US
2007n/0     90788 each of which is           incorporated herein by
reference.        To charge the BCM of this invent ion,                the BCM is
fitted      to a module attached to the charger.                 The module
contains      contacts    similar to those integral with the tool
unit    14.     The BM contacts         76 and 77 connect to the charger
module contacts.
 [00142]       As described above,           tool unit controller         40
count rols the sourcing of energ                at ion signals to t he t ool
unit power gene rating          nt      1 8 based on input       from swit-ch
state     sensor 68.      The tool unit controller of Figure 16
includes      a switch circuit       78 that       selectively connects
cells     38 to tEhe BCM contacts          76.     In   the depicted version of
tne invention,       this   switch circuit           is  an  -bridge.       The H
bridge consists of three pairs of series connected n-channel
MOSFETs      80.   The drains of the upper MOSIET of each pair of
MOSFETs receive        the positive voltage from t                 cel
                                                                  <e    s 38.       The
sources of bottom MOSFET            80 of each pair of MOSFETs is               tied
to around.        Each contact      76 is      connected to the      junction       of
a separate one of the pairs of series connected MOSFETs.                              It
should further be understood that the body diodes of
MOSFETs      80 are  each   f reward biased from the ground line to
 Thc hih      vol tage bus.
 [00143]        Tool unit controller           further includes      two n-
channel      MOSFETs 88 and 90 that are series                connected
together.        MOSFETs 88 and 90 are located between                 the cathode
of the series connected           cells      3:8 and the high voltage bus
connected to the drains of t-op located MOSIETs                     80.     The
drains of MOSFETs         88 are 90 are tied            together.    MOSFET 88 is
thus arranged so that the body diode of MOSFET                      88 is    forward.
biased from the cathode of cells                 38 to the high voltage bus.
                                            27

MOSFET 90 is         arranged so that. the body diode of MOSFET                    90 is
reverse biased from the cathode of the cells 38 to the high
voltage     ine.       MOSFETs 88 and 90 are both cated                  y signals
asserted from controller              44.
[00144]        Controller 44 ouCpt control signals t                      the gates
of MOSFE-s       80.     Contro ler       44 is      able to ouut       the signals
to the MOSFE s so that ene rgzation                     signals a e al'e        to
sourced to and sunk             (returned) from the tool power
generating       iri     over the tool unit            contacts     7   rd t-he BCM
contacts     76.      As described above some tool                           this
                                                                         of7nts
invention      include motors as their                power generating units 18.
Controller       44 is    able to causes            the sources     of energization
signal     to a three phase motor.
[00145]        As also seen in         Figure 16,         the signals output from
switch   state       sensor    68 and tool state           sensors 69 are applied
to controller 44.           As discussed controller 44 employs                    these
signals as input signals to regulate the outputting of
energization signals by the BCM 14 to the tool unit 14.                                F or
example,     when the to0l unit power generating unit 18 is                          a
motor,   the signal from sensor                 68 is   the sensor     signal
representative         of both the use desired on./off state of the
motor as well as the user desired speed.                        The signals from
sensors    69 are the signals representative                    of the rotational
position     of I-he rotor internal               to the motor.       Based on these
signals the tool unit controller                     44 gates   the MOSFETs 80 so
as to cause sequencing             of the application of commutation
currents     to the windings as wel                  as the appropriate pulsing
or this    current.
[00146]        During times when the BCM 14 is                  employed to source
power   to   the tool      unit    12,    controller       44 turns    MOSFET     90   on.
Owiing to the body diode of MOSFET                    88 being forward biased,
there is     typically no requirement                 to also turn on MOSFET 88.
                                              28

 [00147]   When the BCM 14         is  attached to the charger current
can be sourced through one of the contacts                   76.      A second
contact  76 serves as the connection through which a ground
connection,   a return connection,          is    established between             the
components   internal to the BCM,          including the cells              38,   and
the charger.      Current is    therefore sourced through the
MOSFET 80 labeled Q1.        in   the illustrated          version of the
invention MOSFET 80 labeled Q8 functions as the MOSFET
through which the ground a ground connection                     is   made.      Since
the body diodes of MOSFETs 80 are forward biased,                        there is
now need to,   when attaching the BCM to the charger,                       turn on
the MOSFETs 80.
 [00148]   Alternatively,       in    such an embodiment,             a charge
contact may pass through a ground contact                   (identified with a
dashed line in     Figure 16 labeled "'Current path (if
additional ground connection is            used) ")        In   this     case,    the
ground contact     serves as a reference voltage connection                       for
both the charging circuit         82 and a communication               circuit.
It  is to be appreciated that the drive circuit                      78 may be
included as part of the charging circuit                 82.
 [00149]   In  other words,       at least      one of the three BCM
contacts  76 serves    a dual purpose of 1)            connecting the
charging circuit 82 to the recharging unit when the
recharging unit is     coupled to the BCM 14 and 2)                   connecting
the drive circuit     78 to the tool unit 12 when the tool unit
12  is coupled to the BCM 14.            Said differently,            at least     one
of the BCM contacts 76 that connects to a tool unit contact
74 during operation of the tool unit 12 also connects to the
recharging unit during recharging.                Since at least           one of
the BCM contacts     76 serves two purposes,             the overall           number

advantageously reduces cost,           increases reliability,               and
decreases  the area required to support the BCM contacts                          76.

 [00154] An alternative powered surgical tool assembly 120 of
this   invention is       now generallv         described b         -reference        to
Figures   17-19.       Powered      surgical tool assembly v10                  includes
a tool unit 124        that is      removably attached to a battery and
control module e 128.           The illustrated          tool unit 124 includes
a motor 950 as a power generating unit.                      The particular             tool
unit is   designed to oscillate               a sagittal     saw blade 17.
Internal   to BCM 128 are two rechargeable                   cells       38.      Cells    38
provide the power for energy zig                  the tool unit motor 950.
Also   internal     to the tool unit 128 is               a tool unit
controlle-.r   530    (Figure 45)           The tool unit controller                 530
regulates    the application of energization                   signals from
cells   38 to the tool unit motor 950.                    A switch 440 is
moveable mounted to the BCM 12.                    Tool unit controller                530
includes   a sensor that monitors               the manual actuation               of
switch 440.       In   part,     in  response to the actuation                  of the
switch 440,     the tool unit controller                 controls the

                  B.    BATTERY AND      CONTROL MODULE
 [00155] The BCM 128 includes a proximal                    shell 132 and a
distal       shell 162.      Shells 132 and 162 are sealed together to
form the housing or body of the BCM 128.                        Shells 132 and 162
are formed from a pIastic such as pol yphenylsulfonre                       or
polyetheretherk etorne or other material                   able to withstand the
rigors of autoclave sterilization.
 [00156]                Further,    the material       forming the BCM housing
should,       at least    adjacent the below described               sensor 566,  is
a material through which Lhe signal monitored by the
sens or 566 can pass without being distorted or atenuated to
a level that appreciably affects                   the ability      of the
sensor       566 to detect th chcaracteristics                 of Lhe signal.
Similarly,          at least the material          forming the BCM housing
adjacent the below described sensors 594 is                        a material
through which the           type of sgnal          monitored by these
sensors       594 can pass without          beinq distorted or attenuated
to a Ievel that appreciably affects                   the abiI i t v of the
sensors       594 to detect the energy level..                 Here "adversely
affects" is          understood    to mean a distortion            or attenuation
of these               that result     in   the sensors not beina able to
outputsicnals           that,  with the required degree of accuracy
  or this invention,          that reflct          changes in      the
characteristics          of the signals.
 [00157]          From Figures 2r and 22 it           can be seen       that the
proximal        shell 132 is     a sge           ice   unit.       Shell  132 is
                                             32

shaped to have a bottom portion,     not,  identified that curves
outwardly and upwardly into two opposed curved side
panels 134.   At the proximal end of the shell the side
panels 134 curve into a top panel 136.       Distal to the top
panel 136 the side panels 134 curve inwardly so come
together at the top of the shell.      A transition panel 138
curves upwardly from the distal end of the top panel 136 to
close off the shell at the location where the side
panels 134 project above the top panel 136.        An end
plate 140 forms the proximal end of proximal shell 132.
[00158]    A generally circularly shaped step 142 is       integral
with and located distally forward inwardly from end
plate 140.   Step 142 thus defines a recess in      the end
plate 140.   The step 142 is  formed to have an opening 144
that extends proximally-to-distally     through step 142.      A set
of ribs 146 project proximally outwardly from the proximally
directed face of step 142.    Ribs 142 are radially spaced
from opening 144.   Inside the shell 132 two circular
ribs 148 and 150 extend distally forward from the distally
directed face of step 142.    Rib 148 extends forward around
the volume immediately forward of opening 144.        Rib 150 is
spaced radially outwardly from so as to be spaced radially
away from rib 148.   Step 142,   opening 144 and ribs 146,      138
and 150 are provided to facilitate the mounting of a
pressure relief valve 154,   seen in   Figures 18 and 20,    to
shell end plate 140.   Pressure relief valve 154 is       provided
to facilitate the venting of the void space internal to the
BCM 128 during sterilization.      The structure of the pressure
relief valve 154 is  not part of the present invention.
[00159]    Two parallel ribs 156 extend distally forward from
the inner surface of end plate 140.       Ribs 156 extend
laterally across the end plate 156.       The ribs 156 are spaced.
apart.   Two parallel ribs 158 extend inwardly from the
                                33

opposed inner surfaces           of shell    side panels 134          Each
rib 158 is      located within the       proximal shell 132 so as to be
at a height that approximately             corresponds to the height of
a separate one of the ribs 156.               Each rib 153 extends
  ongitudina l    y distally      forw ard from the associated rib 156.
Each      b 158 t-erminates a short          distance,   less than 1 cm,
   from the open proximal        end of the shell.
 [00160]      The distal      shell    62 has a main portion 164 that,
in    cross section planes perpendicular to the oroximal-to
distal    longitudinal       axis through      the shell is   elliptical      in
snape.     The proximal end of shell main portion               164 is     open
and shaped to mate with the open distal                end of oroximal
shell    132.    A lip   163 that is     slightly     smaller in      shape then
toe main portion,        extends proximally         rearward  from the main
portion.      Lip 163 is      steeped inwardly       from the outer
perimeter of the main portion.               When the BCM 128 is
assembled,      lip 163 seats against the inner surface of the
distal    end of proximal        shel   132.      Not identified is       the
tapered outer surface of                163.
 [00161]      A nacelle      166 extends     forward from the shell main
portion    164.      The distal    s el    162 is    formed so i-hat the
nacelle    166 extends distally         forward from the lower section
of shell main portion 164.
 [00162]      Distal shell 162 is        further     formed so i-hat
immediately proximal to and above nacelle                166 the shell main
section    has two side opposed side panels 168,              identified in
  igure 24.       ide panels1O         are tapered. in    that extending
from the distal        end of each panel the panel          angles away from
the vertical      plane that intersects           the longitudinal       axis of
the distal      shell 162.       Forward of the proximal end of each
side panel      168,   the panec is     form to define a recessed
surface    170.      From Figure 23 it       can be seen that each
recessed surface nas a circular              section     A boss     172 extends

outward v from each recessed                 surface 170          A closed end
bore 173 extends inwardly from the outer surface of the
boss 172.       Annular ribs         (not identified) project outwardly
from t.he outer surface of the boss
 [001631 Each side panel 168 is                further shaped so that there
is   an elongoated generally rectangularly                    shaped notch 174       in
the panel         Notches 174 extend longitudinally along                      the
distal     shell 162.       Each notch 174          starts     at a location a
slight     distance forward of           'the   adjacent      recessed
su 1rfac    170 .   Notches      174   are present         for manuf-cturing
reasons and are otherwise not relevant to t'his invention.
The distal      shell 162 is        further formed so that a rectangular
bar 1'76 extends outwardly             f roru   each side panel        16       Each
bar 176 is      located below the adjacent                 notch 176.       Each bar
is   also located below a short linear extension                       of t-he
recessed surface         170 formed in          t-he side panel       168.
 [00164] A multi-section web              seen in      Figure 25 extends between
tne opposed inner surfaces               of the spaced apart           side
panels     168.    This web includes            a top panel 180 that           extends
downwardlv      from the cu-ved uper por tion of the shell                       from
which the side panels 168 extend.                     The web includes a
st     12    that extends distally              forward        r   the bot tom of
the upper panel        180.      A bottom panel           186 extends     forward
from the distal        end of step 182.             In    the depicted version or
the invention,       distal      shell     162 is     formed Lo define a
notch    174   at the location         from which the bottom -panel
extends downward.y          from step 182.           A floor nanel         187 extends
forward     from the base of the bottom panel.                     Floor panel. 187
tapers distally        and downwardly forward into a section of the
shell     -62 that defines         the t.op of nacelle           166.     Th e
proximalv       facing surfaces          of panels        180,   186 and 187 and oF
step 182 partially          define the proximal             end of the void space
internal to the -BCM          1.28.    The loner surfaces of the side

panels  168,   the distally     facing surfaces of panels        180,  186
and 187 and the adjacent        surface of step 182 define a
cavity 190 within the distal          shell 162.    Cavity 190 extends
proximally   from the forward edges of the shell side
panels  168.    Notch 184 is     located within cavity 190.
[00165]     Distal shell 162 is        further   formed so that below
side panels 168     that are opposed recessed surfaces           194 and
196 in  the side portions of the shell,           one surface    194 and
196 each seen in     Figure 23.       Each recessed surface      194 has a
longitudinal     axis that is    approximately parallel      with the
longitudinal     axis through the shell 162.         Each recessed
surface   194 is   further formed so that the proximal portion
of the surface has a larger top-to-bottom width that the
forward located distal        portion.     The recessed surfaces      196
are inwardly recessed relative           to the companion recessed
surfaces   194.    Each recessed      surface 196 has a circular
portion,   not identified,      that extends inwardly      from
associated recessed surface 194 at the distal            end of the
recessed surface     194.     Each recessed surface 196 has a
linear extension,      not identified,      that extends   forward from
the circular portion.         A through opening 198 extends
inwardly from the proximal         end of each recessed surface        194.
Each opening 198 is        generally in    the shape of an oval that
has a curved longitudinal        axis.     A boss 202 extends
outwardly from the center of the circular portion of each
recessed surface     198.     Not identified    are the radially
spaced apart ribs that project outwardly from the exposed
face of each boss 202.         A bore 203 extends through boss
[00166]     Internal     to and integral with distal       shell 162 is
a disc 206 seen best in        Figures 24-26.      Disc 206 extends
upwardly from the inner surfaces of the shell at the bottom
of the shell.      Disc 206 is     formed   so as to have ribs that
extend rearwardly      from the proximally directed        face of the
                                      36

web.      There are two circular         ribs,      ribs 207 and 209.
Ribs 207 and 209 are concentric                and centered on the center
axis of disc 206.            There are six radial ribs,             ribs 208.
Each rib 20P extends between             the outer surface of rib 207
and the inner surface of rib 209.                   Each rib 2C8s
diamtrically            opposed to a second rib 208          relative      to the
center of disc 202.
 [00167]          Disc 206 is   also formed to have a number of
thoug         boles 210 that extend proximally             to distally        through
te    dis c .      Each through hoie 2 1 0 is        located In       an arcuat e
sec tion of the disc between           ris       207 and 209 and          between two
adj ascent ribs 208.          The disc 206       is  also shaped to have a
ring 11       ,   identified in   Fioure      25,   that extends proximally
rearward from the proximal            f-ce of the disc.             Ring 211
extends circumferentially            around the disc         so as to be spaced
a slight         distance inward of the outer perimeter of the disc.
Distal shell 162 is           fu L e   formed so that ring 211               extends
proximal l         r ea rwar  beyond ribs 207 and 209.              A tab 213
proj ects proximallv rearward             from a section of the ring 211
 [00168]          A web 212 extends    forward from the outer perimeter
of disc 206 that is           spaced inwardly of side panels of the
shell     1 6 2.     Web 212 is  arcuate in        cross sectional        shape in
the plane perpendicula-r- to longitudinal                 axis through the
shell.        The web extends     to where the outer structural
components of the shell form nacelle                  166.       Te    d istally
directed fac o f disc 206,            the inner face of web 212 and the
inner surfaces of the ou-.ter structural panels of the
nacelle       166 define a bore '214.          Bore   214 is     open at. the
front of nacelle           166 and extends through narelle               into the
main portion of the shell.             ]Disc     206 and web 212 separate
bore 214 from the main void space internal to the :BCM 128.
Distal shell 162 is           further formed so that ribs 216 project
inwardlv into bore 214 from the inner surfaces of the shell
                                          3 'i

structural panels and of web 212.             openings   198 and bores
204 extend into bore 214.         Disc through holes       210 also open
into bore 214.
 [00169]     The distal     shell 162 is     further formed so that the
portion of the shell that defines the distal              section of
bore 214 defines a groove 216 that extends outwardly from
the outer perimeter of the bore.             Groove 216 extends
outwardly from the upper portion of the bore.                Nacelle 166
is    further formed so that four raised ribs 215,            only three
seen extend inwardly from the surfaces            of the nacelle    that
define bore 214.         The nacelle is     further formed so that a
single rib 217 seen in        cross section in     Figure 25 extends
downwardly     into bore 214 .    Rib 217 extends forward a short
distance,    typically less than 3 cm from the proximal            end of
bore 214.
 [00170]     Two ribs 220,     identified in     Figure   25,  extend
inwardly from the opposed inner surfaces of the sides of the
distal    shell.    The ribs 220 are positioned so that w,&hen
shells    132 and 162 are fitted       together,   each rib 220 is
aligned with a separate one of the proximal              shell ribs 158.
             T
 [00171]       he distal    shell 162 is     further formed so that
there are two posts 224 and 230 are located inside the void
within the shell.         Posts 224 and 230 have proximal ends that
are located forward of where ribs 220 merge into sides of
the main body of the distal        shell 162.      Post 224 is    circular
in    cross section and has a generally circular closed end
bore 226 that extends distally           forward from the proximal
face of the post.         Post 230 is    rectangular   in  cross section.
The post 230 is       formed with a closed end bore 232 that is
rectangular     in  cross section and that extends         inwardly from
the proximal face of the post.            In  the cross   section plane
perpendicular      to the longitudinal       axis along post 230,     the
                                      38

major axes of both post 230 and bore 232 are both located                          on
lines that extend      side-to-side          across the distal          shell  162.
 [00172]    From Figures 19 and 21 it.                can be seen that
internal   to the BCM housing is             a chassis 242.          Mounted to
classes 242 are the cells             38     Also mounted to the
chassis   242 is   a circuit        board 244.          Circuit board 244
contains   the t-ool unit controller              530 that selecti       vely
applies energization         signals      from the cells         38 to the tool
unit power generating unit 950.                 Sensors     566 and 594 are
also mounted to the chassis              242.     Sensor    566 is    the sensor
that monitors     the actuation of switch 440.                   Sensors 594
monitor an operating         state     characteristic        of the tool unit
power generating     unit 950.           The signals output by the
sensors   566 and 594 are applied to tool unit controller                        530.
Based on the states of these signals,                    tool unit
controller   530 selectively sources energization signals,
energization     currents,       to the tool unit 950.
 [00173]    As seen in       Figures 27        and 28,     the chassis 242
include an upper     frame 246 and a lower frame 296.                     Frames
246 and 296 are formed from the same materials                       from which
shells   132 and 162 are formed.               The upper      frame 246,     now
described by reference           Lo Figures 29 and 30 has a proximal
end beam 247.     An approximately U-shaped toe 248 extends
proximally   from the proi           L    v directed face of beam 245.               A
flexible snap tab 250 e tends downwardly                    from tOe 248.        Two
side beams   252 extend distally             forward from proximal           end
beam 247.    Al ong approximately            four-fifths       the length of
frame 244,   the side beams 252 are parallel.                     At  a location
approximately     four   fifths       the length of the frame 246
forward of oroximal beam 245,               the side beams        252 taper
slightly   inwardly toward each other.                   The most distal
portions   of the side beams,            approximately       the most distal
0.5 cm of the beams 252            are parallel,
                                           39'

 [00174]     A bar 256 extends downwardly from the undersurface
of each beam 252.       Each bar 256 is          generally elongated     in
shape.     The bars 256 extend downwardly from the parallel
portions    of the side beams       252.      The upper frame 246 is
further    formed so that each bar 256 does not extend over the
whole of    the undersurface       of the beam 252 with which the bar
is    integral.    Instead,     upper frame 244 is        formed so that
each bar 256 is      stepped slightly         outward of the associated
side beam 252.       Upper frame       244 is    further formed so a snap
tab 258 extends downwardly from each bar 256.                  Each bar 256
is    further formed with an elongated notch              259 that extends
inwardly from the downwardly directed               surface of the bar.
Notches 259 are located proximal              to snap tabs 258.
 [00175]      Two addition bars,        bars 260 also extend downwardly
from side beams 252.          Bars 260 are spaced distally          forward
of and are smaller in         length then bars 256.          The upper
frame    244 is  formed so that each bar 260 projects downwardly
from and is     stepped outwardly the inwardly tapered portion
of the side beam 252 with which the bar is                 integral.    Each
bar 260 also extends a short distance,               approximately    0.3 cm,
along the adjacent       distal    portion of the side beam 252.            A
snap tab 262 projects         downwardly      from each bar 260.
 [00176]      The upper frame 246 is          further formed to have a
number of pins 264.         Two pins 264 extend downwardly below
toe 248.      Two pins 264 extend below each bar 256.               The
pins 264 integral with each bar 256 are located on the
opposed sides of the snap tab 258 integral with the bar 256.
Two pins 264 also extend downwardly from the below described.
web 284.
 [00177]      Five webs 268,      274,    276,   284 and 288 extend across
the frame side beams 252.           Each web has first        and second
side surfaces,      (not identified) .         The first    side surface
rises    up from the side of the beam 252.               The second side
                                         40

surface,      as the surface extends upwardly from the beam 282
tapers inwardly.         Web 268 is    the proximalmost of the webs.
The top of web 268 has two inwardly curved faces                  (not
identified)        that extend across       the upper frame 246.       The
more distal        of the two curved faces         is  recessed inwardly
relative      to the proximal      face.     Thus the faces define a
notch 270 in        the web 263.     Web 268 is       further formed to
define two slots        272.   one identified that extends         inwardly
from the top of the web.            The slot     272 separates    the two
curved top faces of the web.
 [00178]       Webs 274 and 276 are essentially            identical   in
shape.    The webs 274 and 276 extend between the main parallel
sections      of side beams 252.      Each web 274 and 276 has an
inwardly curved top face           (not identified.)        Each web 274 and
276 is    formed to have an opening 278 in              the inwardly tapered
side surfaces        of the web.     Web 284 extends between the
distal    parallel     portions of side beams 252.            The web 284 is
formed to define a notch 286 that extends                 forward from the
proximally directed          face of the web.         The notch-defining
face top face of web 268,           the top faces of webs 274 and 278
and the notch defining top face of web 284 have a common
radius of curvature that is           centered around a common axis.
 [00179]       Web 288 is     the most distal        of the webs formed on
the upper frame 246.           Web 288 extends between the side
beams    252 immediately behind the distal              ends of the beams.
The upper frame        246 is   formed so that web 288 is         generally
arcuate     in   shape.   A fixed rectangularly          shaped crown 290
extends upwardly from the top of web 288.                  Crown 290 is
shaped to have a center notch 292.
 [00180]       The chassis lower frame 296 is            now described    by
reference      to Figures 31 and      32.     The lower frame 296
includes      a proximal end beam 298.           A toe 302 projects
rearwardly       from the proximal end beam 298.            In  shape,
                                         41

toe 302 is      generally identical        to that of upper frame
toe 248.       Toe 302 is    formed with a notch 304 shaped to
receive the upper frame tab 250 .             The upper frame toe 302 is
further      formed to have two through holes 306          (one
identified).        Holes 306 are positioned and dimensioned to
receive the pins 264 that project downwardly              from the upper
frame toe 302.
 [00181]       Two side beams     308 extend forward from the lower
frame proximal beam 298.           Chassis lower frame 298 is            shaped
so that when the chassis is           assembled together      the lower
frame side beams         308 substantially     underlie the upper frame
side beams      252.    Two pairs of bars,      bars 310 and bars 312,
extend upwardly        from the top surfaces of side beams             308.
Frames 246 and 296 are shaped so that when the frames are
assembled together,         each lower frame bar 310 is        in
registration       with the overlying upper       frame bar 256.           Each
bar     310 is  formed with a notch 311 and two through
holes 309.       The notch 311 is      shaped to receive the snap
tab 258 of the complementary bar 256.              Each hole 309 is
dimensioned to receive one of the pins 264 that extends
downwardly      from the complementary bar 256.          A tab 314
protrudes upwardly from the exposed face of each bar 310.
When the chassis 242 is          assembled,    each tab 314 seats in           the
complementary       notch 259 in     the complementary bar 256.
 [00182]       Each bar 312 is     positioned to be in      registration
with a complementary one of the upper             frame bars 260.          A
notch 315 is       formed in    each bar 312.     Notches 314 are shaped.
and positioned to receive the snap tab 262 in tegral with the
overlying upper frame bar 260.
 [00183]       The lower frame side beams        308 are formed with
inwardly directed protrusions            316.   Each protrusion 316          is
located adjacent        the forward end of the bar 312          integral
with th.e beam 308 in        which the protrusion     is  formed.         Each
                                        42

protrusion     316 is     formed with a through hole 31.              When
chassis 242     is   assembled,     the Pins 264 that project         down
from the overlying web 284.
 [00184]      Five webs 320,       324,   326,   328 and 332 extend across
   ie  downwardly directed        faces of side beams 308.          Web 320
has feat ures that ca I b           o   idered     svmretric to those of
,upper frame web 268.          Accord inly     t hese features are not
redescribed.       It  is   not ed t h at web 320 is      located proximal
to web 268.       Webs 324 and 326 have features             symmetric to
those of webs 274 and 276.             Webs 324 and 326 are located
proximal     to webs 274 and 276.           Web 328 has a shape similar
to that of lower frame web 284.               The web 328 is     formed with
two    slots  330 that project        upwardly     from  the downwardly
directed face of the web.             The frames 246 and 296 are
collectively      shaped so that lower frame web 324 is              located
proximal     to the upper frame web 284.
 [00185]      Frames 246 and 296 are further             shaped so that the
lower frame web 332 is          located a short distance forward of
upper frame web 288.           Wleb 332 is    generally arcuate in       shape
in    that downwardly directed surface of the web has an
upwardly     curved surface.        Lower frame 296       is  further   formed
so that web 332 has three spaced apart notches                  334,  two
notches identified.           Web 332 us formed so that notches            334
are arranged in       an arc.      More particularly        the arc around
which the notches are formed is              centered on the longitudinal
axis through distal          shell bore 214.         Each notch 334   has a
longitudinal      axis,    an axis parallel        to the longitudinal. axis
throg      bore 214.       Web 332 is     shaped so the longitudinal
axes of each two adjacent notches              334 are spaced 600      apart
From each based on          point along the longitudinal axis
throg      bore 214 being the vertex           from which the radial.
lines to each notch longitudinal              extends.
                                         43

 [00186]      Two posts 336 extend distal             forward from the
opposed  sides of the distally           directed face of web 332.            A
pin 338,   one identified      in   Figure 28.        extends    forward from
each post 336.
 [00187]     As part of the process of manufacturing the
BCM 128,   circuit     board 244 with the components mounted
thereto,   is    sandwiched between the upper frame 246 and the
lower frame 296.        When the frames 246 and 296 are brought
together,     the upper frame bars 256 and 260 abut the lower
frame bars 310 and 312.          This defines a space between the
beams of   the frames 246 and 296 in              which the perimeter
portion of the circuit        board is      fit.      Upper frame pins 264
seat in  the lower frame holes 306.                The lower     frame tabs 314
seat in  the upper frame notches            259.      The seating of these
components     in  these void spaces facilitates            proper alignment
of the frames 246 and 296.           This     components seating also
prevents post assembly shifting of the frames.                      The
frames 246 and 296 are held together by the snap fitting                      of
the upper frame snap tabs 250,             258 and 262 in       the lower
frame notches      304,  311 and 315,       respectively.
 [00188]     Once the circuit      board 244 and frames 246 and 296
are assembled together,        rechargeable          cells 38 are mounted to
the chassis.       One cell   38 is   seated on upper frame webs 268,
274,  276 and 284.       The proximal       end of the cell         is  seated in
the notch 270 defined by web 268.                 Thus the step that
defines the proximal end of the notch blocks proximal.
longitudinal movement       of the cell          38.   The distal      end of the
cell  38 is    seated in   the notch 286 defined by web 284 .                The
seating of cell      38 in  notch 286 blocks distal              longitudinal
movement   of the shell.       Tie strips         342 that extend around
the cell 38 and through openings              278 in    webs 274 and 276
hold the cell      to the chassis.         The second cell 38 is
                                       4-4

similarly held in position against the downwardly directed
s-urfaces of lower frame webs 320,     324,  326 and 328.
[00189]    A contact plate 344    is  mounted to the proximal       end
of each cell.   Tabs, not illustrated,      integral with the
cont act plates 344 seat in   the slots integral with webs 268
and 320 .  A contact plate 348 isrmounted to the distal end
of each cell 38.   Tabs,  not   illustrated, integral with
cont act plates 348 seat in   the slots integral with slots 330
of web 328.   Contact plates 344 and 348,      along with wires
not shown,  provide the conductive paths from the terminals
of the cell to below discussed tool unit controller 530 on
circuit board 244.
[00190]    When the battery and control module 128 is
assembled the distal portion of the chassis 24         i    slid
between ribs 220 internal to the distal shell 1 6             The
components  forming BCM 128 are shaped so thatL t he chassis is
compressed between the ribs 220.       Chassis  242 is   slide
forward so that the left side chassis pin 338 seats bore 226
internal to shell post 224.      Simultaneously the right side
chassis pin 338 seats in   bore 232 internal to shell
post 230.   More particularly the ribs 225 that extend into
bore 226 hold the associated pin 338 in       a specific position
within the bore 226.    Owing to tihe rectangular cross
sectional shape of bore 232 and the relative dimension of
post 230 and pin 338,   the position of the pin within
bore 232 is  fixed only in the vertical axis.       The position
of pin in  the horizontal plane,     the plane in  and out of
Figure 18,  has some minor degree of variation.        Thus,    the
components forming BCM 128 allow for some manufacturing
tolerances while ensuring that the vertical position of the
chassis 242 and components attached to the chassis have
essentially fixed vertiLca]   position within the void space oF
the BCM housing.

 [00191]       When the proximal       shell  132 is   fitted      over the
open end of the distal           shell 162,   the proximal       side portions
of the cTssis         242 is   slIg  htly compressed between the
proximal      shel    ribs 153.      The proximal    end of the
cnassis     242 Is    compressed between ribs 156.            Ribs    156, 153,
220 and pins 338 thus collectively             hold the cnassis 242 in            a
fixed position in        the void soace within battery and cont-rol
module    128.
 [00192]       Contact pins 350 provide the electrical
connections pin the battery and control module e 128 and t'he
components to which the module is             connected.       From Figure 34
it  can be seen that a contact pin 350 is              a sn    gle piece
unit.    The pin 350 is        formed from an electricall             conduct ive
material      such as brass .       At the proximal end,       the pin is
shaped to have a cylindrical            trunk 351.     Whe C he trunk is
generally cylindrical,           the pin is   formed to define an
annular groove 352 that extends             circumferentialy around the
trunk 351.       Groove 352 is       located at position approximately
midway along       the length of the trunk 351.            Contact pin 350
is  further     shaped to have a stopper that is             located forward
of the trunk 351 and that extends circumferentially                     around
the truo.        T'he  stopper has a proximal        section     353 of
constant diameter.          Stopoer proximal      section 353 has a
diameter greater than that of trunk 351.                 A stoper       distal
section     354 extends      forward from the proximal         section 353.
The distal.     section is     frusto-conical     in  shape.       The diameter
of the distal       section 354      decreases the further the distal
section     is  away from the proximal        section    353.      In  the
depicted version of the invention,             the most proximal portion
of the distal       section has a diameter that          is   approximately
0.5 mm less than the diameter of the proximal                  section 353
 [00193]       Stopper distal       section 354 merges into a
cylindrically       shaped. pin head 355.       In   the illustrated
                                         46

version of the invention,                pin head 355 has a diameter
greater than that of trunk 351 and less than that of stopper
proximal        section    353.     The most distal        end of pin head is
semi- spherical         in   shape.
 [00194]         Each pin 350 is         seated in     a separate one of the
through holes 210 formed in                distal     shell disc 206 as seen in
Figure 33.            More particularly,           the pin head 355 extends
through the disc 206.               in   many versions      of the invention    the
components         forming BCM 128 are designed so that at room
temperature          (22 C),   the pin head 355 has an outer diameter
that is        approximately      -0.2    to 0.3 mm less than the diameter
of the associated through hole 210.                     The abutment of    stopper
distal        section 354 against the proximally directed                face of
disc 206 limits the forward longitudinal movement of the
pin     350 through the disc.
 [00195]         A seal 360 and a cap 370,             seen in  Figures 19 and
33,     cooperate      to form barriers           to the ambient environment
between the BCM housing and pins 350.                      The seal  350,  now
described by reference              to Figure 36,       is  formed from an
elastomeric material able to withstand the rigors of the
sterilization          processes to which the BCM 128 is            exposed.     In
some versions of the invention seal 360 is                     formed from EPDM
rubber.         Seal 360 is      generally shaped as a washer.            There is
a center located through hole 362.                     The body of the seal is
further        shaped to have a number of pin holes 364,               two holes
identified.           Pin holes 364 are parallel            to through
holes 362.          The number      of pin holes equal the number of
contact pins 350 integral with the BCM 128.                      The pin holes
364 have a diameter that is                0.2 to 0.3 mm greater than the
diameter of the pin trunks 351.
 [00196]         Seal 360 is      further formed to have circularly
shaped ribs 365 that project                 forward from the distally
directed face of the seal.                 Each rib 365 extends       forward
                                              4-7

from and around a separate             one of the pin holes 364.          In
cross section,       each rib 365 has a convex shape.
 [00197]        The cap 370,      as best seen in     Figure 37 is
generally disc shaped.             The distally   directed      face of
cap 370 is       planar.     A through hole 372 extends through the
center of the cap 362.             Cap 360 includes a ring 374,
partially       seen in    Figure 37,    that extends     forward from the
distally       directed face of the cap.         Ring 374 has an inner
diameter that facilitates             a contact fit    against the outer
perimeter of ring 211 integral with distal                 shell disc 206.
The outer perimeter of the ring 374 is                spaced inwardly from
the outer perimeter of the main body of the- cap 370.
 [00198]        Cap 370 is    also formed to have a number of
arcuately spaced apart tabs 376 that extend outwardly from
the main circularly shaped body of the cap).                  Tabs  376 are
spaced apart from each other so as to define a notch 378
between the tabs.           A number of through holes 380,          two holes
identified,       extend proximally to distally           through the
cap 370.        Through holes 380 are positioned so that,              when the
SCM 18 is       assembled each cap through hole           380 will be in
registration       with a separate one of the seal pin holes                364.
Each through hole 380 is             formed with a counterbore        (not
identified) .
 [00199]        The cap 370 is       further formed so a circular
rib 382 extends outwardly from the proximally directed                      face
of the main body of the cap.               Rib 382 is   located around
                                                        3
nole 372.        Additional      linear shaped ribs       84' project
radially outwardly from the outer perimeter of rib 384.                       The
cap 370      is  also formed to have a number          of indentations       386.
Each indentation          386 is    concave in  shape.     Each
indentation 386        is   associated with a separate one of the
through holes 380.           A small groove,     present     for
                                          48

manufacturing           reasons extends between           some of the through
hole counterbores           and the associated           indentation       386.
 [00200]       When the battery and control module                   128 is
assembled, a          contact pin       350 is     seated in   each one of the
through holes internal to the distal                     shell web 206.
Seas 360 is        fitted    over the trunks 351 of the contact
pins 350    .   The seal 36C) is               stoned     so that seal ribs           365
abut the proximallv di ec Led annular                    surface of the adjacent
pin stopper proximal section(              r353.       Cap 370 is    fitted      over
toe seal 360        .    More particlrly             the cap is  pos itoned         so
that can ring 374           seats aga n st ring 211 it            er         to the
distal     shell 162.        As parL of this           process,   cap 37 0 is
oriented so that the tao               213 integral with dita                shell 162
seats    in   cap not ch 378.          This tab-in-notch        seating
temno-ra-rily holds the cap              in    the proper ori entati       on relative
to the distal           shell 162.       Can 370 is      then welded or
otherwise secured to the distal shell.
 [00201]       As a result       of the dimensioning           of the components
    sormng battery and control module 128 is                   that the cap 370
presses the seal ribs 365 against the stoppers integral with
contact       ins 36 0.      The distallv          directed face of seal 360
presses against ribs 207,                208 and 209.       Te    abutment       of the

 [00202]       Returning to Figures               19 and 33 it    can be seen that
connectors       390 provide the conductive links between the
wires t.at      extend from the tool unit                controller 53:0 and the
contact     Pins 350.        The connectors           390 are formed from
conducted material,            typically the material             from which the
contact     Pins 350 are formed.                 A single connector         390,  as
seen in     Figure 35,       includes a U-shaped foot 392.                   A bar    like
leg 394 extends distally                forward from the foot.             At the

distal    end of the leg 394,           connector       390 has a bend 396.
Extending proximally from bend 396,                 the connector       390 has a
bar shaped neck 398.               A bend 402 is     located at the proximal
end of neck 398.              A head 404 is     located at the distally
directed end of bend 402.               Head 404 is       U-shaped.     Owing to
the orientation and shape of bends 396 and 402,                     the
longitudinal       axes of connector          leg 39,     neck 398 and head are
parallel.      Also owing to the shaping of the connector,
head 404 is       understood to be located proximally rearward of
bend 396.       Further,         the material    from which the
connector    390 is         formed is   selected so that bends          396 and
402 are flexible.
 [00203]     It    is     still    a further feature of the components
forming BCM 128           that the connectors        390 have a side-to-side
width that      facilitates         the positioning of bends        396 in
indentations       386      formed in   cap 370.
 [00204]     Upon assembly of the BCM 128,                 each connector    390
is   positioned so the connector bend 306 is                  press fit    into an
indentation       386 in        the cap 370.     The head 404 of the
connector    390 is         wrapped around the proximal         section of the
trunk 351 of the connector pin with which the connector is
associated.        The wire that extends from the tool unit
controller      530 component to which the connector                is   to be
attached is       secured in        the foot 392 of the connector          390.
Solder is    typically employed to ensure the wire remains
attached to the connector              foot 392- and the connector
head 404 stays attached to the associated. connector pin                        350.
 [00205]     A further feature of this               invention   is    that when
the connectors          390 are connected to the contact pins 350 and.
seated in    shell 370,           the feet 392 and legs 394 of are
arranged in       a circle.          This circle     is   of sufficient
diameter so the distal              end of the cell 38 mounted to the
chassis    lower frame 296 can be seated within the circle.

 [00206]   A latch assembly 410,       now generally described with
respect to Figure 38,    cooperates with complementary features
integral with tool unit 124 to releasably hold the tool unit
in  BCM bore 214.    While not illustrated,     it should be
understood that in    many versions of the invention there are
two latch assemblies 410.     One latch assembly 410 is
attached to each side of the BCM distal shell 162.          Each
latch assembly 410 engages in      a complementary notch 856
 (Figure 56)  with the tool unit 124.       The latch
assemblies   410 must be simultaneously      actuated to remove the
tool unit 124 from the BCM 128
 [00207]   Each latch assembly 410 includes a release
lever 412 seen in    Figures 38 and 39.      The release lever 412
is  a generally rectangularly shaped piece of sterilizable
plastic.    The distal end of the release lever 412 is
rounded.   Release lever 412 is dimensioned to seat in and
pivot in  void space defined by the recessed surface 194 of
the side of the distal shell to which the lever is        mounted.
Proximal to the distal end of the lever 412,        the lever is
formed to have bore 414 that extends through the lever.          A
ring 416 extends inwardly from the inwardly directed face of
the lever 412.    Ring 416 is  concentric with and radially
spaced outwardly from bore 414.         The lever is formed so that
ring 416 seats between the two ribs integral with the boss
202 adjacent   the recessed surface 194.
 [00208]    Proximal  to and spaced away from ring 416,      the
lever 412 has a raised surface 418.         The lever 412 is
further  formed so a notch 420 extends inwardly from the
raised surface 418.     Notch extends along a tangent line that
extends from an outer surface of ring 416.         A pin 420
extends outwardly from raised surface 418.         Pin 420 is
located a slight distance forward of the proximal end of the
release lever 412.

[00209]    When the BCM 128 is           assembled,      the release
lever 412 is    seated against the distal            shell   recess
surface  194.     Specifically,       the lever is       positioned so that
the shell bore 204 and lever bore 414 are coaxial and
pin 420 extends       through shell opening         198.    A fitting     424
that extends through the lever bore 414 and is                  securely
attached to the surface of the distal               shell that defines
shell bore 205 hold the lever to the shell so the lever can
pivot over recessed surface 194.
[00210]    A torsion spring 426 is            disposed between the shell
162 and the release lever 412.              The circular base of the
torsion spring over the boss 202             integral with the shell.
One leg of the spring 426 is            seated in    the linear extension
of shell recessed surface 196.              The opposed leg of the
torsion spring 426 seats in           lever notch 420.         Spring 426
thus places a force on the release lever 412 that normally
positions  the lever so that the proximal end of the lever is
located below the distal         end.      Finger or thumb force is
sufficient to overcome the biasing force of spring 426 and
pivot the lever 412.
[00211]    The BCM trigger          switch 440 is      now described by
reference  to Figure 40-44.           Trigger    switch 440 includes        a
fork 442 that is       pivotally attached to the SCM housing.                 A
beam 472 holds a finger tab 488 to the fork 442.                      Beam 472
slidably holds finger tab 488 to the fork 442 so the spacing
of the tab from the fork can be selectively set.
[00212]    Fork 442 as seen          in Figures     40 through 42 is
formed from a single piece of plastic               able to withstand the
rigors of sterilization.           The fork    14412 -is  shaped to have a
base plate 444.        Plate 444 has tapered sides            (not
identified) .     Two parallel       bars 446 extend downwardly from
the undersurface       of plate 444.        The bar 446 are formed to
have four indentations         448,   two indentations       identified,
                                        52

that are generally vertically         oriented.       indentations    448
are in    cross section,   semi- crcular      in  shape.   Each
indentation 448 on one bar 446 faces a complementary
indentation on the opposed bar.           One each bar,    below the
three distalmost      indentations    a rectangular tab 450 extends
outwardly towards the opposed bar.            Fork 442 is    further
shaped so that a web 452 extends between the distal               ends of
the bars 446.       Plate 444,  bars 446 and web 452 thus
collectively     define a rectangular opening         453 into the
distal    end of the fork 442.
 [00213]     A thumb 456 extends proximally          rearward from the
proximal    end of fork base plate 444.          The fork is   formed so
that thumb 456 is      elevated relative      to the base plate 444.
Collectively the base plate        444 and thumb      456 are formed to
define a window 457 between the plate and the thumb.
Thumb 456 is     formed so as to have a boss 458 that extends
downwardly    from the undersurface       of the thumb.      The boss 458
is    formed to have a closed end bore 460.
 [00214]     Two tines 464 also extend proximally away from
fork base plate 444.       The fork 442 is       formed so that as each
tine extends proximally away from the base plate 444,               the
tine tapers a small distance away          from the proximal -to
distal    longitudinal   axis through the base plate.          The
components    forming the BCM 128 are shaped so that each tine
464 seats against a distal       shell    side panel 168.      Each
tine 464 is     formed to have a ledge 466,         one ledge
identified,     that projects inwardly from the inner surface of
the tine.     Ledges 466 thus extend inwardly toward each
other.     The ledges 466 extend distally         forward  from
locations    forward of the proximal ends of the tines 464.
Each tine 464     and associated ledge 466 is         shaped to define a
groove 467     (one shown in   phantom)    that extends upwardly from
the undersurface      of the ledge.      Proximal to the ledge      -166,
                                     53

and forward of the proximal end of the tine 464,                 a bore 468
extends     side-to-side through the tine.            Each bore 468 is
formed with a counterbore          (not identified)      that is open at
the outer face of the tine.
 [00215]      Beam 472,    seen in   Figures 41,      43 and 44, is   formed
from a metal plate that is          bent to provide the beam with a
shape in     cross section that is         generally that of a
rectangle.      More specifically,         the beam is   shaped to
slidably fit in the rectangular opening 453 in the front of
fork 442.      The opposed sides of the beam are shaped to form
in    each  side a leg 474 that extends proximally            from the
section of the beam from which the leg extends                 Each leg 474
has a foot 476.        Each foot 476 is        semicircular  in   shape and
is    further shaped to extend outwardly           from the side of the
beam with which the foot is          associated.       Beam feet   476 are
dimensioned to seat in        the indentations        448 formed in
fork 442.
 [00216]      Markings    are formed on the top facing surface of
beam 472.      A first    marking a "I" marking 478 is         located
immediately forward of the proximal end of the beam.
Immediately proximal to marking 478 is              a "0" marking 480      A
second "I"     marking,    marking 482 is       located approximately    1
cm of marking 480.         Beam 472 is      further   formed to have
tab 484 that extends downwardly             from the undersurface     of the
beam.      Tab 484 is   ramp shaped in        that as the tab extends
distally     forward   from the portion of the beam from which the
tab extends the tab extends diagonally downwardly.                  Tab 484,
which is     flexible,    extends below web 452 when the beam is
initially     inserted in    fork opening -53.         The tab 484 thus
prevents     the beam and attached finger          488 from being removed
from the fork 442.
 [00217]      Finger tab 488 is      disposed over the distal        end of
beam 472.      Trigger    switch 440 also includes        a magnet 490.
                                       54d

Magnet    490 is   seated in   the closed end bore 460 internal to
thumb 456.
 [00218]      Fasteners   494,   seen in     Figure 41,  seated in     tine
bores 468 hold the trigger switch 440 to the BCM so the
switch is     able to pivot.      One end of each fastener 494.              A
torsion spring 496,       also seen in       Figure 41,  is  disposed
around each boss 172 integral with the distal shell 162.
One leg of each spring 496 is             seated in  the linear extension
of the recessed surface 170 of the shell.               By extension,
this    spring leg seats on the bar 178 immediately below the
recessed surface      170.    The opposed leg of each torsion
spring 496 seats in       the groove 467 formed in         the adjacent
tine 464 of fork 442.         The torsion springs 496 thus impose a
force on the other components of the trigger assembly that
normally holds the finger tab so that the tab is                spaced
above the distal      end of the BCM.         Finger force is     sufficient
to overcome the force imposed by springs 496.
              C.    BCM TOOL LUNI'     CONTROLLER
A basic understanding       of tool unit controller         530 internal
to battery and control module 128 is             obtained by reference
to Figure 45.       Controller 530 includes a tool unit driver
circuit     (T.U.  DRIVER)   620.     Driver circuit    620 contains       the
components that source and sink the energization                signals
supplied from the cells        38,    the BAT+   and BAT-   signals,     over
the correct :BCM pins 350.           A tool unit drive controller           770
selectively enables and sets the components that comprise
driver circuit      620 to cause the outputting of the
appropriate energization         signals by the driver.         In  Figure
45 only single line connections             are connected by the tool
unit drive controller 770 and the circuits              to which the
controller      is connected.     it    is  understood that this     is     for

ease of illustration only.          In actuality, there are plural
lines between controller 770 and the associated circuits.
 [00219]    Tool unit drive controller 770 sets the states or
the driver components based on a number of input signals.
One set of input signals comes from the trigger sensor
circuit   (TRG SNRS)    560 .    Trigger sensor circuit 5C0 includes
the below discussed sensor 566 internal to the void space
internal to the BCM housing that generates sias                as a
function of the actuation of the trigger switch 440               A
second set of input signal          apied     to the tool unit
controller are generated by a tool unit sensor circuit              (T.U.
SNSRS)   590.    The tool unL Cir u          590 includes the sensors
594 intern-al to the BCM that output signals representative
of the operating state or condition of the cower generating
unit int ernal to the tool unit.           A third set of input
signals upon which the tool unit regulates the sourcing of
energization signals comes from a current            sense (ISNS)
circuit 670.       Current sense circuit 670 monitors the current
drawn bv the tool unit power generating unit as well as the
voltage across the power generating unit 950.              Current sense
circuit also monitors the current sourced by cells 38.
 [00220]    A wake up circuit 702 is         also connected to both
pins 350 and the tool unit drive controlle             770.   Wake up
circuit 702 monitors whether or not a load is            present or a
signal is   aplied     or a across the pins 350 when the BCM 128
is  not connected to a charger or a rool unit.             When the wake
up circuit 702 makes such a detection,           the wake circuit
asserts signals to the tool unit drive controller 770 so as
tc inform the controller that the BCM is           either being
charged or a tool unit 124 has been attached.
 [00221]    Driver controller       770 also includes a
communication       (COMM)  circuit    730.   CoCmmunicatins   circuit
 730 selectively applies power to,          reads data from and writes
                                      56

data to a memory 910                (Figure 60)     internal to the tool
unit 124.          Drive controller         770 also actuates indicators            750
integral         with  the   battery      and control      module     (BCM INDCTRS).
These indicators            750 provide an individual using power
surgical         tool assembly 120 information regarding                  the
operating state of the assembly.
 [00222]          Voltages     for both energizing the components of the
tooL      unit controller 530 and for reference purposes are
supplied by a power supply circuit                     (PWR SPLY)      532 also
connected to the drive controller                     770.    As seen in     Figure
46,     power supply        532 includes a 3.3 Volt power supply 534.
The input into power supply 532 is                     the BAT+     signals from the
cells       38.    in  one version of the invention an LT3970HMS
step-down voltage regulator available                      from Linear Technology
of Milpitas,          California       is  used as power       supply 532.      This
power supply draws a low quiescent current,                         typically 10
micro Amps or less and,                more preferably,        5 micro Amps or
less.        Not depicted are the resistors                and capacitors tied       to
power supply 532 to ensure                 the proper output of the 3.3 Volt
signal.
 [00223]          The 3.3 Volt signal output by power                  supply is
output over an inductor 536.                    This signal     is   always
available as a 3.3 Voltage                 hibernate signal         (3.3 VHIB)
signal.          This 3.3 VHIE signal is            applied to a pin integral
the drive controller 770 that receives a hibernation voltage
that is        applied to the controller.
 [00224]          The signal from inductor 536 is               also applied to
the source of a p-channel MOSFE'T 538.                      A resistor      540 is
tied between the source and gate of MOSFET 538.                           The signal.
present        at the drain of MOSFET 538 is               available as 3.3 V
digital         signal.     This signal      is    output on a bus,       not
illustrated          that is     applied to the other components of tool.
unit controller            530 that require a 3.3 V digital               signal..
                                              5:,7

The signal present at the drain of MOSFET 538 is                                 also
applied to an inductor                          The signal at the end of
inductor 542 spaced from MOSFET 538 is                           applied through a
capacitor        54 4 to an anal og ground.                   A capaciLor      544 is        tied
between      the end of inductor               542 spaced from supoy                 534 and
ground.         The signal present             at the junction of inductor 542
and capac ior          544    is   available         is    the 3.3 VA anal]ogue            3.3
Volt     sigl          This signal is           output on a bus          (not
illustrate)          to 'the      other components of the tool
controller        530 that require a 3 .3                  Volt analog     signal.
 [00225]         The MOSFET 533 thus controls the outputting of the
3.3 Volt digital             signal and the 3.              Volt analogue signal by
power supply         532.        The MOSFET 538 is             normally turned off               so
as to prevent          the outputting of these two                        -ignal .    A 3.3
Volt Wake        (3.3VWAKI)         signal is           applied to the g.ate of
MOSFET      538 to     turn      on the MOSFET.             The 3.3   Volt Wake          signal,
which is        asserted low,        is    selectively          output by the driver
controller        770 as described below.
 [00226]         Power supply 532 also includes                     a 5 Volt power
supply 548 which also receives                       t-he BAT+ vol-tage.           In    one
version of the invention the LTC3245 DC/DC converter                                     also
available from Linear Technology                         is   employed as the 5 Volt
power      supply 548.          Not depicted are the resistors                     and
capacitors tied to power                 supply 548 to ens-ure the proper
outputting of the             5 Volt signal.               The 5 Volt    signal output
by power suoply 548 is               output as a 5 Volt digital                     (5V)
signal over a bus,              not  illustrated.              Thi s 5 Volt digital
signal is        thus available to the other componen.s                          of the tool
controlle-.r      538 that require this                  signal.    The output signal

The end of.          d            550 spaced from power supplv 548 is                          tied.

applied to a bus,           not illustrated.           This 5 Volt analog
signal is        thus available       to the other components               of BCM tool
unit controller          530 that require          such a signal
 [00227]         The on/off state         of the 5 Volt power           supply 548 is
controlled bv a 5 Volt enable                  ( 5V ENB)   signal.        T h is  5 Volt

Normally,        when the BCM is        neither con nected         Lo a tool unit
nor to a charger,           the 5 volt power supply 5                   s in     the off
state.        In  some versions of the invention,                t.he 5 Volt enable
signal is        asserted as a high          signal.
 [00228]         Trigger sensor circuit            560 is   now described by
reference        to Figure 47.        The trigger       sensor circuit           includes
at least one sensor,            sensor 566 in         Figure 47.        This
particular        sensor 566 generates            a signal as a function of
the displacement           of trigger      switch 440.        Sensor 566 is         thus
able to monitor the intensity of the magnetic                         field      emitted
by magnet        490.    In   one version of the invention,                 sensor 566
is    a Hail     sensor that outputs an analog              signal as a function
of sensed field          strength.        One such sensor is          the A1319
sensor available from A legro                 Micro Systems if          W1orchester,
Massachusets.            As seen in       Figure 29,      sensor 566 is          seated
in    notch 292 formed in         web 288 integral with the chassis
upper      frame 246.
 [00229]         From Figure 47       it   can be seen that the 3.3 Volt
analo        signalas      applied to the Vcc pin of sensor 566.                     This
signal is        ap-plied through a p-channe-              OSFET 562.           A
resi store       64 is   tied. between       the source and dran              or
MOSFET 462.        The ground. pin of sensor 566              is   tied to analog
ground.         The Vo.    signal   from sensor 566 is           applied to an
amplifier wih a low pass filter                    568.    The output signal
from amp l         ir   568 is   an analoc        trigger    (ANA---TRG)      signal.
This signal        is   applied    to the drive controller              770.

 [00230]       The on/off state        of sensor 566 is         controlled bv
MOSFET 566.          Specifically    a t rigger sensor enable             (TRIG ENB)
signal is      applied to the gate of MOSFET 562 in                 order to turn
on the MOSFET.          Normally,    MOSFET 562 is       in  the off state.
The TRG ENB signal,           whicn is   asserted low,       is   selectively
asserted by the drive controller               770
 [00231]       A second trigger sensor,          sensor 5H0       i    seen as
part of the trigger sensor circuit               560 of- Figure 47.            This
second sensor 580 may not be physically within the above
described battery and control module                 128.    However,       this
sensor     580 is     present in    the below described battery and
control module accordii ngly the presence                of this     sensor and
related comoonents          is  now described.        Sensor     580 is     capable
of monitoring the orientation of magnetic                   fields that may
surround     the sensor.        It  should d be understood t-hat
sensor     580 is     contained within the BCM housing in                which it
is    disposed at a location         in  which it     will vary its         output
signal as a function of the orientation                  of the sensed
magnetic     fields.      In   one version of      the invention sensor 580
is    a Hall   effeIct   sensor that out-puts a PWM spinal t-hat
varies as a function of field              st-rength and orientation.
 [00232]       IT'he  5 Volt analog signal is         applied to the Vee pin
of sensor 580.          The ground pin of       sensor 580 is        tied    to
analog ground.          A pull up resistor       582 is     applied between
toe     3 Volt analog bus and the output pin of sensor                     580 .   The
signal present at the           junction     of sensor     580 and
resistor     582 is     applied to the drive controller as a pulse
width modulated trigger            (PWMVTRG)    signal.
 [00233]       In    the described version of the invention,                 the
tool unit power generating unit is               a brushless DC motor.
The tool unit sensor c'ircuit            590,   now described by reference
to Figure 48,         generates a signal or set of signals that
indicate     the rotation orientation of the motor rotor                      . In
                                          60

the deJcted          version of the invention,              these signals are
provided by three sensors 594.                    In   some versions of this
erbo diment       of the invention         sensor 594 are identical to
sensor 566 of trigger              sensors circuit         560 .    From Figure 28
it    can he seen that each sensor 566 is                   seated     In a      separate
one of the notches            334 formed in         the web 332 integral with
   he c hassis lower frame 296.
 [00234]        In   Figure 48,       the three       sensors 594 are separately
labeled as S,          S4 and S5.        The 3.3 Vo lt       aInaog sigal            is
applied to th          V     pn     of each     sensor 594 through a single p
channel MOSFET 592.             A resistor        593 is    tied between          the
source and gate of MOSFET 592.                    The o1/off state           of
MOSFET 59         is  controlled by a MTR SNS                    signijal,      which is
asserted low,         that is      output by drive controller                770.      The
ground pin of each sensor 594 is                    tied to the analog ground
plane.       'The output signal generated by each sensor                         594 is
applied through an amplifier with a low pass filter                               598.
The outout        signals from the amplifiers               598   are the
individual        sensor signals,        signals TU SNSl,           TU SNS2       and
TUSNS3,        respectively.
 [00235]        In   the version of the invention described with
reference       to Figures 49A and 49B,              the tool unit drive
circuit      620 includes components              able to selectively
source/ S ink an energization              snal        to/from the       Plural
windings       of a brushless         DC motor.        The enerization            signal
is    the BAT+ signal         from the series connected                ells      38.    Thi s
sign      is    output through two n-channel MOSFET-,                    622 and 623
to a bus       624.    Di        circuit     620 is     arranged     so that the
source of MOFET            622 is     connected to the BA.             coract.       of the
cells    38 and the drains of the MOSFETs                   622 and 623: are
connected       together.        Bus 624     is   connected. to the source or
MOSFET    623:,      A resistor       626 is     inline with bus         624.       The
                                              61

potential present at both end of resistor                      626 is    applied to
the current sense            circuit
 [00236]         For reasons that are clear below,               it   should be
understood that the signal present at the                      junction of
MOSFETs        622 and 623 may be employed to power the 3.3 Volt
power supply 534,            (connection not shown) .
 [00237]         The BAT+     signal on bus 624        is   applied to high side
drive MOSFETs 628 of an H-bridge.                   Each MOSFET 628 is           an
n-channel MOSFET.             The sources of MOSFETs 628 are tied                 to
bus     624,    (two MOSFETs     628 identified).           The source of an
n-channel MOSFET 630 is              tied between      the drain of each
MOSFET 628 and a bus connected to the BAT-                      contact      (bus not
identified).           The junction of each pair of MOSFETs 628 and
630 is      tied to a separate one of three contact pins 350 .                       A
Schottky diode 632 is            forward biased between one of the
pins 350 and the BAT+ bus               624.
 [00238]         Drive controller         770 asserts the signals that
result      in   the turning     on and turning        off    of MOSFETs      628 and
630.      In    Figure 49B these signals are represented as driver
control        (DCNTL)     signals.      A single signal line is            shown for
ease of illustration.             It   is     understood that in       actuality
six individual driver control signals are asserted,                           one for
each MOSFET 628 and 630.               The driver control signals are
applied to a level shifter,                 (LtVL SHF)    636.   Level
shifter        636 shifts     the signal level of each driver control
signal      from 3.3 Volts to 5 Volts.              Not shown are the
connections of the level              shifter     to the 3.3 Volt and 5 Volt
digital       buses.
 [00239]         The pair of voltage-1level           shifted driver control
signals        for each pair of MOSFETs 628 and 630                 s applied to a
gate driver,         (GD)    638 for that pair of MOSFETs.              Each gate
driver 638 in          response to the state         of the drive control
signals applied to the driver selectively applies/negates                            a
                                              62

signal to the gates of the attached MOSFETs 628 and 630.
Gate drivers    638 provide shoot through protection.                 That is
each driver 638 will not simultaneously applied a voltage to
the gates of both of the MOSFETs 628 and 630 attached                   to the
driver.   The voltage each gate driver applies to the gate of
the associated high side MOSFET 628 is               boosted.      A
capacitor  640,    one identified,        tied   between   the   junction of
each pair of MOSFETs        628 and 630 and the boost pin of the
gate driver 638 supplies the charge              for this    boosted gate
voltage.
[00240]    The Vcc voltages        for the gate drivers are supplied
from the higher of        the 5 Volt signal or the BAT+            signal,
circuit  not illustrated.
[00241]    The above described MOSFETs              622 and 623 are turned
on and off to regulating the discharging of the cells                   38 and
the charging of the cells         over bus 624.        A voltage
doubler 642 applies potential to the gates of both MOSFETs
622 and 623 to selectively turn on the MOSFETs.                    The input
signal into the voltage doubler             642 is   a square wave.       While
not shown,  it   should be understood that this               square wave  is
a signal that is       output by the drive controller 770.
[00242]    The output signal         from the voltage doubler 642 is
selectively applied to ground through an n-channel
MOSFET 646.     The 3.3 Volt hibernation            signal is    applied to
the gate of MOSFET 646 through a resistor                644.    A
charge/discharge       enable   (C/DENB)       signal is   also selectively
applied to the gate of MOSFET           646 from the drive
controller  770.
[00243]    The output signal         from voltage doubler 642 is
applied through a p-channel          MOSFET 650 to the gate of one of
the MOSFETs 628.        Specifically this        voltage is     applied to
the gate of the MOSFET 628 to which diode                632 is    connected..
The signal produced by the voltage doubler 642 is                   applied to
                                       63

a p-channel MOSFET 650 .          A resistor      652 is     tied between      the
source and gate of MOSFET 650.               An n-channel MOSFET 654 is
tied between     the drain of MOSFET 650 and digital                  ground.
 [00244]     A charge     enable    (CHG ENB)     signal selectively
output     v drive controller 770 is            applied to the gate of
MOSFET 654.      The charge enab le signal is             also applied to a
disable pin of the level shifter              636.
 [00245]     The signal at t             unction or each MOSFET 628 and
630 is    appliied t o tie    a ssocIted      cont act    pin 350 through a
resistor    631,   (two resistors        631  identified)      .   The signal
present at the       junction    of the MOSFETs         628 and 630 is     also
applied to the current sense circuit                670.
 [00246]     T he current sensor circuit:           670   is   now described by
reference    to Figure 50 .       Current     sense circuit        670 includes
a number    of amplifHers.        Three separate voltages             amplifiers
outout each output        a signal     representative        of the current
drawn by a specific one of the motor windings.                      In  Figure
50,    to minimize redundancy,         a single one of these amplifiers
is    represented as ampli fi er 678.           The LT1999 bidirectional
current    sense amplifiers available from Linear Technology
may be eMloyed as these amplifiers.                   The V-Q     signal to each
winding current        sense amoliier        678 is     the voltage present
at the    junction    of MOSFETs 628 and 630 to resistor                631 to
which the winding        954 is   connected.        In   F,iguire 50 this is
the WNDSx_POS signal.           The V-N     signal to the alD ifier          0678
is    the voltage present       at the opposed        side of th
resistor    631.     In  Figu re 5     this   is  the WN DGxN E G signal.
To minim ze dr awing come x              y,  the WNDCxNEG         connections
are not shown in        Figure 49B.        The output         nal   tor each
amplifier 678     is    a WNDx        signal,    a signal      representative
of the current drawn by the winding.
 [00247]     The WNDGxI.      signoals for each of the windings are
applied to the drive controller 770 .                 In  actuality,     the

current drawn      through two of the windings              954 may be used to
calculate     the current drawn through the third winding 954.
The WNDGx I signal         representative       of the current drawn by
the third    winding      954 may be used as a check.
 [00248]     Each WNDGx NEG signal is            also applied to ground
through two series         connected resistors           672 and 674.     The
voltage present at the           junction of the resistors            672 and 674
is  output as a WNDGx V signal representative                   of the voltage
across the winding         954 .   The plural WNDGx_V signals are
applied to the drive controller             770.
 [00249]      Current sense circuit         650 has a fourth current
sense amplifier,       amplifier 688.         Amplifier       688 is   used to
measure the current drawn by the tool assembly                    120 as a
whole.     The specific amplifier employed as the winding
current    draw amplifiers        678 may also be used as the assembly
current    draw amplifier        688.    The signal present at the
junction of MOSFET 623 and resistor                 626,   ASSYPOS     signal,   is
applied to the V+-N pin of amplifier                688.    The voltage
present    at the    junction of resistors           626 to MOSFETs      628,   the
ASSY NEG signal,       is    applied to the V-m pin of amplifier               688.
Based on the voltage drop across              resistor      626 amplifier      688
produces    as an output signal ASSY            I representative        of the
current    drawn by the assembly 120.              This signal is       applied
to the d rive controller          770 .
 [00250]      The PWRSNEG signal applied to ground through two
series connected       resistors      682 and 684.         The voltage present
at the    junction of resistors          682 and 684 is        applied to the
drive controller       770 as a signal        representative         of the
voltage across the cells           38.
 [00251]      In  order for amplifiers          678 and. 688 to function
the 5 volt      analog signal is        applied the V'       pins of the
amplifiers.       A reference voltage is           also applied to the
amplifiers.       This reference voltage is             based on the 3.3 Volt
                                         65

analog signal,       Specifically,       the 3.3 Volt analog signal is
applied to voltage divider consisting of resistors                  690 and
692.     The voltage present at the junction of resistors                690
and 692 is     applied to the noninverting input of an op
amp 694.      The output voltage of op amp 694 is            tied back to
the inverting input.          The output voltage of the op amp is
the reference voltage applied to the current sense
amplifiers     678 and 680.      it   should be realized that the
reference voltage applied to the amplifiers               678 and 688
varies     with changes in     the actual potential       of the 3.3 Volt
analog signal.       This minimizes        the effects of the drift       of
the 3.3 Volt analog signal.
 [00252]      Not shown is     the capacitor      that removes ripple
from the input the non inverting input into amplifier 694.
Also not shown are the MOSFETs that control the application
of the 3.3 Volt analogue         signal into amplifier         694.    Drive
controller     770 regulates the outputting          of this    3.3 Volt
analogue signal      to the amplifier to ensure that it             is  only
output during the periods in           which BCM 128 is      actually
providing energization         signals to the tool unit power
generating unit 950.
 [00253]      Wake up circuit       702 as seen by reference to
Figure 51 includes a temperature              sensor 704     Temerature
sensor 704 monitors the temperature of the BCM 128.                    The 3.3
Volt hibernate voltage is           applied to the sensor 704 through
a resistor     706.   In  some versions of the invention,
sensor     704 pulls the signal at the pin to which resistor                706
is   connected to ground when the sensed temperature exceeds
800C.
 [00254]      The signal present at the          junction of sensor 704
and resistor     706 is   applied to the drive controller as a
temperature triggered wake up             (WAKETEMP)    signal.     This
signal,     which is  asserted LOW,        is  applied to the drive
                                        66

controller          770 to inform the controller               that the BCM is
being transitioned              from the hibernate         state      to an awake
state      because the BCM is             most likely being subjected to an
autoclave sterilization                  process.    While not illustrated
temperature sensor provides a signal                    representative           of the
sensed temperature              to the drive controller 770.                Drive
controller          770 records these temperatures                in   a memory     (not
illustrated).             These temperatures         as well as the length of
the time the BCM 128 is                  held as these temperatures            are
recorded to provide a history of the sterilization                             processes
to which the BCM has been exposed.
 [00255]          The 3.3 Volt hibernate            signal is       also applied to
the pin of sensor 704 to which resistor                        706 is     connected
through a resistor              708 and a diode 710.             The signal present
at the        junction of resistor           708 and diode        710 is    a general
wake up         (WAKEUP)       signal.      As discussed below,           the WAKEUP
signal is         also asserted low.             The anode of a diode           712 is
connected to the junction of resistor                      708 and 710.          The
cathode of diode             712 is      connected to the connected to the
ECM contact pin over which communications                         circuit    730
outputs a power signal to the tool unit microcontroller                                909.
In    Figure 51 this          pin 350 is      called out as the DEV PWR pin.
 [00256]          Wake up circuit          702 also includes a connection to
each of the contact pins 350 that are connected to the tool
unit windings 954.                 In   Figure 51   the connection to only a
single winding,             the WNDGx connection        is     shown.      The wake up
circuit        702 includes a resistor             714 connected to each of
these contact pins 350.                   The signal present          at the end of
the resistor            714  spaced from the WNDIGx connection               is   a
digital        :BCMCHRG      signal.       The three BCMCHRG signals are
output to         driver     controller      770 .
 [00257]          The communications circuit            730,      now described by
reference         to Figure 52,          provides power to the below
                                               67'

described microcontroller               911 and memory 912 internal to the
tool unit 124,          This power is          provided from a voltage
regulator 732,          One such voltage regulator is             the LT3050
Voltage Regulator available                for Linear Technologies.            The 5
Volt digital      signal is       applied to voltage regulator 732.
The voltage regulator 732 selectively outputs a 3.3 Volt
signal,   the DEV PWR signal,              over one of the contact
pins 350.      This is        the voltage is         output through a tool unit
socket pin 894 to a power bus on the flex circuit                         912
internal to the tool unit 124                   (tool unit power bus not
shown)       This contact pin 350 is                the contact pin to which
diode 712 of the wake up circuit                    702 is  connected.      The
voltage regulator 732 outputs this                    power  signal when the
drive controller inserts             a TU ENB signal to enable the tool
unit 124.
 [00258]      A second contact pin 350 is                 also connected to
communications        circuit     730.       This is     the contact pin 350
over which data          (DEVCOM)       signals are transmitted to and
received from the BCM 128.                 These are the signals that are
exchanged the BCM 128 exchanges both with the tool unit 128
and the charger.           This pin is         connected to the input ot an
inverter with Schmitt trigger 734.                     The output signal from
inverter 734 is         the serial       bit     stream of signals that are
received by the BCM.             These are the input data and
instructions      forwarded       to the drive controller as the
COMRCV    signal   s.
 [00259]      A resistor        736 is     tied     between the DEVCOM signal
contact   350 and ground.            Also tied        between contact      350 and
ground is     an n-channel        MOSFET 740.          A. COMXMT   signal     output
by the drive controller             770 is       selecti-vely applied to the
gate of MOSFET 740.             A resistor        742 is   connected between      the
gate of MOSFET 740 and ground.                    Not shown are pull up
resistors     internal        to both the charger and tool unit.                A
                                              68

digital    logic voltage,          typically the 3.3 Volt signal        are
applied to these pull up resistors.                 Drive controller     770
transmits data signals to the attached tool unit 124 or
charger by selectively asserting the COMXMT                  signal.    When
the COM XMT signal           is  in  the high state,     MOSFET 740 is
turned on.        This pulls the signal present at the free end of
the tool unit 128 or charger pull-up resistor                 to ground.
Thus the changes of the signal level of this                 pull resistor
are the signals received by either the tool unit
microcontroller           909 or the charger.
 [00260]      The remaining contact pin 350 of the BCM 128 can
also be considered part of the communications                 circuit    730.
Specifically        this    pin 350 is   used to establish the
connection      from the ground internal to the tool unit 124 and
the ground of the tool unit controller 530.
              T
 [00261]        he BCM indicators        750 include two LEDs 752 and
766 seen in       Figure 53.       The cathodes of both LEDs 752 and 766
are tied to one of the sources of voltage internal to the
SCM able to cause the emission of light                 by the LEDs.     The
cathode of LED 752 is            tied to ground through a resistor          754
and an n-channel           PET 756.    An LED 1 signal selectively
asserted by drive controller             770 is   applied to the gate of
the FET 756.          Also tied     to the gate of FET 756 is         a
resistor     757.       The LED 752 emits green light.
 [00262]      The LED 766 emits amber light           .   The cathode of
LED 766    is   tied      to ground through a resistor       768 and an n
channel    FET 769.         An LED 2 signal     selectively asserted by
the drive controller 770 is             applied to the gate of FET 769.
A resistor      772 is      tied between the gate of FET 769 and
ground.
 [00263]      The light        emitted by both LEDs is      applied to a
light    pipe 157        (Figure 66)   the exposed proximal       face of
                                          69

which is       mounted in   a transparent window in         end plate 140 of
proximal       shell 132.
 [00264]        Tool unit controller          530 contains a circuit    that
monitors       the voltage across       cells    38.  When the tool
unit 124 is        attached to the BCM and the monitored voltage is
at or above a level at which the BCM can source energization
signals with sufficient current and voltage to the tool
unit,      drive controller     770 asserts the LED 1 signal.           This
results      in   the turning   on of LED 752,       the LED that emits
green light.
 [00265]        If  the detected voltage level drops to a level
approaching the level at which the BCM can deliver
appropriate current and voltages                to the tool unit,    tool unit
controller        770 negates   the assertion of the LED 1 signal.
The LED 2 signal is         asserted.         The resultant emission of
amber light        by LED 766 provides         an indication to the
practitioner        that the charge       stored in   the BCM may not be
sufficient to adequately power the tool unit 124.
 [00266]        The drive controller          770 is any suitable processor
for regulating the operation of tool unit power generating
unit 950 and performs         the described ancillary         functions.
One such controller is          the XMC4504F100 family of
microcontrollers         available    from Infineon Technology of
Munich,      Germany.     This particular        microcontroller has a 32
bit     processor core with 1024 KB of flash memory.
 [00267]        A receiver 780     for wirelessly receiving signals
emitted from a device remote to tool. assembly 120 may also
be integral with tool unit controller                530.   The function of
receiver       780 is   discussed below.

                  C.      TOOL     UNIT
 [00268]          Tool unit 124 of powered surgical                     tool
assembly 120 of this                invention is         now initially       described by
reference         to Figures 53-55.              Tool unit 124 includes            an end
cap 850 that is             seated in      a main tube 940.            A head cap 941
is    disposed over the main tube 940.                       Collectively,         the end
cap 850,        shell 940 and head cap 941 form the                       Iousing of the
tool unit 124.              Disposed inside of the end cap 850 are
socket pins 894 and 902.                   Socket pins 394 and 902 are the
pins in       which the BCM contact pins 350 seat to establish
electrical          connections between the tool unit 124 and the
BCM 128.          Memory       910 is    also disposed in          the end cap 850.
The memory 910 stores the data describing the individual
operating characteristics                  of the tool unit 124.               The tool
power generating              unit 950 is        disposed in       shell 940.        As   seen
only in       Figure       17,   previously described head 16 attached to
the distal         end of shell 940.               Again,   the head removably
holds the energy applicator                     17,    here a sagittal       saw blade,
to the tool unit 124 so the energy applicator                              can be
actuated by the tool unit.
 [00269]          From Figures          56 and 57 it       can be seen that end
cap 850 has a tubular shaped foot 852.                           Foot 852 is       formed
to have three slots                that extend inwardly from the outer
surface       of the foot.            Each of the slots          extends distally
forward        from the proximal end of the foot 352.                        A first
slot,      slot     854,    is   generally rectangular in               shape.     When
tool unit 124           is     seated in      :BCM bore 214 the BCM rib 217
seats in        slot    854 .      Thus,   if    slot    854 is    not present,       a tool
unit 124 that fits               in   the BCM bore 214          cannot be
inadvertently pressed against BCM contact pins 390.
 [00270]          The two additional             slots    are slots      856,   one
slot     856 fully seen in             Figure 56.         Each slot      856 has a wide
proximal        end and tapers           inwardly distally           along    foot      A
                                                  71

short distance proximal to the distal end of the slot 856,
each slot has an extension 858 that extends Ia terally form
the longitudinal axis of the slot 856.              Slot extensions    858
are dimensioned to receive pins 420 integral with release
levers 412         Foot 852 is  further shaped to define a
notch 360.
[00271]      Two lees 864 extend distally forward from
Loot  852       Legs  864 have arcuate outer surfaces         (not
identi fied)    .   More particularly, the end cap 850 is          shaped
so that the outer surfaces of legs 864 define a circle that
has a diameter less than the diameter of the circle defined
by the outer surface of foot 852.             Cap 850 is    further shaped
so that legs 864 support a generally cylindrically                shaped
head 866.       Head 866 has an outer circumference that has a
diameter essential identical to the diameter of t-he circle
defined by the outer surface of legs 864.              Aneck 868
extends proximally rearward from the proximally directed
face of head 866.        The neck 868 is      cylindrical in    shape and
has an outer diameter such that the neck is             soaced radially
inwardly from the inner        surfaces of toe surrounding legs 864
Cap 850 is      further shaped so that the proximal face of
neck 868 Is       located distal l y forward of the distal end of
cap foot 852.
[00272]      IThe   end cap 850 is     further formed so that the
head 866 and neck 868 have a number of bores.                A bore 870
extends axially through the whole length of neck 868.
Bore 870 opens up into a bore 072            formed in  the proximal
portion   of head 866.      Bores 070 and 872 are coaxial.
Bore 8.72 is      larger in diameter than bore 870,.         The bore 872
open s into a bore 874      that is     opeo at the distally      directed
lace of head 866.        Bore 074   is    coaxial with an.d larger in
diameter than bore 872.         The head 866 is      furtherformed to
have a notch 876 that extends forward            -from the proximal    face
                                       72

of the head and inward from the outer surface of the head.
Notch 876 subtends an angle of approximately 120                  around the
outer circumference of the head 866.                 Three bores 878 seen
only in    Figure 56,     extend distally       from the proximally
directed face of notch 876.           Bores 876 are centered on a
single circle       and are parallel       with the proximal-to-distal
longitudinal       axis through the end cap 850.           Each bore 876
opens into the annular         step internal to the head between
bore 872 and bore 874.
[00273]      A socket 880,      now described by reference to Figure
58    is disposed in     the void space      internal to the end cap
foot 852.        Socket 880 is    formed from an electrically
insulating material able to withstand the effects of
autoclave sterilization.           Such material       includes the
material    from which the shells 132 and 162 are formed.                 The
socket    880 is    generally cylindrically          shaped and is
dimensioned to press fit         in  the end cap foot 852.         The
socket    880 is    formed to have at the proximal end a radially
projecting tab 882.         Tab 882 seats in         foot notch 860 so as
to prevent       rotation of the socket       880.
[00274]       The socket is     further formed to have two
cylindrically       shaped fingers     884 that extend forward from
the distal       face of the socket.        Fingers 884 are located on
one side of the socket and are parallel                to the prox imal to
distal    longitudinal     axis through the socket.
[00275]       The socket 880 is      formed to have a number of
longitudinally extending bores that extend between the
opposed proximal and distal          faces of the socket.         One bore,
bore 888,     is   concentric with the longitudinal          axis through
the socket.        The socket 880 has six additional          bores,   bores
890.     Bores 890 are arranged        in   a circle    that extends
between    bore 888 and the outer perimeter of the socket.                The
bores    890 are arranged so that there is             one cluster of three
                                        73

bores that are spaced apart so there is                         a relatively      short
angular distance between two adjacent bores.                             There is   also
a second cluster of three bores                    that are spaced are arranged
so there is         a larger angular distance between the adjacent
bores.
[00276]          An electrically        conductive         socket pin 894 or an
electrically          conductive     socket pin 902,            both seen in
Figure 55,        is   seated in    each one of the socket bores 890.
Socket pins 894 have tubular shaped heads                           896.     Pin
heads 896 are shaped to receive in                      releasable press fit          the
BCM contact pins 350.              A solid stem 898 extends forward                   from
the distal        end of each pin head 896.                  Each socket pin 902
has a head 904 identical to pin head 896.                            A stem 906
extends       forward from the distal              end of each pin head 902.
Stems 906 are in           cross section,          U-shaped.
[00277]          Upon assembly of the tool unit                   124,   the pin
heads 896 and 904            are press fit         in   the socket bores 890.
Pin head 904 are            seated in    the bores         896 wherein the angular
distances between adjacent bores                     is  relatively        large.  The
components        forming tool unit 124 are further shaped so the
pin stems 898 extend forward a relative                         short distance      from
socket       880.     Pin stems 906 extend distally                  forward a further
distance from socket 880.
[00278]          Memory 910,      as seen in         Figure 59,       is   attached to
flex circuit          912.     Flex circuit        910 is      shaped to have a       set
of flaps.         One flap,      flap   914 is       shaped to seat against the
distally       directed face of socket               880.     While not identified,
flap 914       is    formed to have holes that are shaped to receive
socket       fingers 884.        Socket fingers 884 thus hold the flex
circuit       914 to the socket.            It    should     further be understood
that flex circuit            flap 914    is    disposed over stems 898
integral with socket pins 894.
                                               74

 [00279]        Flex circuit       912     has three additional           flaps,   916,
918 and 920.-         Flaps 916,       918 and 920 extend forward from
flap 914.         Memory 910 is        mounted to flap 916.              Mounted to
  lap 918 is        a microcontroller            909.   While not illustrated,
microcontroller           909 is   connect-ed        to memory     90  .
Microcontroller           909 is   Le device that,           in   response to
commands from the BCM tool controller                     530 reads data from
and writes data           to memory       90C is     connected to
microcontroller           909.    Wh ie      not identified,        it   should be
understood that otner components are mounted to flex
circuit 912.          These components            include the component         that
protect the microcontroller                   909 and memory from
electrostatic         discharge.          One of these components is            also
the pull-up resistor             that is       connected to the BCM
communications          circuit    730.
 [00280]        Not illustrated           are the conductive cads            formed on
the flex circuit            to which the connections to piM                stems   898
are made.           Thse    pads are typically located on flex circuit
  lan 914 Also not illustrated                  are the conductors         formed on
                       t
the flex circui             912 that establish the various connections
to the conductive pads as well as to the components on the
flex circuit.
 [00281]        From Figures 53 and 54               it can be seen that tool
unit housing main tube 940                 is   generally tubular in          shape.
Shell       940 is,   like all     the exposed components              forming tool
unit 124 able to withstand the effects of autoclave
sterilization         and other        t                  processes to which
tool unit 124 may be subjected.                      Further,   shell     124 or at
least a portion thereof,               is     formed from material         through
which the signal monitored by sensors                     594   is    able to pass
without being distorted or attenuated to a level that
adversely affect the operation of sensors 594.                            Here
"adversely affect" means the ability                     of the sensors 594         to

output sensor signals as a function or characteristics of
the emitted energy is               impaired.         In  the described
embodiment,           the magnetic field          emitted by the motor rotor
magnets       968 is      the signal to be sensed that is                emitted by
the tool unit 124 .              Accordincly,         in  one version of the
invention,          shell    940 is     formed from a non-magnet-ic            material.
One such material             is  stainless       st eel .    Main tube 940 could
alternatively            be formed from plastic            or a ceramic.
 [00282]          The proximal        end of main tube 940           is  open.      The
inner diameter of the proximal                    end of the snell        is   designed
to closely receive legs                 864 and head 866 of end cap 850 .
The distal          end of the main tube 940 is               formed to have a pair
of inwardly st epped sections,                  not identified.
 [00283]          Distal cap 941 is          formed to have a cv              drical
base 942.           The base 942 is         shaped to fit       ove      hei   nwardly
steped        sections of main tube 940.                  Forward of base 942,
distal      can     941 has a neck 944.             Neck 944 has a diameter less
than that of the main body of the shell 94n.                            Two   slots    946,
one shown,          are   formed in      the outer surface of neck             944.
Slots 946 receive             complementary          rastening    features integral
with head 16.             These fastenrng features facilitate                  the
  rmovable        att La chm ent of head 16 to shell             940 .
 [00284]         When tool unit 124 is               assembled,    a fastening
ning 947       is     press fit     over    the stepped sections of main
tube 940,           Distal cap base 942           is    threaded over distal          cap
base 942.           Not identified is         the threading around the inner
surface       of the distal         can base and the complementary
treading          around the outer surface of                ring 947.       Also    not
identified are the axially aligned bores that extend                              through
main tube 940,            cap base 9 42 and cap neck 944.
 [00285]          Mtor 950,       the tool power generate n              unit,    is   a
brushless DC motor.               The motor 950 includes             a stator 952 and.
a rotor or shaft             966.       From Fgure 60 it          can be seen that
                                               76

the wire forming three windings                         954     (one identified)    of the
stator         is   wrapped. around a tube like core 956                      A lamination
stack 958 is            disposed over the windings 954.                    Two leads 955
extend from each winding                      954.    in   Figure     60, for ease of
illustration,             only five leads            955.      One lead 955 from each
of t he t three windings is                   connected to the ot her two leads
from tihe other winding s 954                      so that- tne windings
collectively            form a Y-winding.               The free lead 955 of each
winding           954 Is   connected          Lo t he stem 906 of a sepa-rate one
of      the sock et pins 902,                (connection not shown)
 [00286]            In  Figure          .54 t   can be seen that the            tor 952 is
disposed in            an electrically             insulating sleeve       96n.
Sleeve         960 tightly        fits      in   the main bore of s'ell         940.
 [00287]            Irn the depicted version of the invention                    motor
rotor 966 is            cannulated.             A lumen,     not identi fed,     extends
between           the proximal and distal               ends of the rotor 966.          A
tube 967 di sposed in                  the     1umen of the rotor 966 is
statically            mounted to the tool unit housing.                    Tube   967 has a
proximal portion,               not identified,            that is     disposed in   socket
bore 888 .            The tube 967 extends              distally      into the bore
internal to i-he distal                   cap base 942.
 [00288]            Four magnets          968     (only two magnets       seen)  are
dispDosed over the portion of the rotor 966 seated in                               the
stator         952.     A sleeve         970 holds the magnets 968 to
rotor 966.             A bearLing assembly 972 rotatably holds the
prox.ma-           end of the rotor 966 bore in                   end. cap bore 872.     A
bear       -ng    assembly 976 rotatably holds                   rotatably holds a

section           of tool unit housing main tube- 940 .
 [00289]            Not identified and not part of the present
invention are components attached to the distal                               end of the
rotor 966.             These components transfer the rotational motion
of the rotor             966 to the tool unit head 17.

              D.   OPERATION
 [00290]      Operation      of. powered surgical               tool assembly 120 of
this invention     is      now explained by reference                    to the flow
chart of Fioures        62A to 62D.           initially,         as represented by
step 1002,     battery and control module                     128 is     in    the
hibernation state        .   When BCM 128 is             in    the hibernation
state,    drive controller        770 does not assert                  any of the
signals that cause any of the power supplies that can be
selectively turned on to be turned on,                         the only signal
output be a power supply is              the 3.3 Volt hibernation                     signal
output    by the 3.3 Volt power supply.
 [00291]      Also it      should be assumed for this                    operating         state
of th1e BCM 128 that the switch finger tab 448 is                               fully
retracted so as to be seated against                       fork 444.          When the
switch is     so set,      the proximal        end of beam 472 Is                seated in
distal    shell notch 184.         The seating of beam 472 in
notch 184 prevents          the switch from being pivoted downwards
towards the shell nacelle 166.                   When the switch is                in    this
state    the "O" marking 480 is           visible          through window 457.                   If
a tool unit 124 was coupled to the BCM 128 this                               would serve
as an indication that the assembly 120 could not be
actuated.
 [00292]      When the ECM is         in  the hibernation                state,      there
are essentially       two activities.              One activity            i:s the
monitoring of ambient temperature by temperature                                sensor 704.
The second activity          is  the monitoring of the WAKEU P and
WAKE TEIIMP signals by drive controller                       770.     This means that
when the BCM is       in    the hibernation            state,      relatively         little
current    is  drawn    from cells       38.       This means that the
BCM 128,     once the cells       38 are fully charged,                    the :BCM can be
left   on  the shelf for a period of at                    least 3 months and
preferably at. least         6 months with little                 concern that the
                                           78

current draw by the always on components will drain the
cells     to such a level      that BCM will not be able to drive a
tool unit 124 to which the BCM is              attached.
 [00293]      When BCM 128 is      in   the hibernation State,
MOSFET 622 and 623 are turned off .               This  reduces tie        loss of
charge tIhat would otherwise          result     from an output of a
signal over bus 624.           The turning off       of MOSFETs 622 and 623
also prevents unintended charging of the ceils                   38.
 [00294]      Step 1004      represents     the determination by
temperature sensor 704 that the ambient temperature has
exceed the set trip          temperature     level.    This event results
in    t-he temperature     sensor 704 connecting        the sensor input
pin to which the 3.3 Volt hibernation                signal is     ground.     The
voltage on the bus connected to this                pin is   thus pulled low.
The signal on this         bus serves as both the WAKE_ P and
WAKE_ ITEMP signals.         Thus both of these signals,          which are
asserted LOVJ,       are applied to the drive coItroller               770.
 [00295]      TIn   response to the drive controller           770 receiving
both the VJAKEUP and WAKE'_T         EMP signals,      the controller
recognizes that         the BCM is   most likely being sterilized.
Te BCM thus enters a data logging state,                   represerted by
step 1 n06.       In  the data loggi         state,   the drive controller,
asserts the 3.3 WAKE signal.              The resultant      Lrning on of
MOSFET 538 results         in  the drive controller         770 being sourced
enougI     current that it      can record data regarding            t-he   ime at
which. the :B1CM is      at a temperature above the trigger level.
Drive controller         770,  as part of this       data loggin,         may also
record data identifying the           temperatures      of the :BCM 128.
These data are based on the           signals      representative       of these
temperatures        supplied by temperature         sensor 704 .       These data
are available        for later   review by the persons responsible
for maintenance        of the BCM.      These data are used to
                                         '79O

determine whether or not the BCM was subjected to an
appropriate sterilization            procedure.
 [00296]      After sterilization,            the BCM 128 is    returned to a
room temperature environment,               appx 22 C.      Eventually        the
temperature of the BCM drops to that of this                   environment.
Once BCM temperature falls            to a level below a return
temperature level,        temperature sensor 704 opens the
connection between the pin to which the 3.3 Volt hibernation
signal is     asserted and ground,             (step not shown)    .     This
results    in  the BCM returning to the hibernation                  state.       This
results    in  the negation of         the 3.3 WAKE signal.
 [00297]      Periodically,        either      the BCM 128 is   attached to a
charger or a tool unit 124 is               fitted    to the BCM.        in   either
event,   t-he BCM contact pins 350 seat in                the complementary
socket pins of the device to which the BCM is                   attached.
Given the structure of the BCM it                  should be appreciated that
the contact pins 350 are able to slightly                   move relative         to
the BCM housing.        The ability         of the contacts pins 350 to so
move reduces the amount of mechanical                   stress to which the
pins are exposed as part of this                  pin-in-socket   coupling
process.      The reduction of this              stress result  in     a like
reduction in     the extent to which this               stress can result         in
pin bending or breakage.
 [00298]      Step 1008 represents            the evaluation by the drive
controller     770 regarding whether or not the BCM is                     attached
to a tool unit or charger.              it    is   understood that step 1008
is   part of the evaluation process performed during the
temperature trigger         level exceeded determination               of
step 1004.
 [00299]      When either the BCM 128 is              seated over the charger
or the tool unit 124 is            seated in       the BCM,  the housing of
the charger or tool unit            seats against ribs 216 internal                 to
BCM bore 214.      This ensures the device in               the bore 214
                                           80

remains Physically static within the bore while minimize                           the
amount of physical          force required to disconnect the BCM 128
from the attached. device.
 [00300]       While not illustrated          it    should be understood that
the charger to which the BCM 128                 is  attached has a low
resistance       relative    to resistor      708.      It  should also be
understood that the charger sources a low level current                           out
of the charger socket pns              that are connected to the contact
pins 350 to which MOSFETs             628 and 630 are connected.
Internal to the tool unit 128 there is                    a like    low resistance
path between the socket pin 894 to which the DEV PWR signal
is    applied and ground.
 [00301]       As long as the BCM 128 is             not connected to a
charger or a tool unit 124,              the 3.3 Volt hibernate            signal
applied to the junction of resistor 708 and diodes 710 and
712 remains at or near this level.
 [00302]       For the reasons set forth above,                 when the BCM 128
is    connected to either the charger or a tool                    .nit   124,   a low
resistance path to ground is              established between the
junction of resistor 708 and diodes 710 and 712.                          This
causes the signal at this junction to fall                      to ground.       This
signal is      the asserted LOW WAKEUP              signal.      At this time
diode 710 prevents the signal present at the junction of
temperature sensor 704 and resistor 706 from likewise
falling    to ground.        Accordingly,        when the BCM is        in  this
state,    wake up circuit        702 does not assert the WAKEUP
signal.       Drive controller 770 in            step 1008 thus interprets
the receipt of the WAKE UP signal without the simultaneous
receipt of the WAKETEMP             signal as an indication that the
BCM 128     is   attached to either a charger or a tool unit 128.
 [00303]       In    a step 1010 drive controller 770 then
determines       if    the BCM is  connected to charger or a tool
unit 124.        This evaluation is         made by monitoring the states
                                           81

of the BCM CHRG signals.              If  the BCM is      attached to a
charger the low-level            I charging current will be present                 on
the contact pins 350 to which this                current is       applied.
These currents are applied to the resistors                     714 .     The
currents      thus appear as t        e   sserted HIGH BCM CHRG signals.
In  contrast,       when the BCM is       attached to the tool unit               124,
the BCM initially           does not source currents          to these
pins 350          Accordingly,     when a tool unit 124 is            attached to
the BCM 128,        immrediately after the WAKE UP signal is
asserted,       the BCM CHRG signals          are not present.           Drive
controller        128 thus bases the determination              of step 1010
based on the whether or not the BCM CHRG signals are
asserted.
 [00304]        The fault state       of less than all        t he BCM CHRG
signals being asserted is             not material       to the main operation
of this     invention.         The operation of the BCM 128 when the
signals indIcate          faults such as this         are therefore only
minimally,        of at all,     described.
 [00305]        If  the BEM is     attached     to a charger,        the BCM
centers a pre-charging           state   represented by step 1012.                When
in  the charing         state,    drive controller        asserts the 3.3 WAKE
signal and the 5V            ENB signal,    the C-D ENE signal and              HR_ ENE
signal.       The assertion       of the 3.3_WAKE signal           results      in
power   siu ,pv     534 outputting the 3.3 Volt 3.3 Volt analog
signals.        'The assertion of the 5V ENB signal              results      In
power   suppLy 548 outputting the 5 Volt and 5 Volt                       analog
 [00306]        When in     the pre---charging    state,    the drive
controller        770 determines      if  the BCM 1278       can accept       a
charge    from the charger to which the BCM is                  attached,
step 101.4.        This evaluation may include running some checks
on the components           of tool controller        530.    This evaluation
may also involve an exchange of data signals with the
                                           82

charger to ensure that the charger                   can charge the BCM.             As
these evaluations          are not part of this            invention they are
not discussed further.            if   it   is    determined that the BCM
cannot be charged,          the BCM enters a fault            state,      step 1016.
 [00307]       if  the BCM 128 can be charged,               the BCM enters a
charging     state    1018.     The BCM enters          the  charging      state     by
outputting the square wave to the voltage doubler 642 and
the assertion        of the C/D ENB and CHRG ENB signals.                      The
outputting of the square wave causes                    the voltage doubler to
output a signal with sufficient                  high potential to turn on
MOSFETs    622,    623 and 628.        The C/D ENB signal            is   asserted
LOW.     The assertion of the C/D ENB signal thus results                          in
the turning off of MOSFET 646.                   The turning off of
MOSFET 646 results          in  the output signal from the voltage
doubler being applied           to the gates         of   MOSFETs    622 and     623
                                               T
and the source of MOSFET 650.                    he turning on of MOSFETs               622
and 623 results        in   the connection of the BAT+ terminal of
the cells      to bus     624.
 [00308]       The asserted CHRGENB signal is                 applied to the
gate of MOSFET 654.            This results        in   the turning off of the
MOSFET 654.        The signal present at the gate of MOSFET 650 is
thus pulled to ground.            This results          in  the turning on of
MOSFET 650.        This results      in   the high potential signal                from
voltage    doubler     642 being applied           to   the gate     of   the
MOSFET 628 to which the drain of MOSFET 650 is                         connected.
This results       in  the turning on of the MOSFET 628.                     The
turning on of this          MOSFET   628 establishes a low resistance
path from the contact pin 350 to which the MOSFET 628 is
connected and the positive terminal of the cells                          38.    This
is    the path over which the charging current                    is    sourced to
the cells.
 [00309]       in  the absence of MOSFET 650 being turned on,
there would still          be a current flow through the MOSFETs                      6.28
                                           83

to the cells          38.      This current          flow is      through the body
diodes of the MOSFETs                  628.    This     is  because while not shown
in    the drawings it             is  understood that MOSFETs 628 are
arranged         so that their          body diodes are forward biased
between       the resistors            631 and resistor           626.     However,      there
is    a voltage drop of approx imately 0. 7 Volts across                              these
body diodes.           The turning on of               one of     the MOSFETs        628
results       a conductive path with a lower voltage drop being
established between one of                     he contact         pins 350 and the
cells      38.      This results in          a more efficient             charging of      the
cells.
 [00310]           There will also be current                 flow from the charger
to the cells          through diode 632.                Diode 632 is         provided in
the event the cells are fully discharged.                              If    the BCM 128 is
in    this     state,     it   is    udest     ood that tool controller 530
does not function.                  Whie not depicted in              the flow charts,
it     should be understood that when the ECM 128                            is   in  this
state and attached to a charger,                        there will be at least             some
current        flow through diode 632.                  This current         flows through
the body diode of MOSFET                   623.      IThe curret       is    then available
t o energize the 3.3 Volt power supply                           534,   (connection from
MOSFET       623 to and power             supply 534 not shown)            .     The
subsequent outputting the 3                   .3   Volt hibernation             signal by
power supply 534 reactivates                     drive controller            770 .    Tool
unit control           r     530 then cycles           the BCM 128 from the
hibernation state              to the state          in   which the BCM recognizes
that the BCM is             attached to a charger.
 [00311]           The CHARENB          signal   is    also applied to level.
shifter        636.    The application of the CHRENB signal to the
level      shifter     636 disables the shifter.                     This ensures that,
during charging an errant signal will not be applied                                   to the
gate of one of the MOSFETs                   630.       If  this     event was to occur,
the cells          38 would be tied to ground.
                                                  84

 [00312]       While the BCM 128 is            in   the charging       state,      drive
controller      770 continually monitors the other components of
the tool     unit controller          530 to determine        if   the BCM is
attached to the charger             530,    step 1020.      This monitoring may
be performed by monitoring the contact pins 350 over which
the charging current source to determine if                       the BCM CHRG
signal changes        state.      Specifically,         the disconnecting             of
the BCM 128 from the charger result                   in  the transition           of the
BCM CHRG signal         to the low state.            Alternatively,          the signal
across the contact pin 732 to which the voltage regulator
is  532 is     attached may be powered.               The removal of the
BCM 128     from the charger          would thus result         in   the WAKE UP
signal,     which is      asserted LOW,        from transitioning to the
HIGH state.
 [00313]       Once   in    step 1020 it       is   determined that the
ECM 128 is      withdrawn from the charger,               drive controller              770
                                                      t
returns the BCM to the hibernate                   sta e.   This results            in   the
negations of the signals that were asserted to place the SCM
in  the charging        state.
 [00314]       Returning to step 1010 it              should be understood
that when a tool unit 124 is               attached to the BCM 128 the
will be no signals on the contact pins 350 from which the
SCMCHRG signals are obtained.                     Drive controller         770 then
places the BCM 128,            at this   time the whole of the tool
assembly 120,       in    the tool attached state,            step 1026.           The
drive controller          770 places the assembly 120 in                 the tool
attached state        by asserting the 3. 3 WAKE and 5V ENB signals.
 [00315]       The TU_ENB signal         is    also asserted to voltage
regulator 732.          The assertion of the TUENB                si gnal     results
in  voltage regulator 732             supplying the DEVPWR             signal to the
tool unit microcontroller              909    (step not shown) .           In   a
step 1028,      the BCM drive controller              770 exchanges data with
the tool unit 124 .            This includes the reading of data in
                                            85

tool unit memory 910.           As part of this          step,     the drive
controller     770 may write data to memory 910.                    These data
include data logging into the tool unit memory 910 the
date/time of the connection and identifying data specific to
the attached BCM 128.
[00316]     Drive controller        770 then determines if                the BCM is
capable of energizing the tool unit 124,                    step 1030.       One or
more evaluations are performed in                step 1030.         These
evaluations include:         determination        if    the tool unit provides
a correct authorization          key; determination             of whether or not
the tool unit provide data indicating it                    was sterilized;        or
a determination      that the tool unit has not stored data
indicating that the unit itself              is   in    a fault      state.    If  in
step 1030,    drive controller       770 determines that the BCM 128
cannot energize      the tool unit 124,           the drive controller
places the assembly 120 in          a fault       state,     step 1032.        Drive
controller     770 may inform the practitioner                  that the
assembly 120 is      in  the fault     state      by rapidly cycling one or
more of LEDs 752 and 766 on and off,                  (step not shown).
[00317]     if   in  step 1030 it     is     determine that the BCM can
energize the tool unit 124,          the drive controller                770 places
the assembly 120 in        the ready state,           step 1036.
Specifically     at this     time the TRGENB signal is                  asserted.
The assertion      of the TRGENB signal results                  in    the turning
on of MOSFET 562.        The 3.3 Volt analog signal                  is  applied to
sensor  566.     Sensor 566 is      then able to generate a variable
signal as a function of the displacement of trigger 440.
[00318]     The practitioner        completes the process                of readying
the assembly for use by extending trigger beam 472 and
finger tab 488 from fork 444.              This moves the proximal end.
of beam 472 out of the notch 184                internal to the distal            end
shell  162.     One or both of the         ''" markings          478 and 482
should then be visible.           The practitioner           is    then   free to
                                        86

turn on the assembly 1030 by pressing down of finger
tab 488.
 [00319]     Step 1038 represents the determination of whether
or not t he practitioner has act uated the assembly 120                  This
determination is     made by monitoring the ANA TRG signal
Specifically,     the downward depression of the trigger 440 by
the practitioner changes the distance between maranet- 490 and
sensor 566.      This results in    a change in     the voltage of the
ANA TRG siQnal.
 [00320]     Once the change of the ANA TRG signal is             above a
hysteresis level,     tool unit controller 530 energizes the
tool unit power generator 950,          step 1040.    Initially,      in
step 1040 drive controller actuates the voltage doubler 642
and asserts the C/,'D ENB si cnal         This results in       the
application of voltages to the gates of MOSFETs 622 and 623
that turn on the MOSE's.
 [00321]     The MTR SNS ENB signal is        also asserted.        This
results in    the application of the 3.3 Volt analog signal
tL rough MOSFET 592 to sensors 954.
 [00322]     Also in  step 1042,    the BCM 126 sources the
einergi zation signals to the tool unit power generating
unit 950.     Since this particu lar power generating unit 950
is   a brushless DC motor,     step 1042 involves the selective
tieing of the moCor windings 954           to either the BAT-       or BAT
terminals of the cells     38.     This process is     performed by the
selective    turning on and off of MOSFETs 628 and 630.               Drive
controller 770 thus asserts the appropriate sequence of
   _CNTRL signals to level     shi after 636.     Level shifter      636 and.
gate drivers 638 collectively assert the signals to the
gates of MOSFETs 628 and 630 to ensure the appropriate
application of commutation       currents to motor windings 954.
 [00323]     Drive controller    770 applies commutation          currents
to windings 954 as a function of the rotational position of
                                     '7

motor rotor 966.             The drive controller 770 determines               rotor
position    as a function           of the output signals from
sensor   594 .      Specific       lv,      each sensor 954 outputs       its
sensor signal as a function of the strength of the magnetic
fieid   sensed by the sensor.                  Mor   specifically these are
magnetic    fi e ds emitted by rotor magnets 968.                     Figure 63 is
a plot of the three TU SNSx signals,                     signals   1044a,   1044b
and 1044c for a complete                 360of     the magnetic     rotation of
the rotor 966.           Each signal I 1044a,          1044b and 1044c is
generally sinusoidal.               Owing to the positioni a of the
sensor   594 relative           to the motor rotor          966,  each ssignal is
essentially        600 out of phase with the adj acent                signal.
 [00324]       in   step 1040,       drive controller         770f, a a-ny given
instant In       time,     uses the linear segment of a single one of
senor    sinal        1044a,     1044b or 1044c,         as the signaI
representative         of roto-r       rotational position.         In  Figure 63
the two bold phases of each signal are the linear portions
of the si      nal.      This is     because when a sensor          signal is     in
one of the signal' s linear phases,                    that signal is    highly
correlates to the rotational position of the rotor.                           Once
one of the sensor signals                  Ieaves  its   linear phase it      can be
seen that signal output by one of the adjacent                        signals will
e-nter its     linear phase.            Accordingly,      at this   time the drive
controller       770 bases the determination                of rotor rotational
position based on this              second sensor signal 1044a,           1044b
or 1044c.      Three sensors            094 are used because       over 180     of
the magnetic rotation of the rotor each sensor provides a
signal that highly correlates to the rotor positiofor                             60
of rotor rotation.            In  the described version of the invention
motor 950 has four magnets                  966 and is    a two pole pair rotor.
                       0
Accordingly,        36       of magnetic rotation correspond to 1800                 or
physical    rotation.           Thus     for every 3600      of physical    rotation
of the rotor        966 the signal           from each     sensor 594 is    used in
                                               88

four different phases of that 360                to determine rotor
rotational          position.
 [00325]           Accordingly,   based on the sequence of sensor
signals         1044a,   1044b and 1044c,    drive controller    770
determines the rotational position of the motor rotor 966
B-ased on rotor position t.he commutation              currents are sourced
to and sunk from the appropriate              set or windings.      It   should
be understood that in            some versions of the invention,         tool
unit controller            530, when sourcinq the commutation current,
may source the current to two of the windinos.                  This would
result       in    two of the MOSFETs    628 being simultaneously        turned
on.      The commutation currents are sunk from at least               one of
reminding windings 954,             the windings   to which the current is
not being sunk.
 [00326]           T'he frequency   with which the commutation     current
is   applied and the duty cycle with which the commutation
current        is   applied are further of the extent to which the
practitioner           actuates switch 440.      Thus,  tool unit
controller          530 in   addition to controlling the on/off        state
of the p ower generating unit            950  is  further able to control
the rate of operation,            here motor speed.      This  speed is      set
based on the level of the A'NA TRG signal from sensor 566.
 [00327]           Tool unit control er 530 sources energization
signals to the power generating unit               950 in  part based on
the data read from tool unit memory 910 .                For example,      these
data may include calibration             data for determining     rotor
rotational position based on the characteristics                 of the
individual magnets 966.              These data may indicate the maximum
currents          that should be applied     to the windings and the
maximum voltages that should be allowed to develop across
the windings.            These data may also indicate      the maximum
torque the motor should be allowed to develop                 (equivalent to
current draw)           for a given motor speed.       Drive controller 770
                                          89

uses these data as well as the WNDGx I signals
representative           of winding        current      draw and the WNDGx V
signal representative               of winding voltages to further
regulate the sources of the energization                           signals to the
motor 950.
 [00328]          The BCM 128 provides               energization      signals,     here
commutation         currents,       to the tool         unit    power generating        unit
as long as the trigger 440 is                      depressed,      switch released
step 1048 of Figure 62D.                   Once use of the assembly              120 is    no
longer required,              the practitioner          releases     the force applied
to the trigger switch 440.                     Springs 496 return the switch to
the off position in              which magnet          490 is    spaced furthest from
sensor 566.           Once tool controller              770 determines        the ANA TRG
signal has returned to the off state                          signal level,      the
controller negates              the application of the C/DENB and DCIITR
signals.          The application of commutation                   currents to the
windings       is   thus terminated,             step   1050.
 [00329]         As represented by step 1052,                   tool unit
controller         530 also determines whether or not the tool unit
has been disconnected from the motor.                           This evaluation may
be monitoring communication between the ECM drive
controller         770 and the tool unit microcontroller                      909.    This
is   because,       while not shown as an explicit                   step,    the drive
controller         770 may repeatedly send an inquiry to the
microcontroller             909 requesting                  the microcontroller         90
send an acknowledgement.                   If   these acknowledgments            are not
received for a defined period of time,                          for example,       for a
period typically less than 2 seconds,                          drive controller       770
assumes that the tool unit has been removed from the BCM.
Alternatively using circuit                    components not illustrated,              the
drive controller              770 monitors the current              drawn by the tool
unit components over the power line connected to these
components.           A drop of this           current draw is         interpreted by
                                                  90

the drive controller 770 in                 step 1052 that the tool unit has
been disconnected              from the BCM 128.
 [00330]       Regardless          of the type of test,          once the drive
controller         770 determines         that the tool unit has been
disconnected,           the Drive controller returns the BCM to the
hibernate state.               As part of this       transition,      the signals
that are asserted to place the assembly in                        the drive
controller         770 in      the ready state       are negated.
 [00331]        The assembly 120 of this               invention has a weight of
less than 0.6 kg and more preferably                       less than 0.4       kg.     The
assembly     is     wit h,     at least    25% of the overall         length of the
to o int        124 being encased in             the BCM housing Ts           designed
to be beld in           a single hand like a pencil or a pen.
 [00332]       A feature of- assembly 120 of this                   invention      is
that the overall length of i-he tool unit 124,                        excluding        the
energy applicator 17,               is   generally be tween 10 to 15 cm.                The
assembly 120 is            further designed         so that when i-he tool
unit 124 is         seated in       the BCM 128,       one of the     'el     s 38 is
disposed over a proximal section of the tool unit ihat is
approximately           2 to 7 cm in       length.      Owing to the weight of
the individual            components,      tool assembly 120 thus tends to
have a center of gravity that is                    located approximately             5 to
8 cm oroximat           from the distal        end of the tool unit            head 16
and more often 6 to 7 cm.                  This means that when a
practitioner         using the tool holds the tool between the thumb
and. middle finger,              the center of gravity of the tool tends
to be approximately 6 cm of where the thumb and forefinger
meet on the hand.                Thus the weight of the tool              is  born
primarily by this              part    of the hand.       This   serves to reduce
the ergonomic           stress imposed on the thumb and finger that is
holding and manipulating the assembly.
 [00333]        It   is    still    a further      feature of this          invention
that the contact pins 350 through which the H-bridge sources
                                              91

current to and sinks current              from the tool unit power
generating unit 950 are the contacts through which the
charger sources currents to the cells                38.   This eliminates
the need to provide the BCM of this                invention with a contact
the sole purpose of which is             to receive the charging
current.
III.        THIRD EMBODIMENT
[00334]     Figures     64-66 depict         the basic structure of an
alternative battery and control module 1200 of this
invention.     Battery and control module 1200 has a housing or
body that is    pistol    shaped.        Thus the housing      includes an
approximately      shape barrel 1202.           The housing has a grip
portion   1204 that extends downwardly from Le barrel.
Internal   to the barrel 202 is            the nacelle    1256 in  which the
tool unit,    such as tool unit 124,            is  releasably seated.
Rechargeable    cells    38 for energizing the tool unit 124 are
disposed in grip portion 1204.
[00335]     Battery and control module              1202 has two control
switches.    Both switches extend forward from the distally
directed portion of the housing grip portion 1204.                    A first
switch,   switch 1210 is       a toggle switch.          The practitioner
sets the position of switch 1210               to control the operating
mode of the attached tool unit.                The second switch,
switch 1212,    is    located below switch 1210.            Switch 1212 is    a
biased switch.        The practitioner         selectively displaces
switch 1212 to both control the on/off state                 of the tool
unit power generating unit and the operating rate of the
power generating unit.            A tool unit controller        1290  is
disposed in    barrel 1202 and the handgrip              1204.   The tool
unit controller       1290 includes the previously described
sensors   566,  580 and 594.           :Based on the signals output by
sensors   566,  580 and 594,         the tool unit controller        1290
                                          92

sources and sinks current to the tool unit power generating
unit.
 [00336]         The housing of BCM 1200 is        formed from a proximal
shell      1220 and a distal      shell 1248.      Proximal shell 1220,        as
now described by reference           to Figures      67 and 68,     comprises
approximately three-quarters of the BCM barrel 1202 and
approximately        one-half    of the hand grip 1204.         Proximal
shell      1220 has an end plate       1222  that    forms the proximal      end
of the barrel 1202.            End plate 1222 is      formed with a through
bore 1224.         Bore 1224 is    present because one type of tool
unit that may be attached to BCM 1200 is                a wire driver.       As
its     name implies,       a wire drive is   used to drive,        advance
wire.       The wire is      feed into the cannulated rotor of the
wire driver through bore 1224.              Not identified is        the step
formed in        the end plate 1222 in      which bore 1224      is   formed.
 [00337]        At the end of the grip portion 1204 of proximal
shell 1220 the shell has a base plate                1226.   The base
plate      1226 is   formed with protruding        ribs 1228 and a through
hole 1230.         Ribs 1228 and hole 1230 are provided to
facilitate        the seating of pressure      relief    valve 154 in      the
base plate 1226.             Two ribs 1232 extend inwardly from each
of the opposed inner surfaces             of proximal     shell 1220.      Ribs
are located in        the portion of the shell that defines             the
bottom of the barrel 1202.            Ribs   1232    suspend the tool unit
controller        1290 in    the void space internal to the BCM 1200.
 [00338]         The distal    shell 1248   as seen in     Figures    69-72 is
shaped to mate over the open distal              end. of    oximal
shell      1220.    The distal    shell 1248 is      formed to have a
base 1250 that is           approximately   semi-circular     in    shape.
Base 1250 forms the front portion of the BCM handgrip 1204.
A head 1252 is         formed integrally with and is         located above
the top of base 1250.            Head 1252   forms the distal        portion of
BCM barrel 1202.

 [00339]       The nacelle 1256 is         formed integrally with distal
shell  1248.       The main body of nacelle          1256 i         tubular        in
shape.      Shell 1248 is     formed so that the nacelle 1256
extends inwardly        from  the front of the shell and is                    located
inwardly     from the portions        of the shell that define                  the
outer sections of the BCM housing .Nacelle                     1256 defines            the
bore 1257 internal to BCM 1200 in               which the tool unit                is
received
 [00340]      At the proximal end of the nacelle                  1256 there is           a
disc shaped end plate         125.       End plate 1253        is     structurally
similar to disc 206 of BCM 128.                End plate 1258 is             formed
with openings 1260         (one opening       identified)      for receiving
the contact pins 350 that provide the electrical                          connections
to tie    tool units and chargers            to t he which the BCM 1200                is
attached.       The proximal.         ivrected face of end Date 1258 is
provided     with the same        oib structure with which disc 206 is
formed     (ribs not identi fed).            When BCM is     assembled,
seal 360 and cap 370 are fitted               against the proxi mal end of
plate  1258.       Seal 360 and cap 370         form the barrier between
plate  1258 and the contact pins 350 seated in                      the plate
needed to seal the void space internal to the BCM from the
ambient environment.          For ease of illustration,                 contact
pins 350,      seal 360 and cap 370          are not illustrated             in    the
drawings depicted BCM 1200.
 [00341]      End plate 1258 is         further formed to have boss 1262
that extends outwardly from the proximally directed                             face of
the plate.       :Boss 1262 is     formed with a through bore that
extends axially through the boss and through the plate.
When BCI3CM 1200    is  assembled,      the proximally directed                 face of
boss 1262 abut and is         sealed against the adjacent                  dismally
directed surface of the proximal               shell 1220      that defines the
end of bore 1224.          This establishes a channel               through the
housing that is        isolated from the void space               in    the housing
                                          94

through which the wire can be feed. into a wire driver-type
tool   unit.
 [00342]       Returning to Figure 36 it         is   noted that seal 350
has center located through hole 362.                 From Figure 37 it    is
understood that cap 370 has a like through holes 372.
Through holes 362 and 372 are provided to facilitate                  the
seating of,        respectively,    the seal 360 and the cap 370
around boss 1262.
 [00343]       Distal shell 1248 is        further formed to have a set
of interior        located panels that define a recess 1266 that
extends inwardly         from the distally      directed face of shell
base 1250.         Recess 1266 is    located a short distance below
shell head 1252.          The recess    1266 is    generally in   the form
of a truncated oval wherein the topped curved end of the
oval is      not present.      In  the Figures      the only recess
defining panel that is           identified is     an end panel    1268.     End
panel    1268 defines       the proximal    closed end of recess 1266.
 [00344]       Shell head 1252 is       formed so as to have an
arcuately shaped recess           1272.    Recess    1272 extends inwardly
from the top of head 1252 and is             located proximally inward
from the distal        face of the head.        The recess   1272 is
generally semi-circular.            The ends of the recess 1272 are,
however parallel        to each other.       Further,    shell 1248 is
shaped so the parallel           ends of recess      1272 have proximal-to
distal     widths that are long the width of the main arcuate
portion of the recess.
 [00345]       The panel of shell       1248 that forms the base of
recess     1272 is    shaped to define a rectangular opening 1274.
Opening 1274 opens into the void space with nacelle                  1256.
Two through bores 1276 extend inwardly from the front face
of head 1252.         Each bore 1276 opens into recess          1276.
Bores 1276      it   should be understood are located on opposed
sides of shell head 1252.            The distal      shell 1248 is   further
                                        95

formed to have two notches 1278.             Each notch 1278 extends
inwardly    from the inner panel of the shell 1248 that defines
the proximal end of recess         1276.     A proximal extension of
each axial line through each bore 1276 intersects               the base
of the adjacent notch 1278.           Ring 1279    (one shown)   extend
outwardly from the panel that defines the base of
recess   1272.     There are two rings 1279.         Each ring 1279 is
located in     the wide portions at the ends of the recess            1272.
 [00346]     Not identified are the features          internal to distal
shell  1248 that facilitate        the holding of tool unit
controller     1290 in  the shell.        A number of these features
are similar to the features that hold the chassis 242 in
BMC 128.
 [00347]      Tool control unit 1290 of BCM 1200 includes a
chassis   1292 to which two circuit          boards 1310 and 1312 are
attached.      Chassis 1292 includes un upper         frame 1294    and a
lower frame 1302.       As chassis frames       1294 and 1302 are
generally similar in       structure      and function to chassis
frames 246 and 296,      respectively,       frames 1294 and 1296 will
not be described in      detail.      It   will however be noted that
upper frame 1294 is      formed with a web 1296 that has an
approximately      concave surface.        Three notches   1298,   (two
notches identified)      are formed in       the web.    Notches  1298   are
the spaces     in  which sensors 594 are disposed.          Lower
frame  1302 is     formed to have two legs 1304.          Legs 1304
extend perpendicularly         downward from the side beams of
frame 1302.       Legs 1304    are formed with opposed notches        1306
 (one notch identified)        that face each other.
 [00348]      Circuit board 1310 is        sandwiched between upper
frame 1294 and lower frame 1302.             Circuit board 1310 is      held
in  position between frames 1294           and 1302 in   the same general
manner in    which 296 in      the same circuit     board 244 is    held
between   frames 246 and 296.         Circuit board 1312     is  held in
                                       96

position by legs          1304 integral with the lower frame 1302.
More Particularly          the opposed top-to-bottom side edges of
circuit       board 1312    are di sposed in        notches 1306 internal     to
legs      -
          134
 [00349]         When BCM 1200     is   assembled,     the chassis is
positioned        so that the main portion of the chassis             1292 and
the attached circuit          board 1312        are located in   the barrel
portion of the housing void space.                   More specifically the
chassis       Is  positioned so that the sensor supporting web               1296
is    located below nacelle           1256.     The chassis 1292 is     further
positioned        so that circuit       board 1312 is     located immediately
proximal        to shell panel     1268.
 [00350]         Switch sensors 566 and 580 are mounted to circuit
board 132 .          Sensor  566 is     positioned to be the closer of
the two sensors to switch 1212.                  Sensor 580 is   the closer     oi
te      two sensors to switch 1210.
 [00351]         Disposed on circu       it  board 1312   are the tool unit
controller        1290 components       that,    in  response to the signals
emitted by sensors 566,            580 and 594 selectively        apply
energizatlon         signals to the tool unit power generating unit.
These are the signals           (currents)       sourced out over and sunk
back into the contact pins.                 As these components     are
generally identical to the components of tool unit
controller        530,  they are not redescribed.
 [00352]         From Figures 75,       75A and 76 it     is seen that
switches        1210  and 1212    are disposed in       a housing   1340.
Housing       1340 is   formed. from a single piece of sterilizable
plastic.         The housing 1340       has a front plate      1341.
Plate 1341        is  dimensioned to seat over the open end of. shell
         re 1266.     A tube 1342      extends proximally from
plate 1341.          A panel 1344      extends over the proximal        end of
tube 1342.          A post 1346 extends         inwardly from the distally
                                            9'7

directed surface of panel 1344          into the tube.         Below
post 1346 panel    1344 has a through hole 1348.
 [00353]    Switch housing 1340 has a head 1.35             .   Head 1350
extends away from the proximally directed               face of the
plate 1341.    The housing is     formed so that head 1350 is
located above tube 1342.       Head 1350 is         formed to have an
opening 1352 that extends downwardly from the top face of
post 1344.    Opening 1352,    in   cross section in          a plane
perpendicular    to the top to bottom axis through the opening
is  generally in   the shape of a flattened circle.               The
opening 1352 is    open to the distally directed              face of the
housing 1340.     The housing 1340       is    further formed so as to
have three indentations      1354 that extend outwardly             from the
opening 1352.
 [00354]    Housing 1340  is   further formed so a step 1355
extends into and circumferentially             around opening 1352.
There is   a space between tube 1342 and the bottom end of
step 1355.    Housing 1340 is     dimensioned to seat in            distal
shell recess 1266.
 [00355]    From Figure 77 it     is    seen that switch 1210
includes   a head 1358.   Head 1358         is  dimensioned to seat in
opening 1352 in    switch housing 1340.            Head 1358 is
dimensioned to have a center frame like structure                  (not
identified)   that defines a rectangular center opening 1360.
An arcuately   shaped ear 1362 extends outwardly               from the
opposed ends of the center structure.               Ear 1362 has a
lobe 1364   that,  in cross section is          generally     circular in
shape.   A number of tabs project downwardly from head 1358.
These tabs are dimensioned to seat in              the circular     opening
in  the housing defined by step 1354.              The tabs have
generally arcuate outer surfaces.              Two of the tabs,
tabs 1366 in   Figure 77 are static.            In  the arcuate     space
between  each tab 1366 there is         a tab 1368,      one seen in
                                     98

Figure 77.         Tabs 1368 are more flexible than tabs             1366.
Each tab 1368 has at the free end and outwardly directed
foot 1370.         Switch 1210 is    mounted to the housing 1340 by
snap fitting        the head 1358    in   opening     1352 so that tab
feet 1370 snap into the space below step 1355.
 [00356]         A stem 1372 projects      distally      forward from
head 1358.         A tab 1374 projects upwardly from the end of
stem 1372.
 [00357]         A magnet 1362 is    mounted in       opening  1362 internal
to switch head 1358.           The position of switch 1210 is            set by
rotating the switch so that lobe 1364                 seats in  one of the
indentations        1354  in  switch housing        1340.   The complementary
sensor,        sensor 580,   outputs the PWM TRG signal with a pulse
width,       duty cycle,    that varies with the orientation of the
magnet        1362 to the sensor.
 [00358]         Switch 1212 as seen in        Figure 78 includes      a
generally cylindrical barrel            1378.       A boss 1380 extends
outwardly from the proximal end of the barrel                  1378.
Boss 1380 is        formed with a closed end bore,           not identified.
Barrel 1378 is         formed to have a bore 1382 that extends
longitudinally through the barrel.                  Both boss 1380 and
bore 1382 are centered on longitudinal                 axes that are
parallel        to and offset   from the center longitudinal           axis
through the barrel 1378.            The outer surface of barrel 1378
is    formed with features,        not identified,        that extend
outwardly and inwardly from the curved outer surface of the
barrel.         These features    cooperate with complementary
features        of the switch assembly housing 140 to facilitate
the seating of the barrel in            the housing tube 13:42.          More
particularly,         the housing 1342 and switch barrel 1378 have
complementary         features  that hold the barrel in         the tube     1342
so that the barrel can move longitudinally in                  the tube while
preventing the rotation of the barrel.

             T
 [00359]       he distal     end of switch barrel      1378 extends
forward of housing front plate 1341.              A finger tab 1384
extends over the distal         end of the barrel.
 [00360]    As part of the process of assembling BCM 1200 a
magnet   1386 is    seated in    the bore internal to switch
boss 1380.      A spring 1388,      seen in   Figure 75A,    is   disposed
in   barrel bore 1382.        Spring 1388 is     disposed around pin
1346.    The proximal end of the spring           1388 seats     against the
distally   directed face of switch housing panel             1344 .    The
distal   end of the spring is        disposed against the surface
internal to the barrel that defines the distal               end of
bore 1382.      Spring    1388 thus exerts a force that normally
positions    the switch 1212 so that the switch is              normally
spaced distally      away from housing panel 1344.           The force
spring 1388 exerts of switch 121 can be overcome with finger
force.
 [00361]     Switch 1212 is      mounted to the rest      of the BCM 1200
so that magnet 1386 is         adjacent   sensor 566.     The ANATRG
signal output by sensor 566 thus            represents the extent to
which trigger switch 1212 has been depressed inwardly.
 [00362]    A latch assembly 1390,          the components of which are
identified in     Figures     65 and 79 releasably holds the tool
unit 124 in     nacelle bore 1257.        In  actuality there are two
latch assemblies        1390,  one on each side of the BCM 1200.
The latch assemblies 1390 are simultaneously actuated                  in
order to disconnect the tool unit            124  from the BCM 1200.
 [00363]    Each    latch assembly 1390 includes         a latch     1391.
The latches     1391 are designed to seat in          recess    1272
integral with the BCM housing.            Each   latch 1391     includes a
generally rectangularly         shaped tab 1392.       Each tab 1392       is
dimensioned to seat in         the one of the relatively         wide width
end portions of recess         1272.   Each tab 1392 is      formed to
                                      100

have a cross-shaped boss 1393 that extends inwardly from the
inner surface of the tab.
 [00364]    An arcuately shaped arm 1394 extends upwardly          from
latch tab 1392.      The arm 1394 is     dimensioned to fit   in the
curved portion of the shell recess 1272.           The arm 1394 is
formed to have a rib 1396 that extends across the arm.             The
rib 1396 is    located a short distance above tab 1392.
Rib 1396 is    shaped to have a bore 1397 that extends
proximally to distally      through the rib      Each arm 1394 is
further   formed to have,    at the end spaced from tab 1392,       a
downwardly directed finger 1398.          Latches 1391 are shaped so
that each arm finger 1398 will         seat in  and extend through
one-half the BCM housing opening 1274 into nacelle
bore 1257.
 [00365]    When BCM 1200 is     assembled,    the latches 1391 are
seated in    distal shell recess 1272.        on each side of the ECM
housing,   a pin 1402 extends through the housing bore 1276,
bore 1397 internal to the latch 1391 and the adjacent shell
notch 1278.     Pins 1402 thus pivotally hold each latch 1391
to the BCM housing.      A spring 1404 extends between the BCM
housing and each latch 1391.         Specifically,   one end the
spring 1404 seats in     the ring 1279 that extends up from the
surface of the housing that forms the base of the
recess 1272.     The opposed end of the spring seats over latch
boss 1393.     Each spring 1404 thus normally holds the
associated latch 1391 in      the locked state.      The locked   state
is  the state in    which the latch finger protrudes into the
nac ele  bore 1257.
 [00366]     Figure  80 depicts the main tube 1402 of a tool
unit 124 that is     used with BCM 1200.       Main tube 950 is
similar to previously described main tube 940 .          Both main
tubes 940 and 13402     form part of the housing or body of the
tool unit.     Main tube 1402    is  formed to have fin    1404 that
                                    101

extends outwardly from the surface of the cylindrical
portion of the tube.        in   a plane perpendicular to a radial
line extending out from the center of tube 1402,                  the fin
would appear to have a rectangular shape.                 Fin 1404 is
formed to have a ramp 1406.          The ramp 1406 is        located
inwardly from the opposed sides of the fin 1404.                   Main
tube 1402 is      formed so that extending       distally     from the
proximal    end of the fin 1402,      ramp extends outwardly away
from the center axis of the tube.          The fin 1404        is   to have a
pocket    1408.    Pocket 1408 is    located immediately forward of
the distal     end,   the highest portion of ramp 1406.             The
pocket    1408 is   generally rectangularly        shaped.     Pocket     1408
is  dimensioned to receive the free ends of both latch
fingers    1398.
 [00367]      A powered surgical tool assembly of this              invention
that includes BCM 1200        is  prepared for use by inserting the
tool unit in      the nacelle bore 1257.       As the tool unit main
tube 1402 is      slide in  the bore 1257.     Latch fingers        1398 ride
up on ramp 1406.        The manual insertion force is          enough to
overcome the force       imposed by springs      1404.      The latch arms
thus move from the locked position to a release/load
position.      As the tool unit is     moved proximally,          the tool
unit contacts      894 and 902 seat over the ECM contact pins
350.   As the tool unit becomes fully seated in               bore 1257,
main tube pocket       1408 goes into registration          with BCM
housing opening 1274.         Springs 1404 pivot the latches            1391
so that    latch fingers    1398   seat in the pocket        1408.    Thus,
the latch assemblies 1390 releasably hold the tool unit 124
to BCM    124.
 [00368]      When the tool unit 124 is      so positioned,
sensors    594 are located below the motor rotor 966.                The
sensors    594 thus generate signals representative               of the
rotation position       of the motor rotor 966.
                                     102

 [00369]       The practitioner           sets the operating mode of the
tool     unit tower generating uni                950 bv the setting of the
position of switch 1210 .               Given the flexibility          of ear 1363,
as the switch is           pivoted,     the lobe 1364 will move out- of and
seat in     each one of the indentations                 1354   formed in   switch
housing     1340 .      The seat     n    of tihe lobe 1364       in  an
indentat on 1 354 provides the pract it ioner with tact ile
feedback      that the switch Is           in   a particular      setting.
 [00370]       If    the power genera ting unit 950 iS               a motor,  it  is
possible to set          thne motor to run         in   forward direction;
reverse direction           or an oscillate          mode.    The setting of the
position of switch 1210 sets the orientation of magnet                         1362.
Sensor     58C outputs a PWM TRG signal representative                     of the
position      of swit ch 1210 .
 [00371]       IThe    practitioner       actuates the assembly by
depressing trigger             1212.    In   response to the result         change
of level of t-he ANATRG signal,                   the tool unit
controller        12 90 sources and sinks the energization                 signals
as approur:ate to the contact pins 350 connected to the
motor winding 954.               Depending of- the         setting of
switch     12        th    tool unit controller            1290,  in  energize tool
unit power generating unit step 1042,                      will source/sink
energize signals tco either run t-he motor rotor in                       a forward
direction,       a reverse direction or an oscillate                  mode.
 [00372]       When it      is   time to disconnect          the tool unit from
BCM 1200,      latch tabs 1392          are simultaneously depressed.
This results         in  the pivoting of latch             fingers 1398 out of
the pocket 1408 integral               with the tool unit main tube 1402.
'This tra   nsitioning of the latch               assemblies 1390      from the
locked positiLon to the release/load position allows the tool
unit to be removed. from the BCM nacelle 1256.
 [00373]       It    should thus be appreciated. that a further
feature of this          invention is        that a single tool unit can be
                                              ,U-3

used to forms different       tves     of tool assembliies.    Thus if     a
particul ar practitioner        prefers working with a pencil shaped
tool,    the tool unit can be coupled to a BCM such as BCM 128.
If    another practitioner prefers working with a pistol              shaped
tool, the samte tool unit can be attached to BCM 1200.
IV.          ALTERNATIVE     EMBODIMENTS
 [00374]     it    should be understood that the foregoing         is
directed to specific embodiments            of the invention and that
variations      from the described embodiments are possible.
 [00375]     For example while in         many versions of the
invention,      the battery and control module will contain
sensors that both monitor a switch attached to the module
and sensors that monitor at least             one operating stat-e or
condition of the handpiece,          this   is  not required in  all
versions    of the invention.        Some BCMs of this     invention may
only incl ude one or1 more sensors that generate            signals as a
function    of the user operated switch.           The tool controller
internal to these BCMs controls the sourcing/s i nki ng of
energization       signals as a function of       these sensor  signals.
Still    other BCMs of this      invention may only include one or
more sensors that generate signals as a fun action of the
sensed operating condition         or state of the attached tool
unit.     The tool control      er eternal      to these BCMs controls
tne sourcing/sinking        of energization      signal as a function or
these sensor signals.
 [00376]     Further,    in  versions     of the invention wherein       the
sensor or sensors internal         to the tool generate signals
based on switch state,        the switch may not always be attached.
to the BCM.        In some versions      of the invention the user
actuated    switch may be attached to the tool unit.
 [00377]     As mentioned     above the user control      may come      rrom
a foot switch unit or a voice control module.               In these

versions of the invent on,         to ensure that the assembly of
this invention remains cordless,          the battery and control
module includes receiver 7!80         (ge       )   The receiver 780
is  configured to receive either the signals,          which are
typical   v RF or optical signals,        from the remote  control
head.    This head may be eit      her a foot  switch assembly a
voice con trol box.        Receiver 780,   in response to tIe
received signal s,       outputs signals similar to t he ANA TRG and
PWM TRG sigras        the tool unit sensor circuIt 590 would
otherwise output      .   In versions of the invention in    which
receiver 780 is       present,   the trigger unit sensor circuit 590
may be omitted.         The structure of receiver 730 is    not part
of the present       invention.
 [00378]      It  is  further underst ood that in   al ternative
powered surgical tool assemblies of this invention,            the tool
power generating        unit may not always be a motor     et alone a
brushless DC motor.         In1 these versions of the invention
signals other than magnetic c flux may function as the signals
that are emitted by the tocl unit that are representative of
te   operating state or cn dt ion of the tool oower
generating unit.         Light may be one such signal.     For
example,   if    the tool uri t is   a laser, a set of light pipes
in  the tool unit and the RCM may serve as the conduits
through which a fraction of the light is          transmitted through
the tool unit housing and the BCM housing to a light
sensitive sensor internal to the BCM housing.            either
transparent- windows or exposed faces of these light pipes
would serve as the components of these housing through which
the signals are transmitted.           If the tool unit is  an
uIltrasonic vibrator,       tne signed may be a mechanicCa
vibration.       In these embodiments of the invention,      the tool
unit housing and the BCM housing may include cores that            are
flexibly mounted to the other components of the housings.

These cores serves         as the Paths through which the ultrasonic
vibrations are applied to a sensor internal to the BCM.
 [00379]       Alternatively      RF signals could be emitted by the
too     power generating unit.            These signals would vary as a
function     of operating state or condition of the tool.                    In
these versions of the invention,                  the tool unit    housing and
BCM housing  n      would both include at- least          components through
which these signals would not be at-tenuated or distorted to
the level at which operating of the BCM sensor/ sensors would
be adver sely affected.
 [00380]       Likewise,    even in     versions      of the invention     in
which the tool unit power generating unit is                     a motor,  the
signals emitted by the motor representative                    of motor state
may not be magnetic fields.               Irn some versions of        the
invention,       an optical encoder may emit light               that  represents
rotor position.          Again,   in'  these versions of the invention
the tool unit housing and BCM housing would both include a
component that is         esse  L ally      transparent to the wavelength
o    light   emitted or refe        cte d by the motor.
 [00381]       In   versions   of     he i nvention in      which Hall sensors
or other sensors         sensitive to magnetic field             strength such
as mane ti c-field        sensitive     resistors      are used to provide an
i.d'   caL' on of rotor position,           the sensor may not alway           be
in   the BCM housing.        These sensors could be in             the tool unit
housing.       It   should be understood that these versions of the
invention      tvoically wol          requ ire      additional   conductive
links between        the tool unit and the BCM in            order to be able
to forward the sensor signals to the drive controller                      770.
 [00382]       In   some versi ons of the invention            in  which the
tool unit power generating unit is                  a motor,   the tool unit
controll-ler      530 may not even use sensors to determine rotor
position.         Instead  drive controller          770 could determine
rotor position by measuring the back EMF signals developed.
                                          ,U06

across the one or more windings         594 through which the
current is    not be sourced.     Alternatively,    rotor position
could be determined based on inductance          sensing of rotor
position.     These methods of determining       rotor position rely
on measurements of the currents         through or voltages     across
the motor windings 594.        Applicant's US Pat.
No.  7,422, 582/PCT Pub.    No.  WO 2006/039331,    the contents      of
which are incorporated herein by reference,           discloses how
back EMF and inductance      sensing can be used to determine
rotor position.
 [00383]    The type of drive circuit        internal  to the battery
and control module is     a function of the power generating
unit to which the module applies energization           signals.      For
example if    the attached   tool unit requires     a variable
potential   DC energization     signal,   the drive circuit     may have
one or more bipolar transistors         that establish the potential
of this   signal.
Alternatively,    for some applications       the energization    signal
is  sourced from or is    regulated by a voltage controlled
oscillator.
 [00384]     in versions  of this    invention wherein tool unit
power generating     unit is   a motor,   the motor need not always
be a brushless    DC motor or even a DC motor.         Further,   the
motor may have one winding,       two windings or four or more
windings.      it should be understood that the number of
windings   the motor has directly establishes the number of
contact pins the BCM has that are connected to the windings.
Generally the BCM will have at least two contact pins.
However,   should there be four or more windings,           the BCM may
have four or more windings       over which energization       signals
are selectively    sourced/sunk to the tool unit power
generating unit.     Similarly,    the motor may have one,      two,
three or more than four magnets.

 [00385]            should though be appreciated that               in  versions
of the invention wherein the tool unit power generating unit
is  a brushless         DC motor that the BCM may not include any
sensors       In    these versions of the invention,              the driver
integral    with the tool controller will at least                    include a
driver wit h an appropriate e number of                 ETs or other      switc   to
selectively       tie    the contact pirns that extend to the motor               to
either the BAT+ terminal             (source current)        or the BAT
terminal     (sink current)
 [00386]      There is      no requirement that in           all  versions of
te   i nven t ion the BCM rely on calibration                data from a memory
integ--a    with the tool unit               Similarly,     there i s no
requirement that in          all   version        of t he invention the BCM
write tool use data into a memory integral wit'h the tool
unit.
 [00387]      In    some versions       of this     invention,    the tool unit
may include both the power              generating unit and the energy
applicator.         In   these versions of the invention there would
be no need to provide the tool unit with a cou-pling assembly
to releasablv hold the energy a-pplicator                   to the rest     of the
tool    n
 [00388]      Further,      the latch assembly is          understood to be
exemplary and not limiting.                In    alternative versions       of the
invention,      the moving release components of the latch
assembly may be part of the tool                  unit instead of part of the
battery and control module.                Still    in  other versions      of the
invention,      the latch assembly may not have any manual.
actuated components.             For example,       the latch assembly       could
cons.st of complementary threading on the housings of the
tool unit     and battery and control module.                  Alternatively,
these latch components may be components that                     form a
releasable      friction     or compression fit          between the tool. unit
and. the battery and control module.                   Alternatively,      spring
                                             H0

loaded comoonents attached to the tool unit or battery and
control module are moved to a release state by a rotational
movement          of one or both the housings,               In  some versions ot
toe invention,                 the electrical contact s that provide the
conductive oaths between the tool unit and battery and
control module function as the latching components that hold
tle    Lw o unit               other.
 [00389]             The circuits of this invention may vary from what
has been described.                    For example in versions of the
invention in               which there Is      only a single trigger switch,
both described sensor 566 and 580 may be provided.                           In these
versions of the invention the second sensor,                        typically bt
not always sensor 580 would pro-vide a redundant sensor
indicating the extent to which the switch was actuated.
Further,          there is          no limit to the number of switch sensors
incorporated into a BCM of ths                       in mention.   For safety
purposes          it      may be desirable to always provide two            sensors
to monitor the actuation                    of the on/off switch.       One sensor
each would be provided to monitor the states of the
remna       ig       switches.
 [00390]             Lkewise it          should be understood that 'the sensors
that remotely monitor sensor actuation need not always be
Halls sensors.                  F'o-r example,  assuming the sensor includes a
magnetized             component,        the sensor could be a magnetoresistive
transducer.
 [00391]             Further in        pencil shaped assemblies of this
invention,             it    is   desirable that the rechargeable       cell   38 and
tool unit partially                   overlap,  this    not need always be the
case.          1n    some versions of the invention,             the tool unit and
BCM may be arranged                   so that tool unit and cell are in        a
tandem arrangement.
 [00392]             Similarly,        in  alternative    embodiments of the
invention,             alternative        contacts may provide electrical
                                                109,

connections          between     the    tool     unit        and     the    battery        and
control unit. For example, the BCM contacts could simply
be     plates      fixedly    mounted     to    the      BCM      housing.         In   these
versions of the invention, the tool unit may have spring
biased or otherwise moveably contacts positioned to abut
the BCM contacts. Alternatively, one or both of the tool
unit       and   BCM    may  have     contacts        that       are     flexible.         For
example, either the tool unit or BCM with flexible spring
resilient          contacts.     The    other      of    the      BCM      or    tool    unit
would         have    static    blade      like        contact.           These        static
contacts         press   against      the   resilient            contact         to    ensure
good physical abutment between each pair of complementary
contacts.
 [00393]          Further    while     the    invention            is    described         as
being a powered tool assembly for use to perform medical
and surgical procedures, including diagnostic procedures,
its application is not so limited. Alternative embodiments
of     this     invention      may    include       tool      units        designed        for
purposes          other    than     performing           medical          and       surgical
procedures.
 [00394]          Further    in   versions       of    the     invention           in   which
the BCM includes one or more sensor for monitoring switch
state or the tool unit, the sensors may not be in the void
space        in  which    the   cells     and     tool       unit      controller          are
located.          Instead     these     sensors         may       be    in      their      own
cavities within the housing.
 [00395]          Likewise the dynamic seal of this invention that
holds the contact pins               350 to the BCM housing that allows
some       pin   movement     while     providing          a   barrier         around      the
pins        may     have    uses     beyond       that        disclosed             in   this
application.
 [00396]          Accordingly, the amended claims cover all such
variations          and  modifications         that        come       within       the   true
spirit and scope of this invention.
 [000397]         While various embodiments of the present
                                          110

Thus,       the present invention should not be limited by any
