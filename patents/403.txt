            The entire content of the complete specification of Australian patent
   application no. <removed-apn> as originally filed is incorporated           herein by
 5 reference.
           The present invention relates to the field of detectors designed for
   detection of unauthorised objects or substances in a protected access zone.
            Today it seems necessary to reliably control attempts at introducing or
   removing some products, for example but not exclusively explosive substances,
10 to or outside of a sensitive zone.
            The pertinent problem covers a very wide range of situations which
   especially encompass and not limitedly attempts to introduce products to a
   protected zone, such as a shop, a school, a train station, a public or private
   institution, or the attempt to remove products to outside a defined perimeter,
15 for example in the event of theft from a company or on a protected site.
             It eventuates these days that individuals who try to fraudulently remove
   a product from a protected zone or who try to introduce such a product, often
   use shoes to conceal the product in question.
            This phenomenon seems due essentially to the fact that this zone is not
20 easy to control visually or by manual handling.
            The applicant has already proposed devices of the type illustrated in the
   attached figure 1, which comprise a frame 1 having:
   - a support base 10 formed by a rectangular tray in the form of a step whereof
   the plane upper surface comprises a diagram or footprint 12 and a stop 14
25 intended to meet and position a single foot of an individual covered by a shoe,
   - two symmetrical lateral panels 20 which house detection means, and
   - an information module 30.
             Examples of the device illustrated      in figure 1 are mentioned      in
   documents FR 2860631, EP 1574879, FR 2889338 and FR 2911212.
30          The abovementioned detection means described in those documents can
   be formed from windings for detection of metals, sampling means, for example
   in the form of suction nozzles, for the sampling of steam or traces of particles,
   for example narcotics or explosives, analysis means based on nuclear magnetic

                                            2
   resonance comprising for example Helmholtz coils, or even analysis means of
   complex impedances or detectors of radioactive radiation.
            Despite the progress contributed by the devices described in the above
   documents, on some sensitive sites there is still a restriction on inviting people
 5 leaving the site or accessing the site to remove their shoes so as to try to
   improve inspection. But despite constraints and discomfort resulting from such a
   situation, visual examination of the removed shoe does not always fully secure
   inspection. The personnel involved cannot in fact determine if an object or a
   substance is camouflaged in an internal cavity not directly accessible to the
10 shoe, especially the sole of the latter.
            The present invention provides a detector device for detection of
   unauthorised objects or substances, comprising a support base designed to
   receive at least one foot covered by its shoe, of an individual to be controlled,
   and measurement means of the electrical capacity formed by the sole of a shoe
15 placed on the support base.
            The preferred embodiments of the present invention provide novel
   means for improving the reliability of detection of objects, products or
   substances likely to be camouflaged in a shoe.
            According to advantageous characteristics of preferred embodiments of

   detection means of vertical stratification, on the basis of a signal representative
10 of the estimated height of the sole,

   the support base,
   - said handles comprise electrodes,
   - an electric generator is provided,      placed in series of said handles and
15 electrodes placed on the support base,
   - the electric generator is adapted to generate voltage of the order of 1 volt,
   - the microwave sender means and the associated microwave receiver means
   placed respectively on either side of the sole of the shoe are adapted to
   detection on receiver means of the signal coming from a sender means placed
20 directly opposite and of the signal coming from sender means placed obliquely
   relative to the receiver means,
   - the device comprises several series of detection means, each comprising
   several detection means distributed geographically similarly for all said series of
   detection means,
25 - the support base comprises a tray in the form of a step coated with a shoe
   positioning marker and two lateral panels,
   - the base is preferably adapted to receive a single foot of the individual being
   tested,
   - the device also comprises auxiliary analysis means selected in the range
30 comprising metal-detection windings, sampling means of steam or traces of

   complex impedance and/or radio-active radiation detector means.

                                              4

   band sole, measurement of the height of the sole by means of capacitive means
   or by analysis of an image taken by an imaging system, detection of vertical
   stratification of a sole by detection of microwave reflections injected vertically
   into the sole.

15           Figures 2 and following show the general structure of a device as per the
   documents described previously FR 2860631, EP1574879, FR 2889338 and FR
   2911212. For this reason, the general structure of the device shown in figures 2
   and following will not be described in detail hereinbelow.
             It is recalled however that figures 2 and following show a device
20 comprising a frame 100 comprising:
   - a support base 110 formed by a rectangular tray in the form of a step whereof
   the plane upper surface comprises a diagram 112 and a stop 114 intended to
   receive and position a single foot covered by a shoe,
   - two lateral panels symmetrical 120 which house detection means, and
25 - an information module 130.
            The device shown in figures 2 and following can be congruous as to its
   geometry, its dimensions, the outline of the positioning marker 112, the stop
   114, the nature of messages displayed on the module 130, the arrangements
   described in the abovementioned documents.
30          The same applies for any accessories of the type of random sorting
   means of individuals subjected to analysis, frequencies used for detecting
   metals and/or any sensor for placing a shoe on the diagram 112 or again
   installation of a foot against the two panels 120 to initiate processing.

                                            7
            Without this arrangement being limiting, such detection means of the
   installation of a shoe in the device 100, more precisely on the marker 112,
   against the stop 114, can be formed by a plurality of photoelectric cells 102,
   104 arranged respectively opposite on the two panels 120 such that an optical
 5 beam emitted by an emitting cell 102 in the direction of an opposite receiving
   cell 104 is interrupted during the placing of a foot.
            As is evident in figures 2 and following, the device in accordance with
   the invention also comprises additional detection means 140, 150 and 160 on
   the support base 110.
10          More precisely according to the embodiment of the invention illustrated
   in figures 2 and following, microwave sender/receiver means 140 are provided
   at the level of the junction interface between the upper surface of the support
   base 110 and the lateral panels 120, for measuring transmission time and
   measuring absorption, associated with infrared sender/receiver means 150 for
15 measuring the width of the part of the shoe inserted in between the microwave
   sender/receiver means 140.
            Capacitive measuring means 160 are also preferably provided. These
   com prise electrodes 162 placed at the level of the footprint 112 and electrodes
   166 placed in the upper part of the panels 120. They will be defined in more
20 detail hereinbelow.
            The structure of the microwave sender/receiver means 140 will be
   described first.
            As shown in figure 3, microwave sender means 142 are preferably
   provided of a side of the base 110 in the lower part of a panel 120 and
25 associated microwave receiver means 144 on the side opposite the base, that
   is, in the lower part of the second lateral panel 120.
            The sender means 142 and the receiver means 144 respectively
   associated are aligned horizontally.
            The frequency of microwaves emitted by the senders 142 is preferably
30 in the range of 5GHz to 30GHz, advantageously in the range of 12GHz to
   20GHz.
             Even more precisely, according to the invention several senders 142 and
   several receivers 144 are preferably provided, respectively associated in pairs,
   distributed at the base of panels 120 over the depth of the device.

                                              8
            According to the invention, a plurality of microwave senders 142 and
   microwave receivers 144 is preferably provided adapted to cover three zones
   separate respectively corresponding to the heel, the arch and the front sole of a
   shoe.
 5          According to the particular embodiment shown in the attached figures,
   six senders 142 of a side of the base and six associated receivers 144 on the
   side opposite the base are provided. The senders are referenced 142a to 142f
   and the receivers are referenced 144a to 144f in figure 12.
            The six senders 142 and six receivers 144 are distributed in the form of
10 an aligned horizontal row 145, 146. If needed, as illustrated in figure 4 at least
   two superposed rows 145 and 146 can be provided, each comprising a plurality
   of senders 142, respectively receivers 144, for example two rows 145 of six
   senders 142 and two rows 146 of six receivers 144.
            The distribution of the initiation of microwave elements associated with
15 respective focusing cones 149 forming respectively sender 142 of a side of the
   base and receiver 144 on the opposite side can be ensured by adapted
   switches.
            The expert will understand that microwaves emitted by a sender 142 of
   a side of the base passes through the sole of a shoe placed on the footprint 112
20 before reaching a receiver 144 placed opposite.
            The dielectric characteristics of the sole inserted in between a sender
   142 and a receiver 144 influence the transmission time of microwaves and the
   absorption of the latter.
            Analysis of the delay between the emission by a sender 142 and receipt
25 at the associated receiver 144, and the amplitude of microwaves received at a
   receiver 144 relative to the reference emitted by the associated sender 142, can
   show the dielectric characteristics of the inserted sole.
            Comparison with cartography of reference materials and analysis of the
   delay and amplitude of microwaves received on a receiver 144 can characterise
30 the nature of the product comprising the sole of the relevant shoe.
            In particular, explosives having a characteristic signature in transmission
   time and absorption can be characterised.
            Control of microwave senders 142 and microwave receivers 144,
   analysis of the delay in transmission at the level of each receiver 144 and the

                                            9
   abovementioned comparison, can be done by a processor referenced 180 in
   figure 12. Thisfigure 12 shows at 182 a memory associated with the processor
   180 which contains the preset cartography of reference materials.
            As shown in figure 3, the analysis method can take into account the
 5 microwaves received directly by a receiver cone 149 placed rigorously opposite
   a sender 142 (shown at < D n in figure 3), but also as an option the microwaves
   coming from an oblique sender cone 142 (shown at          0 n in figure 3).
            This arrangement in accordance with the invention intended to take into
   account on a receiver 144 not only the signal of a sender 142 placed directly
10 opposite, but also the signal coming from sender means 142 placed obliquely
   relative to the receiver means 144, applies not only for oblique receiver means
   in the horizontal direction, but also for oblique receiver means in the vertical
   direction.
            Inclusion of the signal coming from an oblique sender means in the
15 vertical direction, that is, coming from sender means located at a height
   different to the obliquely associated receiver means, or at a height greater than
   that of the receiver means or at a height lower than latter, produces information
   on the height of the sole of the shoe being tested. In fact not only when the sole
   has a height less than that of the sender 142 and receiver 144 couples aligned
20 horizontally which are the highest, these high receivers 144 receive a direct
   signal different to the direct horizontal signal received by lower receivers 144,
   but also the associated pairs of obliquely vertical sender 142 and receiver 144
   couples generate a signal proportional to the height of the sole being tested,
   since the volume of substance of the sole inserted in between such an oblique
25 sender 142 and receiver 144 vertically depends directly on the height of the
   sole.
            As indicated previously in terms of the invention, as illustrated in figures
   5 and 12, measuring means of the width of the element S inserted in between a
   microwave sender element 142 and a microwave receiver element 144 are also
30 provided.
            These width-measuring means are preferably formed based on infrared
   sender/receiver means.

                                           10
            In terms of the invention, as illustrated in figure 5 a plurality of pairs
   151 of sender means 152 and receivers respectively associated 154 is provided,
   to each side of the base 110.
            In other terms a first pair of infrared transducers is provided for
 5 example comprising sender means 152 and respectively associated receiver
   means 154 on a first side of the base 110, and opposite, a second pair of
   transducers infrared comprising other sender means 152 and other respectively
   associated receiver means 154 on the second side opposite the base 110.
            The device also comprises analysis means of the two-way time of
10 infrared between a sender 152 and the associated receiver 154. The infrared
   emitted by a sender 152 is reflected on the external surface of the sole S before
   being recovered by the adjacent associated receiver 154. The analysis means of
   the two-way time of the infrared between a sender 152 and the associated
   receiver 154 are preferably formed by the processor 180.
15          The associated infrared senders 152 and infrared receivers 154 are
   preferably placed on a card 156 transparent to microwaves, placed opposite the
   exit mouth of the abovementioned cones 149.
          Preferably, the gap of infrared senders 152/receivers 154, that is, the
   distance separating two such pairs of senders 152 and receivers 154, is identical
20 to that of microwave senders 142/receivers 144.
          In other terms, an infrared sender 152/receiver 154 couple associated
   respectively with each microwave sender 142 and each microwave receiver 144
   is preferably provided to each side of the base 110.
            Even more precisely the infrared senders 152/receivers 154 couples
25 preferably have the same distribution as the pairs of microwave senders
   142/receivers 144. Typically, a pair of infrared senders 152/receivers 154 is
   provided opposite each pair of microwave senders 142/receivers 144. This
   arrangement ensures that the zone targeted by a pair of infrared senders
   152/receivers 154 is the same as that for a pair of respectively associated
30 microwave senders 142/receivers 144 and consequently allows simple, reliable
   and rigorous correlation between the information coming from a pair of infrared
   senders 152/receivers 154 and that coming from             a pair of respectively
   associated microwave senders 142/receivers 144.

                                               11
             Six pairs of senders 152 and receivers 154 are preferably provided on a
   first side of the sole and six pairs of senders 152 and receivers 154 opposite on
   the second side opposite the sole.
             The infrared senders are referenced 152a to 1521 and the infrared
 5 receivers are referenced 154a to 1541 in figure 12.
             Given the width of the sole S inserted in between a microwave sender
   142 and the associated microwave receiver 144, via infrared measurement, the
   device in accordance with the invention can undertake standardisation per size
   unit of the transmission delay and amplitude of the microwave signal received
10 on a receiver 144.
             The abovementioned standardisation can be done by the processor 180.
             In other terms, before standardisation a zone A of a sole having a
   double width of a zone B, of identical material, in principle has a transmission
   delay and double attenuation of the zone B. After measuring of the widths of
15 zones A and B and standardisation of delay and absorption, having material
   identical, the two zones A and B will all the same have identical characteristics
   in terms of transmission delay of microwaves and absorption.
             Also, zones A and C of a sole formed at least in part of different
   materials and therefore having different properties in terms of microwave
20 transmission, for example in the case of a zone C housing an unauthorised
   object, will have different responses as to transmission delay and absorption.
             This is illustrated in figures 9 to 11.
             Figure 9a schematically illustrates the profile of a shoe sole S formed
   from homogeneous material.
25           Figure 9b illustrates the transmission time curve measured by means of
   microwave senders 142/receivers 144, while figure 9c illustrates the absorption
   curve measured by means of the same microwave sender 142/receiver 144
   means when the abovementioned shoe sole S is inserted in between the sender
   means 142 and the receiver means 144. Since the sole S is made of
30 homogeneous material, logically the curves of figures 9b and 9c are overall
   homothetic with the thickness of material of the sole traversed by the
   microwaves.
             Figure 9d illustrates the measurement curve of width obtained by means
   of infrared sender/receiver means on the sole S.

                                             12
            Figures 9e and 9f illustrate curves of transmission time and absorption
   based on the curves of figures 9b and 9c, but after standardisation per size unit
   on the basis of the curve of figure 9d. As is evident from figures 9e and 9f, since
   the material of the sole S is homogeneous the standardised curves of figures 9e
 5 and 9f are overall constant.
            Standardisation easily determines that the sole is made of homogeneous
   material.
            Figure 10 illustrates views respectively similar to figure 9 for a different
   profile of shoe sole. The profile of transmission delay and absorption curves
10 shown in figures 10b and 10c differ consequently from figures 9b and 9c and
   overall remain homothetic to the thickness of material of the sole traversed by
   the microwaves.
            But in the case of a sole composed of homogeneous material, as is
   evident in figures 10e and 10f, the standardised transmission delay and
15 absorption curves return to constant amplitude.
            Figure 11 illustrates views respectively similar to figure 9 for a shoe sole
   which houses an unauthorised body C having delay characteristics of microwave
   transmission and microwave absorption different to that comprising the sole S.
            From comparative examination of figures 11b and 1le, respectively 11c
20 and 11 f, it is clear that standardisation clearly reveals any anomaly due to the
   presence of the unauthorised body C. Comparison of the amplitudes of resulting
   standardised curves with a library of pre-recorded characteristics of preferred
   specific products identifies these products.
            Information available on the receivers 144 also detects microwave
25 echoes sent back horizontally to interfaces of the sole and detects stratifications
   formed by juxtaposition in the horizontal direction of layers of materials having
   different properties with respect to the propagation of microwaves, resulting for
   example in the presence of pockets within the sole.
            As indicated previously, according to the invention measurement means
30 160 of the thickness of the sole of the shoe are preferably also provided.
            According to a first variant in accordance with the invention, these
   measuring means 160 are of capacitive type.

                                             13
            As illustrated in figure 6, according to the invention electrodes 162 are
   preferably provided on the upper surface of the footprint 112, flush with the
   upper surface of the footprint 112 or slightly projecting above this footprint 112.
            Even more precisely, different distinct zones of electrodes 162 are
 5 preferably provided coinciding as to their location on the depth of the device
   with the different microwave detection zones. At least six electrode zones 162
   are preferably provided distributed over the depth of the base 110.
            This arrangement ensures that the zone located opposite an electrode
   162 is the same as that for a pair of respectively associated microwave senders
10 142/receivers 144 and consequently enables simple, reliable and rigorous
   correlation between information coming from           capacitive measurement      of
   thickness and that coming from a pair of respectively associated microwave
   senders 142/receivers 144.
            Each electrode 162 can be formed by a plurality of points or an
15 equivalent form, for example in the form of pins.
            But each electrode 162 preferably has an annular form            coaxially
   enclosing the cone 174 of a microwave sender 172, the function of which will be
   explained hereinbelow, as illustrated in figure 6.
            The electrodes in the form        of a ring 162 are isolated from      the
20 abovementioned cones of the microwave senders 172 so as not to disrupt the
   respective measurements of these different means.
            By way of non-limiting       example the external dimensions of the
   electrodes 162 can typically be of the orderof 30 mm x 30 mm, whilethewidth
   of the cones 174 at the level of their greatest width is between 10 and 15 mm,
25 the interval between the electrodes 162 and the cones being at least equal to
   1 mm.
            The device also comprises an electric generator          164, typically a
   generator of alternating current, shown in figure 7, connected by means of an
   interrupter 165 in series of the abovementioned electrodes 162 and handles 166
30 forming electrodes provided on the upper surfaces of the lateral panels 120 and
   intended to be held by an individual being tested.
            The electrodes 162 provided at the level of the footprint 112 and the
   handles 166 forming electrodes provided at the level of the upper surfaces of
   the lateral panels 120 can form the object of many variant embodiments. They

                                           14
   can be formed by adapted electrically conductive ranges, for example metallic
   ranges or all equivalent means. According to a particular embodiment these
   electrodes are formed by material comprising electrically conductive particles,
   for example nanotubes, integrated to form electrodes. Such a realisation of
 5 electrodes 166 by integration of electrically conductive particles in the mass of
   the lateral panels 120, and not in the form of a metallic element superposed on
   the upper edge of the panels 120, ensures the individuals being tested who are
   asked to place their hands on the panels 120 by avoiding giving them the
   sentiment of contacting ranges placed under electrical voltage.
10          The electric generator 164 is adapted to emit alternating voltage
   typically of between 0.1V and 10V, advantageously of the order of 1 volt, at an
   impedance of 10kQ and at a frequency preferably be tween 1 and 10kHz.
            The invention is not however limited to this particular voltage value, or
   frequency.
15          The capacity defined between the electrodes 162 and 166 depends
   essentially on the height or thickness of the sole of the shoe. The value of the
   impedance of this capacity shown by the sole is also high relative to that of the
   human body inserted in between the same electrodes 162 and 166.
            The interrupter 165 is closed when the aim is to perform measurements.
20          The measurement of the capacity between both the electrodes 162
   provided on the upper surface of the base 110 and therefore subjacent to the
   lower surface of a sole and also the electrodes 166 provided on the upper
   surfaces of the panels 120, on which the hands of the user being tested rest,
   can be taken by any appropriate means 167 known to the expert, linked to the
25 processor 180. This measurement determines the capacity of the sole and
   consequently its thickness.
            Typically this measurement can be done by measuring the voltage at the
   terminal of resistor 168 placed in series of electrodes 162 and 166, in a dividing
   bridge, by means of an analog/digital converter integrated into the means 167.
30 Since the impedance of the human body is very low relative to that due to the
   capacity of the sole, the voltage sampled at the terminals of the resistance 168
   is directly representative of the height of the sole.

                                            15
            Given the thickness of the sole, this refines the reliability of the
   characterisation of the material analysed from the microwave sender/receiver
   means 140.
            Of course, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments
 5 which have just been described, but extends to any variant in accordance with
   its essence.
            Preferably as illustrated in figure 8 the device in accordance with the
   present     invention   also   comprises   means    170   based    on   microwave
   senders/ receivers, adapted to detect microwave echoes of microwaves em itted
10 vertically under the footprint 112, in the direction of the foot of an individual.
            In figure 8 171 is referenced as a support layer of a laminate adapted to
   resist any type of heel or sole TS, 172 a microwave sender adapted to emit
   microwaves vertically upwards, 174 an associated guide cone, 162 an electrode
   previously described used for capacitive measuring, P the foot of an individual
15 and Ti the rod of the shoe.
            The means 172 alternatively forms sender and receiver or alternatively
   a couple of adjacent senders and receivers associated with each cone 174 can
   be provided. The receiver means integrated in this way detect microwave
   echoes on the different interfaces or stratifications resulting from vertical
20 stacking of successive layers having different propagation properties with
   respect to microwaves, between the lower surface of the sole or heel TS and the
   upper surface of the sole which corresponds to the lower surface of the foot P.
            The means 170 detect the presence of pockets or particular material
   within the mass of the sole or heel TS.
25          The frequency of microwaves emitted by the senders 172 is preferably
   in the range of 5GHz to 30GHz, advantageously in the range of 12GHz to
   20GHz. It is advantageously separate from the frequency of the sender means
   142.
            Even more precisely, according to the invention several senders 172 and
30 receivers are preferably provided respectively associated in pairs, distributed
   under the footprint 112 over the depth of the device.
            According to the invention, a plurality of microwave senders 172 and
   receivers is preferably provided associated and adapted to cover respectively at

                                            16
   least three separate zones corresponding to the heel, the arch and the front
   sole of a shoe.
            According to a preferred embodiment, six senders 172 are provided
   distributed over the length of the footprint 112.
 5          The associated senders 172 and receivers can be aligned or be arranged
   according to any other modality, for example alternately, to optimally cover all
   ranges of size of existing shoe soles.
            Preferably distribution of the senders/receivers 172 over the depth of
   the device is also identical to that of the senders 142 and receivers 144, such
10 that the zone of a sole covered by a sender/receiver 172 assembly on the depth
   of the device is the same as that covered by a sender 142/receiver 144
   assem bly.
            This arrangement      ensures that the zone targeted      by a pair of
   sender/receivers 172 working in vertical direction for measurement in thickness
15 of the sole is the same as that for a pair of respectively associated microwave
   senders 142/receivers 144 and consequently enables simple, reliable and
   rigorous correlation between information coming from a pair of sender/receivers
   172 and that coming from a pair of respectively associated microwave senders
   142/receivers 144.
20          The exploitation of signals coming from the senders/receivers 172 can
   form the object of many embodiments.
            According to    a first  embodiment,     the signals coming   from   the
   senders/receivers 172 are compared to a signal representative of measurement
   of the thickness of the sole, for example the signal representative of the
25 thickness of the sole obtained by means of the electrodes 162 and of the
   corresponding     capacitive   measurement.    It   can  however    be  a  signal
   representative of the thickness of the sole obtained by any other means.
            The sender/receiver 172 assemblies detect echoes sent back by the
   interfaces of substance resulting from vertical stacking within the sole and
30 detect the height of these interfaces by measuring the transmission and receipt
   time of these echoes.
            The main echo is that produced by the lower surface of the foot which
   corresponds to the upper surface of the sole.

                                              17
            Initial direct comparison of the time of receipt of this main echo with the
   sole thickness signal obtained by capacitive measurement produces a first
   simple test.
            In fact for a sole of minimal thickness, the system expects the receipt of
 5 a main echo on the lower surface of the foot, after a short transmission and
   reflection time.
            Inversely for a sole of considerable thickness, the system expects the
   receipt of a main echo on the lower surface of the foot, after a longer
   transmission and reflection time.
10          But if the system detects, while the capacitive measurement indicates a
   sole of considerable thickness, a main echo after a short transmission and
   reflection time, the presence of a pocket or a foreign body within the sole can
   be suspected.
            Standardisation of receipt times of the echoes on the receivers 172 as a
15 function of the thickness of the sole makes detection of anomaly on a sole easy.
            The expert will in fact understand from examination of attached figures
   20, 21 and 22 that if it can be difficult before standardisation to exploit the
   receipt time of different echoes, since as this appears in figures 20c, 21c and
   22c, the real instants of receipt of echoes are influenced at the same time by
20 the thickness of the sole and by the defects of evenness of the sole, after
   standardisation as a function of the height of the sole, and therefore once the
   time of receipt of echoes freed of the influence of the height of the sole, the
   temporal distribution of the echoes is directly representative of the vertical
   constitution of the sole.
25          Comparison      of figures 20d,   21d and 22d shows in fact that the
   convergence of the first echoes 1 e, in principle of low am plitude, resulting from
   reflection on the lower surface of the sole, and expected main echoes ep is
   easy. From there parasite echoes epa resulting from vertical stratification of the
   sole, due for exam ple to the presence of a pocket or a foreign body, can also be
30 easily detected.
            In effect, for example figures 21c and 22c show that parasite echoes
   epa can be combined with a main echo ep, before standardisation. But figures
   21d   and 22d show that after standardisation           parasite echoes epa are
   distinguished clearly from a main echo ep.

                                             18
             As illustrated in figures 2 and following, the device in accordance with
   the invention can also be fitted with a device 190 for taking photos, for example
   a camera, linked to a lighting system          192 for refining monitoring of the
   positioning of the foot on the base.
 5           Such a camera can store a photograph of each shoe tested and in this
   way improve a database stored with characteristics of shoes, specific to
   improving the reliability of later measurements.
             It can also be used to aid measurement of the geometry of the sole, in
   particular of the width of the sole, and contribute to improving the reliability of
10 detection.
             Measurement of sole width obtained by pixel processing of the image
   sampled by the camera can be used by replacing measuring of the sole width
   performed by infrared the senders 152/receivers 154, or as a complement to
   the latter.
15           It has also been noted experimentally that some support interface plates
   making up the upper surface of the base 110 generate a significant echo on the
   vertical waves generated by the senders 172, likely to complicate analysis of
   signals obtained leaving the associated receivers.
             To simplify signal processing and avoid energy losses due to these
20 echoes and therefore improve measurement precision, in terms of the present
   invention it is also proposed to add an adapter for coupling of waves emitted by
   the senders 172, in said plate support 171.
             Such an adapter is preferably formed from an assembly of blocks 310 in
   the form of a pyramid inserted respectively in each cone 174 of a sender 172.
25           The different pyramids 310 are preferably made of material on a
   common plate 171.
             The arrangement of pyramids 310 on the plate 171 must of course
   respect the arrangement and distribution of the cones 174. So according to the
   illustration given in the attached figures 17 to 19 six aligned pyramids are
30 provided arranged according to spacing identical to that of the senders 172 and
   associated cones 174. This alignment arrangement is however not imperative,
   the essential being that the distribution of pyramids respects that of the cones
   174.

                                            19
            The pyramids 310 and the plate 171 can be made by moulding, for
   example of polytetrafluoroethylene or polystyrene.
            As per figures 17 to 19 the pyramids 310 are more precisely formed on
   a sub-assembly of plate support 171 whereof the contour reproduces the
 5 geometry of a sole and serves as footprint 112 to impose precise positioning of
   the shoe. The invention is not however limited to this precise arrangement.
            The points of the pyramids 310 are directed towards the senders 172. In
   this way the microwaves emitted by the senders 172 penetrate almost without
   reflection in the pyramids 310 by progressive coupling and spread in the
10 latter, pass through the plate support 171, then reach the superposed sole.
            According to the invention, the device can also comprise auxiliary
   detection means such as metal-detection windings, sampling means of steam or
   traces of particles, for example narcotics or explosives, especially based on
   suction nozzle, means by nuclear magnetic resonance, especially based on
15 Helmholtz coils, analysis means of complex impedance and detector means of
   radio-active radiation. These additional measurement and detection means are
   shown under reference 200 in figure 12.
            The combination of transversal or horizontal measurement obtained by
   means of the transducers 142, 144 and 152, 154 on the one hand and of the
20 measurement in height or vertical obtained by means of the transducers 170 on
   the other hand, or by capacitive measurement or even by any equivalent means
   for example by analysis of the image taken by the camera 190, produces
   information on the volume of the base of the relevant shoe.
            The combination of all the information obtained in terms of the invention
25 also considers the large disparity of structures, com positions and geometries of
   commercially available shoes.
            The expert understands in fact that all information obtained in terms of
   the invention (measurement of the microwave absorption amplitude by a
   horizontal band of the sole or of the propagation time of microwaves in such a
30 horizontal band sole by way of means 142/144, measurement of the width of
   the corresponding horizontal band of sole by way of means 152/154 or 190,
   measurement of the height of the sole by way of capacitive means 162/166 or
   means 172/174), can be brought together and compared, at least in pairs, or
   even in their entirety to improve the reliability and coherence of results

                                            20
   obtained, both as relates to the basic generation of detection of an anomaly and
   to providing more exact information relative the location, importance, geometry
   and nature of an obvious anomaly.
            Execution of the present invention described previously in the context of
 5 a device whereof the bases have previously been described in documents FR
   2860631, EP1574879, FR 2889338 and FR2911212, comprising a support base
   10 formed by a step whereof the upper surface comprises a footprint 12 and a
   stop 14 intended to receive and position a single foot of an individual covered
   by a shoe.
10         But the invention is not limited to this particular embodiment. As shown
   in attached figure 23, the present invention can also apply to devices in which
   the support base is adapted to receive simultaneously the two feet P of an
   individual.
            In this case it is however preferable, for allow detection respectively and
15 individually on each of the two feet Pof an individual being tested, to provide in
   projection on the upper surface of the base three blocks 320, 330 and 340
   between which the two feet P must be positioned such that the central block
   330 is placed between the two feet P, while the two lateral blocks 320 and 340
   are arranged respectively on the exterior of the feet. The central block 330
20 houses detection means associated respectively with the blocks 320 and 340 to
   allow the abovementioned different measurements respectively on each of the
   two feet P. In this way the central block 330 in this case preferably houses
   sender means 142/receivers 144 for measuring the absorption amplitude of
   microwaves and time of propagation, as well as infrared transducers 152/154
25 for measuring the width of each of the two soles S separately.

   context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as
   "comprises" and "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a
   stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any
