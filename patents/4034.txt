                                        CROSS-REFERENCE
[0001]     This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
2013293089 filed on 23 July 2013 and claims the benefit of U.S. Application No. 61/675,753,
filed 25 July 2012, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] Hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) is a recognized endogenous gasotransmitter involved in multiple
signaling pathways that impact various aspects of physiological and pathological processes.
Such processes include, but are not limited to; pain, inflammation, neurodegenerative disorders,
regulation of breathing, respiratory disorders, cutaneous injuries, regulation of blood pressure,
metabolic disorders, and urinary disorders, among others. Cystathionine-y-lyase (CSE) is a key
enzyme involved in the generation of H 2S and an important target for therapeutic intervention in
H 2S-mediated pathologies and disorders. Compounds that can effectively modulate CSE
activity will provide important therapeutic opportunities in disorders sensitive to H2 S
production.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0003] Described herein are inhibitors of cystathionine-y-lyase (CSE). Also disclosed herein are
methods for synthesizing such CSE inhibitors and methods for using such CSE inhibitors in the
treatment of diseases wherein CSE inhibition provides therapeutic benefit to the patient having
the disease. Further described are pharmaceutical formulations that include a CSE inhibitor.

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0027] A devastating health problem in the United States and abroad is the inadequate treatment
of pain. Pain can be acute or chronic and can also be categorized as nociceptive,
                                                 -5 -

 WO 2014/018569                                                               PCT/US2013/051744
pathologic/neuropathic, or inflammatory pain. While acute pain is usually self-limited, chronic
pain persists for three months or longer. One third of all Americans suffer from some form of
chronic pain, and a third of these have pain, which is resistant to current medical therapy. The
economic impact of pain is equally large at approximately $100 billion annually. Severe pain
syndromes reduce quality of life in patients, partly because reduced analgesic effectiveness with
chronic opiate therapy (i.e., hyperalgesia and tolerance) leads to escalating doses and distressing
side effects.
[00281 Neuropathic pain is a particular type of chronic, pathologic pain that has a complex and
variable etiology. It is frequently a chronic condition attributable to complete or partial
transection of a nerve, trauma or injury to a nerve, nerve plexus or soft tissue, or other
conditions, including cancer and idiopathic causes. Neuropathic pain is characterized by
hyperalgesia (lowered pain threshold and enhanced pain perception) and by allodynia (pain from
innocuous mechanical or thermal stimuli). The condition is progressive in nature. Because the
hyperesthetic component of neuropathic pain does not respond to the same pharmaceutical
interventions as does more generalized and acute forms of pain, development of effective long
term treatment modalities has been problematic.
[0029] The treatment of pain is of great importance in medicine. However, little progress has
been made in preventing the development of neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain and
hyperalgesia. Thus, there is a serious need for new agents and methods of treating pain
conditions.
[0030] Endogenous hydrogen sulfide is synthesized through degradation of L-cysteine by
cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) or cystathionine-beta synthase (CBS). The enzyme
cystathionine-y-lyase (CSE) converts cystathionine to L-cysteine, yielding pyruvate, ammonia
and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a gasotransmitter physiologically regulating
neuronal transmission and vascular tone. CBS is the predominant H2 S synthesizing enzyme in
the brain, while CSE preponderates in the peripheral tissues.
[0031]    Hydrogen sulfide in some embodiments is known to play a role in nociception by
sensitizing or directly activating various ion channels (e.g., TRPV channels, TRPA1, NaV and
CaV cation channels) potentially contributing to hyperalgesia as well as many other
physiological processes including vasodilation (e.g., smooth muscle relaxation and/or opening of
vascular smooth muscle K channels), and neuromodulation (e.g., induction of hippocampal
long-term potentiation).    Studies have shown that hydrogen sulfide is also associated with
inflammation (e.g., hindpaw edema), acute pancreatitis, endotoxemia and sepsis.
Neuropathic pain
[0032] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are methods of treating neuropathic pain in an
individual in need thereof. Neuropathic pain is a complex, chronic, pathologic pain state that
                                                 -6-

 WO 2014/018569                                                                PCT/US2013/051744
may or may not be accompanied by an active tissue injury process. With neuropathic pain, the
nerve fibers themselves may be damaged, dysfunctional or injured. These damaged nerve fibers
send incorrect signals to other pain centers, potentially resulting in altered functioning at the
level of the central nervous system. The impact of nerve fiber injury includes a change in nerve
function both at the site of injury and areas around the injury.
[0033] One example of neuropathic pain is called phantom limb syndrome. This occurs when an
arm or a leg has been removed because of illness or injury, but the brain still gets pain messages
from the nerves that originally carried impulses from the missing limb. These nerves now
misfire and cause pain.
[0034] Other examples of neuropathic pain include, but are not limited to, trigeminal neuralgia,
painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatica, and post-herpetic neuralgia. Trigeminal
neuralgia is a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation
from the face to the brain. In trigeminal neuralgia, even mild stimulation of the face, such as
from brushing teeth or putting on makeup, may trigger a jolt of excruciating pain.
[0035] Trigeminal neuralgia can occur as short, mild attacks, however, trigeminal neuralgia can
also progress, causing longer, more frequent bouts of searing pain. Trigeminal neuralgia affects
women more often than men, and it's more likely to occur in people who are older than 50.
[0036] Medications to lessen or block the pain signals sent to the brain are the most common
initial treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. Anticonvulsants such as carbazepine can be prescribed
to treat trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Carbatrol) is the drug most commonly
prescribed, and with the most demonstrated effectiveness, for trigeminal neuralgia. Other
anticonvulsant drugs used to treat trigeminal neuralgia include oxcarbazepine (Trileptal),
lamotrigine (Lamictal), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek) and gabapentin (Neurontin).
[0037] Antispasmodic agents can also be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia. Muscle-relaxing
agents such as baclofen may be used alone or in combination with carbamazepine or phenytoin.
Side effects may include confusion, nausea and drowsiness.
[0038] Alcohol injections provide temporary pain relief by numbing the affected areas of the
face. Typically, alcohol is injected into the part of the face corresponding to the trigeminal nerve
branch causing pain. The pain relief isn't permanent, so repeated injections or a different
procedure in the future may be needed. Side effects may include infections at the injection site,
bleeding and damage to nearby nerves.
[0039] Surgery is another option for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The goal of surgery
for trigeminal neuralgia is either to stop the blood vessel from compressing the trigeminal nerve
or to damage the trigeminal nerve to keep it from malfunctioning. Damaging the nerve often
causes temporary or permanent facial numbness, and with any of the surgical procedures, the
pain can return months or years later.

 WO 2014/018569                                                               PCT/US2013/051744
[0040] Surgical options for trigeminal neuralgia include gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKR); and
microvascular decompression (MVD). GKR involves delivering a focused, high dose of
radiation to the root of the trigeminal nerve. Because of GKR's effectiveness and safety
compared with other surgical options for trigeminal neuralgia, the procedure is becoming widely
used and may be offered earlier than other surgical procedures.
[0041] Gamma-knife radiosurgery uses radiation to damage the trigeminal nerve and reduce or
eliminate pain. Relief occurs gradually and can take several weeks to begin. GKR is successful
in eliminating pain for the majority of people. If pain recurs, the procedure can be repeated.
Fewer than 5 percent of people who undergo this procedure experience side effects, which may
include lasting loss of facial sensation. The procedure is painless and typically is done without
anesthesia.
[0042] Microvascular decompression (MVD) involves relocating or removing blood vessels that
are in contact with the trigeminal root. During MVD, the doctor makes an incision behind the
ear on the side of the pain. Then, through a small hole in the skull, part of the brain is lifted to
expose the trigeminal nerve. Any artery in contact with the nerve root is directed away from the
nerve, and the surgeon places a pad between the nerve and the artery. If a vein is compressing
the nerve, the surgeon typically will remove it.
[0043] MVD can successfully eliminate or reduce pain most of the time, but pain can recur in
some people. While MVD has a high success rate, it also carries risks. There are small chances
of decreased hearing, facial weakness, facial numbness, double vision, and even a stroke or
death. Most people who have this procedure have no facial numbness afterward.
[0044] Note that if no artery or vein appears to be compressing the nerve, part of the nerve may
be severed instead. This procedure is called a rhizotomy.
[0045] During glycerol injection, a needle is inserted through the face and into an opening in the
base of the skull. The needle is guided into the trigeminal cistern, a small sac of spinal fluid that
surrounds the trigeminal nerve ganglion, where the trigeminal nerve divides into three branches,
and part of its root. Images are made to confirm that the needle is in the proper location, and
then a small amount of sterile glycerol is injected. After three or four hours, the glycerol
damages the trigeminal nerve and blocks pain signals. Initially, this procedure relieves pain in
most people. However, some people have a later recurrence of pain, and many experience facial
numbness or tingling.
[0046] In balloon compression of the trigeminal nerve, a hollow needle is inserted through the
face and into an opening in the base of the skull. Then, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a
balloon on the end is threaded through the needle. The balloon is inflated with enough pressure
to damage the nerve and block pain signals. Balloon compression successfully controls pain in

most people, at least for a while. Most people undergoing this procedure experience some facial
numbness, and some experience temporary or permanent weakness of the muscles used to chew.
[0047] Electric current (radiofrequency thermal rhizotomy) selectively destroys nerve fibers
associated with pain. A hollow needle is placed through the face and into an opening in the
skull. Once the needle is positioned, an electrode is threaded through it to the nerve root. Then
the electrode is heated until it damages the nerve fibers, creating an area of injury (lesion). If the
pain isn't eliminated, additional lesions may be created. Almost everyone who undergoes
radiofrequency thermal rhizotomy has some facial numbness after the procedure.
[0048] A procedure called partial trigeminal rhizotomy involves cutting part of the trigeminal
nerve at the base of the brain. Through an incision behind an ear, a quarter-sized hole is made in
the skull to access the nerve. Because partial trigeminal rhizotomy cuts the nerve at its source,
facial numbness is a permanent side effect.
[0049] Diabetic neuropathies are neuropathic disorders that are associated with diabetes
mellitus. These conditions are thought to result from diabetic microvascular injury involving
small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum) in addition to macrovascular conditions
that can culminate in diabetic neuropathy. Relatively common conditions which may be
associated with diabetic neuropathy include third nerve palsy; mononeuropathy;
mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrophy; a painful polyneuropathy; autonomic
neuropathy; and thoracoabdominal neuropathy.
[0050] Despite advances in the understanding of the metabolic causes of neuropathy, treatments
aimed at interrupting these pathological processes have been limited. Thus, with the exception of
tight glucose control, treatments are for reducing pain and other symptoms.
[0051] Options for pain control include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). A systematic review concluded that "tricyclic
antidepressants and traditional anticonvulsants are better for short term pain relief than newer
generation anticonvulsants." A combination of these medications (gabapentin + nortriptyline)
may also be superior to a single agent.
[0052] The two drugs approved by the FDA for diabetic peripheral neuropathy are the
antidepressant duloxetine and the anticonvulsant pregabalin. Before trying a systemic
medication, some doctors recommend treating localized diabetic periperal neuropathy with
lidocaine patches.
[0053] Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a nerve pain due to damage caused by the varicella
zoster virus. Typically, the neuralgia is confined to a dermatomic area of the skin and follows an
outbreak of herpes zoster (HZ, commonly known as shingles) in that same dermatomic area. The
neuralgia typically begins when the HZ vesicles have crusted over and begun to heal, but it can
begin in the absence of HZ, in which case zoster sine herpete is presumed (see Herpes zoster).

[0054] Treatment options for PHN include antidepressants, anticonvulsants (such as gabapentin
or pregabalin) and topical agents such as lidocaine patches or capsaicin lotion. Opioid analgesics
may also be appropriate in many situations. There are some sporadically successful experimental
treatments, such as rhizotomy (severing or damaging the affected nerve to relieve pain) and
TENS (a type of electrical pulse therapy).
[0055] Neuropathic pain often seems to have no obvious cause; but, some common causes of
neuropathic pain include alcoholism; amputation; back, leg, and hip problems; chemotherapy;
diabetes; facial nerve problems; HIV infection or AIDS; multiple sclerosis; shingles; and spine
surgery.
[0056] Symptoms may include shooting and burning pain; and tingling and numbness.
[0057] Some neuropathic pain studies suggest the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
such as Aleve or Motrin, may ease pain. Some people may require a stronger painkiller, such as
those containing morphine. Anticonvulsant and antidepressant drugs seem to work in some
cases.
[0058] If another condition, such as diabetes, is involved, better management of that disorder
may alleviate the pain.
[0059] In cases that are difficult to treat, a pain specialist may use invasive or implantable
device therapies to effectively manage the pain. Electrical stimulation of the nerves involved in
neuropathic pain generation may significantly control the pain symptoms.
[0060] Unfortunately, neuropathic pain often responds poorly to standard pain treatments and
occasionally may get worse instead of better over time. For some people, it can lead to serious
disability.
[0061] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are methods of treating neuropathic pain in an
individual in need thereof. In some embodiments, the neuropathic pain is trigeminal neuralgia.

Acute Post-Operative Pain
[0063] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are methods of preventing or reducing acute
post-operative pain in an individual in need thereof. Post-operative pain (as a result of surgery)
is usually considered normal. However, when poorly controlled, the pain can cause increased
heart and respiratory rate, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, and elevated
adrenalin and cortisol levels, or reduced immune response and increased risk of infection.
[0064] Uncontrolled pain is similar to uncontrolled fear in that it promotes a "fight or flight"
reaction. This reaction tends to delay wound healing and increases the complication rate
including infection.
[0065] Education as to the nature of the surgery or procedure is very important in order to
minimize fear and anxiety pre-operatively.
[0066] The following have all been shown to reduce post-operative pain and surgical infection,
and hasten wound healing use of non-steriod anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen
preoperatively; injection of local anesthetic into the wound prior to suturing; more liberal
prescription of post-operative analgesics; and use of intra- and post-operative epidural infusions
for complex surgeries. Numerous studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of relaxation
techniques, such as hypnosis and massage therapy in reducing post-operative pain.

combination with a second treatment regimen. In some embodiments, the methods comprise
administering a CSE inhibitor before, simultaneously with, or after a second treatment regimen.
Autoimmune Disease
[0070] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are methods of treating an autoimmune
disease in an individual in need thereof Autoimmune diseases often arise from an inappropriate
immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body. In
other words, the immune system mistakes some part of the body as a pathogen and attacks its
own cells. This may be restricted to certain organs (e.g. in autoimmune thyroiditis) or involve a
particular tissue in different places (e.g. Goodpasture's disease which may affect the basement
membrane in both the lung and the kidney). The treatment of autoimmune diseases is typically
with immunosuppression-medication which decreases the immune response.
[0071] Examples of autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Addison's disease, agammaglobulinemia, alopecia areata,

some embodiments, the methods comprise administering a CSE inhibitor before, simultaneously
with, or after a second treatment regimen.
Inflammatory Disease
[0073] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are methods of treating an inflammatory
disease in an individual in need thereof Inflammation is part of the complex biological
response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants.
Inflammation is a protective attempt by the organism to remove the injurious stimuli and to
initiate the healing process. Inflammation is not a synonym for infection, even in cases where
inflammation is caused by infection. Although infection is caused by a microorganism,
inflammation is one of the responses of the organism to the pathogen. However, inflammation is
a stereotyped response, and therefore it is considered as a mechanism of innate immunity, as
compared to adaptive immunity, which is specific for each pathogen.
[0074] Without inflammation, wounds and infections would never heal. Similarly, progressive
destruction of the tissue would compromise the survival of the organism. However, chronic
inflammation can also lead to a host of diseases, such as hay fever, periodontitis, atherosclerosis,
rheumatoid arthritis, and even cancer (e.g., gallbladder carcinoma). It is for that reason that
inflammation is normally closely regulated by the body.

 WO 2014/018569                                                                PCT/US2013/051744
[0075] Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the
initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of
plasma and leukocytes (especially granulocytes) from the blood into the injured tissues. A
cascade of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the
local vascular system, the immune system, and various cells within the injured tissue. Prolonged
inflammation, known as chronic inflammation, leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells
present at the site of inflammation and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and healing
of the tissue from the inflammatory process.
[0076] Inflammatory abnormalities are a large group of disorders which underlie a vast variety
of human diseases. The immune system is often involved with inflammatory disorders,
demonstrated in both allergic reactions and some myopathies, with many immune system
disorders resulting in abnormal inflammation. Non-immune diseases with etiological origins in
inflammatory processes include cancer, atherosclerosis, and ischaemic heart disease. A large
variety of proteins are involved in inflammation, and any one of them is open to a genetic
mutation which impairs or otherwise dysregulates the normal function and expression of that
protein.
[0077] Examples of disorders associated with inflammation include, but are not limited to, acne
vulgaris, asthma, autoimmune diseases, celiac disease, chronic prostatitis, glomerulonephritis,
hypersensitivities, inflammatory bowel diseases, pelvic inflammatory disease, primary or
secondary pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, reperfusion injury,
rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, transplant rejection, vasculitis and interstitial cystitis. Types of
inflammation include, but are not limited to, appendicitis, bursitis, colitis, cystitis, dermatitis,
meningitis, phlebitis, rhinitis, tendonitis, and tonsillitis

Stroke
[0080] A stroke is the rapid loss of brain function(s) due to disturbance in the blood supply to
the brain. In an ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to
dysfunction of the brain tissue in that area. Current evidence suggests that H 2 S promotes
ischemic damage by a direct degenerative effect on cerebral neurons, although effect on cerebral
blood flow may not be excluded.

extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease or condition being treated. The result can be
reduction and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired
alteration of a biological system. For example, an "effective amount" for therapeutic uses is the
amount of the composition comprising a compound as disclosed herein required to provide a
clinically significant decrease in disease symptoms. An appropriate "effective" amount in any
individual case may be determined using techniques, such as a dose escalation study.
[0086] The term "subject" or "patient" encompasses mammals and non-mammals. Examples of
mammals include, but are not limited to, any member of the Mammalian class: humans, non
human primates such as chimpanzees, and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as
cattle, horses, sheep, goats, swine; domestic animals such as rabbits, dogs, and cats; laboratory

[0092] The term "optionally substituted" or "substituted" means that the referenced group
substituted with one or more additional group(s). In certain embodiments, the one or more
additional group(s) are individually and independently selected from amide, ester, alkyl,
cycloalkyl, heteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heteroalicyclic, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio,
arylthio, alkylsulfoxide, arylsulfoxide, ester, alkylsulfone, arylsulfone, cyano, halogen, alkoyl,
alkoyloxo, isocyanato, thiocyanato, isothiocyanato, nitro, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, fluoroalkyl,
amino, alkyl-amino, dialkyl-amino, amido. In one embodiment, the referenced group is
substituted with one or more halogen. In another embodiment, the referenced group is
substituted with one or more alkyl.
[0093]    An "alkyl" group refers to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group. Reference to an alkyl group
includes "saturated alkyl" and/or "unsaturated alkyl". The alkyl group, whether saturated or
unsaturated, includes branched, straight chain, or cyclic groups. By way of example only, alkyl
includes methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl, iso
pentyl, neo-pentyl, and hexyl. In some embodiments, alkyl groups include, but are in no way
limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, hexyl, ethenyl,
propenyl, butenyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like. A "lower
alkyl" is a C 1-C6 alkyl. A "heteroalkyl" group substitutes any one of the carbons of the alkyl
group with a heteroatom having the appropriate number of hydrogen atoms attached (e.g., a CH 2
group to an NH group or an 0 group).
[0094]    An "alkoxy" group refers to a (alkyl)O- group, where alkyl is as defined herein.
[0095]    The term "alkylamine" refers to the -N(alkyl)xHy group, wherein alkyl is as defined
herein and x and y are selected from the group x=1, y--1 and x=2, y--0. When x=2, the alkyl
groups, taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached, optionally form a cyclic ring
system.
[0096]    An "amide" is a chemical moiety with formula C(O)NHR or NHC(O)R, where R is
selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl (bonded through a ring carbon) and
heteroalicyclic (bonded through a ring carbon).

[0097]    The term "ester" refers to a chemical moiety with formula -C(=O)OR, where R is
selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl and heteroalicyclic.
[0098]    As used herein, the term "aryl" refers to an aromatic ring wherein each of the atoms
forming the ring is a carbon atom. Aryl rings described herein include rings having five, six,
seven, eight, nine, or more than nine carbon atoms. Aryl groups are optionally substituted.
Examples of aryl groups include, but are not limited to phenyl, and naphthalenyl.
[0099]    The term "cycloalkyl" refers to a monocyclic or polycyclic non-aromatic radical,
wherein each of the atoms forming the ring (i.e. skeletal atoms) is a carbon atom. In various
embodiments, cycloalkyls are saturated, or partially unsaturated. In some embodiments,
cycloalkyls are fused with an aromatic ring. Cycloalkyl groups include groups having from 3 to
10 ring atoms. Illustrative examples of cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, the
following moieties:
                                                                                               and
the like. Monocyclic cycloalkyls include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl,
cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl. Dicylclic cycloalkyls include, but are not
limited to tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl, tetrahydropentalene or the like. Polycyclic cycloalkyls
include adamantane, norbornane or the like. The term cycloalkyl includes "unsaturated
nonaromatic carbocyclyl" or "nonaromatic unsaturated carbocyclyl" groups both of which refer
to a nonaromatic carbocycle, as defined herein, that contains at least one carbon carbon double
bond or one carbon carbon triple bond.
[00100] The term "heterocyclo" refers to heteroaromatic and heteroalicyclic groups containing
one to four ring heteroatoms each selected from 0, S and N. In certain instances, each
heterocyclic group has from 4 to 10 atoms in its ring system, and with the proviso that the ring
of said group does not contain two adjacent 0 or S atoms. Non-aromatic heterocyclic groups
include groups having 3 atoms in their ring system, but aromatic heterocyclic groups must have
at least 5 atoms in their ring system. The heterocyclic groups include benzo-fused ring systems.
An example of a 3-membered heterocyclic group is aziridinyl (derived from aziridine). An
example of a 4-membered heterocyclic group is azetidinyl (derived from azetidine). An example
of a 5-membered heterocyclic group is thiazolyl. An example of a 6-membered heterocyclic
group is pyridyl, and an example of a 10-membered heterocyclic group is quinolinyl. Examples

[00101] The terms "heteroaryl" or, alternatively, "heteroaromatic" refers to an aryl group that
includes one or more ring heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. An N
containing "heteroaromatic" or "heteroaryl" moiety refers to an aromatic group in which at least
one of the skeletal atoms of the ring is a nitrogen atom. In certain embodiments, heteroaryl
groups are monocyclic or polycyclic. Examples of monocyclic heteroaryl groups include and
are not limited to:

[001061 The term heteroalicyclic also includes all ring forms of the carbohydrates, including
but not limited to the monosaccharides, the disaccharides and the oligosaccharides.
[001071 The term "halo" or, alternatively, "halogen" means fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.
[001081 The terms "haloalkyl," and "haloalkoxy" include alkyl and alkoxy structures that are
substituted with one or more halogens. In embodiments, where more than one halogen is
included in the group, the halogens are the same or they are different. The terms "fluoroalkyl"
and "fluoroalkoxy" include haloalkyl and haloalkoxy groups, respectively, in which the halo is
fluorine.
[001091 The term "heteroalkyl" include optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl
radicals which have one or more skeletal chain atoms selected from an atom other than carbon,
e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, silicon, or combinations thereof. In certain
embodiments, the heteroatom(s) is placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group.

then the substitution cannot eliminate the carboxylic acid isosteric properties of the inventive
compound. It is contemplated that the placement of one or more substituents upon a carbocyclic
or heterocyclic carboxylic acid isostere is not a substitution at one or more atom(s) which
maintain(s) or is/are integral to the carboxylic acid isosteric properties of the compound, if such
substituent(s) would destroy the carboxylic acid isosteric properties of the compound.

provided herein, therapeutically effective amounts of compounds described herein are
administered in a pharmaceutical composition to a mammal having a disease, disorder, or
condition to be treated. In some embodiments, the mammal is a human. A therapeutically
effective amount can vary widely depending on the severity of the disease, the age and relative
health of the subject, the potency of the compound used and other factors. The compounds can
be used singly or in combination with one or more therapeutic agents as components of
mixtures.
[00154] The pharmaceutical formulations described herein are administered to a subject by
appropriate administration routes, including but not limited to, oral, parenteral (e.g., intravenous,
subcutaneous, intramuscular), intranasal, buccal, topical, or transdermal administration routes.
The pharmaceutical formulations described herein include, but are not limited to, aqueous liquid
dispersions, self-emulsifying dispersions, solid solutions, liposomal dispersions, aerosols, solid
dosage forms, powders, immediate release formulations, controlled release formulations, fast
melt formulations, tablets, capsules, pills, delayed release formulations, extended release
formulations, pulsatile release formulations, multiparticulate formulations, and mixed immediate
and controlled release formulations.
[00155] Pharmaceutical compositions including a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III),
(IV), or (IVa) are manufactured in a conventional manner, such as, by way of example only, by
means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying,
encapsulating, entrapping or compression processes.
[00156] The pharmaceutical compositions will include at least one compound of Formula (I),
(II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) as an active ingredient in free-acid or free-base form, or in a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. In addition, the methods and pharmaceutical
compositions described herein include the use of N-oxides (if appropriate), crystalline forms,
amorphous phases, as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of
activity. In some embodiments, compounds of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) exist
in unsolvated form or in solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as
water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds of Formula (I), (II), (Ila),
(III), (IV), or (IVa) are also considered to be disclosed herein.
[00157] In some embodiments, the compounds of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa)
exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented
herein. As such, it is to be understood that a compound of the Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV),
or (IVa) or a salt thereof may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism whereby two chemical
compounds that are capable of facile interconversion by exchanging a hydrogen atom between
two atoms, to either of which it forms a covalent bond. Since the tautomeric compounds exist in
mobile equilibrium with each other they may be regarded as different isomeric forms of the

 [00158] In some embodiments, compounds of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) exist
 as enantiomers, diastereomers, or other steroisomeric forms. The compounds disclosed herein
include all enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and epimeric forms as well as mixtures thereof
 [00159] In some embodiments, compounds described herein may be prepared as prodrugs. A
 "prodrug" refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often
useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They
may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug
may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An
 example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is
 administered as an ester (the "prodrug") to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where
water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the
 carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A
 further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group
where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in
vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or
therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is
 enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically,
pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound.
 [00160] Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized
in vivo to produce a compound of (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) as set forth herein are

included within the scope of the claims. Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds,
wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila),
(III), (IV), or (IVa) as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases,
some of the compounds described herein may be a prodrug for another derivative or active
compound. In some embodiments described herein, hydrazones are metabolized in vivo to
produce a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa).
[00161] In certain embodiments, compositions provided herein include one or more
preservatives to inhibit microbial activity. Suitable preservatives include mercury-containing
substances such as merfen and thiomersal; stabilized chlorine dioxide; and quaternary
ammonium compounds such as benzalkonium chloride, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and
cetylpyridinium chloride.
[00162] In some embodiments, formulations described herein benefit from antioxidants, metal
chelating agents, thiol containing compounds and other general stabilizing agents. Examples of

material to enhance absorption and prevent the removal of the transdermal formulation from the
skin. In other embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein can maintain a
saturated or supersaturated state to promote diffusion into the skin.
[00165] In one aspect, formulations suitable for transdermal administration of compounds
described herein employ transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches and can
be lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions, dissolved and/or dispersed in a polymer
or an adhesive. In one aspect, such patches are constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on
demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Still further, transdermal delivery of the compounds
described herein can be accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like. In one
aspect, transdermal patches provide controlled delivery of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila),
(III), (IV), or (IVa). In one aspect, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising
a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a
rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and
predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin.
[00166] In further embodiments, topical formulations include gel formulations (e.g., gel patches
which adhere to the skin). In some of such embodiments, a gel composition includes any
polymer that forms a gel upon contact with the body (e.g., gel formulations comprising
hyaluronic acid, pluronic polymers, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-based polymers or the
like). In some forms of the compositions, the formulation comprises a low-melting wax such as,
but not limited to, a mixture of fatty acid glycerides, optionally in combination with cocoa butter
which is first melted. Optionally, the formulations further comprise a moisturizing agent.
[00167] In certain embodiments, delivery systems for pharmaceutical compounds may be
employed, such as, for example, liposomes and emulsions. In certain embodiments,
compositions provided herein can also include an mucoadhesive polymer, selected from among,
for example, carboxymethylcellulose, carbomer (acrylic acid polymer),
poly(methylmethacrylate), polyacrylamide, polycarbophil, acrylic acid/butyl acrylate
copolymer, sodium alginate and dextran.
[00168] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein may be administered topically
and can be formulated into a variety of topically administrable compositions, such as solutions,
suspensions, lotions, gels, pastes, medicated sticks, balms, creams or ointments. Such
pharmaceutical compounds can contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents,
buffers and preservatives.
[00169] In alternative embodiments, a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa)
is formulated and presented as a wash or rinse liquid which is used to irrigate the affected area.

Wound dressings
[00170] In one aspect, a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) is presented as
part of a wound dressing. A dressing is an adjunct used for application to a wound to promote
healing and/or prevent further harm. A dressing is designed to be in direct contact with a wound.
In some embodiments, a wound dressing comprising a CSE inhibitor described herein provides a
controlled release of the CSE inhibitor. In other embodiments, a wound dressing comprising a
CSE inhibitor described herein provides sustained release of the CSE inhibitor. In other
embodiments, a wound dressing comprising a CSE inhibitor described herein provides
intermediate release of the CSE inhibitor. In further embodiments, a wound dressing comprising
a CSE inhibitor described herein provides intermediate release of the CSE inhibitor. In other
embodiments, a wound dressing comprising a CSE inhibitor described herein provides a
combination of sustained, intermediate or immediate release of the CSE inhibitor.
[00171] Optionally a wound dressing comprising a CSE inhibitor comprises particles of the
CSE inhibitor designed for controlled release (e.g., micronized particles, nanosized particles or a
mixture thereof, non-sized particles, coated particles for controlled and/or sustained release). In
some embodiments, a wound dressing is a gel patch that adheres to the skin at the site of the
wound or cutaneous injury or condition. In some embodiments, a gel patch comprises any
suitable gelling polymer (e.g., hyaluronan, carbomer polymers, pluronic polymers, PLGA
polymers or the like). In some embodiments, a wound dressing comprises a coating on a sticky
tape (e.g., medicated bandage or tape). In some embodiments, a wound dressing is a liquid
which gels upon contacting the skin and is administered as a spray-on or paint.
[00172] In some additional embodiments, a CSE inhibitor is administered topically or
systemically in combination with a wound dressing. In some of such embodiments, the wound
dressing is non-medicated (i.e., does not comprise the CSE inhibitor). In some other
embodiments, the wound dressing comprises a CSE inhibitor as described above.
[00173] In further embodiments, a CSE inhibitor is administered topically or systemically in
combination with a wound dressing and a bandage.
Certain systemically administered compositions
[00174] In one aspect, a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) is formulated
into a pharmaceutical composition suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous
injection. In one aspect, formulations suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous
injection include physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions,
dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile
injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers,
diluents, solvents, or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethylene
glycol, glycerol, cremophor and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive
                                                - 47 -

oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for
example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size
in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. In some embodiments, formulations
suitable for subcutaneous injection also contain additives such as preserving, wetting,
emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the growth of microorganisms can be ensured
by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, such as parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic
acid, and the like. In some cases it is desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium
chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be
brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and
gelatin.
[00175] For intravenous injections or drips or infusions, compounds described herein are
formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as
Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal
administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation.
Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For other parenteral injections, appropriate
formulations include aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, preferably with physiologically
compatible buffers or excipients. Such excipients are known.
[00176] Parenteral injections may involve bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations
for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers,
with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in a form
suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or
aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or
dispersing agents. In one aspect, the active ingredient is in powder form for constitution with a
suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.
[00177] For administration by inhalation, a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or
(IVa) is formulated for use as an aerosol, a mist or a powder. Pharmaceutical compositions
described herein are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from
pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.,
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or
other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by
providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, such as, by way of
example only, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder
mix of the compound described herein and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.
[00178] Representative intranasal formulations are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos.
4,476,116, 5,116,817 and 6,391,452. Formulations that include a compound of Formula (I) are
prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives,

fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. See, for example,
Ansel, H. C. et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Sixth Ed. (1995).
Preferably these compositions and formulations are prepared with suitable nontoxic
pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. These ingredients are known to those skilled in the
preparation of nasal dosage forms and some of these can be found in REMINGTON: THE
SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY, 21st edition, 2005. The choice of suitable
carriers is dependent upon the exact nature of the nasal dosage form desired, e.g., solutions,
suspensions, ointments, or gels. Nasal dosage forms generally contain large amounts of water in
addition to the active ingredient. Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters,
emulsifiers or dispersing agents, preservatives, surfactants, gelling agents, or buffering and other
stabilizing and solubilizing agents are optionally present. Preferably, the nasal dosage form
should be isotonic with nasal secretions.
[00179] Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use are obtained by mixing one or more solid
excipient with one or more of the compounds described herein, optionally grinding the resulting
mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to
obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include, for example, fillers such as sugars,
including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example,
maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methylcellulose,
microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose; or
others such as: polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP or povidone) or calcium phosphate. If desired,
disintegrating agents are added, such as the cross-linked croscarmellose sodium,
polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. In some
embodiments, dyestuffs or pigments are added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification
or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.
[00180] In some embodiments, pharmaceutical formulations of a compound of Formula (I),
(II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) are in the form of a capsules, including push-fit capsules made of
gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or
sorbitol. The push-fit capsules contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as
lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and,
optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds are dissolved or suspended in
suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In some
embodiments, stabilizers are added. A capsule may be prepared, for example, by placing the
bulk blend of the formulation of the compound described above, inside of a capsule. In some
embodiments, the formulations (non-aqueous suspensions and solutions) are placed in a soft
gelatin capsule. In other embodiments, the formulations are placed in standard gelatin capsules
or non-gelatin capsules such as capsules comprising HPMC. In other embodiments, the

capsule is opened and the contents sprinkled on food prior to eating.
[00181] All formulations for oral administration are in dosages suitable for such administration.
[00182] In one aspect, solid oral dosage forms are prepared by mixing a compound of Formula
(I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) with one or more of the following: antioxidants, flavoring
agents, and carrier materials such as binders, suspending agents, disintegration agents, filling
agents, surfactants, solubilizers, stabilizers, lubricants, wetting agents, and diluents.
[00183] In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms disclosed herein are in the form of a
tablet, (including a suspension tablet, a fast-meh tablet, a bite-disintegration tablet, a rapid
disintegration tablet, an effervescent tablet, or a caplet), a pill, a powder, a capsule, solid
dispersion, solid solution, bioerodible dosage form, controlled release formulations, pulsatile
release dosage forms, multiparticulate dosage forms, beads, pellets, granules. In other
embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation is in the form of a powder.
[00184] Compressed tablets are solid dosage forms prepared by compacting the bulk blend of
the formulations described above. In various embodiments, tablets will include one or more
flavoring agents.
[00185] In other embodiments, the tablets will include a film surrounding the final compressed
tablet. In some embodiments, the film coating can provide a delayed release of the compound of
Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) from the formulation. In other embodiments, the film
coating aids in patient compliance (e.g., Opadry* coatings or sugar coating). Film coatings
including Opadry* typically range from about 1% to about 3% of the tablet weight.
[00186] In some embodiments, solid dosage forms, e.g., tablets, effervescent tablets, and
capsules, are prepared by mixing particles of a compound with one or more pharmaceutical
excipients to form a bulk blend composition. The bulk blend is readily subdivided into equally
effective unit dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, and capsules. In some embodiments, the
individual unit dosages include film coatings. These formulations are manufactured by
conventional formulation techniques.
[00187] In another aspect, dosage forms include microencapsulated formulations. In some
embodiments, one or more other compatible materials are present in the microencapsulation
material. Exemplary materials include, but are not limited to, pH modifiers, erosion facilitators,
anti-foaming agents, antioxidants, flavoring agents, and carrier materials such as binders,
suspending agents, disintegration agents, filling agents, surfactants, solubilizers, stabilizers,
lubricants, wetting agents, and diluents.
[00188] Exemplary useful microencapsulation materials include, but are not limited to,
hydroxypropyl cellulose ethers (HPC) such as Klucel@ or Nisso HPC, low-substituted
hydroxypropyl cellulose ethers (L-HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose ethers (HPMC) such

 [00189] Liquid formulation dosage forms for oral administration are optionally aqueous
 suspensions selected from the group including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable
 aqueous oral dispersions, emulsions, solutions, elixirs, gels, and syrups. See, e.g., Singh et al.,
Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, 2nd Ed., pp. 754-757 (2002). In addition to a CSE
inhibitor, the liquid dosage forms optionally include additives, such as: (a) disintegrating agents;
 (b) dispersing agents; (c) wetting agents; (d) at least one preservative, (e) viscosity enhancing
 agents, (f) at least one sweetening agent, and (g) at least one flavoring agent. In some
 embodiments, the aqueous dispersions further includes a crystal-forming inhibitor.
 [00190] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations described herein are self
 emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS). Emulsions are dispersions of one immiscible
phase in another, usually in the form of droplets. Generally, emulsions are created by vigorous
mechanical dispersion. SEDDS, as opposed to emulsions or microemulsions, spontaneously
 form emulsions when added to an excess of water without any external mechanical dispersion or
 agitation. An advantage of SEDDS is that only gentle mixing is required to distribute the
 droplets throughout the solution. Additionally, water or the aqueous phase is optionally added
just prior to administration, which ensures stability of an unstable or hydrophobic active
ingredient. Thus, the SEDDS provides an effective delivery system for oral and parenteral
 delivery of hydrophobic active ingredients. In some embodiments, SEDDS provides
improvements in the bio availability of hydrophobic active ingredients. Methods of producing
 self-emulsifying dosage forms include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos.
 5,858,401, 6,667,048, and 6,960,563.
 [00191] Buccal formulations that include a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or
 (IVa) are administered using a variety of formulations known in the art. For example, such

5,739,136. In addition, the buccal dosage forms described herein can further include a
bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the
buccal mucosa. For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of
tablets, lozenges, or gels formulated in a conventional manner.
[00192] For intravenous injections, a CSE inhibitor is optionally formulated in aqueous
solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's
solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate
to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. For other parenteral injections,
appropriate formulations include aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, preferably with
physiologically compatible buffers or excipients.
[00193] Parenteral injections optionally involve bolus injection or continuous infusion.
Formulations for injection are optionally presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in
multi dose containers, with an added preservative. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical
composition described herein is in a form suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile
suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and contain formulatory agents
such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for
parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of an agent that modulates the activity of a
carotid body in water soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of an agent that modulates the
activity of a carotid body are optionally prepared as appropriate, e.g., oily injection suspensions.
[00194] Conventional formulation techniques include, e.g., one or a combination of methods:
(1) dry mixing, (2) direct compression, (3) milling, (4) dry or non-aqueous granulation, (5) wet

[00198] Binders impart cohesiveness to solid oral dosage form formulations: for powder filled
capsule formulation, they aid in plug formation that can be filled into soft or hard shell capsules
and for tablet formulation, they ensure the tablet remaining intact after compression and help
assure blend uniformity prior to a compression or fill step. Materials suitable for use as binders

like.
[00199] In general, binder levels of 20-70% are used in powder-filled gelatin capsule
formulations. Binder usage level in tablet formulations varies whether direct compression, wet
granulation, roller compaction, or usage of other excipients such as fillers which itself can act as
moderate binder. Binder levels ofup to 70% in tablet formulations is common.

[00207] In various embodiments, the particles of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III),
(IV), or (IVa) and one or more excipients are dry blended and compressed into a mass, such as a
tablet, having a hardness sufficient to provide a pharmaceutical composition that substantially
disintegrates within less than about 30 minutes, less than about 35 minutes, less than about 40
minutes, less than about 45 minutes, less than about 50 minutes, less than about 55 minutes, or
less than about 60 minutes, after oral administration, thereby releasing the formulation into the
gastrointestinal fluid.
[00208] In other embodiments, a powder including a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III),
(IV), or (IVa) is formulated to include one or more pharmaceutical excipients and flavors. Such
a powder is prepared, for example, by mixing the compound and optional pharmaceutical
excipients to form a bulk blend composition. Additional embodiments also include a suspending
agent and/or a wetting agent. This bulk blend is uniformly subdivided into unit dosage
packaging or multi-dosage packaging units.
[00209] In still other embodiments, effervescent powders are also prepared. Effervescent salts
have been used to disperse medicines in water for oral administration.
Controlled release formulations
[00210] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical dosage forms are formulated to provide a
controlled release of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa). Controlled
release refers to the release of the compound from a dosage form in which it is incorporated
according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. Controlled release profiles
include, for example, sustained release, prolonged release, pulsatile release, and delayed release
profiles. In contrast to immediate release compositions, controlled release compositions allow
delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of time according to a predetermined
profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for an extended
period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacologic response while minimizing
side effects as compared to conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of
response provide for many inherent benefits that are not achieved with the corresponding short
acting, immediate release preparations.
[00211] In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms described herein are formulated as
enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms, i.e., as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical
composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small
intestine or large intestine. In one aspect, the enteric coated dosage form is a compressed or
molded or extruded tablet/mold (coated or uncoated) containing granules, powder, pellets, beads
or particles of the active ingredient and/or other composition components, which are themselves
coated or uncoated. In one aspect, the enteric coated oral dosage form is in the form of a capsule
                                                  - 55 -

containing pellets, beads or granules, which include a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III),
(IV), or (IVa), that are coated or uncoated.
[00212] Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating
does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5, but does dissolve at pH
about 5 and above. Coatings are typically selected from any of the following:
[00213] Shellac - this coating dissolves in media of pH >7; Acrylic polymers - examples of
suitable acrylic polymers include methacrylic acid copolymers and ammonium methacrylate
copolymers. The Eudragit series E, L, S, RL, RS and NE (Rohm Pharma) are available as
solubilized in organic solvent, aqueous dispersion, or dry powders. The Eudragit series RL, NE,
and RS are insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for
colonic targeting. The Eudragit series E dissolve in the stomach. The Eudragit series L, L-30D
and S are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine; Poly Vinyl Acetate Phthalate
(PVAP) - PVAP dissolves in pH >5, and it is much less permeable to water vapor and gastric
fluids.
[00214] Conventional coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply
coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains
intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached.
[00215] In other embodiments, the formulations described herein are delivered using a pulsatile
dosage form. A pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release
pulses at predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites. Exemplary
pulsatile dosage forms and methods of their manufacture are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.
5,011,692, 5,017,381, 5,229,135, 5,840,329 and 5,837,284. In one embodiment, the pulsatile
dosage form includes at least two groups of particles, (i.e. multiparticulate) each containing the
formulation described herein. The first group of particles provides a substantially immediate
dose of the compound of Formula (I) upon ingestion by a mammal. The first group of particles
can be either uncoated or include a coating and/or sealant. In one aspect, the second group of
particles comprises coated particles. The coating on the second group of particles provides a
delay of from about 2 hours to about 7 hours following ingestion before release of the second
dose. Suitable coatings for pharmaceutical compositions are described herein or known in the
art.
[00216] In some embodiments, pharmaceutical formulations are provided that include particles
of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) and at least one dispersing agent or
suspending agent for oral administration to a subject. The formulations may be a powder and/or
granules for suspension, and upon admixture with water, a substantially uniform suspension is
obtained.

[00217] In some embodiments, particles formulated for controlled release are incorporated in a
gel or a patch or a wound dressing.
[00218] In one aspect, liquid formulation dosage forms for oral administration and/or for
topical administration as a wash are in the form of aqueous suspensions selected from the group
including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous oral dispersions, emulsions,
solutions, elixirs, gels, and syrups. See, e.g., Singh et al., Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical
Technology, 2nd Ed., pp. 754-757 (2002). In addition to the particles of a compound of
Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa), the liquid dosage forms include additives, such as:
(a) disintegrating agents; (b) dispersing agents; (c) wetting agents; (d) at least one preservative,
(e) viscosity enhancing agents, (f) at least one sweetening agent, and (g) at least one flavoring
agent. In some embodiments, the aqueous dispersions can further include a crystalline inhibitor.
[00219] In some embodiments, the liquid formulations also include inert diluents commonly
used in the art, such as water or other solvents, solubilizing agents, and emulsifiers. Exemplary
emulsifiers are ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol,
benzyl benzoate, propyleneglycol, 1,3-butyleneglycol, dimethylformamide, sodium lauryl
sulfate, sodium doccusate, cholesterol, cholesterol esters, taurocholic acid, phosphotidylcho line,
oils, such as cottonseed oil, groundnut oil, corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil, and sesame oil,
glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, fatty acid esters of sorbitan, or
mixtures of these substances, and the like.
[00220] Furthermore, pharmaceutical compositions optionally include one or more pH
adjusting agents or buffering agents, including acids such as acetic, boric, citric, lactic,
phosphoric and hydrochloric acids; bases such as sodium hydroxide, sodium phosphate, sodium
borate, sodium citrate, sodium acetate, sodium lactate and tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane;
and buffers such as citrate/dextrose, sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride. Such acids,
bases and buffers are included in an amount required to maintain pH of the composition in an
acceptable range.
[00221] Additionally, pharmaceutical compositions optionally include one or more salts in an
amount required to bring osmolality of the composition into an acceptable range. Such salts
include those having sodium, potassium or ammonium cations and chloride, citrate, ascorbate,
borate, phosphate, bicarbonate, sulfate, thiosulfate or bisulfite anions; suitable salts include
sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium thiosulfate, sodium bisulfite and ammonium
sulfate.
[00222] Other pharmaceutical compositions optionally include one or more preservatives to
inhibit microbial activity. Suitable preservatives include mercury-containing substances such as
merfen and thiomersal; stabilized chlorine dioxide; and quaternary ammonium compounds such
as benzalkonium chloride, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and cetylpyridinium chloride.

[00231] In certain embodiments, the compositions containing the compound(s) described herein
are administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In certain therapeutic
applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or
condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest at least one of the symptoms
of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use depend on the severity and course of
the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the
drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. Therapeutically effective amounts are
optionally determined by methods including, but not limited to, a dose escalation clinical trial.
[00232] In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein
are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder
or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a "prophylactically effective amount or dose." In
this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like.
When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of
the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to
the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. In one aspect, prophylactic treatments
include administering to a mammal, who previously experienced at least one symptom of the
disease being treated and is currently in remission, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a
compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) in order to prevent a return of the
symptoms of the disease or condition.
[00233] In certain embodiments wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the
doctor's discretion the administration of the compound of Formula (I), (II), (Ila), (III), (IV), or
(IVa) is administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout
the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the
symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.
[00234] In certain embodiments wherein a patient's status does improve, the dose of drug being
administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time
(i.e., a "drug holiday"). In specific embodiments, the length of the drug holiday is between 2

days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7
days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, or more than 28 days. The dose reduction
during a drug holiday is, by way of example only, by 10%-100%, including by way of example
only 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%,        3 0%, 35%, 4 0%, 45%, 50%, 55%,    6 0 %, 6 5%, 70%, 75%, 80%,
85%, 90%, 95%, and 100%.
[00235] In certain embodiments the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily
reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a "drug diversion"). In
specific embodiments, the length of the drug diversion is between 2 days and 1 year, including
by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15
days, 20 days, 28 days, or more than 28 days. The dose reduction during a drug diversion is, by
way of example only, by 10%-100%, including by way of example only 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%,
30%, 3 5%, 4 0%, 45%, 50%, 55% 6 0%, 6 5%, 70%, 75%, 8 0%, 85% 9 0%, 95%, and 100%.
After a suitable length of time, the normal dosing schedule is optionally reinstated.
[00236] In some embodiments, once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a
maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, in specific embodiments, the
dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, is reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to
a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. In certain embodiments,
however, the patient requires intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of
symptoms.
[00237] The amount of a given agent that corresponds to such an amount varies depending
upon factors such as the particular compound, disease condition and its severity, the identity
(e.g., weight, sex) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be determined
according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent
being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or
host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment are typically
in the range of 0.01mg-5000 mg per day. In one aspect, doses employed for adult human
treatment are from about 1mg to about 1000 mg per day. In one embodiment, the desired dose is
conveniently presented in a single dose or in divided doses administered simultaneously (or over
a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub
doses per day.
[00238] In some embodiments, as a patient is started on a regimen of a CSE inhibitor, the
patient is also weaned off (e.g., step-wise decrease in dose) a second treatment regimen (e.g., a
methylxanthine).
[00239] In one embodiment, the daily dosages appropriate for a compound of Formula (I), (II),
(Ila), (III), (IV), or (IVa) described herein are from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg per body
weight. In specific embodiments, an indicated daily dosage in a large mammal, including, but

not limited to, humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 1000 mg, conveniently
administered in divided doses, including, but not limited to, up to four times a day. In one
embodiment, the daily dosage is administered in extended release form. In certain embodiments,
suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from about 1 to 500 mg active
ingredient. In other embodiments, the daily dosage or the amount of active in the dosage form
are lower or higher than the ranges indicated herein, based on a number of variables in regard to
an individual treatment regime. In various embodiments, the daily and unit dosages are altered
depending on a number of variables including, but not limited to, the activity of the compound
used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the
individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the
practitioner.
[00240] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens are determined by
standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not
limited to, the determination of the LD 50 and the ED 50 . The dose ratio between the toxic and
therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it is expressed as the ratio between LD5 o and
ED 5 0 . In certain embodiments, the data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies are
used in formulating the therapeutically effective daily dosage range and/or the therapeutically
effective unit dosage amount for use in mammals, including humans. In some embodiments, the
daily dosage amount of the compounds described herein lies within a range of circulating
concentrations that include the ED 50 with minimal toxicity. In certain embodiments, the daily
dosage range and/or the unit dosage amount varies within this range depending upon the dosage
form employed and the route of administration utilized.

In some embodiments, an in vivo assay for identifying a CSE inhibitor comprises
         (a) preparing organ or tissue homogenates from a test animal that has been administered
a test compound; and
         (b) calculating H 2 S concentration based on absorbance;
wherein a decrease in H2 S concentration indicates that the test compound is a CSE inhibitor. In
some embodiments of the aforementioned assay, the test animal is subjected to normoxia, acute
hypoxia, chronic intermittent hypoxia, hypercapnia, or a combination thereof Optional
intermediate steps include:

Biological Examples
[00288] Measurements of H 2 S levels. H2 S levels in the liver were assayed as follows. Briefly,
liver tissue homogenates were prepared in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 + 0.5%
Triton-X100. The enzyme reaction was carried out in 96 well, deep square well plates with
700ptl Glass Insert (Waters Corporation Cat. #186000349) with TFE/Silicone MicroMat sealing
covers (Sun-SRI Cat. #400 026). In the outer well in a total volume of 200 pl the assay mixture
contained (in final concentration): L-cysteine, (5 mM); pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, (50 PM);
potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, (100 mM); and tissue homogenate (500 jpg protein). The
glass insert contained 100 pl alkaline zinc acetate solution (1% in 0.1N NaOH) to trap the
generated H2 S. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37'C for 3 h and at the end of the
reaction, 100 pl NN-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate (20 ptM in 7N HCl) and 100 pl ferric
chloride (30 ptM in 1.2N HCl) was added to the glass insert. Absorbance was measured at 671
nm using a micro-plate reader. A standard curve relating the concentration of Na2 S and
absorbance was used to calculate H2 S concentration and expressed as nanomoles of H2 S formed
per hour per milligram protein.

Example 2: Acute Post Surgical (Brennan) model of pain in the rat
[00290] The method, which detects antihyperalgesic activity in rats with postoperative pain,
follows that described by Brennan et al (Pain,64 493-501, 1996).
[00291] Incision of the plantar face of the hindpaw in rats is associated with hyperalgesia,
allodynia and spontaneous pain which lasts for 3 - 4 days, and therefore constitutes a model of
postoperative pain in humans. Antihyperalgesics reduce these signs of acute pain
hypersensitivity.
[00292] Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and a 1 cm-longitudinal incision was made
though skin, fascia and muscle of the plantar aspect of the left hindpaw. The wound was then
sutured. After local application of antibiotic pomade, the rats were allowed to recover.
[00293] Test compounds were dosed two hours prior to pain testing (L-propargylglycine (L
PAG), 100 mpk IP; Compound A (Cmpd A), 300 mpk IP). Compound A is (S)-1-(1H-tetrazol-5
yl)-but-3-ynylamine.
Thermal hyperalgesia evaluation: Plantar test
[00294] For heat stimulation, the apparatus (Ugo Basile, Reference: 7371) consisted of
individual acrylic plastic boxes (18 x 11.5 x 14 cm) placed upon an elevated glass floor. A rat
was placed in the box and left free to habituate for 10 minutes. A mobile infrared radiant source
(96  10 mW/cm2 ) was focused under the non-incised and then under the incised hindpaw and
the paw-withdrawal latency was automatically recorded. In order to prevent tissue damage the
heat source was automatically turned off after 45 seconds (Fig. 1).
Tactile hyperalgesia evaluation: Pinchmeter test
[00295] The device consists of a pair of large blunt forceps (15 cm long; flat contact area: 7mm
x 1.5 mmn with smooth edges) equipped with 2 strain gauges connected to a modified electronic
dynamometer. The tips of the forceps are placed around the hind paw of the tested animal and
                                                - 78 -

the force applied is incremented by hand until the paw withdrawal response. The maximum
force applied on the lesioned paw is automatically recorded and displayed by the dynamometer.
In order to prevent tissue damage, the applied force is limited to a maximum of 1 kg. This
procedure is carried out 3 times and the mean force per paw is calculated.
Example 3a: Chronic Constrictive Injury (Bennett) model of neuropathic pain in the rat
[00296] The method, which detects antihyperalgesic activity in rats with neuropathic pain,
follows that described by Bennett and Xie (Pain,33, 87-107, 1988).
[00297] Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the common sciatic nerve in rats is associated with
hyperalgesia, allodynia and spontaneous pain, and therefore constitutes a model for peripheral
neuropathic pain in humans. Antihyperalgesics reduce these chronic signs of pain
hypersensitivity.
[00298] Rats were anesthetized (sodium pentobarbital 40 mg/kg i.p.) and an incision at mid
thigh level was performed to expose the common left sciatic nerve. Four ligatures spaced 1 mm
apart were loosely tied around the sciatic nerve. The wound was then sutured. The rats received
a s.c. injection of Duphamox LA@ and were allowed to recover.
[00299] Test compounds were dosed two hours prior to pain testing (L-PAG, 100 mpk IP;
Compound A (Cmpd A), 300 mpk IP; AMG-517; 3 mpk oral). Compound A is (S)-1-(1H
tetrazol-5-yl)-but-3-ynylamine. AMG-517 is N-[4-[[6-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4
pyrimidinyl]oxy]-2-benzothiazolyl]-acetamide.
Tactile allodynia evaluation: electronic von Frey test
[00300] For tactile stimulation, the animal was placed under an inverted acrylic plastic box (18
x 11.5 x 14 cm) on a grid floor. The tip of an electronic von Frey probe was then applied with
increasing force to the lesioned paw (2 hindpaws for the pre-test) and the force required to
induce paw-withdrawal was automatically recorded. This procedure was carried out 3 times and
the mean force per paw was calculated (Fig. 2).

1 kg. This procedure was carried out 3 times and the mean force per paw is calculated (Fig. 4).
Example 3b: Chronic Constrictive Injury (Bennett) model of neuropathic pain in the rat
(alternate procedure)
[00303] Rats were anesthetized (2.5% Isoflurane) and an incision at mid-thigh level was
performed to expose the common left sciatic nerve through the biceps femoralis muscle. Four
chromic gut (3/0) ligatures spaced 1 mm apart were loosely tied around the sciatic nerve. The
wound was then closed. The rats received a s.c. injection of amoxicillin (4 mg/kg) and were
allowed to recover.
[00304] Test compounds were dosed one or six hours prior to pain testing. Compound A
(Cmpd A), 1, 10, 100 mg/kg PO 6 hours pre test; Gabapentin; 300 mg/kg PO 1 hour pre test).
Compound A is (S)-1-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-but-3-ynylamine.
Tactile allodynia evaluation: electronic von Frey test
[00305] For tactile stimulation, the animal was placed under an inverted acrylic plastic box (18

increasing force to the non lesioned and lesioned paws and the force required to induce paw
withdrawal was automatically recorded. This procedure was carried out 3 times on each paw and
the mean difference in force that elicits withdrawal was calculated (Fig. 7).
Example 4a: Chronic Inflammatory Pain (Freund's adjuvant model) in the rat
[00306] The method, which detects analgesic/anti-inflammatory activity in rats suffering from
acute inflammation, follows that described by Butler et al (Pain,4_8 73-81, 1992).
[00307] An intra- plantar injection of Freund's adjuvant in rats induces clinical signs of
inflammation with pain.
[00308] On Day 0, rats were weighed and injected with a suspension of Mycobacterium
butyricum (Freund's adjuvant) into the plantar surface of one hind paw (0.1 mg in 0.01 ml
paraffin oil, 18pl). The other hind paw was injected with a corresponding volume of saline.

Example 6: CSE inhibition in vivo assay
Target Engagement
[00320] To evaluate in vivo CSE inhibition, male Sprague Dawley rats (approximately 300
grams) were orally dosed with 1, 3, 10, 30 mg/kg Compound A ((S)-1-(lH-tetrazol-5-yl)-but-3
ynylamine) or vehicle (20% HPpCD in water). Two hours post dosing, animals were
anesthetized with isoflurane and approximately 1 gram of liver tissue was removed, quickly
rinsed in ice cold saline and homogenized in ice cold assay buffer (100 mM potassium
phosphate, pH 7.6) plus 0.5% Triton X-100 using a BioSpec Products Tissue-Tearor. Samples
were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4'C at 20,000 X G and the supernatant was collected. Protein
was determined by Pierce BCA assay using BSA as a standard.
[00321] Inhibition of CSE-mediated H2S generation from cysteine was determined by
incubating 200 pg liver homogenate protein in assay buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH
7.6) plus 10 mM L-cysteine and 50 pM pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (200 gl final volume) for 3
hours at 37'C in the outer well of 96-well deep well plates containing glass inserts (Waters
#186000349) with 100 gl of trapping solution (1% alkaline zinc acetate in 0.2N NaOH) to
capture the liberated H 2S and sealed with TFE/silicone sealing mat (Sun SRI #400 026). The
reaction was stopped and the H2S that was generated was determined adding 100 pl of 20 mM
N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulphate in 7.2N HCl followed by addition of 100 pl of 30
mM FeCl 3 -6H 20 in 1.2N HCl. After mixing for 20 minutes at room temperature, 200 Pl of this
solution was transferred to a standard 96-well clear bottom assay plate and absorbance at 671
nm was measured using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Results were
normalized to no lysate control level (Fig. 10).
Duration of Effect
[00322] To evaluate in vivo duration of effect of CSE inhibition, male Sprague Dawley rats
(approximately 300 grams) were orally dosed with 30 mg/kg Compound A ((S)-1-(1H-tetrazol
5-yl)-but-3-ynylamine) or vehicle (20% HP3CD in water). Two, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 or 144
hours post dosing animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and approximately 1 gram of liver
tissue was removed, quickly rinsed in ice cold saline and homogenized in ice cold assay buffer
(100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.6) plus 0.5% Triton X-100 using a BioSpec Products
Tissue-Tearor. Samples were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4'C at 20,000 X G and the
supernatant was collected. Protein was determined by Pierce BCA assay using BSA as a
standard.

[00323] Inhibition of CSE-mediated H2 S generated from cysteine was determined by
incubating 200 pg liver homogenate protein in assay buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH
7.6) plus 10 mM L-cysteine and 50 tM pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (200 tl final volume) for 3
hours at 370C in the outer well of 96-well deep well plates containing glass inserts (Waters
#186000349) with 100 pl of trapping solution (1% alkaline zinc acetate in 0.2N NaOH) to
capture the liberated H 2S and sealed with TFE/silicone sealing mat (Sun SRI #400 026). The
reaction was stopped and the H2 S that was generated was determined adding 100 pl of 20 mM
N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulphate in 7.2N HCl followed by addition of 100 pl of 30
mM FeCl 3 -6H 2 0 in 1.2N HCl. After mixing for 20 minutes at room temperature, 200 Pl of the
solution was transferred to a standard 96-well clear bottom assay plate and absorbance at 671
nm was measured using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Results were
normalized to no lysate control level (Fig. 11).
