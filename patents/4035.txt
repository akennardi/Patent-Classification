       POSITIONING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ARC WELDING CONSUMABLES
 [0001]       The present disclosure relates generally to welding apparatuses, and more
 particularly to arc welding apparatuses such as Metal Inert Gas (MIG) or Gas Metal Arc
 Welding (GMAW) welding guns, including consumables for generating a welding arc and
 diffusing a shield gas.
 [0002]       The statements in this section merely provide background information related to
 the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.
 [0003]       In an arc welding apparatus, such as Metal Inert Gas (MIG) or Gas Metal Arc
 Welding (GMAW) welding gun, a welding wire is fed through the welding gun to provide a
 molten metal pool to join metal work pieces together. An inert gas is directed through the
 front (distal) end of the welding gun to provide a surrounding layer or blanket of shielding
 gas to protect the molten metal pool from atmospheric contamination. The inert gas is
 typically a combination of various gases such as argon or helium, among others.
 [0004] A prior art MIG or GMAW welding gun typically includes a contact tip and a gas
 diffuser connected to the contact tip. The contact tip has a central bore to guide the
 welding wire to the work pieces. The contact tip transfers electrical current to the welding
 wire. The contact tip is typically threaded into the gas diffuser and the gas diffuser defines
 gas passageways that direct the shielding gas around the contact tip. The contact tip and
 gas diffuser are constantly subjected to high heat and are susceptible to wear due to high
 temperature operation. A nozzle assembly surrounds the contact tip and gas diffuser. The
 nozzle assembly further directs the shielding gas towards the work pieces to blanket the
 molten metal pool.
                                            SUMMARY
 [0005]       The present disclosure generally provides a nozzle assembly comprising an
 insulator having a plurality of grooves around an outer periphery, a plurality of sealing
 members disposed within the grooves of the insulator, and a nozzle body slip-fit around the
 insulator, such that at least one of the insulator and the nozzle body define position indicia.
 In one form, the insulator has a scale along its outer periphery as the position indicia.
 According to another form, the insulator defines a plurality of position rings disposed along
 its outer periphery as the scale. The plurality of position rings may comprise a light duty
 ring, a medium duty ring, and a heavy duty ring. The nozzle body may define at least one
 window or aperture through which a scale can be viewed as the position indicia.
 [0006]       The nozzle assembly may also be attached to a conductor tube that includes
 position indicia.   The nozzle body may include a proximal end extension that allows
                                                 1

 alignment of the nozzle body with the position indicia on the conductor tube in order to
 adjust the nozzle body so that it is in a desired positional relationship with a contact tip.
 [0007]      The nozzle body may further comprise a distal end face and an exterior surface
 defining an index marking for measuring a trim distance for a welding liner. The distal end
 face abuts a portion of a conductor tube, and the welding liner extends distally from the
 portion of the conductor tube, for the measuring of the welding liner to extend into a contact
 tip. A length between a distal end face of the conductor tube and the index marking of the
 nozzle body defines the trim distance. The nozzle body may also include a tapered end
 portion, such that the trim distance is measured along the tapered end portion or
 perpendicular to the distal end face.
 [0008]      According to another aspect of the present disclosure, an arc welding apparatus
 is provided. The arc welding apparatus comprises a handle, a conductor tube attached to
 the handle, and a consumable assembly attached to the conductor tube. The consumable
 assembly comprises both a contact tip and the nozzle assembly as previously described
 above and further defined herein, wherein at least one of an insulator and a nozzle body
 define position indicia.
 [0009]      According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure a method of adjusting
 the positioning of a distal opening of a nozzle body with a distal end face of a contact tip in
 an arc welding apparatus is provided. The method generally comprises providing an arc
 welding apparatus as previously described above and further defined herein that defines
 position indicia and aligning a nozzle body with the position indicia in order to adjust the
 positioning of a distal opening of the nozzle body with the distal end face of a contact tip.
 The nozzle body is aligned with the position indicia by locating the position indicia so that it
 can be viewed through at least one window or aperture in the nozzle body.
 [0010]      Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided
 herein. It should be understood that the description and specific examples are intended for
 purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present
 disclosure.

 [0049]       The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only and are not
 intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.
                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 [0050] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit
 the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be understood that throughout the
 drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and
 features. Although the term "MIG" and "GMAW" are used within the specification, it should
 be understood that the teachings of the present disclosure apply to any type of welding or
 cutting apparatus.
 [0051]       Referring to FIG. 1, an arc welding apparatus, such as a MIG or GMAW welding
 gun, is illustrated and generally indicated by reference numeral 10. The MIG welding gun
 10 includes a handle 12, a conductor tube 14 attached to the handle 12, and a consumable
 assembly 16 attached to the conductor tube 14. The handle 12 is connected to a welding
 cable 18 that carries welding current, shielding gas, and a welding wire 20 from a power
 source (not shown), a gas source (not shown), and a wire feeder (not shown) to the
 welding gun 10.
 [0052]       The consumable assembly 16 includes a plurality of consumable components
 including a nozzle assembly 22 and a contact tip 24. The structure and operation of an
 exemplary arc welding apparatus has been disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,491,321 and
 5,338,917, which are commonly owned by the assignee of the present application, and the
 contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.     In addition, the
 structure and operation of the arc welding apparatus 10 incorporating a contact tip that
 provides for the function as a contact tip and a diffuser has been disclosed in related U.S.
 Published Application No. 2013/0126506, which is commonly owned by the assignee of the
 present application, and the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their
 entirety.
 [0053]       Referring to FIG. 2, the consumable assembly 16 is connected to a distal end
 portion 26 of the conductor tube 14. A nozzle assembly 22 is substantially cylindrical in
 one form and receives the distal end portion 26 of the conductor tube 14 therein. In one
 form, a contact tip 46 is coaxially disposed inside the nozzle assembly 22, which has a
 seating surface 28 that is configured to mate with an end portion 30 (which in one form is
 spherical as shown, but could be any shape including a linear or polynomial taper) of the
 contact tip 24 into the distal end portion 26 of the conductor tube 14.
                                                 5

WO 2015/073605                                                            PCT/US2014/065346
 [0054]       In one form the nozzle assembly 22 is secured onto the distal end 26 of the
 conductor tube assembly 40, and the contact tip 24 engages the seating surface 28 of a
 nozzle insert 44.      As the nozzle assembly 22 is tightened onto the conductor tube
 assembly 40, the seating surface 28 engages against the shoulder 46 of the contact tip 24,
 thereby urging the spherical tapered end 48 of the contact tip 24 into the spherical tapered
 seat 50 of the conductor tube 14. The nozzle insert 44 tightens onto the conductor tube
 assembly 40 and the spherical tapered end 48 of the contact tip 24 is secured into
 engagement with the tapered seat 50.
 [0055]       The conductor tube 14 defines an internal passageway 52, and a conduit liner
 54 is disposed within the internal passageway 52 as shown. The conduit liner 54 has a
 guiding channel 56 for guiding the welding wire 20 (not shown) to the contact tip 24. The
 conduit liner 54 may extend into an internal cavity 58 of the contact tip 24. The positioning
 of the conduit liner 54 within the internal cavity 58 provides a continuous guiding channel
 56 for directly feeding the welding wire into the contact tip 24.
 [0056] Referring to FIGS. 3A and 3B, an alternate form of a nozzle assembly 900
 comprises a distal end face 902 and an exterior surface 904. The exterior surface 904 of
 the nozzle assembly 900 defines an index marking 906. The index marking 906 indicates a
 trim distance 908 to assist the user for properly measuring the conduit liner 32 to a correct
 length that extends from the conductor tube 14. The user can measure the trim distance
 908 by abutting the distal end face 902 of the nozzle assembly 900 against an end portion
 914 of the conductor tube 14.
 [0057] The nozzle assembly 900 in one form may include a tapered end portion 912, and
 the index marking 906 may be positioned on this tapered end portion 912 of the nozzle
 assembly 900. The measurement of the trim distance 908 may be measured perpendicular
 to the distal end face of the of the nozzle body, as shown in FIG 3A. Alternatively, it is
 contemplated the trim distance may be measured along the exterior surface 904 of the
 tapered end portion 912 of a nozzle body 918, as shown in FIG 3B. The index marking 906
 in one form is a groove extending around the exterior surface of the nozzle assembly 900.
 It should be understood, however, that various markings or indicia may be employed while
 remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. Such indicia may include, by way of
 example, knurling bands, intermittent circumferential markings, or color, among others.
 [0058] Referring to FIG. 3C, in operation, when measuring the trim distance, the user
 abuts the distal end face 902 of the nozzle body 918 to the end portion 914 of the
 conductor tube14 as shown. The user is then able to quickly line up and trim the conduit
 liner 32 with the index marking 906 for the correct trim distance 908, which then extends
 into the internal cavity 118 of the contact tip 46 (shown in FIG. 2).

WO 2015/073605                                                             PCT/US2014/065346
  [0059] Proper positioning of the conduit liner 32 within the contact tip 24, or "stick-out"
  relative to the distal end portion 26 of the conductor tube 14, is a factor for the correct
 operation of the welding torch 10.The conduit liner 32 directs the welding wire 20 through
 the welding cable 18, torch 10, conductor tube 14 and into the contact tip 23. The correct
 trim distance 908 reduces the likelihood of jams, hang-ups or "birdnesting" of the welding
 wire 20 within the torch. For example, referring to FIG. 3D, if the trim distance is too short,
 a gap 234 between the conduit liner 32 and the contact tip 24 may be large enough that the
 welding wire 20 may be unsupported, causing the wire to sporadically wobble or become
 jammed 232 before entering an orifice 236 of the contact tip 24. In one form, the proper
 trim distance is 3/8 inches, which is based on a torch having an amperage rating between
 approximately140 to 600 Amps and a specific geometry of the internal cavity 58 of the
 contact tip 24. It should be understood that 3/8 inches is merely exemplary and should not
  be construed as limiting the scope of the present disclosure.
  [0060]      Additional aspects of the location and features of the conduit liner 32 within the
  internal cavity 58 of the contact tip 24 has been disclosed in U.S. Published Application No.
 2013/0126504 Al, which is commonly owned by the assignee of the present application,
 and the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
  [0061]      Referring to FIGS. 4A-4C, the conductor tube 14 can define a variety of
 geometries, and, a curved geometry of various degrees is used depending on the
 application requirements. The conductor tube 14 alternatively could be straight or flexible
 and configurable as has been disclosed in U.S. Published Application No. 2007/0284354,
 which is commonly owned by the assignee of the present application, and the contents of
 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The conductor tube assembly
 40 extends a length between its distal end 41 and its proximal end 51. The proximal end 51
  is adapted to be secured to the handle 12 of the welding gun 10, and the distal end 41 of
 the conductor tube 14 is adapted to receive the consumable assembly 16 (as shown in
  FIG. 1).
  [0062]      The distal end 41 of the conductor tube 14 provides unique features to allow for
 an efficient and robust connection with the consumable assembly 16, the nozzle assembly
 22, and the contact tip 24.      For example, in one form, the distal end 41 has an outer
 surface 49 that includes two opposing flat faces 59, that allows for an anti-rotational
 engagement with a sleeve (not shown). Additionally, in another form, the distal end 41 has
 a threaded opening 62 through at least one of the flat faces 59 for securing the sleeve.
  [0063]      The conductor tube 14 is typically made from a copper alloy or other metal that
  has conductive properties and then is coated with an insulation material 64, which in one
 form may be silicone, and finally covered with a tube jacket 66 to provide durability and
                                                 7

WO 2015/073605                                                               PCT/US2014/065346
 additional insulation from the electric current, which flows through the conductor tube 14
 during operation of the welding gun 10. The tube jacket 66 by way of example may be
 made from a brass or stainless steel metal or alloy in one form of the present disclosure.
 [0064]      As shown in FIG. 5, the conductor tube 14 is a hollow member defining the
 internal passageway 52. The internal passageway 52 includes a tailored cavity 70. The
 tailored cavity 70 is shaped to receive an alignment device (not shown in this figure), which
 in one form is press-fit therein. In addition, the internal passageway 52 at the distal end 72
 includes a spherical tapered seat 50 forming a contact surface that engages with the
 contact tip 24.
 [0065]      FIG. 6 summarizes and illustrates components of the conductor tube assembly
 40 and the consumable assembly 16. The consumable assembly 16 includes the nozzle
 assembly 22 and the contact tip 24. The consumable assembly 16 is secured to the distal
 end 41 of the conductor tube 14 via the sleeve 60, and the collar assembly 50 pretensions
 the consumable assembly 16 to the conductor tube assembly 40 as previously set forth.
 [0066]       The contact tip 24 has a body that defines an internal cavity extending from its
 proximal end portion to its distal end portion.        Advantageously, the contact tip 24 is
 designed to function as both a contact tip for transferring electric current to the welding wire
 and a gas diffuser for diffusing shielding gas around the molten metal pool, thus providing a
 dual function while eliminating an additional component (i.e., a separate gas diffuser) from
 the consumable assembly 16.
 [0067]      Referring to FIGS. 7A-7C and 8-11, the nozzle assembly 22 includes a nozzle
 body 68 that is in one form generally cylindrical, an insulator 74, and a nozzle insert 44. As
 shown, the outer nozzle 68 extends from a proximal opening 78 to a distal opening 80.
 The nozzle body 68 may further include a nose portion 82 that narrows or extends inwardly
 to properly direct the shielding gas for a given application in relation to maintain the desired
 space 84 (FIG. 7A) for the contact tip 24. The nozzle insert 44 has a proximal end portion
 86 and a distal end portion 88 and includes a central bore 90 extending from the proximal
 end portion 86 towards the distal end portion 88. The nozzle insert 44 at its distal end
 portion 88 defines an internal gas diverter 92. The internal gas diverter 92 further defines a
 seating surface 28 toward the proximal end portion of the nozzle insert 44. The seating
 surface 28 is chamfered in one form, for engaging the angled shoulder 46 of the contact tip
 24. The internal gas diverter 92 defines a profiled diverter orifice 94 that extends distally
 from the central bore 90.
 [0068]      As shown in FIG. 7C, the profiled diverter orifice 94 extends around the
 apertures 96 of the contact tip 24. The gas flow, indicated by the path arrows 167, is
 directed distally through the internal cavity 58, and then radially outwards through the
                                                  8

WO 2015/073605                                                             PCT/US2014/065346
 apertures 96. The profiled diverter orifice 94 then directs the gas flow exiting the apertures
 96 distally around an exterior portion of the contact tip 24 as shown. The profiled diverter
 orifice 94 may extend various lengths from the contact seat 28 (as shown in FIGS. 7A and
 7B) and include a variety of geometries, in addition to the chamfered configurations as
 illustrated herein. In addition, the profiled diverter orifice 94 may extend at any angle that
 will change the direction of the shield gas to improve the flow characteristics or cooling of
 the contact tip 24 and surrounding nozzle assembly 22.            For example, to generate a
 laminar flow along the length of the contact tip 24.
 [0069]       The nozzle insert 44 may be manufactured by various methods including
 machining or a metal injection molding process, also known as MIM.             In addition, the
 nozzle insert may be made from various metals and alloys, for example, in one form the
 nozzle insert 44 is made of brass.
 [0070]       According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a nozzle assembly is
 provided that comprises an insulator having a plurality of grooves around an outer
 periphery. The insulator has a plurality of sealing members disposed within the grooves of
 the insulator, and a nozzle body slip-fit around the insulator.
 [0071]       Referring now to FIGS. 12, 13A and 13B, in another form, the nozzle assembly
 includes a nozzle body 68 that is slip-fit around an insulator 74. As shown in FIG. 12, the
 insulator 74 and a nozzle insert 44 define an assembly and are secured to the sleeve 60 on
 the conductor tube assembly 40.        In one form, the insulator 74 is secured around the
 nozzle insert 44. As further shown in Figs. 13A and 13B, the insulator 74 includes a
 plurality of grooves 102 around its outer periphery. The grooves 102 are used for locating
 and seating sealing members 180, which provide a sealing engagement between the
 nozzle body 68 and the insulator 74. In one form, the sealing members 104 are spring
 rings that are located within the grooves 102. Although the insulator 74 is illustrated with
 three (3) grooves 102, it should be understood that a greater or fewer number may be used
 depending on the application and the length of the nozzle body 68, among other operating
 parameters.
 [0072] The insulator 74 may further include various features on its exterior surface to allow
 for positioning the insulator 74 without the use of any tools. The insulator 74 may further
 include a tail portion 250 having position indicia 260, such as scale lines 265 along the
 outer periphery, as shown by way of example, for properly positioning the nozzle body 68
 over the insulator 74. In one form, the indicia 260 is a plurality of position rings 270
 disposed around the outer periphery of the insulator 74 as shown. The position rings 270
 or indicia 260 may be used to provide information to the user regarding the proper
 positioning of the nozzle body for the welding application, rated duty cycle and/or
                                                 9

WO 2015/073605                                                            PCT/US2014/065346
 application of the nozzle assembly 22. The position rings 270 or indicia 260 may assist a
 user in determining a nozzle distance 275, as will be discussed below in further detail.
 [0073] The insulator may also include exterior features that assist with gripping the
 insulator 74 for tightening and removing the insulator from the conductor tube assembly 40.
 In one example the exterior features may include a series of grooves 280 extend along the
 exterior surface, but if would be appreciated that various surface texturing may provide an
 improved gripping surface.
 [0074] Referring to FIG. 14A and 14B, the indicia 260, in another form, allows the user to
 align the nozzle body 68 with the position indicia 260 for adjusting and positioning the distal
 opening 80 of the nozzle body 68 relative the distal end face of the contact tip 24. The
 nozzle body 68 includes a window 290 for viewing the indicia 260 to locate the proper
 position of the nozzle body 68.      In other forms, the window 290 may be any aperture
 through the nozzle body 68, and there may be one or numerous windows spaced around
 the nozzle body 68.
 [0075] Referring back to FIGS. 15 and 16, the nozzle body 68 may further include an
 external surface pattern 272 to provide an improved grip for securing, positioning and
 removing the nozzle assembly 22. In one form, the nozzle body 68 the surface pattern 272
 is formed by knurling. The nozzle body 68 may also include exterior surface markings to
 indicate the rated duty cycle or application of the nozzle assembly 22. In one example, the
 exterior markings define a ring 274 around the nozzle body 68, where no ring is used to
 indicate a light duty application, one ring is used to indicate a medium duty application and
 two rings are used to indicate a heavy duty application. However, it should be appreciated
 that any indicia and/or surface patterns may be used to indicate the rated duty cycle and/or
 application of the nozzle assembly 22. However, it should be appreciated that any indicia
 and/or surface patterns may be used to indicate the rated duty cycle and/or application of
 the nozzle assembly 22.
 [0076] Referring to FIGS. 17 and 18A to 18D, another form of the indicia 260 is on the
 collar body 65 for allowing a nozzle distance 275 to be set by aligning the proximal opening
 78 of the nozzle body 68 with the desired nozzle distance 275.        In one form there is an
 initial position and three additional positions for setting the nozzle distance 275.         As
 shown in FIG. 18A, an initial exemplary position where the distal end face 26 of the contact
 tip 24 is recessed within the nozzle body 68 to the nozzle distance 275 of approximately
 1/4 inches. Referring to FIG. 18B, an example of a first position is shown with the distal
 end face 26 of the contact tip is recessed within the nozzle body 68 to the nozzle distance
 275 of approximately 1/8 inches. As shown in FIG. 18C, an example of a second position
 is shown and in this form, the distal end face 26 of the contact tip 24 is flush with the distal
                                                 10

WO 2015/073605                                                            PCT/US2014/065346
 opening 80 of the nozzle body 174. Referring to FIG. 18D, another example of a third
 position is shown with the distal end face 26 of the contact tip 24 protruding beyond the
 distal opening a nozzle distance of approximately 1/8 inches.      Therefore, the indicia 260
 on the collar body 65 is used to allow the user to quickly adjust the nozzle position without
 having to perform any manual measurements between the distal opening 80 of the nozzle
 body 68 and the distal end face 26 of the contact tip 24.    It should be understood that the
 specific dimensions of 1/4 and 1/8 inches are merely exemplary and should not be
 construed as limiting the scope of the present disclosure.
 [0077] Alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 19, the position indicia 260 may be on the
 conductor tube 14, and the nozzle body 68 includes a proximal extension 218 that extends
 beyond the collar assembly (not shown). The proximal extension 218 of the nozzle body 68
 allows the user to align a proximal edge 78 of the nozzle body with the indicia 260 on the
 conductor tube 14 for adjusting the nozzle body 68 into the desired positional relationship
 with the contact tip.
 [0078] The position indicia 260 can be various scales to allow for quick adjustment to the
 location of the nozzle body 68 for various applications and a nozzle distance between distal
 opening 80 of the nozzle body 68 and the distal end face 26 of the contact tip 24.
 [0079]      The consumable components are typically, rated to a duty cycle. The duty cycle
 is usually determined by the duration of the weld operation and the amperage used during
 continuous operation of the welding gun.      For example, a light duty application may be
 considered to be those welding operations that are rated and use approximately 250
 amperes and below.       A medium duty application may be considered to be welding
 operations with a range from approximately 250 amperes to approximately 350 amperes,
 and a heavy duty application is generally 350 amperes and above.
 [0080]      Referring to FIG. 20, in one form, a nozzle assembly 200 for a light duty
 application. The nozzle assembly 200 comprises a nozzle body 202 and an insulator 204.
 The insulator 204 may be over molded onto the nozzle body 202. As further shown, the
 insulator 204 defines an internal bore 206 having a plurality of detents 208 at a proximal
 end portion 207. The detents 208 are a series of grooves that are spaced along the internal
 bore 206 to progressively engage sealing members 216. The user can adjust the relative
 position of the nozzle with the distal end of the contact tip 24 depending on the
 engagement between the detents 208 and the sealing members 216.
 [0081]      The insulator, whether a plastic material or other insulator, has a high strength,
 hardness and rigidity to provide for durability of the nozzle body 202 and the detents 208.
 For example, the over molded insulator 204 may be made from a thermoset polyester,
                                               11

WO 2015/073605                                                             PCT/US2014/065346
 such as BMC 6605. However, it is appreciated that the insulator 204 may be any insulating
 material that can withstand the amperage for the duty cycle of the welding application.
 [0082]      Referring to FIG. 21, another form of a nozzle assembly 300 for a light duty
 application is shown. The nozzle assembly 300 comprises a nozzle body 302, an insulator
 304, and a nozzle sleeve 306. In this form, the nozzle assembly 300 is assembled together
 by a crimping process to secure the insulator 304 and the nozzle sleeve 309 within the
 nozzle body 302. The nozzle sleeve 309 defines an internal bore 306 of the nozzle body
 302. The internal bore 306 further defines a plurality of detents 308 at a proximal end
 portion 307. The nozzle sleeve 309 may be a made of various materials including metals
 such as a copper alloy, brass alloy, or alternately plastic materials. Other materials may be
 used as long as the material and withstand the heat of the application and the amperage
 needed for the specific welding application. For example, in a light duty application is
 generally between 250 to 350 Amperes.
 [0083]      An insert assembly 210, in one form, is the same for both forms of the nozzle
 body 200, 300 of the light duty applications. The insert assembly 210 has a proximal
 exterior surface 212 with a plurality of groove 214, and a plurality of spring bands 216. The
 spring bands in this form are split ring metal seals that provide an outward bias and engage
 into the detents to provide a user with a haptic feedback on the position of the nozzle
 assembly. The spring bands also provide a bias force to secure the nozzle assembly 200,
 300 to the insert assembly 210. The insert assembly 210 is threaded onto the conductor
 tube (not shown) and secures the contact tip 24 to the conductor tube (not shown). The
 insert assembly 210 for the light duty applications has two grooves 214 each for retaining a
 spring band 216. The nozzle bodies 200, 300 define three detents 216 that secure the
 nozzle body 200, 300 in three positions relative to a distal opening of the nozzle body and
 the contact tip. The nozzle body slides and locks the detents into positions relative to the
 contact tip for adjusting the flow characteristics of the shield gas to accommodate a wide
 variety of welding parameters and user preferences.
 [0084]      Referring now to FIGS. 22 and 23, another form of the nozzle assembly for
 medium and heavy duty applications is described. The nozzle assembly may be scaled
 and sized to accommodate a variety of diameters of welding wire and consumables
 components. It is also appreciated that the materials may vary depending on the duty cycle
 and the amperage rating. In this form, the nozzle assembly 400 includes a nozzle body
 402. The nozzle body 402 may be a singular metal component, typically a copper alloy, but
 may be formed of various other metals and alloys, among other temperature and durability
 capable materials, while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. The nozzle
                                                12

WO 2015/073605                                                            PCT/US2014/065346
 body 402 has an internal bore 406 with a plurality of detents 408 within a portion 407 of the
 internal bore 406.
 [0085]       The medium and heavy duty applications may also include in an alternate form
 an insert assembly 410 that includes a nozzle insert 418, insulator 420 and a slip adapter
 420, which are secured together in one form by a crimping process. However, it should be
 understood that various processes may be used to secure the components of the insert
 assembly 410 while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. The slip adapter
 422 defines a proximal exterior surface 412 with a plurality of grooves 414, and a plurality
 of spring bands 416. The spring bands 416 in this form include a split spring ring, as in the
 previous forms and a spring metal band 424. The grooves 414 may vary in width to
 accommodate the spring band 416. And the spring bands 416 may be customized, such as
 by way of example, a metal band 424 that defines circumferentially spaced protrusions
 426. The metal band provide the biased outward force and the protrusions 426 are
 designed to engage within the plurality of detents 408 of the internal bore 406 of the nozzle
 body 402. During adjusting of the nozzle body 402 the protrusions 426 provide tactile
 feedback and assist the user with locating the nozzle body 402 at the desired location
 relative to the distal end of the contact tip (not shown).
 [0086] In FIG. 24, various forms of consumable assemblies having a nozzle body 802,
 802', 802" and a contact tip 846, 846', 846" are shown. Both the nozzle body 802, 802',
 802" and the contact tip 846, 846', 846" define exterior surfaces having matching indicia
 800, 800', 800" to assist with identifying the correct pairing of the nozzle body 802, 802',
 802" with the contact tip 846, 846', 846". The matching indicia 800 may correspond to a
 duty rating for pairing the nozzle body 802 with the contact tip 846.
 [0087]       For example, the matching indicia 800 may be a series of grooves on the
 exterior surfaces 804, as shown. Generally, the number of grooves increases as the duty
 rating increases or may be selected for pairing the contact tip and nozzle body for a
 specific application.    For example, one (1) set groove on each of the nozzle body and
 contact tip indicates a light duty application. Two (2) sets of grooves indicates a medium
 duty application, and three (3) sets of grooves indicates a heavy duty application., In one
 form, the number of grooves is four (4) to indicate the nozzle body 802" and contact tip
 846" for a specific duty cycle and tapered application. It is further contemplated that the
 exterior surface of the nozzle may alternately define various indicia that are easily matched
 with corresponding indicia on the contact tip, rather than the matching bands as illustrated
 herein. In another form, the nozzle body 802 may include a series of knurl bands that are
 matched with a series of grooves on the exterior surface of the contact tip. The grooves
 may further be defined as any raised or recessed surface texture, knurling or raised bands
                                                  13

 that provide visual indication or indicia to the exterior surface of the consumable
 component.      Accordingly, the use of grooves is merely exemplary and should not be
 construed as limiting the scope of the present disclosure.
 [0088]      According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a method of adjusting the
 positioning of a distal opening of a nozzle body with a distal end face of a contact tip in an
 arc welding apparatus is provided.      Referring to Figure 25, the method 1000 generally
 provides 1005 an arc welding apparatus constructed according to the present disclosure
 that has a handle, a conductor tube attached to the handle; and a consumable assembly
 attached to the conductor tube; the consumable assembly including a contact tip and a
 nozzle assembly. The nozzle assembly comprises an insulator with a plurality of grooves
 around an outer periphery, a plurality of sealing members disposed within the grooves of
 the insulator; and a nozzle body slip-fit around the insulator, such that the insulator defines
 position indicia. The nozzle body is aligned 1010 with the position indicia in order to adjust
 the positioning of the distal opening of the nozzle body with the distal end face of the
 contact tip. The alignment of the nozzle body with the position indicia involves locating the
 position indicia so that it can be viewed through at least one window or aperture in the
 nozzle body.
 [0089]      The various forms of the present disclosure provide a simplified structure, more
 uniform heat distribution and improved cooling to increase consumable life, among other
 benefits. The various forms of the present disclosure further provide additional adjustments
 to a nozzle assembly, thereby allowing a consumable assembly to be adaptable for a wider
 variety of applications.
