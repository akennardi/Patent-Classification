SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR GENERATING STEAM BY CREATING
SHOCKWAVES IN A SUPERSONIC GASEOUS VORTEX
Field
[0001] This disclosure relates to systems and methods for generating steam using an apparatus
that creates shockwaves in a supersonic gaseous vortex.
Background
[0002] In any non-nuclear power station or ship operating on the Brayton Cycle, the cost of the
steam boilers is one of the major capital costs. Shipping companies which used to operate on
the Brayton cycle in their ships have switched to the Otto or Diesel cycle because they can
operate at 50-54% efficiency. Conventional boilers occupy considerable real estate and are
involved in most of the legislation regarding permitting for power stations. They have some
inherent disadvantages, which are taken for granted in the power industry. Because the boiler
tubes holding steam can only accept a relatively small amount of heat per unit area, the area of
boiler tubes in a large power station is quite considerable. The heat losses through the outside of
the boiler itself are a major problem in design and operation. There is a significant volume of
heat carried away in the ash, but by far the major heat loss from the boiler is up the chimney.
Even with economisers, which are essentially a secondary boiler used to recover the low-grade
heat after the main boiler, the flue gases are still quite hot, and represent the most significant
loss of energy in the whole boiler system.
[0003] Steam moderated combustion is a technique that has been employed for over one
hundred years in steam engines and steam powered generators. The exhaust steam from the
pistons driving the wheels in a classical steam engine is vented up the exhaust stack of the steam
engine primarily to assist in the draft through the combustion chamber but it has the added
benefit of being catalyzed by the carbon particles present in the exhaust and breaking down into
hydrogen and carbon monoxide which is then combusted. This results in much lower exhaust
emissions from the steam engine, and a significant increase in the draft in the boiler and hence
the rate of combustion. The reduction in soot is a feature which is only recently appreciated.
Many boilers running on dirty fuel use either continuous or pulsed steam injection to clean the
fire tubes. This steam injection keeps the interior of the boiler clean but also assists in the

                                                  2
catalytic breakdown of large soot particles which would otherwise be ejected from the exhaust
stack.
[0004] Modern steam moderated combustion has two principally different aims. One is to
increase the efficiency of combustion of problematic fuels. The other relates to oxygen (instead
of air)-assisted combustion to generate steam and carbon dioxide without the nitrogen diluent
associated with air combustion. The carbon dioxide so produced is not diluted with nitrogen and
is readily separated using a variety of commonly available methods. The carbon dioxide so
produced is then often sequestered in the ground.
[0005] There are a number of flare gas systems that are designed primarily to reduce or
ameliorate the black smoke generated by flares. The auto ignition temperature of most
hydrocarbon fuels is between about 300 'C and about 650 'C and it is not commonly realized in
the industry that, if the steam is above 700 'C, even if the fuel air ratios are not correct, ignition
and combustion will proceed without an external ignition source.
[0006] Steam or water injection has been commonly employed since the advent of internal
combustion engines. Modern heavy fuel ship engines use water or steam injection at different
phases of the typical two stoke cycle to once again aid in the clean combustion of low rank fuels
and increase the overall thermodynamic efficiency.
[0007] Electrically assisted combustion systems involve an exchange of electrons between the
fuel and the oxygen in the air. This simple fact is quite often ignored in the fundamental design
of combustion systems. Many combustion engineers know that something like this is necessary
for stable combustion and become experts in designing flame front plates or other devices which
are not commonly realized as electron donors. There are a number of companies that offer
electrically assisted combustion. These systems are used when for whatever reason the
combustion is not stable. With the addition of appropriate voltages amperages and in the right
position, a given burner flame can be moderated or controlled across a very wide fuel/air ratio at
a wide variety of pressures. If a given burner is driven too hard, then there is invariably a very
significant Joule Thompson cooling effect across the burner. This quite often results in the
burner flame being extinguished because the fuel and air mix is reduced below the auto ignition
temperature. By injecting electricity into the burner at the appropriate place a given burner can
be stabilized and run efficiently on inconsistent fuel rates and fuel/air ratios. With the injection

                                                   3
of electricity, the effective auto ignition temperature may be dropped by about 2 'C to 300 'C.
Electrical assistance in the combustor or burner may lead to very high turndown ratios of better
than 10-to-1.
[0008] A number of companies around the world have patented and developed ultrasonically
assisted combustion burners with a view to be able to efficiently combust low rank coals and
shale oil directly. These ultrasonic combustors effectively fragment the fuel and mix it
thoroughly with the air giving more efficient fuel utilization and more complete combustion.
Ultrasonic burners are typically much smaller than conventional burners of the same output
because of the fuel fragmentation and a very thorough mixing in a very short flight path and
hence a much smaller burner. Ultrasonic burners also enable the efficient combustion of oil and
water emulsions which under normal circumstances would be nonflammable. Ultrasonic
burners are also used to thoroughly mix limestone and other Sulphur scavengers with high
Sulphur fuel which reduces the need for post-combustion gas cleanup.
[0009] Steam eductors have been around for over 100 years and at first glance the principals
involved seem quite counterintuitive. Water typically is pumped into the boiler in boiler
systems to replace the water lost into the steam which is used in whatever application is needed.
The modern approach simply is to a use high-pressure water pump. However, in the past a
steam eductor was commonly used to pump freshwater back into the boiler using the steam
pressure in the boiler. This can be considered counterintuitive because one may wonder how the
steam pressure in the boiler can be used to pump water back into the boiler. With the use of a
steam educator, which comprises one or more venturies in series, the water is accelerated up to
the point where its inertia is high enough to overcome pressure inside the boiler. In essence, one
is virtually lifting oneself by pulling on one's bootstraps. This same principle can be used to
compress air. With the use of suitable venturi, steam may be used to entrain air and thereby
compress it typically up to half the pressure of the incoming steam.
[0010] For example, if the steam pressure is 60 bar or 1000psi, then it may be used to compress
an equivalent weight of air of about 30 bar or 500 psi. The actual pressures delivered depend on
a number of factors but this is presented here solely as a general rule.

                                                  4
Summary
 [0011] One aspect of the present disclosure relates to a system configured for generating steam
using an apparatus that creates shockwaves in a supersonic gaseous vortex. The steam cycle
system as described herein may have the potential to operate at better than 60% efficiency, and
because of the very small quantity of water used relative to current systems, the system is
believed to be much safer than current systems. In addition, the system described herein has a
much smaller footprint when compared to a comparable conventional boiler system of the same
output. The system may be configured to be portable or containerized. The present disclosure
addresses efficiency issues associated with heat loss, thus reducing the capital cost to a fraction
of that of a conventional boiler and improving the overall efficiency of the system.
 [0012] The system may comprise an apparatus configured to generate steam and combine the
steam with heat from combustion. The apparatus may include a chamber. The chamber may
have an internal surface that is substantially axially symmetrical about a longitudinal axis. The
chamber may be configured to receive fuel gas liquids or solids and/or oxygen containing gas.
The chamber may be configured to pressurize the fuel gas liquids or solids and/or the oxygen
containing gas. The chamber may be configured to heat the fuel gas liquids or solids and/or the
oxygen containing gas to a temperature exceeding an auto-ignition temperature of the fuel
and/or the oxygen containing gas.
 [0013] The apparatus may include one or more inlets disposed at a first end of the chamber.
The one or more inlets may be arranged to emit one or more of the fuel, the oxygen containing
gas, or water. The fuel, the oxygen containing gas, or the water may be emitted as one or more
jet streams. The one or more jet streams may be emitted tangentially to the internal surface of
the chamber to effectuate a gaseous vortex rotating about the longitudinal axis within the
chamber. The one or more inlets may comprise one or more inlet nozzles configured to
accelerate the one or more jet streams to a supersonic velocity. The jet streams may be
configured to impinge on an electrically isolated face of a cylinder arranged in a radial
disposition such that the cylinders may be rotated and advanced into the chamber to account for
wear. The cylinders also may have varying voltages, amperages, and waveforms applied to
them to effectuate an enhanced catalytic effect at the point of impingement. This electrical
enhancement of catalytic activity is commonly called the NEMCA effect.

                                                  5
[0014] The one or more inlet nozzles may be structured to adjustably control a frequency of
shockwaves emitted from the one or more inlet nozzles into the gaseous vortex. The fuel gas
and/or the oxygen containing gas of the first jet may breach the auto ignition temperature of the
fuel and/or the oxygen containing gas. The water or extra steam may be injected into the
chamber by the one or more inlets. The water may be injected into the chamber responsive to
breach of the auto ignition temperature of the fuel gas and/or the oxygen containing gas. The
water may be injected into the chamber such that internal chamber temperature is stabilized.
The water may be converted into steam.
[0015] The apparatus may include an outlet. The outlet may be disposed proximal to the
longitudinal axis at a second end of the chamber opposite from the first end. The outlet may be
configured to emit one or both of product gases or the steam from the chamber.
[0016] These and other features, and characteristics of the embodiments, as well as the methods
of operation and functions of the related structural elements and the combination of parts and
economies of manufacture, will become more apparent upon consideration of the following
description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which
form a part of this specification, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts

the present disclosure. As used in the specification and in the claims, the singular form of "a",
"an", and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Detailed Description
[0024] In some implementations, the steam generator described herein has been designed from
the outset to produce high temperature high-pressure steam from a very wide variety of fuel
sources at very high efficiencies in the smallest possible configuration. Trials have been carried
out on gas production and then combustion of household waste, Lignite coals, oil, saturated soil,
and a wide variety of off specification hydrocarbon fuels quite often having very high water and
dirt loading. In some implementations, the system has been designed to be as compact as
possible with the highest possible output for a given size. This has resulted in the adoption of a
variety of techniques for the promotion of efficient combustion in a small envelope whilst using
conventional and nonconventional fuels. Some of the fuels that have been tested, whilst giving
adequate energy output, are extremely abrasive and may not be practical for conventional
combustion systems because of the high wear, although still could be used in accordance with
the systems and apparatus herein.
[0025] There are, in some implementations, three basic manifestations of the steam generation
apparatus: the first running on air, the second running on oxygen, and the third running on
hydrogen derived from hydrocarbon gasification generated elsewhere together with oxygen. In
some implementations, the hydrocarbon gasification is generated in a Pressure Swing
Absorption (PSA) system.
[0026] In a first embodiment operating using air, the system may be configured to have the
chosen fuel admitted to the chamber, together with steam/air above the auto ignition

                                                   7
temperature. The actual temperature may be governed by the synergistic effect of a shockwave
nozzle and Non Faradic Electro Magnetic Catalytic Activity (NEMCA) promoted on the surface
of an impactor, as well as the pressure of the system, which can be within the range of about 10
to about 60 bar, or from about 20 to about 40 bar, or about 30 bar or about 500 PSI, or any
pressure therebetween. Using the guidelines provided herein, a person having ordinary skill in
the art will be capable of determining the actual temperature to use with various fuels.
[0027] The air pressure can be generated either in a conventional air compressor or it can be
generated in an eduction venturi with steam being used as the propelling gas typically at a
pressure within the range of from about 25 to about 85 bar, or from about 45 to about 75 bar, or
about 60 bar or 1000 PSI, or any range therebetween. The venturis into the system may be
configured to act as Hartman nozzles to promote a supersonic shockwave in the venturi to aid in
the fragmentation of the fuel, the thorough mixing of the fuel air, and the stabilization of the
flame front. The exothermic reaction between the fuel and the air can be ameliorated with the
injection of more steam or water to prevent the thermal destruction of the system.
[0028] The apparatus may be configured to have the point of impact of the venturi gas stream
impinge on the face of impactor cylinders. These impact cylinders, or "impactors," serve a
number of functions. The expression "impact cylinders," the term "impactors," and the
expression "replaceable wear parts," are used interchangeably throughout this description, and
denote a surface upon which a stream (gas, solid, liquid, etc.) impinges. Impact cylinders are
not necessarily cylindrical, but may be any desirable shape or size, as will be appreciated by
those having ordinary skill in the art. The impact cylinders usually are electrically isolated from
the main body of the reactor, and may act as electron donors that aid in the promotion and
stabilization of the flame front. By having appropriate voltage, current and waveform, an
electrically enhanced catalytic effect can be promoted on that surface. The impact cylinders also
act as the primary point of wear for the fuel air mixture, which in the case of low rank fuels with
high ash levels can be a source of wear and blockage problems for conventional burners. By
applying appropriate voltage and frequency to these impact cylinders, combustion can be
initiated at a temperature that is typically about 2 'C to 300 'C lower than what is normally
achieved for a given fuel, or fuel-to-air ratio.
[0029] The first embodiment may produce steam, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen together with
any ash present in the fuel. This combination of gases and solids would not typically be suitable

                                                  8
for a conventional steam turbine, but is particularly useful for users of steam for the enhanced
recovery of hydrocarbon fuels where the presence of the carbon dioxide enhances the solubility
of the hydrocarbon fractions in the ground and leads to enhanced recovery.
[0030] The presence of nitrogen in the heating gas is not believed to pose a disadvantage. The
small, relative quantities of ash may either be deposited in the substrata or may be added to the
solids in the recovered hydrocarbons.
[0031] A second embodiment may be configured to run on oxygen instead of air. The oxygen in
one embodiment can be derived from a pressure swing absorption system (PSA). Using oxygen
has the advantage of not having nitrogen as a diluent. The steam so produced will still have ash
and carbon dioxide present. A third system can be configured to run on hydrogen generated in a
gasifier combined with oxygen generated in a PSA system. This system generates very high
quality steam at any conceivable temperature or pressure required.
[0032] FIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 configured for generating steam 102 using an apparatus
104 that creates shockwaves in a supersonic gaseous vortex, in accordance with one or more
implementations. Apparatus 104 may also be referred to herein as a "reactor," although
chemical reactions do not necessarily have to take place within apparatus 104. Apparatus 104
may be configured to facilitate the generation of steam 102 via one or more processes including:
(a) steam 102 being produced as a product of combustion; (b) steam 102 being produced by
injection of water into one or more components of system 100; and/or (c) steam 102 being
produced via other processes. Combustion may include a high-temperature exothermic redox
chemical reaction between a fuel (e.g., fuel gas) and an oxidant (e.g., oxygen containing gas)
that produces oxidized gaseous products and/or other products of combustion. The fuel gas may
include one or more of hydrogen, coal, natural gas, synthetic gas, oxygen, air, carbonaceous
fuel, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbonaceous solid, carbonaceous liquid, clean
hydrogen, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), methane, hydrocarbon gas, hydrocarbon liquid,
hydrocarbon solid, and/or other fuel gases. The oxygen containing gas may include one or more
of oxygen, air, steam and/or other oxidant.

implementations, one or more valves may be used to control a rate of flow of fuel gas from fuel
gas source 114 to heating component(s) 120. In some implementations, a first portion of fuel
gas provided by fuel gas supply 114 may be provided to fuel gas heater 118. A second portion
of that fuel gas may be delivered by fuel gas source 114 to be burned as an energy source for

heater 118 beyond a critical point of the fuel gas such that the fuel gas may be in a super critical
state.
[0038] In some implementations, oxygen containing gas supply 108 may be configured to
supply oxygen containing gas to apparatus 104 and/or other components of system 100.

                                                10
Oxygen containing gas supply 108 may include one or more of an oxygen containing gas source
124, an oxygen containing gas control unit 126, an oxygen containing gas heater 128, heating
component(s) 130, and/or other components.
[0039] In some implementations, oxygen containing gas source 124 may be configured to

                                                  11
[0042] In some implementations, additional fuel gases and/or oxygen containing gases may be
introduced. In some implementations, differences in selection of fuel gases and/or oxygen
containing gases may be utilized to control reaction conditions, products of reaction, and/or
other characteristics of the products of the gaseous reaction. The fuel gas and/or the oxygen
containing gas may have different velocities, temperatures, pressures, and/or other
characteristics. By way of non-limiting example, a first fuel gas and/or oxygen containing gas
may enter the reactor at a low temperature and/or pressure. A second fuel gas and/or oxygen
containing gas may enter the reactor at a high temperature and/or pressure. The first fuel gas

of heating component(s) 120, 130, 140, and/or 150, the valves, reactor 104, and/or other
components. It will be appreciated and understood by those having ordinary skill in the art that
the respective control units (116, 126, 136, 146, etc.) described herein would be combined in
one control unit for the entire system 100, or may be separately included in certain
configurations and in communication with one another.
[0047] In some implementations, reactor system 144 may be monitored by system control unit
146. System control unit 146 may be configured to control one or more of pressure,
temperature, rate of flow, and/or other properties of reactor system 144. In some
implementations, system control unit 146 may be configured to control frequency, amplitude,
waveform, and/or other properties of gas flow.
[0048] In some implementations, sensor 148 may be configured to provide one or more signals
conveying information associated with pressure, temperature, flow rate, and/or other
information of the fuel gas, oxygen containing gas, and/or water, within system 100. Sensor
148 may be configured to provide a signal conveying information associated with temperature
of one or more of the heating component(s) 120, 130, 140, and/or 150, the valves, fuel gas
heater 118, fuel gas supply 114, oxygen containing gas heater 128, oxygen containing gas
supply 108, water heater 138, water supply 110, apparatus 104, and/or other components of
system 100. Sensor 148 may be placed in several locations within system 100. The position of
sensor 148 within apparatus 104 in FIG. 1 is illustrative only and is not intended to be limiting.
The illustration in FIG. 1 only depicts one sensor for clarity purposes and is not intended to be
limiting. More than one sensor may be used in a variety of positions throughout system 100. In
some implementations, system control unit 146 may be configured to control one or more
operations associated with the fuel gas, oxygen containing gas, and/or water based on
information associated with pressure, temperature, flow rate, and/or other properties within
system 100 based on information provided by sensor 148.

                                                  13
[0049] In some implementations, outlet 152 may be configured to emit one or both of product
gases 154 and/or steam 102 from apparatus 104. The products of combustion together with
steam 102 may exit through outlet 152 into the product gas separator 112.
[0050] In some implementations, product gas separator 112 may be configured to receive
product gases 154 and/or steam 102. Product gas separator 112 may be configured to separate
product gases 154 and/or steam 102 into individual types and/or mixtures of gases. Product gas
separator 112 may be facilitated by pressure swing adsorption (PSA). Product gases 154 may
include one or more of superheated steam, pure steam, very clean steam, hydrogen, carbon
dioxide, carbon monoxide, and/or other product gases. In some implementations, heat required
for a steam reformer
[0051] A separate apparatus can be configured to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide,
which can then be combusted in a conventional boiler or can be combusted in a second
apparatus together with water or steam which can then be added to a steam reformer. A "steam
reformer" refers to a system or device that mixes carbon monoxide and steam together in
appropriate ratios and under an appropriate temperature and pressure to thereby convert the
carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide. Under the appropriate conditions the carbon in carbon
monoxide catalytically strips the oxygen from the water and thereby delivers hydrogen. This
process is a standard reforming operation in the petroleum industry for converting carbon
monoxide into hydrogen of a similar calorific value, and may be derived from a separate process
configured to increase the calorific value of the resultant gas output responsive to carbon
dioxide levels being reduced to a range between about 0.05 % and about 30 % by weight.
[0052] Some features of system 100 may be the same as or similar to one or more features
described in U.S. Patent No. 9,050,604 filed on June 6, 2014 and entitled "A REACTOR
CONFIGURED TO FACILITATE CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND/OR COMMINUTION OF
SOLID FEED MATERIALS," and U.S. Patent Application No. 14/719,303 filed on May 21,
2015 and entitled "REACTOR CONFIGURED TO FACILITATE CHEMICAL REACTIONS
AND/OR COMMINUTION OF SOLID FEED MATERIALS," which are both incorporated
herein by reference in their entireties.
[0053] FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate a side and a top view of apparatus or reactor 104,
respectively, in accordance with one or more implementations. Reactor 104 may include one or

                                                  14
more of a chamber 200, one or more inlets, one or more replaceable wear parts, an outlet 152,
and/or other components. Reactor 104 may be configured to generate steam 102. Reactor 104
may be configured to combine steam 102 with heat from combustion. In some implementations,
reactor 104 may be formed wholly or partially of heat and corrosion resistant materials. In some
implementations, reactor 104 may be formed wholly or partially of mild steel, heat resistant
alloys, silicon carbide, reaction bonded silicon carbide, silicon nitride, boron nitride, partially
stabilized zirconia, a variety of cermets, and/or other materials. In some implementations,
reactor 104 may be formed wholly or partially from material configured to be resistant to high
temperature, high-pressure carbon monoxide, hydrogen, steam, and/or various ash products.
[0054] In some implementations, chamber 200 may be configured to facilitate combustion.
Chamber 200 may be configured to (1) receive fuel gas and/or oxygen containing gas, (2)
pressurize the fuel gas and/or the oxygen containing gas, and/or (3) heat the fuel gas and/or the
oxygen containing gas to a temperature exceeding an auto-ignition temperature of the fuel gas
and/or the oxygen containing gas. Chamber 200 may include one or more of a first end, a
second end, an internal surface 202, a longitudinal axis, and/or other components. In some
implementations, chamber 200 may be cylindrical in shape. Chamber 200 may be shaped as a
cone, a hemisphere, a horn-shape, and/or other shapes.
[0055] In some implementations, internal surface 202 and/or chamber 200 may be configured to
receive one or more of a fuel gas, an oxygen containing gas, water, and/or other materials.
Internal surface 202 may be substantially axially symmetrical about the longitudinal axis. The
longitudinal axis may be disposed between the first end and the second end. The second end
may be disposed opposite from the first end.
[0056] In some implementations, one or more inlets may be configured to introduce one or more
of a fuel gas, an oxygen containing gas, water, and/or other materials into chamber 200. The
one or more inlets may include a first inlet 122, a second inlet 132, a third inlet 142, and/or other
inlets. One or more inlets may be positioned at the first end of chamber 200.
[0057] In some implementations, fuel gas may be introduced into chamber 200 via the one or
more inlets, including first inlet 122 and/or other inlets. The fuel gas may facilitate combustion
in chamber 200. The fuel gas may include one or more fuel gases selected from hydrogen, coal,
natural gas, synthetic gas, oxygen, air, carbonaceous fuel, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,

                                                 15
carbonaceous solid, carbonaceous liquid, clean hydrogen, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW),
methane, hydrocarbon gas, hydrocarbon liquid, hydrocarbon solid, and/or other fuel gases. In
some implementations, selection of the fuel gas may be responsive to desired outputs and/or
products of combustion. Products of combustion may include one or more product gases 154.
By way of non-limiting examples, there are many chemical reactions and more particularly
those involving reduction of metal oxides, sulfides, sulphates, chlorides, or other halogenated
metal complexes that can be used to produce a high value product gas 154. Using the guidelines
provided herein, a person having ordinary skill in the art will be capable of selecting suitable
fuel gas(es) depending on the desired product gas 154. Inputs received by reactor 104 may
include oxygen, coal, MSW, and/or other suitable carbonaceous fuel and/or methane and/or
other suitable hydrocarbon gas, liquid, and/or solid. In this implementation, the resulting
product gases 154 may include hydrogen and/or carbon monoxide and in some implementations,
may not include a high loading of nitrogen.
[0058] By way of a non-limiting example, responsive to reactor 104 receiving air and a
carbonaceous fuel, the products of combustion and/or the steam 102 so produced may include
carbon dioxide. By way of non-limiting example, responsive to very clean steam for a
conventional steam turbine or steam required for further chemical reactions being a required
output, inputs received by reactor 104 may include clean hydrogen having its flame temperature
moderated by water injection.
[0059] In some implementations, oxygen containing gas may be introduced into chamber 200
via the one or more inlets, including second inlet 132, and/or other inlets. Oxygen containing
gas may facilitate combustion in chamber 200. Oxygen containing gas may be selected from
one or more of oxygen, air, and/or other oxidant. In some implementations, oxygen may be
derived from oxygen-producing systems configured to produce oxygen from air (e.g., a pressure
swing adsorption (PSA) device). Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) includes gas separation
techniques for air separation, gas drying, hydrogen purification separation, methane purification,
and/or other gas separation processes. PSA is used to separate some gas species from a mixture
of gases under pressure according to the species' molecular characteristics and affinity for an
adsorbent material. By way of non-limiting example, responsive to pure steam with a steam
turbine or a chemical reaction being an output, reactor 104 may be fired with oxygen derived
from a PSA device.

                                                  16
[0060] In some implementations, water may be introduced into chamber 200 via the one or
more inlets, including third inlet 142, and/or other inlets. Water may be injected into chamber
200 to stabilize internal chamber temperature. Water may be heated prior to being injected into
chamber 200. Water may not be heated prior to being injected into chamber 200. In some
implementations, small quantities of water may be used. The quantity of water being utilized by
system 100 at a given time may be in a range between about one liter per minute for a very
small system and about 3 to about 5000 liters per minute for a 2 Gigawatt steam generator.
Water may be configured to moderate extremely hot (e.g., hydrogen/oxygen) combustion, with
a combustion temperature in excess of about 3000 'C down to typically about 1000 'C or a
temperature that is below the corrosion or erosion temperature of the device. Water may be
configured to prevent the internal chamber temperature from reaching thermal runaway.
Thermal runaway may include conditions in which an increase in temperature causes a further
increase in temperature. Responsive to water being injected into chamber 200, the water may be
converted into steam 102.
[0061] In some implementations, chamber 200 may be configured to pressurize the fuel gas,
oxygen containing gas, and/or other materials. Chamber 200 may be configured to heat the fuel
gas, oxygen containing gas, and/or other materials that are introduced thereto via first inlet 122,
a second inlet 132, a third inlet 142, and/or other inlets. The fuel gas, oxygen containing gas,
and/or other materials may be heated to a temperature exceeding auto-ignition temperature. The
auto-ignition temperature may correspond to the auto-ignition temperature of the fuel gas,
oxygen containing gas, and/or the auto-ignition temperature of other materials. The auto
ignition temperature of a substance includes the lowest temperature at which the substance will
spontaneously ignite in normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition, such as a
flame or spark. Auto-ignition temperature may be required to supply the activation energy
needed for combustion. The temperature at which a chemical will ignite may decrease as the
pressure and/or oxygen concentration increases. Reactor 104 and/or chamber 200 may be
configured to generate temperatures in a range between about 80 'C and about 1200 'C.
Reactor 104 and/or chamber 200 may be configured to generate pressures in a range between
about 0.1 megapascals (MPa) and about 30 megapascals (MPa), or any value therebetween.
[0062] In some implementations, reactor 104 and/or chamber 200 may be configured to use all
or nearly all of the heat derived from combustion and/or combine the heat with steam 102
produced in chamber 200. In some implementations, reactor 104 may be configured to generate

                                                17
steam 102, product gases 154, and/or other products of combustion without the use of a
chimney, flue, and/or other exhaust component. Reactor 104 and/or chamber 200 may be
configured to generate steam 102 at temperatures and/or pressures above the supercritical region
for steam 102 (e.g., temperatures up to about 1600 degrees Celsius and pressures in excess of 25
MPa).
[0063] In some implementations, the one or more inlets may introduce one or more of the fuel
gas, oxygen containing gas, water, and/or other materials as one or more jet streams. One or
more inlets may be arranged to introduce one or more jet streams tangentially to internal surface
202 of chamber 200. One or more inlets may be arranged so as to effectuate a gaseous vortex to
rotate about the longitudinal axis within chamber 200.
[0064] In some implementations, one or more inlets may include one or more inlet nozzles.
One or more inlet nozzles may include a first inlet nozzle, a second inlet nozzle, a third inlet
nozzle, and/or other inlet nozzles. In some implementations, the first inlet nozzle may be
disposed within first inlet 122. In some implementations, the second inlet nozzle may be
disposed within second inlet 132. In some implementations, the third inlet nozzle may be
disposed within third inlet 142. An exemplary inlet nozzle configuration is shown in connection
with FIGs. 4-6.
[0065] Exemplary implementations of an inlet nozzle are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application
Serial No. 14/298,877 filed on June 6, 2014, and entitled "SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR
PROCESSING SOLID MATERIALS USING SHOCKWAVES PRODUCED IN A
SUPERSONIC GASEOUS VORTEX," and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 14/690,149 filed
on April 17, 2015, and entitled "SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR FACILITATING
REACTIONS IN GASES USING SHOCKWAVES PRODUCED IN A SUPERSONIC
GASEOUS VORTEX," which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
[0066] In some implementations, one or more inlet nozzles may be configured to accelerate one
or more jet streams to a supersonic velocity. One or more inlet nozzles may be structured to
adjustably control a frequency of shockwaves 204. Frequency of shockwaves 204 may be
emitted from one or more inlet nozzles. Frequency of shockwaves 204 may be emitted into the
gaseous vortex.

                                                  18
 [0067] In some implementations, reactor 104 may include one or more replaceable wear parts,
or impactors, or impact cylinders. One or more replaceable wear parts may include a first
replaceable wear part 206, a second replaceable wear part 208, a third replaceable wear part 210,
and/or other replaceable wear parts. In some implementations, one or more replaceable wear
parts may be configured to protect internal surface 202. One or more replaceable wear parts
may be disposed within chamber 200. One or more replaceable wear parts may be disposed
such that one or more jet streams impinges on one or more replaceable wear parts. As one or
more jet streams is emitted from the one or more inlets, one or more jet streams may impinge on
one or more replaceable wear parts instead of impinging on internal surface 202 of chamber
200. One or more jet streams may include a first jet 212, a second jet 214, a third jet 216, and/or
other jets. By way of non-limiting example, first replaceable wear part 206 may be configured
to protect internal surface 202. First replaceable wear part 206 may be disposed within chamber
200. First replaceable wear part 206 may be disposed such that first jet 212 impinges on first
replaceable wear part 206. As first jet 212 is emitted from one or more inlets, first jet 212 may
impinge on first replaceable wear part 206 instead of impinging on internal surface 202 of
chamber 200.
 [0068] Exemplary implementations of replaceable wear part(s) are disclosed in U.S. Patent
Application Serial No. 14/690,111 filed on April 17, 2015, and entitled "PROVIDING WEAR
RESISTANCE IN A REACTOR CONFIGURED TO FACILITATE CHEMICAL

 [0069] In some implementations, one or more inlets may include first inlet 122. First inlet 122
may be configured to introduce first jet 212. First jet 212 may include one or more of the fuel
gas, oxygen containing gas, water, and/or other materials. In some implementations, first inlet
 122 may include a first inlet nozzle. The first inlet nozzle may be configured to accelerate first
jet 212 to a supersonic velocity. First inlet nozzle may be structured to adjustably control the
frequency of shockwaves 204 emitted from the first inlet nozzle into the gaseous vortex.

                                                     19
[0070] In some implementations, reactor 104 may include a first steering inlet 218. First
steering inlet 218 may be configured to control the direction of first jet 212. First steering inlet
218 may be disposed proximal to first inlet 122. First steering inlet 218 may be configured to
introduce a first steering jet 220 into chamber 200. First steering jet 220 may be configured to
produce a "steering effect" to first jet 212. First steering jet 220 may be introduced to control
the direction of first jet 212 such that first jet 212 may be directed to a particular direction to
even out wear in chamber 200. To achieve this, first steering inlet 218 may be disposed such
that first steering jet 220 may have an axial flow configured to intercept first jet 212 introduced
by first inlet 122. As illustrated, first steering inlet 218 may be employed to "steer" first jet 212
towards a desired area of internal surface 202 of chamber 200. By way of non-limiting
example, first steering inlet 218 may be employed to steer first jet 212 towards first replaceable
wear part 206. In some implementations, first steering jet 220 may be configured to introduce
eddy current and/or interference currents into chamber 200 to vary the shockwave effects of
reactor 104.
[0071] In some implementations, one or more inlets may include first inlet 122 and/or second
inlet 132. Second inlet 132 may be disposed at first end of chamber 200. Second inlet 132 may
be arranged to introduce fuel gas, oxygen containing gas, or water as second jet 214
substantially tangentially to internal surface 202 of chamber 200. Second jet 214 may effectuate
a gaseous vortex to rotate about the longitudinal axis within chamber 200. Second inlet 132
may include a second inlet nozzle. The second inlet nozzle may be configured to accelerate

to a particular direction to even out wear in chamber 200. To achieve this, second steering inlet

                                                  20

second steering jet 224 may be configured to introduce eddy current and/or interference currents
into chamber 200 to vary the shockwave effects of reactor 104.
 [0073] In some implementations, one or more inlets may include first inlet 122, second inlet

[0075] In some implementations, chamber 200 may include outlet 152. Outlet 152 may be
configured to emit one or both of product gases 154 and/or steam 102 from chamber 200.
Outlet 152 may be disposed proximal to the longitudinal axis of chamber 200. Outlet 152 may
be disposed at the second end of chamber 200. In some implementations, outlet 152 may
include one or more of an outlet nozzle 230 disposed within outlet 152. In some
implementations, the products of combustion together with steam 102 may exit through outlet
nozzle 230 into the process, which consumes the steam 102, so produced.
[0076] FIG. 3 illustrates a system 300 wherein an apparatus or reactor 302 may be coupled to an
additional apparatus or reactor 304, in accordance with one or more implementations. Reactor
302 may be configured to be coupled to additional reactor 304. Additional reactor 304 may be
coupled to reactor 302 such that product gases 306 that are the same as or similar to the product
gases 154 as described in connection with FIG. 1, may be emitted from outlet 308 of reactor 302
into additional reactor 304 as a fuel gas. In some implementations, the fuel gas may include
carbon monoxide and/or hydrogen. The fuel gas may be separated via use of membrane
technology and/or other systems for hydrogen separation that are known to those having
ordinary skill in the art. In some implementations, recovered carbon monoxide may be
reformed with steam 102 in additional reactor 304 by converting the carbon monoxide into
carbon dioxide and liberating the hydrogen.
[0077] In some implementations, mixed hydrogen and carbon dioxide may be separated by a
membrane system and/or other methods. The separated hydrogen may be added to the original
stream of hydrogen. This method may facilitate converting carbonaceous solid, liquid, and/or
gaseous fuel into hydrogen. The output hydrogen may be used in one or more applications
including feedstock in the chemical industry, transport of fuel internal combustion engines
(ICE), fuel cell applications, and/or other applications.
[0078] System 300 may be configured for comminution and/or gasification of various materials
including Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), industrial waste, run of mine, mine tailings, and/or
other materials. System 300 may be configured for the treatment of contaminated soils and/or
other similar mine tailings wherein the carbonaceous material may be gasified and/or chloride
and/or sulfurous materials that may be present in the material may be rendered innocuous
responsive to being introduced together with limestone and/or other suitable absorbents
configured to combine with the chlorine and/or sulfur. System 300 may be used with the

                                                    22
addition of a known quantity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and a known quantity of
heavy metals wherein the PCB concentration has been reduced to below permissible limits of,
for example 1 ppm. System 300 may facilitate heavy metals being rendered non-leachable and/
or rendering contaminated soil nontoxic for PCBs and/or heavy metal contamination.
 [0079] FIG. 4 illustrates a rear view of reactor 104, in accordance with one or more
implementations. The reactor 104 may include a chamber 200 centered on a longitudinal axis
that is normal to the cross-section. In some implementations, a portion of the chamber 200 may
be shaped as a cylinder. The chamber 200 may be formed of various materials. The chamber
200 may be formed of a ridged material. The chamber 200 may be formed of a thermally
conductive material. The chamber 200 may be formed of an electrically conductive material.
According to some implementations, chamber 200 may be formed wholly or partially of steel,
iron, iron alloys, silicon carbide, partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ), fused alumina, tungsten
carbide, boron nitride, carbides, nitrides, ceramics, silicates, geopolymers, metallic alloys, other
alloys, and/or other materials. In some implementations, an internal surface 202 of chamber 200
may be coated with one or more coatings. An exemplary coating may be configured to prevent
physical or chemical wear to internal surface 202 of chamber 200. In some implementations, a
coating may be configured to promote a chemical reaction within chamber 200. An example of
a coating that may promote a chemical reaction may include one or more of iron, nickel,
ruthenium, rhodium, platinum, palladium, cobalt, other transition metals and their alloys,
compounds, oxides (e.g., the lanthanide series and their compounds, alloys, and/or oxides),
and/or other materials.
 [0080] In some implementations, first inlet 122 may be configured to introduce a high-velocity
jet stream into chamber 200. First inlet 122 may be disposed and arranged so as to effectuate a
vortex of the jet stream circulating within chamber 200. The vortex may rotate about the
longitudinal axis of chamber 200. First inlet 122 may be disposed so that the jet stream is
directed substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of chamber 200. First inlet 122 may
be disposed so that the jet stream is directed substantially tangential to an internal surface of the
substantially circular cross-section of the chamber, as illustrated in FIG. 4.
 [0081] The jet stream introduced by first inlet 122 may include any number of gaseous
materials. In some implementations, the gas may include a reduced gas (e.g., a gas with a low
oxidation number and/or high reduction) which is often hydrogen-rich. The gas may include

                                                  23
one or more of steam, methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, ammonia, hydrogen, carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, fluorine, ethene, hydrogen sulphide,
acetylene, and/or other gases. The gas may be a vapor. The gas may be superheated. In some
implementations, the gas may be heated beyond a critical point, and/or compressed above a
critical pressure so that the gas becomes a superheated gas, compressible fluid, and/or a super
critical fluid.
[0082] FIG. 5 provides a more detailed view of a first inlet 122 of apparatus 104, in accordance
with one or more implementations. First inlet 122 may include a first inlet nozzle 502
positioned within first inlet 122. The first inlet nozzle 502 may be configured to be secured in
place by screw threads or other mechanisms capable of securing first inlet nozzle 502 within or
on first inlet 122. The first inlet nozzle 502 may be configured to accelerate the jet stream being
introduced into chamber 506. In exemplary implementations, first inlet nozzle 502 may be
configured to introduce the jet stream at a supersonic speed. The first inlet nozzle 502 may be
configured to produce shockwaves in the jet stream emitted from first inlet nozzle 502. First
inlet 122 may include an annular cavity 504 disposed about first inlet nozzle 502. The annular
cavity 504 may be configured such that the jet stream emitted from first inlet nozzle 502
resonates within annular cavity 504.
[0083] FIG. 6 illustrates a detailed view of first inlet nozzle 502 of first inlet 122, in accordance
with one or more implementations. The first inlet nozzle 502 may include one or more
resonator cylinders 602. A given resonator cylinder 602 may be disposed within first inlet
nozzle 502 and may be oriented perpendicular to the main flow of gas through first inlet nozzle
502. A given resonator cylinder 602 may be configured such that gas pressure pulses resonate
within the given resonator cylinder 602 to induce shockwaves within first inlet nozzle 502.
Shockwaves occurring within first inlet nozzle 502 may propagate out of first inlet nozzle 502
into chamber 200. Different resonator cylinders 602 may have different sizes so that
corresponding different resonant frequencies result in shockwaves occurring at different
frequencies. Offset of a lip 604 relative to another lip 606 of a given resonator cylinder 602 may
induce pumping in the given resonator cylinder 602.
[0084] In some implementations, first inlet nozzle 502 may be configured to produce
shockwaves, and/or harmonics in the gas, and/or chamber 200. The first inlet nozzle 502 may
include one or more of a Hartmann-Sprenger tube, a Hartmann generator, a Hartmann oscillator,

                                                  24
a nozzle utilizing one or more electronically controlled piezoelectric or magnostrictive
transducers to control the shockwaves, a motorized rotating nozzle similar to a siren, and/or
other types of nozzles. A capacitor discharge spark may be used to induce a shockwave. A
Hartmann generator may include a device in which shockwaves generated at the edges of a
nozzle by a supersonic gas jet resonate with the opening of a small cylindrical pipe, placed
opposite the nozzle, to produce powerful ultrasonic sound waves. A Hartmann oscillator may
include a gas-jet radiator of sonic and ultrasonic waves. The oscillator may include a nozzle
from which gas under a pressure p > 0.2 meganewtons per square meter (1.93 atmospheres)
emerges at supersonic speed.
[0085] In the process, the gas jet may create compression and rarefaction waves. If a resonator
is placed in this flow coaxially with the nozzle at a certain distance, sonic and ultrasonic waves
may be radiated. The frequency of the acoustic radiation may be a function of the distance
between the nozzle and the resonator, as well as the size of the resonator. Hartmann oscillators
may radiate up to several dozen watts of acoustic power. If compressed air (from a tank or
compressor) is blown through the nozzle, frequencies ranging from 5 or 6 kilohertz up to 120
kilohertz may be obtained. By using hydrogen in place of air, frequencies up to 500 kilohertz
may be reached.
[0086] In some implementations, one or more inlet nozzles may be an acoustic device. One or
more inlet nozzles may be designed to maximize the pressure differences that a given particle
may experience for a given time. Current supersonic nozzles may produce a very wide
spectrum frequency distribution per unit area or acoustic flow velocity. The acoustic component
of the one or more inlet nozzles may generate variations in pressure experienced across the one
or more inlet nozzles due to oscillation. Oscillation may be generated by one or more Hartman
type devices. One or more Hartman type devices may be disposed at the one or more inlet
nozzles. One or more inlet nozzles may include converging nozzles, diverging nozzles, and/or
other types of nozzles. One or more Hartman type devices may be introduced in advance of one
or more inlet nozzles such that the one or more inlet nozzles are not exposed to wear. One or
more inlet nozzles may be designed to couple to particles and/or chemical reactions processed in
chamber 200 of reactor 104.
[0087] Reactor 104 may be configured to operate at an average power in a range between about
10 kilowatts (kW) and about 30,000 kilowatts (kW). Reactor 104 may have peak power in a

                                                25
range between about three to four times the average power (e.g., about 10,000 kW to about
50,000 kW). Instantaneous pressures and/or temperatures may be greater than the average
temperature and/or pressure. In some implementations, the instantaneous power may be directly
proportional to the square of the pressure. By way of a non-limiting example, a small increase
in pressure may cause a dramatic increase in the power being imparted to a given particle and/or
species. Responsive to increasing the peak power, peak temperatures and/or pressures may be
much greater than the average pressure and/or temperature.
[0088] In some implementations, one or more components of reactor 104 may generate
constructive and/or destructive interference of waves including a first wave. One or more inlet
nozzles may be configured to generate a pure tone and/or a fixed frequency wave including a
second wave. The harmonics of the second wave may constructively and/or destructively
interfere with the first wave in some implementations, causing very large increases in peak
pressure. The increases in peak pressure may be in a range between about 30 megapascals
(MPa) and about 90 megapascals (MPa). Reactor 104 may be configured for peak pressure
variations and/or very large fluctuations.
[0089] In some implementations, chamber 200 may be designed to facilitate an acoustic
feedback system. In some implementations, chamber 200 of reactor 104 may be designed as an
open-ended system. In some implementations, one or more inlet nozzles may be tuned by a
Hartman oscillator. In some implementations, one or more inlet nozzles and/or chamber 200
may be considered as one acoustic device for a given set of conditions desired in system 100. In
some implementations, a Hartman type nozzle may be designed such that chamber 200 may not
resonate with one or more inlet nozzles. In some implementations, the material and/or species
within chamber 200 may effectively absorb energy generated by one or more inlet nozzles.
Particles and/or species within chamber 200 may absorb the energy.
[0090] In some implementations, tuning the frequency, the dimensions, and/or the
configurations of one or more inlet nozzles and/or chamber 200 may amplify the pressure and/or
temperature oscillations and/or variations within chamber 200. In some implementations, gas
under pressure may be heated above critical temperature and/or pressure before it may be
allowed to expand. Inversion temperature includes the critical temperature below which a gas
expanding at constant enthalpy may experience temperature decrease, and above which may
experience temperature increase. By way of non-limiting example, compressed air heated above

                                               26
325 degrees Celsius may expand as the temperature of the compressed air increases.
Compressed air below 325 degrees Celsius may expand as the temperature of the compressed air
decreases. Responsive to gas expanding in relatively low temperature conditions, conventional
Joule-Thomson cooling may occur across the expansion nozzle. Responsive to temperature of a
working gas being above critical temperature prior to expansion, the temperature may increase
upon expansion.
[0091] In some implementations, one or more inlet nozzles may be configured such that
fluctuations in temperature and/or pressure occur across Hartmann type nozzle(s). By way of
non-limiting example, as gas is emitted by one or more inlet nozzles, the temperature
fluctuations may be greatly amplified. In some implementations, one or more inlet nozzles may
be tuned to produce extreme fluctuation in temperature and/or pressure (e.g., reverse Joule
Thomson effect). By way of non-limiting example, responsive to such pressure variations
and/or temperature variations across one or more inlet nozzles, the temperature of the first wave
generated by one or more inlet nozzles may be decreasing due to conventional Joule-Thomson
cooling, and the temperature of the second wave may rise dramatically wherein the pressure
exceeds the inversion temperature and/or pressure. In some implementations, reverse Joule
Thomson heating effect may be coupled with conventional Joule-Thomson cooling and applied
to comminution and/or chemical reactions.
[0092] FIG. 7 illustrates a method 700 for generating steam using an apparatus or reactor that

implementations. The operations of method 700 presented below are intended to be illustrative.
In some implementations, method 700 may be accomplished with one or more additional

                                                 28
[0100] At an operation 716, emit product gases from the outlet of the chamber into an additional
reactor as fuel gas. Operation 716 may be facilitated by components that are the same as or
similar to outlet 152 and/or additional reactor 304 (as described in connection with FIGS. 1 and
3, respectively), in accordance with one or more embodiments.

illustration based on what is currently considered to be the most practical and preferred
implementations, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that the
technology is not limited to the disclosed implementations, but, on the contrary, is intended to
