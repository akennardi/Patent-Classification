                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
10002]         Embodiments of the invention relate to compositions and methods for
modulating innate and adaptive immunity in a subject and/or for the treatment of an
immune-related disorder, cancer, autoimmunity, treating and preventing infections.
                                         BACKGROUND
10003]         Cellular host defense responses to pathogen invasion principally involves the
detection of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as viral nucleic acid or
bacterial cell wall components including lipopolysaccharide or flagellar proteins that results
in the induction of anti-pathogen genes. For example, viral RNA can be detected by
membrane bound Toll-like receptors (TLR's) present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
and/or endosomes (e.g. TLR 3 and 7/8) or by TLR-independent intracellular DExD/H box
RNA helicases referred to as retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) or melanoma
differentiation associated antigen 5 (MDA5, also referred to as IFIHI and helicard). These
events culminate in the activation of downstream signalling events, much of which remains
unknown, leading to the transcription of NF-idB and IRF3/7- dependent genes, including type
I IFN.
                                            SUMMARY

thymus DNA or E. coli DNA. Culture supernatants were collected 16 hours after transfection
and endogenous IFN-p was analyzed by ELISA (Invitrogen). The data indicates that dsRNA
pathways (polyiC), but not intracellular DNA (poly dG-dC, calf thymus DNA or E. coli
DNA) pathways which are regulated by STING are functional.

relationships, and methods are set forth to provide a full understanding of the invention. One
having ordinary skill in the relevant art, however, will readily recognize that the invention
can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods. The
present invention is not limited by the illustrated ordering of acts or events, as some acts may
occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events. Furthermore, not all
illustrated acts or events are required to implement a methodology in accordance with the
present invention.
[0044]       All genes, gene names, and gene products disclosed herein are intended to
correspond to homologs from any species for which the compositions and methods disclosed
herein are applicable. Thus, the terms include, but are not limited to genes and gene products
from humans and mice. It is understood that when a gene or gene product from a particular
species is disclosed, this disclosure is intended to be exemplary only, and is not to be
interpreted as a limitation unless the context in which it appears clearly indicates. Thus, for

Definitions
[00461       The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular
embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the
singular forms "a", "an" and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms "including",
"includes", "having", "has", "with", or variants thereof are used in either the detailed
description and/or the claims, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to
the term "comprising."
[00471       The tern "about" or "approximately" means within an acceptable error range for
the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in
part on how the value is measured or determined, i.e., the limitations of the measurement
system. For example, "about" can mean within 1 or more than 1 standard deviation, per the
practice in the art. Alternatively, "about" can mean a range of up to 20%, preferably up to
10%, more preferably up to 5%, and more preferably still up to 1% of a given value.
Alternatively, particularly with respect to biological systems or processes, the term can mean
within an order of magnitude, preferably within 5-fold, and more preferably within 2-fold, of
a value. Where particular values are described in the application and claims, unless otherwise
stated the term "about" meaning within an acceptable error range for the particular value
should be assumed.
[00481       The term "induces or enhances an immune response" is meant causing a
statistically measurable induction or increase in an immune response over a control sample to
which the peptide, polypeptide or protein has not been administered. Preferably the induction
or enhancement of the immune response results in a prophylactic or therapeutic response in a
subject. Examples of immune responses are increased production of type I IFN, increased
resistance to viral and other types of infection by alternate pathogens. The enhancement of
immune responses to tumors (anti-tumor responses), or the development of vaccines to
prevent tumors or eliminate existing tumors.
[0049]       The term "STING" is meant to include, without limitation, nucleic acids,
polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, sense and antisense polynucleotide strands,
complementary sequences, peptides, polypeptides, proteins, homologous and/or orthologous
STING molecules, isoforms, precursors, mutants, variants, derivatives, splice variants,
alleles, different species, and active fragments thereof
                                             - 14 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
[00501       The term "lacks a functional STING gene" is meant that a transgenic animal lacks
a gene that encodes STING, or lacks other genetic components (e.g. promoters) required for
expression of STING.
[00511       The term "active fragment or variant" is meant a fragment that is at least 380
amino acid residues in length and is 100% identical to a contiguous portion of the peptide,
polypeptide or protein, or a variant that is at least 90%, preferably 95% identical to a
fragment up to and including the full length peptide, polypeptide or protein. A variant, for
example, may include conservative amino acid substitutions, as defined in the art, or
nonconservative substitutions, providing that at least e.g. 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 90% of the
activity of the original peptide, polypeptide or protein is retained. Also included are STING
molecules, fragments or variants having post-translational modifications such as sumoylation,
phosphorylation glycosylation, splice variants, and the like, all of which may effect the
efficacy of STING function.
[0052]       Unless otherwise indicated, the terms "peptide", "polypeptide" or "protein" are
used interchangeably herein, although typically they refer to peptide sequences of varying
sizes.
[0053]       The term "variant," when used in the context of a polynucleotide sequence, may
encompass a polynucleotide sequence related to a wild type gene. This definition may also
include, for example, "allelic," "splice," "species," or "polymorphic" variants. A splice
variant may have significant identity to a reference molecule, but will generally have a
greater or lesser number of polynucleotides due to alternate splicing of exons during mRNA
processing. The corresponding polypeptide may possess additional functional domains or an
absence of domains. Species variants are polynucleotide sequences that vary from one
species to another. Of particular utility in the invention are variants of wild type gene
products. Variants may result from at least one mutation in the nucleic acid sequence and
may result in altered mRNAs or in polypeptides whose structure or function may or may not
be altered. Any given natural or recombinant gene may have none, one, or many allelic
forms. Common mutational changes that give rise to variants are generally ascribed to
natural deletions, additions, or substitutions of nucleotides. Each of these types of changes
may occur alone, or in combination with the others, one or more times in a given sequence.
[0054]       The resulting polypeptides generally will have significant amino acid identity
relative to each other. A polymorphic variant is a variation in the polynucleotide sequence of
a particular gene between individuals of a given species. Polymorphic variants also may
                                             - 15 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                             PCT/US2009/052767
encompass "single nucleotide polymorphisms" (SNPs) or single base mutations in which the
polynucleotide sequence varies by one base. The presence of SNPs may be indicative of, for
example, a certain population with a propensity for a disease state, that is susceptibility
versus resistance.
[0055]       Derivative polynucleotides include nucleic acids subjected to chemical
modification, for example, replacement of hydrogen by an alkyl, acyl, or amino group.
Derivatives, e.g., derivative oligonucleotides, may comprise non-naturally-occurring
portions, such as altered sugar moieties or inter-sugar linkages. Exemplary among these are
phosphorothioate and other sulfur containing species which are known in the art. Derivative
nucleic acids may also contain labels, including radionucleotides, enzymes, fluorescent
agents, chemiluminescent agents, chromogenic agents, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors,
magnetic particles, and the like.
[00561       A "derivative" polypeptide or peptide is one that is modified, for example, by
glycosylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, sulfation, reduction/alkylation, acylation,
chemical coupling, or mild formalin treatment. A derivative may also be modified to contain
a detectable label, either directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, a radioisotope,
fluorescent, and enzyme label.
[0057]       The term "immunoregulatory" is meant a compound, composition or substance
that is immunogenic (i.e. stimulates or increases an immune response) or immunosuppressive
(i.e. reduces or suppresses an immune response).
[0058]       "An antigen presenting cell" (APC) is a cell that is capable of activating T cells,
and includes, but is not limited to, monocytes/macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells (DCs).
The term "dendritic cell" or "DC" refers to any member of a diverse population of
morphologically similar cell types found in lymphoid or non-lymphoid tissues. These cells
are characterized by their distinctive morphology, high levels of surface MHC-class II
expression. DCs can be isolated from a number of tissue sources. DCs have a high capacity
for sensitizing MHC-restricted T cells and are very effective at presenting antigens to T cells
in situ. The antigens may be self-antigens that are expressed during T cell development and
tolerance, and foreign antigens that are present during normal immune processes.
[0059]       The term "expression vector" as used herein refers to a vector containing a nucleic
acid sequence coding for at least part of a gene product capable of being transcribed. In some
cases, RNA molecules are then translated into a protein, polypeptide, or peptide. In other
cases, these sequences are not translated, for example, in the production of antisense
                                              - 16 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                           PCT/US2009/052767
molecules, siRNA, ribozymes, and the like. Expression vectors can contain a variety of
control sequences, which refer to nucleic acid sequences necessary for the transcription and
possibly translation of an operatively linked coding sequence in a particular host organism.
In addition to control sequences that govern transcription and translation, vectors and
expression vectors may contain nucleic acid sequences that serve other functions as well.
[0060]       By "encoding" or "encoded", "encodes", with respect to a specified nucleic acid, is
meant comprising the information for translation into the specified protein. A nucleic acid
encoding a protein may comprise non-translated sequences (e.g., introns) within translated
regions of the nucleic acid, or may lack such intervening non-translated sequences (e.g., as in
cDNA). The information by which a protein is encoded is specified by the use of codons.
Typically, the amino acid sequence is encoded by the nucleic acid using the "universal"
genetic code.
[0061]       As used herein, "heterologous" in reference to a nucleic acid is a nucleic acid that
originates from a foreign species, or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from
its native form in composition and/or genomic locus by deliberate human intervention. For
example, a promoter operably linked to a heterologous structural gene is from a species
different from that from which the structural gene was derived, or, if from the same species,
one or both are substantially modified from their original form. A heterologous protein may
originate from a foreign species or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from
its original form by deliberate human intervention.
[0062]       "Sample" is used herein in its broadest sense. A sample comprising
polynucleotides, polypeptides, peptides, antibodies and the like may comprise a bodily fluid;
a soluble fraction of a cell preparation, or media in which cells were grown; a chromosome,
an organelle, or membrane isolated or extracted from a cell; genomic DNA, RNA, or cDNA,
polypeptides, or peptides in solution or bound to a substrate; a cell; a tissue; a tissue print; a
fingerprint, skin or hair; and the like.
[0063]       The terms "patient", "subject" or "individual" are used interchangeably herein, and
refers to a mammalian subject to be treated, with human patients being preferred. In some
cases, the methods of the invention find use in experimental animals, in veterinary
application, and in the development of animal models for disease, including, but not limited
to, rodents including mice, rats, and hamsters; and primates.
[0064]       "Diagnostic" or "diagnosed" means identifying the presence or nature of a
pathologic condition. Diagnostic methods differ in their sensitivity and specificity. The
"sensitivity" of a diagnostic assay is the percentage of diseased individuals who test positive
                                             - 17 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                           PCT/US2009/052767
(percent of "true positives"). Diseased individuals not detected by the assay are "false
negatives." Subjects who are not diseased and who test negative in the assay, are termed
"true negatives." The "specificity" of a diagnostic assay is 1 minus the false positive rate,
where the "false positive" rate is defined as the proportion of those without the disease who
test positive. While a particular diagnostic method may not provide a definitive diagnosis of
a condition, it suffices if the method provides a positive indication that aids in diagnosis.
[0065]       "Treatment" is an intervention performed with the intention of preventing the
development or altering the pathology or symptoms of a disorder. Accordingly, "treatment"
refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need
of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is
to be prevented. In tumor (e.g., cancer) treatment, a therapeutic agent may directly decrease
the pathology of tumor cells, or render the tumor cells more susceptible to treatment by other
therapeutic agents, e.g., radiation and/or chemotherapy. As used herein, "ameliorated" or
"treatment" refers to a symptom which is approaches a normalized value (for example a value
obtained in a healthy patient or individual), e.g., is less than 50% different from a normalized
value, preferably is less than about 25% different from a normalized value, more preferably,
is less than 10% different from a normalized value, and still more preferably, is not
significantly different from a normalized value as determined using routine statistical tests.
For example the term "treat" or "treating" with respect to tumor cells refers to stopping the
progression of said cells, slowing down growth, inducing regression, or amelioration of
symptoms associated with the presence of said cells. Treatment of an individual suffering
from an infectious disease organism refers to a decrease and elimination of the disease
organism from an individual. For example, a decrease of viral particles as measured by
plaque forming units or other automated diagnostic methods such as ELISA etc.
[00661       The "treatment of cancer", refers to one or more of the following effects: (1)
inhibition, to some extent, of tumor growth, including, (i) slowing down and (ii) complete
growth arrest; (2) reduction in the number of tumor cells; (3) maintaining tumor size; (4)
reduction in tumor size; (5) inhibition, including (i) reduction, (ii) slowing down or (iii)
complete prevention, of tumor cell infiltration into peripheral organs; (6) inhibition, including
(i) reduction, (ii) slowing down or (iii) complete prevention, of metastasis; (7) enhancement
of anti-tumor immune response, which may result in (i) maintaining tumor size, (ii) reducing
tumor size, (iii) slowing the growth of a tumor, (iv) reducing, slowing or preventing invasion
and/or (8) relief, to some extent, of the severity or number of one or more symptoms
associated with the disorder.

[00671       As used herein, the term "safe and effective amount" refers to the quantity of a
component which is sufficient to yield a desired therapeutic response without undue adverse
side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable
benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of this invention. By "therapeutically effective
amount" is meant an amount of a compound of the present invention effective to yield the
desired therapeutic response. For example, an amount effective to delay the growth of or to
cause a cancer, either a sarcoma or lymphoma, or to shrink the cancer or prevent metastasis.
The specific safe and effective amount or therapeutically effective amount will vary with
such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the patient, the
type of mammal or animal being treated, the duration of the treatment, the nature of
concurrent therapy (if any), and the specific formulations employed and the structure of the
compounds or its derivatives.
[00681       "Cells of the immune system" or "immune cells", is meant to include any cells of
the immune system that may be assayed, including, but not limited to, B lymphocytes, also
called B cells, T lymphocytes, also called T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T
(NK) cells, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils,
granulocytes, mast cells, platelets, Langerhans cells, stem cells, dendritic cells, peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, tumor-infiltrating (TIL) cells, gene modified immune cells
including hybridomas, drug modified immune cells, and derivatives, precursors or
progenitors of the above cell types.
[0069]       "Immune effector cells" refers to cells capable of binding an antigen and which
mediate an immune response selective for the antigen. These cells include, but are not
limited to, T cells (T lymphocytes), B cells (B lymphocytes), monocytes, macrophages,
natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), for example CTL lines, CTL
clones, and CTLs from tumor, inflammatory, or other infiltrates.
[0070]       "Immune related molecules" refers to any molecule identified in any immune cell,
whether in a resting ("non-stimulated") or activated state, and includes any receptor, ligand,
cell surface molecules, nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides, variants and fragments thereof.
[0071]       "T cells" or "T lymphocytes" are a subset of lymphocytes originating in the
thymus and having heterodimeric receptors associated with proteins of the CD3 complex
(e.g., a rearranged T cell receptor, the heterodimeric protein on the T cell surfaces responsible
for antigen/MHC specificity of the cells). T cell responses may be detected by assays for
their effects on other cells (e.g., target cell killing, activation of other immune cells, such as
B-cells) or for the cytokines they produce.

[00721       The phrase "T cell response" means an immunological response involving T cells.
The T cells that are "activated" divide to produce antigen specific memory T cells or antigen
specific cytotoxic T cells. The cytotoxic T cells bind to and destroy cells recognized as
containing the antigen. The memory T cells are activated by the antigen and thus provide a
response to an antigen already encountered. This overall response to the antigen is the
antigen specific T cell response, e.g. tumor specific.
[00731       A "secondary immune response" or "adaptive immune response" may be active or
passive, and may be humoral (antibody based) or cellular that is established during the life of
an animal, is specific for an inducing antigen, and is marked by an enhanced immune
response on repeated encounters with said antigen. A key feature of the T lymphocytes of the
adaptive immune system is their ability to detect minute concentrations of pathogen-derived
peptides presented by MHC molecules on the cell surface.
STING Compositions
[0074]       Embodiments of the invention are directed to nucleic acid sequences and encoded
products thereof, to a molecule termed herein STING. The novel STING nucleic acids,
polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, peptides, mutants, variants and active fragments thereof,
can be used to modulate innate and adaptive immunity in a subject and/or for the treatment of
an immune-related disorder, including treating and preventing infection by modulating
immunity. Also provided are an agent reactive with the peptide, a pharmaceutical
composition that includes the peptide, isolated nucleic acid molecules, an isolated nucleic
acid molecules encoding the peptides, recombinant nucleic acid constructs that include the
nucleic acid molecules, at least one host cell comprising the recombinant nucleic acid
constructs, and a method of producing the peptide using the host cell. The present invention
further provides a method for treating and/or preventing infection in a subject by
administering the peptide of the invention to the subject, thereby modulating innate immunity
in the subject. Additionally, the present invention provides a method for identifying
candidate therapeutic agents.
[00751       In the Examples section which follows, the data provide for the identification
following expression cloning and characterization of a novel molecule, STING (STimulator
of INterferon Genes) that regulates innate immune signaling processes. Both the nucleic acid
and peptide sequences are identified in humans and mice. STING, comprising 5 putative
transmembrane (TM) regions, predominantly resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
is able to activate both NF-KB and IRF3 transcription pathways to induce type I IFN and to
                                            - 20 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                             PCT/US2009/052767
exert a potent anti-viral state following expression. In contrast, loss of STING reduced the
ability of polyIC to activate type I IFN and rendered murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking
STING (- MEFs) generated by targeted homologous recombination, susceptible to vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. DNA-mediated ability to stimulate type I IFN responses in
the absence of STING, was also greatly inhibited, indicating that STING may play an
important role in recognizing DNA-virus and bacteria as well as other pathogen infection.
Yeast-two hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that STING interacts with
RIG-I and with Ssr2/TRAP3, a member of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex
required for protein translocation across the ER membrane following translation. RNAi
ablation of TRAPP was subsequently found to inhibit STING function as well as impede the
production of type I IFN in response to polyIC. Thus, aside from identifying a novel
regulator of innate immune signaling, this data further implicates, for the first time, a
potential role for the translocon in intracellular dsRNA/virus signaling and DNA /virus,
plasmid DNA based pathways in mammalian cells which appears central for the activation of
primary innate immune responses, including the production of Type I IFN.
[00761       In preferred embodiments, STING molecules and the molecules STING regulates
in the various pathways described herein, provide the design of new adjuvants, vaccines and
therapies to regulate the immune system and other systems. The molecule, and/or pathways
it regulates, would be utilized in vaccine and therapies to combat disease. Modulation of the
immune system by STING provides for the treatment of diseases, including diseases caused
by foreign agents. Exemplary infections by foreign agents which may be treated and/or
prevented by the method of the present invention include an infection by a bacterium (e.g., a
Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterium), an infection by a fungus, an infection by a
parasite, and an infection by a virus. In one embodiment of the present invention, the
infection is a bacterial infection (e.g., infection by E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., or
vancomycin-resistant enterococcus). In another embodiment, the infection is a fungal
infection (e.g. infection by a mould, a yeast, or a higher fungus). In still another embodiment,
the infection is a parasitic infection (e.g., infection by a single-celled or multicellular parasite,
including Giardiaduodenalis, Crvptosporidiunparvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis,and
Toxoplasma gondiz). In yet another embodiment, the infection is a viral infection (e.g.,
infection by a virus associated with AIDS, avian flu, chickenpox, cold sores, common cold,
gastroenteritis, glandular fever, influenza, measles, mumps, pharyngitis, pneumonia, rubella,
SARS, and lower or upper respiratory tract infection (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus)).

[00771       STING also associates with components of the proteosome (PSMB 1), which is
essential for the elimination of misfolded proteins. Removal of misfolded proteins from the
secretory pathway depends on their recognition in the endoplasmic reticulum ER). STING
resides in the ER and associates with PSMB 1 to potentially play a role in ERAD- ER
associated protein degradation. A functional ubiquitin proteosome system is essential and
defects can lead to neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson, Alzheimer's) and cardiac
disorders. Up-regulation of proteosome activity can lead to wasting conditions (sepsis,
cachexia). Immunoproteosomes occurring in the brain and muscle reflect persistent
inflammation and are downregulated in cancer cells. The induction of apoptosis by
proteosome inhibitors is a treatment for cancer (such as myeloma). Thus STING could play a
role in these pathways and provide a target for cancer therapy and neurodegenerative disease.
[00781       In another embodiment, STING is associated with a molecule of interest (e.g.
peptide, antigen, enzyme, etc) either by binding, as a fusion moiety, or linked via a chemical
moiety to modulate the molecule of interest's half-life, retention in an intracellular body,
degradation, altering of intracellular or surface expression of the molecule of interest, etc.
[00791       In a preferred embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein
or peptide comprises a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, or an active fragment or
variant thereof that induces or enhances an immune response.
[0080]       In another preferred embodiment, an active fragment is of at least 380 consecutive
amino acid residues in length in humans and induces or enhances an immune response in vivo
or in vitro.
[00811       In another preferred embodiment, expression of SEQ ID NOS: I or 2 or active
fragments thereof, induce type I IFN in a cell, tissue or organ, in vivo or in vitro.
[00821       In another preferred embodiment, the expression of SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2 in vivo
or in vitro induces an antiviral immune response.
[0083]       In another preferred embodiment, STING induces an anti-tumor response. Cancer
cells may activate the STING pathway by numerous ways, for example following virus
infection (EBV, HPV, HBV ETC) of known or unknown viruses, by the re-activation of
endogenous retroviruses (ERV), or other retroelements (retroelement-derived DNA,
retrotranscription) or proteins or nucleic acids which activate the STING pathway

[00841       In another preferred embodiment, treatment of cancer comprises administration of
STING or agents which induce STING and pathways thereof. The data shown herein,
evidences that the intracellular DNA pathway that is regulated by STING is defective in all
cancer cells examined so far. Thus suppression of the STING pathway may be an early,
critical and hitherto novel requirement for the cellular transformation process. The
intracellular DNA pathway is defective and that this event involves STING or STING
interacting molecules, or molecules upstream or downstream of STING, including TRAP
complexes, vesicular pathways and endosome pathways.
[00851       In a preferred embodiment, STING and/or STING interacting molecules are
administered to patients for the treatment of cancer. STING can be administered as a
polynucleotide, polypeptide, peptides, antisense oligonucleotides, vectors expressing STING,
antibodies and the like. The data herein, indicate that STING is absent in a variety of
lymphoma such as Burkett's lymphoma, breast cancer, other leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma
and so on. The data herein also show that there is defective intracellular DNA signaling in
cancer cells but not normal cells. Thus, reconstitution of STING and/or STING associated
molecules are used in treatments for cancer and other diseases or disorders. For example, the
data show that reconstitution of STING into cancer cell-lines previously shown to be
defective in intracellular DNA signaling such as 293T or MCF7, rescues the intracellular
pathway. That is reconstitution of STING can induce type I IFN and perhaps other signal
transduction pathways. STING would thus be useful to reconstitute in cancer cells, perhaps
to kill cancer but not normal cells. STING or other molecules associated directly or
indirectly with STING in the intracellular DNA pathway may be useful targets for therapeutic
intervention. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is also proposed that the STING
pathway will be deregulated/suppressed in viral infected tumors such as HPV related cervical
carcinoma, HCV or HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma, herpes virus associated cancers
(EBV positive Burkett's lines- (see, for example, Figures 26, 27). STING may also be
suppressed in latently infected cells such as those mentioned above (EBV, HPV) as well as
CMV, HIV etc.
[00861       In another preferred embodiment, STING is administered to a patient to prevent or
treat cancer. Cancer refers to all types of cancer or neoplasm or malignant tumors found in
mammals, including, but not limited to: leukemias, lymphomas, melanomas, carcinomas and
sarcomas. Examples of cancers are cancer of the brain, breast, pancreas, cervix, colon, head
and neck, kidney, lung, non-small cell lung, melanoma, mesothelioma, ovary, sarcoma,
stomach, uterus and Medulloblastoma. As used herein, the terms "cancer," "neoplasm," and

"tumor," are used interchangeably and in either the singular or plural form, refer to cells that
have undergone a malignant transformation that makes them pathological to the host
organism. Primary cancer cells (that is, cells obtained from near the site of malignant
transformation) can be readily distinguished from non-cancerous cells by well-established
techniques, particularly histological examination. The definition of a cancer cell, as used
herein, includes not only a primary cancer cell, but any cell derived from a cancer cell
ancestor. This includes metastasized cancer cells, and in vitro cultures and cell lines derived
from cancer cells. When referring to a type of cancer that normally manifests as a solid
tumor, a "clinically detectable" tumor is one that is detectable on the basis of tumor mass;
e.g., by procedures such as CAT scan, MR imaging, X-ray, ultrasound or palpation, and/or
which is detectable because of the expression of one or more cancer-specific antigens in a
sample obtainable from a patient.
[00871      In a preferred embodiment, administration of STING prevents (neuroprotective)
or treats neurological disorders. Neurological disorder refers to any disorder of the nervous
system and/or visual system. "Neurological disorders" include disorders that involve the
central nervous system (brain, brainstem and cerebellum), the peripheral nervous system
(including cranial nerves), and the autonomic nervous system (parts of which are located in
both central and peripheral nervous system). Neurodegenerative diseases, include, for
example, Alzheimer's Disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis etc.

[00891       In another preferred embodiment, administration of STING prevents or treats
patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Examples of autoimmune diseases comprise:
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)
comprising Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) which are chronic inflammatory
conditions with polygenic susceptibility.
[0090]       In another preferred embodiment, STING is a prognostic marker for disease
progression or outcome or response or resistance to anti-cancer therapies. For example, loss
of STING, change in expression and/or function of STING as compared to a normal cell, or
detection of a mutant STING molecule would be an indication of a cell progressing towards
being a tumor cell.
[0091]       In another preferred embodiment, STING is prognostic of a disease state
comprising cancer, autoimmunity, infection by an agent and the like.
[0092]       In a preferred embodiment, a peptide, polypeptide or protein encoded by an
isolated nucleic acid set forth as SEQ ID NOS: I or 2, or an active fragment or variant
thereof. In certain embodiments, the peptide is at least 380 consecutive amino acid residues
in length.
[0093]       In another preferred embodiment, a biomarker comprises a nucleic acid sequence
set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof.
[0094]       In another preferred embodiment, a biomarker comprises a peptide, polypeptide or
protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active
fragment, variant, or mutant thereof.
[0095]      Role in Autoininiunity: Antibodies to double-stranded DNA are present in roughly
half of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and are highly specific to the diagnosis of
SLE (Sim6n JA, et al. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2004 Feb;43(2):220-4). In addition, these
antibodies have prominent prognostic importance: SLE patients with anti-dsDNA antibodies
have a much greater likelihood of developing severe manifestations of lupus including lupus
nephritis and vasculitis, and have a substantially poorer long-term prognosis. Despite the
long-standing awareness of the importance of dsDNA antibodies to lupus, the relevance of
these antibodies to disease pathogenesis has remained mysterious. Isolated dsDNA
specificities have been found in some patients that directly interact with target tissue antigens,
but patients without identified cross-reactivities of this sort still often target the kidneys with
similarly poor prognoses . B and T cell tolerance protocols toward dsDNA antigens in
patients or in animal models of lupus have had very limited success (Renaudineau Y, et al.
Arthritis Rheum. 2006 Aug;54(8):2523-32; Cardiel MH, et al. Arthritis Rheun. 2008
                                            - 27  -

   WO 2010/017248                                                           PCT/US2009/052767
Aug;58(8):2470-80; Kang HK, et al. JImnunol. 2007 Jun 15;178(12):7849-58.). Interest in
the relevance of nucleosomal DNA to induction of innate immunity and in particular severe
dsDNA-associated lupus continues to exist, though, and non-TLR9 innate immune
recognition pathways for self DNA to induce immune reactivity have been identified. Given
the potential role that STING may play in inducing/amplifying innate immune responses to
products potentially including constituents of cell debris (such as nucleosomes or cellular
RNAs), STING may also play a role in the expression of a broader array of autoimmune and
auto-inflammatory conditions. It is thus notable that the STING gene is located in humans at
5q31.2, at or immediately adjacent to the IBD5 locus that has been linked to disease risk
and/or to more severe disease in processes including Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis,
diabetes mellitus type I, and celiac disease (7-10). At least one report has also observed an
association between this region and risk for lupus (De Jager PL, et al. Genes Immun. 2006
Jun;7(4):327-34). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that increased
induction of STING-associated pathways increases pro-immune signaling, increasing the
likelihood and severity of autoimmune diseases, including the tendency for anti-dsDNA
associated lupus to target major organs and to lead to poorer outcomes. Other diseases
regulated by the STING pathway include multiple sclerosis, the cause of which may involve
DNA based retroelements (Dolei A, Perron H. JNeurovirol.2009 Jan;15(1):4-13;
Christensen T. Association of human endogenous retroviruses with multiple sclerosis and
possible interactions with herpes viruses Rev Med Virol. 2005 May-Jun;15(3):179-211).
[0096]      STING InteractingMolecules: STING interacts or associates with a variety,
including, as yet unknown molecules and pathways.
[0097]      In a preferred embodiment, STING, compositions thereof, active fragment,
variant, or mutant thereof modulates expression and/or function of molecules which interact
or associate with, directly or indirectly, with STING. This includes all pathways and
molecules involved in those pathways, directly or indirectly, which STING may affect
(directly or indirectly).

 Vectors Expressing STING:
[00101]      In another preferred embodiment, a vector comprises a polynucleotide set forth as
SEQ ID NOS: 1, 2, variants, mutants or active fragments thereof.
[00102]      The vector can be administered to a patient wherein expression of SEQ ID NOS:
1, 2, variants, mutants or active fragments thereof, induces a response comprising at least one
of: anti-viral activity, immune responses, immune signaling or intracellular B-form DNA.
[00103]      A number of vectors are known to be capable of mediating transfer of gene
products to mammalian cells, as is known in the art and described herein. A "vector"
(sometimes referred to as gene delivery or gene transfer "vehicle") refers to a macromolecule
or complex of molecules comprising a polynucleotide to be delivered to a host cell, either in
vitro or in vivo. The polynucleotide to be delivered may comprise a coding sequence of
interest in gene therapy. Vectors include, for example, viral vectors (such as adenoviruses
("Ad"), adeno-associated viruses (AAV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and
retroviruses), liposomes and other lipid-containing complexes, and other macromolecular
complexes capable of mediating delivery of a polynucleotide to a host cell. Vectors can also

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
comprise other components or functionalities that further modulate gene delivery and/or gene
expression, or that otherwise provide beneficial properties to the targeted cells. As described
and illustrated in more detail below, such other components include, for example,
components that influence binding or targeting to cells (including components that mediate
cell-type or tissue-specific binding); components that influence uptake of the vector nucleic
acid by the cell; components that influence localization of the polynucleotide within the cell
after uptake (such as agents mediating nuclear localization); and components that influence
expression of the polynucleotide. Such components also might include markers, such as
detectable and/or selectable markers that can be used to detect or select for cells that have
taken up and are expressing the nucleic acid delivered by the vector. Such components can
be provided as a natural feature of the vector (such as the use of certain viral vectors which
have components or functionalities mediating binding and uptake), or vectors can be
modified to provide such functionalities. Other vectors include those described by Chen et
al; BioTechniques, 34: 167-171 (2003). A large variety of such vectors are known in the art
and are generally available.
[00104]     A "recombinant viral vector" refers to a viral vector comprising one or more
heterologous gene products or sequences. Since many viral vectors exhibit size-constraints
associated with packaging, the heterologous gene products or sequences are typically
introduced by replacing one or more portions of the viral genome. Such viruses may become
replication-defective, requiring the deleted function(s) to be provided in trans during viral
replication and encapsidation (by using, e.g., a helper virus or a packaging cell line carrying
gene products necessary for replication and/or encapsidation). Modified viral vectors in
which a polynucleotide to be delivered is carried on the outside of the viral particle have also
been described (see, e.g., Curiel, D T, et al. PNAS 88: 8850-8854, 1991).
[001051     Suitable nucleic acid delivery systems include viral vector, typically sequence
from at least one of an adenovirus, adenovirus-associated virus (AAV), helper-dependent
adenovirus, retrovirus, or hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome (HVJ) complex.
Preferably, the viral vector comprises a strong eukaryotic promoter operably linked to the
polynucleotide e.g., a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.
[001061     Additionally preferred vectors include viral vectors, fusion proteins and chemical
conjugates. Retroviral vectors include Moloney murine leukemia viruses and HIV-based
viruses. One preferred HIV-based viral vector comprises at least two vectors wherein the gag
and pol genes are from an HIV genome and the env gene is from another virus. DNA viral
vectors are preferred. These vectors include pox vectors such as orthopox or avipox vectors,

herpesvirus vectors such as a herpes simplex I virus (HSV) vector [Geller, A.I. et al., J.

Nat. Genet. 3: 219 (1993); Yang, et al., J. Virol. 69: 2004 (1995)] and Adeno-associated
Virus Vectors [Kaplitt, M.G., et al., Nat. Genet. 8:148 (1994)].
[001071      Pox viral vectors introduce the gene into the cells cytoplasm. Avipox virus
vectors result in only a short term expression of the nucleic acid. Adenovirus vectors, adeno
associated virus vectors and herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors may be an indication for
some invention embodiments. The adenovirus vector results in a shorter term expression
(e.g., less than about a month) than adeno-associated virus, in some embodiments, may
exhibit much longer expression. The particular vector chosen will depend upon the target
cell and the condition being treated. The selection of appropriate promoters can readily be
accomplished. Preferably, one would use a high expression promoter. An example of a
suitable promoter is the 763-base-pair cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The Rous sarcoma
virus (RSV) (Davis, et al., Hum Gene Ther 4:151 (1993)) and MMT promoters may also be
used. Certain proteins can expressed using their native promoter. Other elements that can
enhance expression can also be included such as an enhancer or a system that results in high
levels of expression such as a tat gene and tar element. This cassette can then be inserted into
a vector, e.g., a plasmid vector such as, pUC19, pUC 118, pBR322, or other known plasmid
vectors, that includes, for example, an E. coli origin of replication. See, Sambrook, et al.,
Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press, (1989).
The plasmid vector may also include a selectable marker such as the      p-lactamase gene for
ampicillin resistance, provided that the marker polypeptide does not adversely effect the
metabolism of the organism being treated. The cassette can also be bound to a nucleic acid
binding moiety in a synthetic delivery system, such as the system disclosed in WO 95/22618.
[00108]      If desired, the polynucleotides of the invention may also be used with a
microdelivery vehicle such as cationic liposomes and adenoviral vectors. For a review of the
procedures for liposome preparation, targeting and delivery of contents, see Mannino and
Gould-Fogerite,BioTechniques, 6:682 (1988). See also, Felgner and Holm, Bethesda Res.
Lab. Focus, 11(2):21 (1989) and Maurer, R.A., Bethesda Res. Lab. Focus, 11(2):25 (1989).

accordance with known techniques. See, Quantin, et al., Proc.Nat/. A cad. Sci. USA,

[001101      Another delivery method is to use single stranded DNA producing vectors which
can produce the STING intracellularly. See for example, Chen et al, BioTechniques, 34: 167
171 (2003), which is incorporated herein, by reference, in its entirety.
[00111]      Expression of STING may be controlled by any promoter/enhancer element
known in the art, but these regulatory elements must be functional in the host selected for
expression. Promoters which may be used to control STING gene expression include, but are
not limited to, cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,385,839 and 5,168,062),
the SV40 early promoter region (Benoist and Chambon, 1981, Nature 290:304-310), the

[00112]     A wide variety of host/expression vector combinations may be employed in
expressing the DNA sequences of this invention. Useful expression vectors, for example,
may consist of segments of chromosomal, non-chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences.
Suitable vectors include derivatives of SV40 and known bacterial plasmids, e.g., E. coli
plasmids col El, pCR1, pBR322, pMal-C2, pET, pGEX (Smith et al., Gene 67:31-40, 1988),
pMB9 and their derivatives, plasmids such as RP4; phage DNAs, e.g., the numerous
derivatives of phage 1, e.g., NM989, and other phage DNA, e.g., M13 and filamentous single
stranded phage DNA; yeast plasmids such as the 2[L plasmid or derivatives thereof, vectors
useful in eukaryotic cells, such as vectors useful in insect or mammalian cells; vectors
derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNAs, such as plasmids that have been
modified to employ phage DNA or other expression control sequences; and the like.
[00113]     Yeast expression systems can also be used according to the invention to express
STING. For example, the non-fusion pYES2 vector (XbaI, SphI, Shol, NotI, GstXI, EcoRI,
BstXI, BamH 1, Sac, Kpn1, and HindIl cloning sites; Invitrogen) or the fusion pYESHisA,

N-terminal peptide purified with ProBond resin and cleaved with enterokinase; Invitrogen),
to mention just two, can be employed according to the invention. A yeast two-hybrid
expression system can be prepared in accordance with the invention.
[00114]     One preferred delivery system is a recombinant viral vector that incorporates one
or more of the polynucleotides therein, preferably about one polynucleotide. Preferably, the
viral vector used in the invention methods has a pfu (plague forming units) of from about 108
to about 5x 1010 pfu. In embodiments in which the polynucleotide is to be administered with
a non-viral vector, use of between from about 0.1 nanograms to about 4000 micrograms will
often be useful e.g., about 1 nanogram to about 100 micrograms.
inmune modulation:
[00115]     STING activates innate immune responses. Accordingly, it is expected that it can
be attached to disease specific antigens and used in vaccines as an adjuvant, modulates the
immune response and as such, applicable in a wide variety of disease therapies.

[00116]     Immune systems are classified into two general systems, the "innate" or "primary"
immune system and the "acquired/adaptive" or "secondary" immune system. It is thought
that the innate immune system initially keeps the infection under control, allowing time for
the adaptive immune system to develop an appropriate response. The various components of
the innate immune system trigger and augment the components of the adaptive immune
system, including antigen-specific B and T lymphocytes (Kos, Innunol.Res. 1998, 17:303;
Romagnani, innunol. Today. 1992, 13: 379; Banchereau and Steinman, Nature. 1988,
392:245). A "primary immune response" refers to an innate immune response that is not
affected by prior contact with the antigen. The main protective mechanisms of primary
immunity are the skin (protects against attachment of potential environmental invaders),
mucous (traps bacteria and other foreign material), gastric acid (destroys swallowed
invaders), antimicrobial substances such as interferon (IFN) (inhibits viral replication) and
complement proteins (promotes bacterial destruction), fever (intensifies action of interferons,
inhibits microbial growth, and enhances tissue repair), natural killer (NK) cells (destroy
microbes and certain tumor cells, and attack certain virus infected cells), and the
inflammatory response (mobilizes leukocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells to
phagocytose invaders).
[00117]     Some cells of the innate immune system, including macrophages and dendritic
cells (DC), function as part of the adaptive immune system as well by taking up foreign
antigens through pattern recognition receptors, combining peptide fragments of these
antigens with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, and
stimulating naive CD8' and CD4' T cells respectively (Banchereau and Steinman, supra;
Holmskov et al., Immunol. Today. 1994, 15:67; Ulevitch and Tobias Annu. Rev. Immunol.
1995, 13:437). Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) communicate with these T cells,
leading to the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into T-helper I (Thl) or T-helper 2 (Th2)
lymphocytes that mediate cellular and humoral immunity, respectively (Trinchieri Annu. Rev.
Immunol. 1995, 13:25 1; Howard and O'Garra, Inmunol. Today. 1992, 13:198; Abbas et al.,
Nature. 1996, 383:787; Okamura et al., Adv. Immunol. 1998, 70:281; Mosmann and Sad,
Inununol. Today. 1996, 17:138; O'GarraImmunity. 1998, 8:275).
[00118]     In adaptive immunity, adaptive T and B cell immune responses work together
with innate immune responses. The basis of the adaptive immune response is that of clonal
recognition and response. An antigen selects the clones of cell which recognize it, and the
first element of a specific immune response must be rapid proliferation of the specific
lymphocytes. This is followed by further differentiation of the responding cells as the

effector phase of the immune response develops. These effector T lymphocytes, in the
context of the embodiments, are the tumor specific T lymphocytes.
[00119]      In a preferred embodiment, an immunomodulatory composition comprises STING
polynucleotides, peptides, mutants, variants or fragments thereof.
[00120]      In another preferred embodiment, an immunomodulatory composition comprises
an agent which modulates the expression and/or function of STING, thus affecting the
intracellular pathways that STING is involved in (e.g. regulation of intracellular DNA
mediated type -1 interferon induction). The immuniomodulatory compositions are used in
preventing or treating a patients varying diseases or disorders. Examples of diseases or
disorders comprise: immune disorders, autoimmunity, cancer, inflammation, cachexia,
neurodegenerative disease or disorders, neurological diseases or disorders, cardiac
dysfunction, transplantation, or infection.
[00121]      In another preferred embodiment, an agent inhibits or increases a function of
STING as compared to a baseline control.
[00122]      In another preferred embodiment, STING inhibits or increases an immune
response as compared to a baseline control.
[00123]      In another preferred embodiment, a partner molecule or a molecule which is part
of a pathway whereby STING acts either directly, for example, binding to a partner molecule,
or indirectly, for example, STING affects a molecule in one part of the pathway thereby
affecting the entire pathway downstream of that interaction. Examples of partner molecules
that STING may interact with, directly or indirectly comprise: RIG-I, Ssr2, TRAP, SEC61,
NK-kB, TBK, IPS-1, MAM components, exocyst components, major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I and II components, GARP components, translocon components,
endosome components or IRF3, IRF7.
[00124]      In another preferred embodiment, an adjuvant which can be administered with one
or more vaccines (e.g. DNA vaccine), or other therapeutic agents comprises: (i) a peptide
encoded by nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment,
variant, or mutant thereof; or, (ii) a nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an
active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof.
[00125]      In another preferred embodiment, a method of modulating a DNA-induced innate
immune response in a patient in need thereof, comprises administering to the patient, a
therapeutically effective amount of : (i) a peptide encoded by nucleic acid sequence set forth
as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof; or, (ii) a nucleic acid
sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof.

[00126]      In another preferred embodiment, a method of treating a viral infection in a patient
comprises administering to the patient, a therapeutically effective amount of : (i) a peptide
encoded by nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment,
variant, or mutant thereof; or, (ii) a nucleic acid sequence (Sting) set forth as SEQ ID NOS: I
or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof.
[00127]      In a preferred embodiment, STING regulates cross-presentation of antigen.
STING also interacts with beta-2 microimmunoglobulin, a component of the MHC-I.            02
microglobulin is necessary for cell surface expression of MHC class I and stability of the
peptide binding groove. In the absence of p2 microglobulin, very limited amounts of MHC
class I (classical and non-classical) molecules can be detected on the surface. In the absence
of MHC class I, CD8 T cells cannot develop. Type II IFN can upregulate components of the
proteosome (immune subunits) that are incorporated into immunoproteosomes. These
produce peptides that effectively, with antigen, bind to MHC class I receptors to stimulate
cell-mediated immunity. Thus, in some preferred embodiments, STING regulate these
processes and modulates immunity. Defects in this process could also involve STING and
provide screens and targets for drugs.
[00128]      STING also appears important for recognizing DNA's ability to stimulate the
innate immune response (including DNA comprising vectors, plasmids, poly dA-dT, poly
dC-dG and DNA of varying lengths and sequence composition including interferon
stimulating DNA [ISD]). Thus, in another preferred embodiment, STING modulates the
innate immune response.
[00129]      In another preferred embodiment, a method of modulating a DNA-induced innate
immune response in a patient in need thereof, comprises administering to the patient, a
therapeutically effective amount of : (i) a peptide encoded by nucleic acid sequence set forth
as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof; or, (ii) a nucleic acid
sequence (Sting) set forth as SEQ ID NOS: I or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant
thereof.
[00130]      All DNA vaccines function through the TBK1 pathway, activating the IFN
pathway through TBK1, which is essential for an immune response. It appears that STING
mediates this process, since plasmid DNA completely fails to activate IFN in the absence of
STING. Thus, STING and related molecules should be important components in future
vaccines and immunotherapeutic methods. STING was also found to activate the NF-kB
pathway.

[00131]      In another preferred embodiment, an adjuvant comprises: (i) a peptide encoded by
nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant
thereof; or, (ii) a nucleic acid sequence (Sting) set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active
fragment, variant, or mutant thereof.
[00132]      STING may regulate the translocon and proteosome and Golgi/endosome/exocyst
function and provide a new mechanism for the strategic design of new vaccine and
therapeutic concepts.
[00133]      Regulation of the pathway by STING attached to antigens, or encapsulated, is
expected to result in new vaccine concepts since this molecule potently stimulates the innate
immune pathway. The pathway could also be stimulated by other molecules- to regulate
function. The pathway further implicates the translocon in the mechanism of action. Thus,
these molecules could also be targeted for vaccine and therapeutic purposes. These pathways
or STING itself could be disregulated in cancers or by viruses following infection
contributing to pathogenesis.
[00134]      STING may be targeted by pathogens such as flaviviruses, yellow fever virus,
dengue virus for suppression, to evade host defense responses, and may be a targeted for anti
pathogen drugs.
[00135]      STING may be useful in vaccines against pathogens and cancer, and could be
targeted by drugs or used as a therapeutic target to boost immune system. As STING and
intracellular DNA pathways may be disregulated in cancer (the data herein indicates it is not
expressed in many cancer cells), it may also serve as a biomarker for disease and/or a
prognostic marker for outcome of disease. STING may be frequently disregulated in cancer
and provide a mechanism for viral oncolysis.
[00136]      In a preferred embodiment, a vaccine comprises a nucleic acid sequence set forth
as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, or an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof. The vaccine can be
administered in the context of a vector or as a nucleic acid.
[00137]      In another preferred embodiment, a vaccine comprises a peptide, polypeptide or
protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active
fragment, variant, or mutant thereof.
[00138]      In another preferred embodiment, a method of modulating an immune response in
vivo, comprises administering to a patient in need thereof, an immunoregulatory composition
in a therapeutically effective amount. Preferably, the immunomodulatory composition
comprises a nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment,
variant, or mutant thereof.

[00139]      In another preferred embodiment, the immunomodulatory composition comprises
a peptide, polypeptide or protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID
NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof.
[00140]      In yet another embodiment, a method of preventing or treating a disease or
disorder in a subject in need thereof, comprises administering to a patient an
immunoregulatory composition in a therapeutically effective amount wherein the
immunomodulatory composition comprises a nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID
NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof In another preferred
embodiment, the immunomodulatory composition comprises a peptide, polypeptide or
protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active
fragment, variant, or mutant thereof.
[001411      In another preferred embodiment, STING, mutants, variants and active fragments
thereof, are administered to a patient to prevent or treat an infection from an infectious
disease agent, for example, such as a viral, bacterial, fungal or protozoan agent.
[00142]      Viruses such as the herpes family (HSV-1- 8) and other DNA viruses implicated
in cancer such as HPV and HBV may also inadvertently activate STING to induce IFN and
an innate and thus adaptive immune response. The same result is apparent following
infection with bacteria such as Listeria. The DNA from Listeria normally activates IFN, but
this does not occur in the absence of STING. Collectively, STING is required for innate
signaling following infection with negative stranded RNA viruses, plausible positive-stranded
viruses, as well as DNA viruses and certain bacteria and other DNA pathogens such as
parasites and fungi. Thus, STING appears even more important than RIG-I or MDA5 or IPS
1 (which collectively just modulate RNA virus innate immunity).
[00143]      In a preferred embodiment, a method of treating a viral infection in a patient
comprises administering to the patient, a therapeutically effective amount of : (i) a peptide
encoded by nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: I or 2, an active fragment,
variant, or mutant thereof; or, (ii) a nucleic acid sequence (Sting) set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1
or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof.
[00144]     Peptides: Nucleic acids encoding for STING peptides are set forth as SEQ ID
NOS: 1 and 2. The term "STING" will refer to both the nucleic acids and peptides. The
invention is not limited to these two species but includes without limitation, allelic variants,
species variants, splicing variants, mutants, fragments, and the like. For illustrative purposes
only, these two sequences will be used throughout the specification but is not to be construed
as a limitation.

[00145]     In a preferred embodiment, peptides encoded by SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2 comprise at
least five consecutive amino acid residues with the understanding that they are "active"
peptides. "Active" includes one or more functions of STING which includes known
functions as described herein but also any other function that is innate to the STING molecule
or including one which may be altered based on any manipulation by the end user.
[00146]     In another preferred embodiment, STING peptide includes the peptide itself,
chemical equivalents thereto, isomers thereof (e.g., isomers, stereoisomers, retro isomers,
retro-inverso isomers, all-[D] isomers, all-[L] isomers, or mixed [L] and [D] isomers thereof),
conservative substitutions therein, precursor forms thereof, endoproteolytically-processed
forms thereof, such as cleavage of single amino acids from N or C terminals or
immunologically active metabolites of the peptides of the invention, pharmaceutically
acceptable salts and esters thereof, and other forms resulting from post-translational
modification. Also included is any parent sequence, up to and including 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and
4 amino acids in length (cyclized, or linear, or branched from the core parent sequence), for
which the specified sequence is a subsequence. A person skilled in the art would appreciate
that where the peptide can be a monomer, dimer, a trimer, etc. The use of the peptides of the
present invention include use of peptides wherein the active fragment or fragments are
complexed to one or more binding partners. Modified peptides which retain the activity of
the peptides of the invention are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
[00147]     In another preferred embodiment, a STING peptide comprises at least one non
native amino acid residue or a non-amino acid molecule. A "non-native" amino acid residue
comprises any change to an amino acid which is encoded by the STING nucleic acid
sequence. Thus, a non-native amino acid residue or non-amino acid molecule comprises,
without limitation: a chemical equivalent, analog, synthetic molecule, derivative, variant,
substitution, peptide nucleic acid, a linker molecule, inorganic molecule etc.
[00148]     The mutations can be introduced at the nucleic acid level or at the amino acid
level. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, because of the degeneracy of the
genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein.
For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine.
Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to
any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such
nucleic acid variations are "silent variations," which are one species of conservatively
modified variations. If mutations at the nucleic acid level are introduced to encode a
particular amino acid, then one or more nucleic acids are altered. For example proline is
                                             - 40 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
encoded by CCC, CCA, CCG, CCU; thus, one base change, e.g. CCC (proline) to GCC gives
rise to alanine. Thus by way of example every natural or non-natural nucleic acid sequence
herein which encodes a natural or non-natural polypeptide also describes every possible silent
variation of the natural or non-natural nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each
codon in a natural or non-natural nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only
codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be
modified to yield a functionally identical molecule or a different molecule. Accordingly, each
silent variation of a natural and non-natural nucleic acid which encodes a natural and non
natural polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.
[00149]      As to amino acid sequences, individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a
nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single
natural and non-natural amino acid or a small percentage of natural and non-natural amino
acids in the encoded sequence, the alteration results in the deletion of an amino acid, addition
of an amino acid, or substitution of a natural and non-natural amino acid with a chemically
similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar natural
amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition
to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the
methods and compositions described herein.
[00150]      A "non-natural amino acid" refers to an amino acid that is not one of the 20
common amino acids or pyrolysine or selenocysteine. Other terms that may be used
synonymously with the term "non-natural amino acid" is "non-naturally encoded amino
acid," "unnatural amino acid," "non-naturally-occurring amino acid," and variously
hyphenated and non-hyphenated versions thereof. The term "non-natural amino acid"
includes, but is not limited to, amino acids which occur naturally by modification of a
naturally encoded amino acid (including but not limited to, the 20 common amino acids or
pyrrolysine and selenocysteine) but are not themselves incorporated, without user
manipulation, into a growing polypeptide chain by the translation complex. Examples of
naturally-occurring amino acids that are not naturally-encoded include, but are not limited to,
N-acetylglucosaminyl-L-scrine, N-acetylglucosaminyl-L-threonine, and 0-phosphotyrosine.
Additionally, the term "non-natural amino acid" includes, but is not limited to, amino acids
which do not occur naturally and may be obtained synthetically or may be obtained by
modification of non-natural amino acids.
[00151]      In some cases, the non-natural amino acid substitution(s) or incorporation(s) will
be combined with other additions, substitutions, or deletions within the polypeptide to affect

other chemical, physical, pharmacologic and/or biological traits. In some cases, the other
additions, substitutions or deletions may increase the stability (including but not limited to,
resistance to proteolytic degradation) of the polypeptide or increase affinity of the
polypeptide for its appropriate receptor, ligand and/or binding proteins. In some cases, the
other additions, substitutions or deletions may increase the solubility of the polypeptide. In
some embodiments sites are selected for substitution with a naturally encoded or non-natural
amino acid in addition to another site for incorporation of a non-natural amino acid for the
purpose of increasing the polypeptide solubility following expression in recombinant host
cells. In some embodiments, the polypeptides comprise another addition, substitution, or
deletion that modulates affinity for the associated ligand, binding proteins, and/or receptor,
modulates (including but not limited to, increases or decreases) receptor dimerization,
stabilizes receptor dimers, modulates circulating half-life, modulates release or bio
availability, facilitates purification, or improves or alters a particular route of administration.
Similarly, the non-natural amino acid polypeptide can comprise chemical or enzyme cleavage
sequences, protease cleavage sequences, reactive groups, antibody-binding domains
(including but not limited to, FLAG or poly-His) or other affinity based sequences (including
but not limited to, FLAG, poly-His, GST, etc.) or linked molecules (including but not limited
to, biotin) that improve detection (including but not limited to, GFP), purification, transport
thru tissues or cell membranes, prodrug release or activation, size reduction, or other traits of
the polypeptide.
[001521      The methods and compositions described herein include incorporation of one or
more non-natural amino acids into a polypeptide. One or more non-natural amino acids may
be incorporated at one or more particular positions which does not disrupt activity of the
polypeptide. This can be achieved by making "conservative" substitutions, including but not
limited to, substituting hydrophobic amino acids with non-natural or natural hydrophobic
amino acids, bulky amino acids with non-natural or natural bulky amino acids, hydrophilic
amino acids with non-natural or natural hydrophilic amino acids) and/or inserting the non
natural amino acid in a location that is not required for activity.
[001531      A variety of biochemical and structural approaches can be employed to select the
desired sites for substitution with a non-natural amino acid within the polypeptide. Any
position of the polypeptide chain is suitable for selection to incorporate a non-natural amino
acid, and selection may be based on rational design or by random selection for any or no
particular desired purpose. Selection of desired sites may be based on producing a non
natural amino acid polypeptide (which may be further modified or remain unmodified)

partial agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists, receptor binding modulators, receptor activity
modulators, modulators of binding to binder partners, binding partner activity modulators,
binding partner conformation modulators, dimer or multimer formation, no change to activity
or property compared to the native molecule, or manipulating any physical or chemical
property of the polypeptide such as solubility, aggregation, or stability. For example,
locations in the polypeptide required for biological activity of a polypeptide can be identified
using methods including, but not limited to, point mutation analysis, alanine scanning or
homolog scanning methods. Residues other than those identified as critical to biological
activity by methods including, but not limited to, alanine or homolog scanning mutagenesis
may be good candidates for substitution with a non-natural amino acid depending on the
desired activity sought for the polypeptide. Alternatively, the sites identified as critical to
biological activity may also be good candidates for substitution with a non-natural amino
acid, again depending on the desired activity sought for the polypeptide. Another alternative
would be to make serial substitutions in each position on the polypeptide chain with a non
natural amino acid and observe the effect on the activities of the polypeptide. Any means,
technique, or method for selecting a position for substitution with a non-natural amino acid
into any polypeptide is suitable for use in the methods, techniques and compositions
described herein.
[001541     The structure and activity of naturally-occurring mutants of a polypeptide that
contain deletions can also be examined to determine regions of the protein that are likely to
be tolerant of substitution with a non-natural amino acid. Once residues that are likely to be
intolerant to substitution with non-natural amino acids have been eliminated, the impact of
proposed substitutions at each of the remaining positions can be examined using methods
including, but not limited to, the three-dimensional structure of the relevant polypeptide, and
any associated ligands or binding proteins. X-ray crystallographic and NMR structures of
many polypeptides are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, www.rcsb.org), a
centralized database containing three-dimensional structural data of large molecules of
proteins and nucleic acids, one can be used to identify amino acid positions that can be
substituted with non-natural amino acids. In addition, models may be made investigating the
secondary and tertiary structure of polypeptides, if three-dimensional structural data is not
available. Thus, the identity of amino acid positions that can be substituted with non-natural
amino acids can be readily obtained. Exemplary sites of incorporation of a non-natural
amino acid include, but are not limited to, those that are excluded from potential receptor

[00155]      A wide variety of non-natural amino acids can be substituted for, or incorporated

a preference for conservative substitutions
[001561      As further used herein, a "chemical equivalent" of a peptide of the invention is a
molecule which possesses the same desired activity, e.g. immunological activity, as peptides
described herein, and exhibits a trivial chemical different, or a molecule which is converted,
under mild conditions, into a peptide of the invention (e.g., esters, ethers, reduction products,
and complexes of the peptides of the invention).
[00157]      Additionally, as used herein, "conservative substitutions" are those amino acid
substitutions which are functionally equivalent to the substituted amino acid residue, either
because they have similar polarity or steric arrangement, or because they belong to the same
class as the substituted residue (e.g., hydrophobic, acidic, or basic). The term "conservative
substitutions", as defined herein, includes substitutions having an inconsequential effect on
the ability of the peptide of the invention to enhance innate immunity. Examples of
conservative substitutions include the substitution of a polar (hydrophilic) residue for another
(e.g., arginine/lysine, glutamine/asparagine, or threonine/serine); the substitution of a non
polar (hydrophobic) residue (e.g. isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine) for
another, the substitution of an acidic residue (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) for another;
or the substitution of a basic residue (e.g., arginine, histidine, lysine or ornithine) for another.
[00158]      The term "analogue", as used herein, includes any peptide having an amino acid
sequence substantially identical to a sequence described herein, in which at least one residue
has been conservatively substituted with a functionally-similar residue. An "analogue"
includes functional variants and obvious chemical equivalents of an amino acid sequence of a
STING peptide. As further used herein, the term "functional variant" refers to the activity of
a peptide that demonstrates an ability to modulate innate immunity, such as, for example by
stimulating IFN; interacting with one or more molecules, such as for example, RIG-1,
Ssr2/TRAPP; activating a transcription pathway, such as for example, activating NF-KB,

IRF3, etc. An "analogue" further includes any pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of an
analogue as described herein.
[001591      A "derivative", as used herein, refers to a peptide of the invention having one or
more amino acids chemically derivatized by reaction of a functional side group. Exemplary
derivatized molecules include, without limitation, peptide molecules in which free amino
groups have been derivatized to form salts or amides, by adding acetyl groups, amine
hydrochlorides, carbobenzoxy groups, chloroacetyl groups, formyl groups, p-toluene sulfonyl
groups, or t-butyloxycarbonyl groups. Free hydroxyl groups may be derivatized to form 0
acyl or O-alkyl derivatives. Furthermore, free carboxyl groups may be derivatized to form
salts, esters (e.g., methyl and ethyl esters), or hydrazides. Thus, a "derivative" further
includes any pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of a derivative as described herein.
[001601      In one embodiment of the present invention, the isolated peptide of the invention
has a modified C-terminus and/or a modified N-terminus. For example, the isolated peptide
may have an amidated C-terminus. For example, the amino terminus can be acetylated (Ac)
or the carboxy terminus can be amidated (NH 2). However, in one embodiment of the
invention, the peptides of the invention are preferably not acetylated if such a modification
would result in loss of desired immunological activity. Amino terminus modifications
include methylating (i.e., --NHCH 3 or --NH(CH 3)2, acetylating, adding a carbobenzoyl group,
or blocking the amino terminus with any blocking group containing a carboxylate
functionality defined by RCOO--, where R is selected from the group consisting of naphthyl,
acridinyl, steroidyl, and similar groups. Carboxy terminus modifications include replacing
the free acid with a carboxamide group or forming a cyclic lactam at the carboxy terminus to
introduce structural constraints.
[001611      In one embodiment backbone substitutions can be made, such as NH to NCH 3.
The isolated peptide may also be a modification (e.g., a point mutation, such as an insertion
or a deletion, or a truncation). By way of example, the peptide may comprise an amino acid
sequence comprising a modified residue by at least one point insertion of a D amino acid as
long as desired STING activity is retained. In particular, proline analogs in which the ring
size of the proline residue is changed from 5 members to 4, 6, or 7 members can be
employed. Cyclic groups can be saturated or unsaturated, and if unsaturated, can be aromatic
or non-aromatic.
[001621      In another preferred embodiment, the naturally occurring side chains of the 20
genetically encoded amino acids (or D amino acids) are replaced with other side chains with
similar properties, for instance with groups such as alkyl, lower alkyl, cyclic 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7

membered alkyl amide, amide lower alkyl amide di(lower alkyl), lower alkoxy, hydroxy,
carboxy and the lower ester derivatives thereof, and with 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7-membered
heterocyclic.
[001631      Such substitutions can include but are not necessarily limited to: (1) non-standard
positively charged amino acids, like: ornithine, Nlys; N-(4-aminobutyl)-glycine which has the
lysine side chain attached to the "N-terminus" and compounds with aminopropyl or
aminoethyl groups attached to the amino group of glycine. (2), Non-naturally occurring
amino acids with no net charge and side-chains similar to arginine, such as, Cit; citrulline and
Hei; citrulline with one more methylene group; (3) non-standard non-naturally occurring
amino acids with OH (e.g., like serine), such as, hSer; homoserine (one more methylen group,
Hyp; hydroxyproline, Val(3OH); hydroxyvaline, Pen; penicillamin, (Val(3SH); (4) proline
derivatives, such as, D-Pro, such as, 3,4-dehydroproline, Pyr; pyroglutamine (proline with
C=O in ring), Proline with fluorine substitutions on the ring, 1,3-thiazolidine-+carboxylic
acid (proline with S in ring); (5) Histidine derivative, such as, Thi; beta-(2-thienyl)-alanine;
or (6) alkyl derivatives, such as, Abu; 2-aminobutyric acid (ethyl group on Ca), Nva;
norvaline (propyl group on Ca), NIe; norleucine (butyl group on Ca), Hol; homoleucine
(propyl group on Ca), Aib, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (valine without methylene group). A
person skilled in the art would appreciate that those substitutions that retain the activity of the
parent peptide/sequence.
[001641      In another alternative embodiment, the C-terminal carboxyl group or a C-terminal
ester can be induced to cyclize by internal displacement of the --OH or the ester (--OR) of the
carboxyl group or ester respectively with the N-terminal amino group to form a cyclic
peptide. For example, after synthesis and cleavage to give the peptide acid, the free acid is
converted to an activated ester by an appropriate carboxyl group activator such as
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) in solution, for example, in methylene chloride (CH 2Cl 2 ),
dimethyl formamide (DMF) mixtures. The cyclic peptide is then formed by internal
displacement of the activated ester with the N-terminal amine. Internal cyclization as
opposed to polymerization can be enhanced by use of very dilute solutions. Such methods
are well known in the art.
[001651      The peptides of the invention can be cyclized, or a desamino or descarboxy
residue at the termini of the peptide can be incorporated, so that there is no terminal amino or
carboxyl group, to decrease susceptibility to proteases or to restrict the conformation of the
peptide. C-terminal functional groups of the compounds of the present invention include

amide, amide lower alkyl, amide di(lower alkyl), lower alkoxy, hydroxy, and carboxy, and
the lower ester derivatives thereof, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
[001661       The peptides of the invention can be cyclized by adding an N and/or C terminal
cysteine and cyclizing the peptide through disulfide linkages or other side chain interactions.
[00167]       A desamino or descarboxy residue at the termini of the peptide can be
incorporated, so that there is no terminal amino or carboxyl group, to decrease susceptibility
to proteases or to restrict the conformation of the peptide.
[00168]       Chimeric Molecules: In a preferred embodiment, one or more STING nucleic
acids, proteins or peptides can be linked or fused to another moiety. For example, a targeting
sequence, such as, for example, an aptamer, antibody sequence; a therapeutic effector
molecule, e.g. cytokines, antibiotics, toxins, radiolabels; signal leader peptide; intracellular
targeting moiety and the like. The STING molecules can be genetically fused, or linked via
linker molecules.
[00169]       For example, STING fusion molecules can be fused or linked to a therapeutically
effective domain which can be a modulatory or cytolytic moiety having a significant serum
half-life (t1 2) beyond that of either antibody or modulatory/cytolytic moiety alone.
[00170]       Accordingly, embodiments of the invention are further directed to chimeric fusion
molecules comprising single or multivalent therapeutically active domains which can be
modulatory and/or cytolytic; an antigen-binding domain; compositions of single-chain and
multivalent modulatory and cytolytic antigen-binding fusion proteins and the like. Other
moieties include integrin motifs and NGR motifs.
[00171]       Furthermore, the chimeric STING molecules to be used in the present invention,
as described herein, may comprise at least one further domain, inter alia, domains which
provide for purification means, like, e.g. histidine stretches. The further domain(s) may be
linked by covalent or non-covalent bonds.
[00172]       The linkage can be based on genetic fusion according to the methods known in the
art and described herein or can be performed by, e.g., chemical cross-linking as described in,
e.g., WO 94/04686. The additional domain present in the construct may be linked by a
flexible linker, such as a polypeptide linker to one of the binding site domains; the
polypeptide linker can comprise plural, hydrophilic or peptide-bonded amino acids of a
length sufficient to span the distance between the C-terminal end of one of the domains and
the N-terminal end of the other of the domains when the polypeptide assumes a conformation
suitable for binding when disposed in aqueous solution.

[00173]       In another preferred embodiment, the molecule comprises a label for detecting the
fusion molecule in vivo and to monitor the effects of the chimeric molecule during therapy.
[001741       "Detectable moiety" or a "label" refers to a composition detectable by
spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, or chemical means. For
                                  32
example, useful labels include       p, 35S, fluorescent dyes, electron-dense reagents, enzymes
(e.g., as commonly used in an ELISA), biotin-streptavidin, dioxigenin, haptens and proteins
for which antisera or monoclonal antibodies are available, or nucleic acid molecules with a
sequence complementary to a target. The detectable moiety often generates a measurable
signal, such as a radioactive, chromogenic, or fluorescent signal, that can be used to quantify
the amount of bound detectable moiety in a sample. Quantitation of the signal is achieved by,
e.g., scintillation counting, densitometry, or flow cytometry.
[001751       In other embodiments, the molecules can be in any stereoisomeoric form, for
example, enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers and the like. The fusion molecule or parts
thereof includes all variants, mutations, alleles, substitutes, fragments and analogs thereof.
[00176]       In another preferred embodiment, a moiety which can be used in embodiments of
the invention can be determined based on the desired treatment. For example, if the disease
is cancer, various anticancer agents can be used. If a disease relates to transplantation or
autoimmunity, immune suppressor molecules can be used. If the diseases is an infection,
antibiotics, antiviral moieties, anti-inflammatory moieties can be used. The invention
contemplates the use of one or more moieties with different properties can be used, for
example, an anti-angiogenic moiety and a toxin. The various moieties and combinations are
only limited by the imagination of the user. As illustrative examples, the moieties can
include one or more molecules' comprising: endostatin, angiogenin, angiostatin, chemokines,
angioarrestin, angiostatin (plasminogen fragment), basement-membrane collagen-derived
anti-angiogenic factors (tumstatin, canstatin, or arrestin), anti-angiogenic antithrombin III,
signal transduction inhibitors, cartilage-derived inhibitor (CDI), CD59 complement fragment,
fibronectin fragment, gro-beta, heparinases, heparin hexasaccharide fragment, human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), interferon alpha/beta/gamma, interferon inducible protein (IP

2-methoxyestradiol, placental ribonuclease inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor, platelet
factor-4 (PF4), prolactin 16 kD fragment, proliferin-related protein (PRP), various retinoids,
tetrahydrocortisol-S, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-3),

forms, variants, mutations, alleles, substitutes, fragments and analogs thereof

[00177]     In another preferred embodiment, the targeting domain comprises antibody,
aptamer, a ligand for a receptor (e.g. VEGF), diabodies, peptides, lipopolysaccharides,
integrins and the like.
[001781     In another preferred embodiment, the chimeric fusion molecules comprise an
antigen binding domain specific for other tumor antigens. The antigen binding domain can
be an antibody or aptamer, receptor, ligand etc.
[00179]     In one preferred embodiment, the invention provides for antibody fusion
molecules comprising: Fe region, CHI, CH2 and/or C11 3, Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 , single chain Fv
(ScFv)and Fv fragments, as well as any portion of an antibody having specificity toward a
desired target epitope or epitopes. Also preferred are antibodies or antibody fragments or to
single chain, two-chain, and multi-chain proteins and glycoproteins belonging to the classes
of polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, bispecific and hetero immunoglobulins (monoclonal
antibodies being preferred); it also includes synthetic and genetically engineered variants of
these immunoglobulins.
[00180]     In another preferred embodiment, the antigen binding domain is an aptamer. In
the preferred embodiment, the chimeric molecule comprises an aptamer fused to the STING
molecule, variants, mutants and fragments thereof. The aptamer can be specific for any one
or more tumor antigens.
[00181]     As used herein, the term "aptamer" or "selected nucleic acid binding species"
shall include non-modified or chemically modified RNA or DNA. The method of selection
may be by, but is not limited to, affinity chromatography and the method of amplification by
reverse transcription (RT) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
[00182]     Many tumor antigens are well known in the art. See for example, Van den Eynde

[00183]     In another preferred embodiment, the present invention features a compound
having a plurality of binding moieties, wherein at least two binding moieties have specificity
for different binding sites on the same target. In preferred embodiments, the plurality of
binding moieties includes a polypeptide. In other preferred embodiments, the targeting
moieties are all binding polypeptides which bind to different sites on the desired target. In
certain preferred embodiments, the target is a protein, a receptor, or a receptor/ligand

or the receptor/ligand complex.
[001841     In another preferred embodiment, the target is a receptor involved in angiogenesis,
hyperproliferative disorders or wound healing. In another embodiment the target includes a
family of receptors, such as, for example, protein-tyrosine kinase receptors. In one
embodiment, the target is Flt-I and KDR, VEGF (VEGF-1, -2 or -3) or the KDR/VEGF and
Flt-1/VEGF complexes, and the binding moieties, particularly binding peptides, bind to
different epitopes on Flt-1 and KDR or the KDR/VEGF and Flt-1/VEGF complexes. For
example, VEGFR-2/KDR, VEGFR-1/Flt-1 and VEGFR-3/Flt-4.
[00185]     In connection solid tumor treatment, the present invention may be used in
combination with classical approaches, such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and the
like. The invention therefore provides combined therapies in which the therapeutic
compositions are used simultaneously with, before, or after surgery or radiation treatment; or
are administered to patients with, before, or after conventional chemotherapeutic,
radiotherapeutic or other anti-angiogenic agents, or targeted immunotoxins or coaguligands.
[00186]     In another preferred embodiments, the chimeric molecule comprises one or more
cytolytic or other effector molecules. Cytolytic molecules that can be used to fuse to an
antibody or fragment thereof, include, but are not limited to TNF-a, TNF-, suitable effector
genes such as those that encode a peptide toxin--such as ricin, abrin, diphtheria, gelonin,
Pseudomonasexotoxin A, Crotalusdurissus terrificus toxin, Crotalus adanenteus toxin, Naja
naja toxin, and Naja mocambique toxin. (Hughes et al., Hum. Exp. Toxicol. 15:443, 1996;
Rosenblum et al., Cancerhnmunol. Inmiunother.42:115, 1996; Rodriguez et al., Prostate
34:259, 1998; Mauceri et al., Cancer Res. 56:4311; 1996).
[00187]     Also suitable are genes that induce or mediate apoptosis--such as the ICE-family
of cysteine proteases, the Bel-2 family of proteins, Bax, BclXs and caspases (Favrot et al.,
Gene Ther. 5:728, 1998; McGill et al., Front.Biosci. 2:D353, 1997; McDonnell et al., Semin.
CancerBiol. 6:53, 1995). Another potential anti-tumor agent is apoptin, a protein that
induces apoptosis even where small drug chemotherapeutics fail (Pietersen et al., Adv. Exp.
Med. Biol. 465:153, 2000). Koga et al. (Hu. Gene Ther. 11: 1397, 2000) propose a
telomerase-specific gene therapy using the hTERT gene promoter linked to the apoptosis
gene Caspase-8 (FLICE).
[00188]     Also of interest are enzymes present in the lytic package that cytotoxic T
lymphocytes or LAK cells deliver to their targets. Perform, a pore-forming protein, and Fas
ligand are major cytolytic molecules in these cells (Brandau et al., Clin. CancerRes. 6:3729,

2000; Cruz et al., Br. J. Cancer 81:881, 1999). CTLs also express a family of at least 11
serine proteases termed granzymes, which have four primary substrate specificities (Kam et
al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1477:307, 2000). Low concentrations of streptolysin 0 and
pneumolysin facilitate granzyme B-dependent apoptosis (Browne et al., Mol. Cell Biol.
19:8604, 1999).
[00189]      Other suitable effectors encode polypeptides having activity that is not itself toxic
to a cell, but renders the cell sensitive to an otherwise nontoxic compound--either by
metabolically altering the cell, or by changing a non-toxic prodrug into a lethal drug.
Exemplary is thymidine kinase (tk), such as may be derived from a herpes simplex virus, and
catalytically equivalent variants. The HSV tk converts the anti-herpetic agent ganciclovir
(GCV) to a toxic product that interferes with DNA replication in proliferating cells.
[00190]      If desired, although not required, factors may also be included, such as, but not
limited to, chemokines, cytokines, e.g. interleukins, e.g. IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-11, as well
as the other interleukins, the colony stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, interferons, e.g. y
interferon, erythropoietin.
[00191]      In another preferred embodiment, STING chimeric molecules can also comprise
an antisense or siRNA domain.
[00192]      In another preferred embodiment, the STING molecules, chimeric STING
molecules, etc, can be radiolabeled. Uses include therapeutic and imaging for diagnostic
purposes. The label may be a radioactive atom, an enzyme, or a chromophore moiety.
Methods for labeling antibodies have been described, for example, by Hunter and
Greenwood, Nature, 144:945 (1962) and by David et al. Biochemistry 13:1014-1021 (1974).
Additional methods for labeling antibodies have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,940,475
and 3,645,090. Methods for labeling oligonucleotide probes have been described, for

[00195]      Some useful enzymatic labels include enzymes that cause a detectable change in a
substrate. Some useful enzymes and their substrates include, for example, horseradish
peroxidase (pyrogallol and o-phenylenediamine),         p-galactosidase  (fluorescein p-D
galactopyranoside), and alkaline phosphatase (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro
blue tetrazolium). The use of enzymatic labels has been described in U.K. 2,019,404, EP
63,879, and by Rotman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 47, 1981-1991 (1961).
[001961      Useful chromophores include, for example, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and
bioluminescent molecules, as well as dyes. Some specific chromophores useful in the present
invention include, for example, fluorescein, rhodamine, Texas red, phycoerythrin,
umbelliferone, luminol.
[001971      The labels may be conjugated to the antibody or nucleotide probe by methods that
are well known in the art. The labels may be directly attached through a functional group on
the probe. The probe either contains or can be caused to contain such a functional group.
Some examples of suitable functional groups include, for example, amino, carboxyl,
sulfhydryl, maleimide, isocyanate, isothiocyanate. Alternatively, labels such as enzymes and
chromophores may be conjugated to the antibodies or nucleotides by means of coupling
agents, such as dialdehydes, carbodiimides, dimaleimides, and the like.
[00198]      The label may also be conjugated to the probe by means of a ligand attached to the
probe by a method described above and a receptor for that ligand attached to the label. Any
of the known ligand-receptor combinations is suitable. Some suitable ligand-receptor pairs
include, for example, biotin-avidin or biotin-streptavidin, and antibody-antigen.
[001991      In another preferred embodiment, the chimeric fusion molecules of the invention
can be used for imaging. In imaging uses, the complexes are labeled so that they can be
detected outside the body. Typical labels are radioisotopes, usually ones with short half

the polynucleotide or in the protein moiety, are considered known in the art.
[00200]      It is also envisaged that the STING molecules disclosed for uses, compositions
and methods of the present invention comprises (a) further domain(s) which may also
function as immune-modulating molecule. The immune-modulating molecule comprise, but

chimeric fusion molecule targets and delivers a modulatory or cytolytic molecule to a target

[002011      An immune-modulating effector molecule positively and/or negatively influences
the humoral and/or cellular immune system, particularly its cellular and/or non-cellular
components, its functions, and/or its interactions with other physiological systems. The
immune-modulating effector molecule may be selected from the group comprising cytokines,
chemokines, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF; as described, inter alia, in
Bcrnhagen (1998), Mol Med 76(3-4); 151-61 or Metz (1997), Adv Immunol 66, 197-223), T
cell receptors and soluble MHC molecules. Such immune-modulating effector molecules are
well known in the art and are described, inter alia, in Paul, "Fundamental immunology",
Raven Press, New York (1989). In particular, known cytokines and chemokines are
described in Meager, "The Molecular Biology of Cytokines" (1998), John Wiley & Sons,
Ltd., Chichester, West Sussex, England; (Bacon (1998). Cytokine Growth Factor Rev
9(2):167-73; Oppenheim (1997). Clin Cancer Res 12, 2682-6; Taub, (1994) Ther. Immunol.

[002021      Immune cell activity that may be measured include, but is not limited to, (1) cell
proliferation by measuring the DNA replication; (2) enhanced cytokine production, including
specific measurements for cytokines, such as IFN-y, GM-CSF, or TNF-a; (3) cell mediated
target killing or lysis; (4) cell differentiation; (5) immunoglobulin production; (6) phenotypic
changes; (7) production of chemotactic factors or chemotaxis, meaning the ability to respond
to a chemotactin with chemotaxis; (8) immunosuppression, by inhibition of the activity of
some other immune cell type; and, (9) apoptosis, which refers to fragmentation of activated
immune cells under certain circumstances, as an indication of abnormal activation.
TransgenicNon-Human Animal
[002031      In yet another aspect, the invention provides transgenic non-human animal, e.g., a
transgenic mouse, which lack STING. Details are provided in the examples which follow.
[002041      In a preferred embodiment, a nonhuman transgenic mammal whose genome lacks
a functional STING gene as set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, species variants, or mutants
thereof.
[002051      Transgenic mammals can be prepared for evaluating the molecular mechanisms of
STING, and particularly human STING -induced signaling. Such mammals provide
excellent models for screening or testing drug candidates. It is possible to evaluate
compounds or diseases on "knockout" animals, e.g., to identify a compound that can
                                                - 53 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
compensate for a defect in STING activity. Alternatively, human STING, "knock-in"
mammals can be prepared for evaluating the molecular biology of this system in greater
detail than is possible with human subjects. Both technologies permit manipulation of single
units of genetic information in their natural position in a cell genome and to examine the
results of that manipulation in the background of a terminally differentiated organism.
[00206]      A "knockout mammal" is a mammal (e.g., mouse) that contains within its genome
a specific gene that has been inactivated by the method of gene targeting (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.
Nos. 5,777,195 and 5,616,491). A knockout mammal includes both a heterozygote knockout
(i.e., one defective allele and one wild-type allele) and a homozygous mutant. Preparation of
a knockout mammal requires first introducing a nucleic acid construct that will be used to
suppress expression of a particular gene into an undifferentiated cell type termed an
embryonic stem cell. This cell is then injected into a mammalian embryo. A mammalian
embryo with an integrated cell is then implanted into a foster mother for the duration of
gestation. Zhou, et al. (Genes andDevelopment, 9:2623-34, 1995) describes PPCA knock-out
mice. Knockout mice can be used to study viral infections, immune system functions,
STING regulated pathways, identification of new therapies, cancer susceptibility, etc.
Disease phenotypes that develop can provide a platform for further drug discovery.
[00207]      The term "knockout" refers to partial or complete suppression of the expression of
at least a portion of a protein encoded by an endogenous DNA sequence in a cell. The term
"knockout construct" refers to a nucleic acid sequence that is designed to decrease or
suppress expression of a protein encoded by endogenous DNA sequences in a cell. The
nucleic acid sequence used as the knockout construct is typically comprised of (1) DNA from
some portion of the gene (exon sequence, intron sequence, and/or promoter sequence) to be
suppressed and (2) a marker sequence used to detect the presence of the knockout construct
in the cell. The knockout construct is inserted into a cell, and integrates with the genomic
DNA of the cell in such a position so as to prevent or interrupt transcription of the native
DNA sequence. Such insertion usually occurs by homologous recombination (i.e., regions of
the knockout construct that are homologous to endogenous DNA sequences hybridize to each
other when the knockout construct is inserted into the cell and recombine so that the
knockout construct is incorporated into the corresponding position of the endogenous DNA).
The knockout construct nucleic acid sequence may comprise 1) a full or partial sequence of
one or more exons and/or introns of the gene to be suppressed, 2) a full or partial promoter
sequence of the gene to be suppressed, or 3) combinations thereof. Typically, the knockout
construct is inserted into an embryonic stem cell (ES cell) and is integrated into the ES cell
                                            - 54  -

    WO 2010/017248                                                            PCT/US2009/052767
genomic DNA, usually by the process of homologous recombination. This ES cell is then
injected into, and integrates with, the developing embryo.
[002081     The phrases "disruption of the gene" and "gene disruption" refer to insertion of a
nucleic acid sequence into one region of the native DNA sequence (usually one or more
exons) and/or the promoter region of a gene so as to decrease or prevent expression of that
gene in the cell as compared to the wild-type or naturally occurring sequence of the gene. By
way of example, a nucleic acid construct can be prepared containing a DNA sequence
encoding an antibiotic resistance gene which is inserted into the DNA sequence that is
complementary to the DNA sequence (promoter and/or coding region) to be disrupted. When
this nucleic acid construct is then transfected into a cell, the construct will integrate into the
genomic DNA. Thus, many progeny of the cell will no longer express the gene at least in
some cells, or will express it at a decreased level, as the DNA is now disrupted by the
antibiotic resistance gene.
[002091     A "knock-in" mammal is a mammal in which an endogenous gene is substituted
with a heterologous gene (Roemer et al., New Biol. 3:331, 1991). Preferably, the
heterologous gene is "knocked-in" to a locus of interest, either the subject of evaluation (in
which case the gene may be a reporter gene; see Elefanty et al., Proc Nati Acad Sci USA
95:11897, 1998) of expression or function of a homologous gene, thereby linking the
heterologous gene expression to transcription from the appropriate promoter. This can be
achieved by homologous recombination, transposon (Westphal and Leder, CurrBiol 7:530,
1997), using mutant recombination sites (Araki et al., Nucleic Acids Res 25:868, 1997) or
PCR (Zhang and Henderson, Biotechniques 25:784, 1998).
[00210]     Generally, for homologous recombination, the DNA will be at least about I
kilobase (kb) in length and preferably 3-4 kb in length, thereby providing sufficient
complementary sequence for recombination when the knockout construct is introduced into
the genomic DNA of the ES cell.
[00211]     Included within the scope of this invention is a mammal in which two or more
genes have been knocked out or knocked in, or both. Such mammals can be generated by
repeating the procedures set forth herein for generating each knockout construct, or by
breeding to mammals, each with a single gene knocked out, to each other, and screening for
those with the double knockout genotype.
[00212]     Regulated knockout animals can be prepared using various systems, such as the
tet-repressor system (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,168) or the Cre-Lox system (see U.S. Pat. Nos.
4,959,317 and 5,801,030).

[00213]      In another series of embodiments, transgenic animals are created in which (i) a
human STING is stably inserted into the genome of the transgenic animal; and/or (ii) the
endogenous STING genes are inactivated and replaced with their human counterparts. See,
e.g., Coffman, Senin. Nephrol. 17:404, 1997; Esther et al., Lab. Invest. 74:953, 1996;
Murakami et al., Blood Press. Suppl. 2:36, 1996. Such animals can be treated with candidate
compounds and monitored for the effects of such drugs on STING activity.
[00214]      In another preferred embodiment, cells from the transgenic animals both knock-in,
knock-out and xenogeneic STING molecules, can be used in different assays, the cells can be
transformed, immortalized etc.
Antisense STING Oligonucleotides
[00215]      In another preferred embodiment, the functions and/or expression of STING in a
cell or patient are modulated by targeting STING molecules. Examples of STING antisense,
or siRNA oligonucleotides comprise SEQ ID NOS: 3 to 5.
[00216]      In a preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide comprises at least five consecutive
bases complementary to a nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, wherein
the oligonucleotide specifically hybridizes to and modulates expression and/or function of
STING in vivo or in vitro. In another preferred embodiment, the oligomeric compounds of
the present invention also include variants in which a different base is present at one or more
of the nucleotide positions in the compound. For example, if the first nucleotide is an
adenosine, variants may be produced which contain thymidine, guanosine or cytidine at this
position. This may be done at any of the positions of the oligonucleotide. These compounds
are then tested using the methods described herein to determine their ability to inhibit
expression of a target nucleic acid.
[00217]      In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, between
the oligonucleotide and target is from about 50% to about 60%. In some embodiments,
homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is from about 60% to about 70%. In some
embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is from about 70% to about
80%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is from about
80% to about 90%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity,
is about 90%, about 92%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about
99% or about 100%.
[00218]      In another preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide comprises combinations of
phosphorothioate intemucleotide linkages and at least one intemucleotide linkage selected
                                            - 56 -

from the group consisting of: alkylphosphonate, phosphorodithioate, alkylphosphonothioate,
phosphoramidate, carbamate, carbonate, phosphate triester, acetamidate, carboxymethyl
ester, and/or combinations thereof.
[002191      In another preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide optionally comprises at least
one modified nucleobase comprising, peptide nucleic acids, locked nucleic acid (LNA)
molecules, analogues, derivatives and/or combinations thereof
[002201      An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to
the target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the target nucleic acid to cause a
loss of activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific
binding of the oligonucleotide to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which
specific binding is desired. Such conditions include, i.e., physiological conditions in the case
of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and conditions in which assays are performed in
the case of in vitro assays.
[00221]      An oligonucleotide, whether DNA, RNA, chimeric, substituted etc, is specifically
hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target DNA or RNA molecule interferes
with the normal function of the target DNA or RNA to cause a loss of utility, and there is a
sufficient degree of complementarily to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide to
non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under
physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and in the case
of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are performed.
[00222]      The specificity and sensitivity of antisense is also harnessed by those of skill in
the art for therapeutic uses. Antisense oligonucleotides have been employed as therapeutic
moieties in the treatment of disease states in animals and man. Antisense oligonucleotides
have been safely and effectively administered to humans and numerous clinical trials are
presently underway. It is thus established that oligonucleotides can be useful therapeutic
modalities that can be configured to be useful in treatment regimes for treatment of cells,
tissues and animals, especially humans.
[00223]      In embodiments of the present invention oligomeric oligonucleotides, particularly
oligonucleotides, bind to target nucleic acid molecules and modulate the expression and/or
function of molecules encoded by a target gene. The functions of DNA to be interfered
comprise, for example, replication and transcription. The functions of RNA to be interfered
comprise all vital functions such as, for example, translocation of the RNA to the site of
protein translation, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or
                                              - 57 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                              PCT/US2009/052767
more mRNA species, and catalytic activity which may be engaged in or facilitated by the
RNA. The functions may be up-regulated or inhibited depending on the functions desired.
[002241      The oligonucleotides, include, antisense oligomeric compounds, antisense
oligonucleotides, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, alternate splicers, primers,
probes, and other oligomeric compounds that hybridize to at least a portion of the target
nucleic acid. As such, these compounds may be introduced in the form of single-stranded,
double-stranded, partially single-stranded, or circular oligomeric compounds.
[002251      Targeting an oligonucleotide to a particular nucleic acid molecule (e.g. SEQ ID
NOS: 1 or 2), in the context of this invention, can be a multistep process. The process
usually begins with the identification of a target nucleic acid whose function is to be
modulated. This target nucleic acid may be, for example, a cellular gene (or mRNA
transcribed from the gene) whose expression is associated with a particular disorder or
disease state, or a nucleic acid molecule from an infectious agent.
[002261      The targeting process usually also includes determination of at least one target
region, segment, or site within the target nucleic acid for the antisense interaction to occur
such that the desired effect, e.g., modulation of expression, will result. Within the context of
the present invention, the term "region" is defined as a portion of the target nucleic acid
having at least one identifiable structure, function, or characteristic. Within regions of target
nucleic acids are segments. "Segments" are defined as smaller or sub-portions of regions
within a target nucleic acid. "Sites," as used in the present invention, are defined as positions
within a target nucleic acid.
[002271      Since, as is known in the art, the translation initiation codon is typically 5'-AUG
(in transcribed mRNA molecules; 5'-ATG in the corresponding DNA molecule), the
translation initiation codon is also referred to as the "AUG codon," the "start codon" or the
"AUG start codon". A minority of genes has a translation initiation codon having the RNA
sequence 5'-GUG, 5'-UUG or 5'-CUG; and 5'-AUA, 5'-ACG and 5'-CUG have been shown to
function in vivo. Thus, the terms "translation initiation codon" and "start codon" can
encompass many codon sequences, even though the initiator amino acid in each instance is
typically methionine (in eukaryotes) or formylmethionine (in prokaryotes). Eukaryotic and
prokaryotic genes may have two or more alternative start codons, any one of which may be
preferentially utilized for translation initiation in a particular cell type or tissue, or under a
particular set of conditions. In the context of the invention, "start codon" and "translation
initiation codon" refer to the codon or codons that are used in vivo to initiate translation of an
mRNA transcribed from a gene encoding STING, regardless of the sequence(s) of such
                                              - 58 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                              PCT/US2009/052767
codons. A translation termination codon (or "stop codon") of a gene may have one of three
sequences, i.e., 5'-UAA, 5'-UAG and 5'-UGA (the corresponding DNA sequences are 5'
TAA, 5'-TAG and 5'-TGA, respectively).
[00228]        The terms "start codon region" and "translation initiation codon region" refer to a
portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous
nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation initiation codon. Similarly, the
terms "stop codon region" and "translation termination codon region" refer to a portion of
such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides
in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation termination codon. Consequently, the
"start codon region" (or "translation initiation codon region") and the "stop codon region" (or
"translation termination codon region") are all regions that may be targeted effectively with
the antisense compounds of the present invention.
[002291        The open reading frame (ORF) or "coding region," which is known in the art to
refer to the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination
codon, is also a region which may be targeted effectively. Within the context of the present
invention, a targeted region is the intragenic region encompassing the translation initiation or
termination codon of the open reading frame (ORF) of a gene.
[00230]        Another target region includes the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), known in the
art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5' direction from the translation initiation codon,
and thus including nucleotides between the 5' cap site and the translation initiation codon of
an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene). Still another target region includes the
3' untranslated region (3'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3'
direction from the translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the
translation termination codon and 3' end of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the
gene). The 5' cap site of an mRNA comprises an N7-methylated guanosine residue joined to
the 5'-most residue of the mRNA via a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage. The 5' cap region of an
mRNA is considered to include the 5' cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides
adjacent to the cap site. Another target region for this invention is the 5' cap region.
[00231]        Although some eukaryotic nRNA transcripts are directly translated, many contain
one or more regions, known as intronss," which are excised from a transcript before it is
translated. The remaining (and therefore translated) regions are known as "exons" and are
spliced together to form a continuous mRNA sequence. In one embodiment, targeting splice
sites, i.e., intron-exon junctions or exon-intron junctions, is particularly useful in situations
where aberrant splicing is implicated in disease, or where an overproduction of a particular
                                                - 59 -

splice product is implicated in disease. An aberrant fusion junction due to rearrangement or
deletion is another embodiment of a target site. mRNA transcripts produced via the process
of splicing of two (or more) mRNAs from different gene sources are known as "fusion
transcripts". Introns can be effectively targeted using antisense compounds targeted to, for
example, DNA or pre-mRNA.
[00232]     In another preferred embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotides bind to coding
and/or non-coding regions of a target polynucleotide and modulate the expression and/or
function of the target molecule.
[002331     In another preferred embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotides bind to natural
antisense polynucleotides and modulate the expression and/or function of the target molecule.
[002341     In another preferred embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotides bind to sense
polynucleotides and modulate the expression and/or function of the target molecule.
[00235]     Alternative RNA transcripts can be produced from the same genomic region of
DNA. These alternative transcripts or "pre-mRNA variants" are transcripts produced from
the same genomic DNA that differ from other transcripts produced from the same genomic
DNA in either their start or stop position and contain both intronic and exonic sequence.
[00236]     Upon excision of one or more exon or intron regions, or portions thereof during
splicing, pre-mRNA variants produce smaller "mRNA variants". Consequently, mRNA
variants are processed pre-mRNA variants and each unique pre-mRNA variant must always
produce a unique nRNA variant as a result of splicing. These mRNA variants are also
known as "alternative splice variants". If no splicing of the pre-mRNA variant occurs then
the pre-mRNA variant is identical to the mRNA variant.
[00237]     Variants can be produced through the use of alternative signals to start or stop
transcription. Pre-mRNAs and mRNAs can possess more that one start codon or stop codon.
Variants that originate from a pre-mRNA or mRNA that use alternative start codons are
known as "alternative start variants" of that pre-mRNA or mRNA. Those transcripts that use
an alternative stop codon are known as "alternative stop variants" of that pre-mRNA or
mRNA. One specific type of alternative stop variant is the "polyA variant" in which the
multiple transcripts produced result from the alternative selection of one of the "polyA stop
signals" by the transcription machinery, thereby producing transcripts that terminate at unique
polyA sites. Within the context of the invention, the types of variants described herein are
also embodiments of target nucleic acids.

[00238]     The locations on the target nucleic acid to which the antisense compounds
hybridize are defined as at least a 5-nucleobase portion of a target region to which an active
antisense compound is targeted.
[002391     While the specific sequences of certain exemplary target segments are set forth
herein, one of skill in the art will recognize that these serve to illustrate and describe
particular embodiments within the scope of the present invention. Additional target segments
are readily identifiable by one having ordinary skill in the art in view of this disclosure.
[00240]     Target segments 5-100 nucleobases in length comprising a stretch of at least five
(5) consecutive nucleobases selected from within the illustrative preferred target segments are
considered to be suitable for targeting as well.
[00241]     Target segments can include DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least the 5
consecutive nucleobases from the 5'-terminus of one of the illustrative preferred target
segments (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA
beginning immediately upstream of the 5'-terminus of the target segment and continuing until
the DNA or RNA contains about 5 to about 100 nucleobases). Similarly preferred target
segments are represented by DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least the 5 consecutive
nucleobases from the 3'-terminus of one of the illustrative preferred target segments (the
remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA beginning
immediately downstream of the 3'-terminus of the target segment and continuing until the
DNA or RNA contains about 5 to about 100 nucleobases). One having skill in the art armed
with the target segments illustrated herein will be able, without undue experimentation, to
identify further preferred target segments.
[00242]     Once one or more target regions, segments or sites have been identified, antisense
compounds are chosen which are sufficiently complementary to the target, i.e., hybridize
sufficiently well and with sufficient specificity, to give the desired effect.
[00243]     In embodiments of the invention the oligonucleotides bind to an antisense strand
of a particular target. The oligonucleotides are at least 5 nucleotides in length and can be
synthesized so each oligonucleotide targets overlapping sequences such that oligonucleotides
are synthesized to cover the entire length of the target polynucleotide. The targets also
include coding as well as non coding regions.
[00244]     According to the present invention, antisense compounds include antisense
oligonucleotides, ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, siRNA
compounds, single- or double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) compounds such as siRNA
compounds, and other oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a portion of the

target nucleic acid and modulate its function. As such, they may be DNA, RNA, DNA-like,
RNA-like, or mixtures thereof, or may be mimetics of one or more of these. These
compounds may be single-stranded, double-stranded, circular or hairpin oligomeric
compounds and may contain structural elements such as internal or terminal bulges,
mismatches or loops. Antisense compounds are routinely prepared linearly but can be joined
or otherwise prepared to be circular and/or branched. Antisense compounds can include
constructs such as, for example, two strands hybridized to form a wholly or partially double
stranded compound or a single strand with sufficient self-complementarity to allow for
hybridization and formation of a fully or partially double-stranded compound. The two
strands can be linked internally leaving free 3' or 5' termini or can be linked to form a
continuous hairpin structure or loop. The hairpin structure may contain an overhang on either
the 5' or 3' terminus producing an extension of single stranded character. The double
stranded compounds optionally can include overhangs on the ends. Further modifications can
include conjugate groups attached to one of the termini, selected nucleobase positions, sugar
positions or to one of the internucleoside linkages. Alternatively, the two strands can be
linked via a non-nucleic acid moiety or linker group. When formed from only one strand,
dsRNA can take the form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule that doubles back
on itself to form a duplex. Thus, the dsRNAs can be fully or partially double stranded.
Specific modulation of gene expression can be achieved by stable expression of dsRNA
hairpins in transgenic cell lines, however, in some embodiments, the gene expression or
function is up regulated. When formed from two strands, or a single strand that takes the
form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule doubled back on itself to form a duplex,
the two strands (or duplex-forming regions of a single strand) are complementary RNA
strands that base pair in Watson-Crick fashion.
[002451      Once introduced to a system, the compounds of the invention may elicit the action
of one or more enzymes or structural proteins to effect cleavage or other modification of the
target nucleic acid or may work via occupancy-based mechanisms. In general, nucleic acids
(including oligonucleotides) may be described as "DNA-like" (i.e., generally having one or
more 2'-deoxy sugars and, generally, T rather than U bases) or "RNA-like" (i.e., generally
having one or more 2'-hydroxyl or 2-modified sugars and, generally U rather than T bases).
Nucleic acid helices can adopt more than one type of structure, most commonly the A- and
B-forms. It is believed that, in general, oligonucleotides which have B-form-like structure
are "DNA-like" and those which have A-form-like structure are "RNA-like." In some
(chimeric) embodiments, an antisense compound may contain both A- and B-form regions.

[00246]     In another preferred embodiment, the desired oligonucleotides or antisense
compounds, comprise at least one of: antisense RNA, antisense DNA, chimeric antisense
oligonucleotides, antisense oligonucleotides comprising modified linkages, interference RNA
(RNAi), short interfering RNA (siRNA); a micro, interfering RNA (miRNA); a small,
temporal RNA (stRNA); or a short, hairpin RNA (shRNA); small RNA-induced gene
activation (RNAa); small activating RNAs (saRNAs), or combinations thereof.
[002471     dsRNA can also activate gene expression, a mechanism that has been termed
"small RNA-induced gene activation" or RNAa. dsRNAs targeting gene promoters induce
potent transcriptional activation of associated genes. RNAa was demonstrated in human cells
using synthetic dsRNAs, termed "small activating RNAs" (saRNAs). It is currently not
known whether RNAa is conserved in other organisms.
[002481     Small double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), such as small interfering RNA (siRNA)
and microRNA (miRNA), have been found to be the trigger of an evolutionary conserved
mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi invariably leads to gene silencing via
remodeling chromatin to thereby suppress transcription, degrading complementary mRNA, or
blocking protein translation. dsRNAs may also act as small activating RNAs (saRNA).
Without wishing to be bound by theory, by targeting sequences in gene promoters, saRNAs
would induce target gene expression in a phenomenon referred to as dsRNA-induced
transcriptional activation (RNAa).
[002491     RNA interference (RNAi) has become a powerful tool for blocking gene
expression in mammals and mammalian cells. This approach requires the delivery of small
interfering RNA (siRNA) either as RNA itself or as DNA, using an expression plasmid or
virus and the coding sequence for small hairpin RNAs that are processed to siRNAs. This
system enables efficient transport of the pre-siRNAs to the cytoplasm where they are active
and permit the use of regulated and tissue specific promoters for gene expression.
[00250]     In a preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide or antisense compound comprises
an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and/or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), or a
mimetic, chimera, analog or homolog thereof. This term includes oligonucleotides composed
of naturally occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent internucleoside (backbone) linkages
as well as oligonucleotides having non-naturally occurring portions which function similarly.
Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often desired over native forms because of
desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for a
target nucleic acid and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.

[00251]      According to the present invention, the oligonucleotides or "antisense
compounds" include antisense oligonucleotides (e.g. RNA, DNA, mimetic, chimera, analog
or homolog thereof), ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, siRNA
compounds, single- or double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) compounds such as siRNA
compounds, saRNA, aRNA, and other oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a
portion of the target nucleic acid and modulate its function. As such, they may be DNA,
RNA, DNA-like, RNA-like, or mixtures thereof, or may be mimetics of one or more of these.
These compounds may be single-stranded, double-stranded, circular or hairpin oligomeric
compounds and may contain structural elements such as internal or terminal bulges,
mismatches or loops. Antisense compounds are routinely prepared linearly but can be joined
or otherwise prepared to be circular and/or branched. Antisense compounds can include
constructs such as, for example, two strands hybridized to form a wholly or partially double
stranded compound or a single strand with sufficient self-complementarity to allow for
hybridization and formation of a fully or partially double-stranded compound. The two
strands can be linked internally leaving free 3' or 5' termini or can be linked to form a
continuous hairpin structure or loop. The hairpin structure may contain an overhang on either
the 5' or 3' terminus producing an extension of single stranded character. The double
stranded compounds optionally can include overhangs on the ends. Further modifications
can include conjugate groups attached to one of the termini, selected nucleobase positions,
sugar positions or to one of the internucleoside linkages. Alternatively, the two strands can
be linked via a non-nucleic acid moiety or linker group. When formed from only one strand,
dsRNA can take the form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule that doubles back
on itself to form a duplex. Thus, the dsRNAs can be fully or partially double stranded.
Specific modulation of gene expression can be achieved by stable expression of dsRNA
hairpins in transgenic cell lines (Hammond et al., Nat. Rev. Genet., 1991, 2, 110-119; Matzke
et al., Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev., 2001, 11, 221-227; Sharp, Genes Dev., 2001, 15, 485-490).
When formed from two strands, or a single strand that takes the form of a self
complementary hairpin-type molecule doubled back on itself to form a duplex, the two
strands (or duplex-forming regions of a single strand) are complementary RNA strands that
base pair in Watson-Crick fashion.
[00252]      The antisense compounds in accordance with this invention can comprise an
antisense portion from about 5 to about 80 nucleobases (i.e. from about 5 to about 80 linked
nucleosides) in length. This refers to the length of the antisense strand or portion of the
antisense compound. In other words, a single-stranded antisense compound of the invention

[002531      In one embodiment, the antisense compounds of the invention have antisense
portions of 10 to 50 nucleobases in length. One having ordinary skill in the art will
appreciate that this embodies oligonucleotides having antisense portions of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

In some embodiments, the oligonucleotides are 15 nucleobases in length.
[00254]      In one embodiment, the antisense or oligonucleotide compounds of the invention
have antisense portions of 12 or 13 to 30 nucleobases in length. One having ordinary skill in
the art will appreciate that this embodies antisense compounds having antisense portions of
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or30 nucleobases in
length, or any range therewithin.
[00255]      Certain preferred oligonucleotides of this invention are chimeric oligonucleotides.
"Chimeric oligonucleotides" or "chimeras," in the context of this invention, are
oligonucleotides which contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at
least one nucleotide. These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region of modified
nucleotides that confers one or more beneficial properties (such as, for example, increased
nuclease resistance, increased uptake into cells, increased binding affinity for the target) and
a region that is a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA
hybrids. By way of example, RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA
strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the
RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of antisense modulation of gene
expression. Consequently, comparable results can often be obtained with shorter
oligonucleotides when chimeric oligonucleotides are used, compared to phosphorothioate
deoxyoligonucleotides hybridizing to the same target region. Cleavage of the RNA target can
be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid
hybridization techniques known in the art. In one preferred embodiment, a chimeric
oligonucleotide comprises at least one region modified to increase target binding affinity,

and, usually, a region that acts as a substrate for RNAse H. Affinity of an oligonucleotide for
its target (in this case, a nucleic acid encoding ras) is routinely determined by measuring the
Tm of an oligonucleotide/target pair, which is the temperature at which the oligonucleotide
and target dissociate; dissociation is detected spectrophotometrically. The higher the Tm, the
greater the affinity of the oligonucleotide for the target.
[00256]       Chimeric antisense compounds of the invention may be formed as composite
structures of two or more oligonucleotides, modified oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides
and/or oligonucleotide mimetics as described above. Such; compounds have also been
referred to in the art as hybrids or gapmers. Representative United States patents that teach
the preparation of such hybrid structures comprise, but are not limited to, US patent nos.

5,623,065; 5,652,355; 5,652,356; and 5,700,922, each of which is herein incorporated by
reference.
[00257]       In another preferred embodiment, the region of the oligonucleotide which is
modified comprises at least one nucleotide modified at the 2' position of the sugar, most
preferably a 2'-O-alkyl, 2'-0-alkyl-O-alkyl or 2'-fluoro-modified nucleotide. In other
preferred embodiments, RNA modifications include 2'-fluoro, 2'-amino and 2' 0-methyl
modifications on the ribose of pyrimidines, abasic residues or an inverted base at the 3' end of
the RNA. Such modifications are routinely incorporated into oligonucleotides and these
oligonucleotides have been shown to have a higher Tm (i.e., higher target binding affinity)
than; 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides against a given target. The effect of such increased affinity is
to greatly enhance RNAi oligonucleotide inhibition of gene expression. RNAse H is a
cellular endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of RNA:DNA duplexes; activation of this
enzyme therefore results in cleavage of the RNA target, and thus can greatly enhance the
efficiency of RNAi inhibition. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely demonstrated by
gel electrophoresis. In another preferred embodiment, the chimeric oligonucleotide is also
modified to enhance nuclease resistance. Cells contain a variety of exo- and endo-nucleases
which can degrade nucleic acids. A number of nucleotide and nucleoside modifications have
been shown to make the oligonucleotide into which they are incorporated more resistant to
nuclease digestion than the native oligodeoxynucleotide. Nuclease resistance is routinely
measured by incubating oligonucleotides with cellular extracts or isolated nuclease solutions
and measuring the extent of intact oligonucleotide remaining over time, usually by gel
electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides which have been modified to enhance their nuclease
resistance survive intact for a longer time than unmodified oligonucleotides. A variety of

oligonucleotide modifications have been demonstrated to enhance or confer nuclease
resistance. Oligonucleotides which contain at least one phosphorothioate modification are
presently more preferred. In some cases, oligonucleotide modifications which enhance target
binding affinity are also, independently, able to enhance nuclease resistance. Some desirable
modifications can be found in De Mesmaeker et al. Ace. Chem. Res. 1995, 28:366-374.
[00258]     Specific examples of some preferred oligonucleotides envisioned for this
invention include those comprising modified backbones, for example, phosphorothioates,
phosphotriesters, methyl phosphonates, short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl intersugar linkages or
short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic intersugar linkages. Most preferred are
oligonucleotides with phosphorothioate backbones and those with heteroatom backbones,
particularly CH 2 --NH--O--CH 2, CH,--N(CH 3)--O--CH     2 [known as a
methylene(methylimino) or MMI backbone], CH 2 --O--N (CH 3 )--CH 2 , CH 2 --N (CH 3)--N
(CH 3)--CH 2 and O--N (CH 3 )--CH 2 -- CH 2 backbones, wherein the native phosphodiester
backbone is represented as O--P--0--CH,). The amide backbones disclosed by De
Mesmaeker et al. Ace. Chein. Res. 1995, 28:366-374) are also preferred. Also preferred are
oligonucleotides having morpholino backbone structures (Summerton and Weller, U.S. Pat.
No. 5,034,506). In other preferred embodiments, such as the peptide nucleic acid (PNA)
backbone, the phosphodiester backbone of the oligonucleotide is replaced with a polyamide
backbone, the nucleobases being bound directly or indirectly to the aza nitrogen atoms of the
polyamide backbone (Nielsen et al. Science 1991, 254, 1497). Oligonucleotides may also
comprise one or more substituted sugar moieties. Preferred oligonucleotides comprise one of
the following at the 2' position: OH, SH, SCH 3, F, OCN, OCH 3 OCH 3 , OCH 3 O(CH2)n CH 3 ,
O(CH 2)n NH 2 or O(CH 2 )n CH 3 where n is from I to about 10; C1 to C10 lower alkyl,

heterocycloalkaryl; aminoalkylamino; polyalkylamino; substituted silyl; an RNA cleaving
group; a reporter group; an intercalator; a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties
of an oligonucleotide; or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an
oligonucleotide and other substituents having similar properties. A preferred modification
includes 2'-methoxyethoxy [2'-O-CH 2 CH 2 OCH 3, also known as 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)]
(Martin et al., Helv. Chim. A cta, 1995, 78, 486). Other preferred modifications include 2'
methoxy (2'-O--CH 3), 2'-propoxy (2'-OCH 2 CH 2 CH 3) and 2'-fluoro (2'-F). Similar
modifications may also be made at other positions on the oligonucleotide, particularly the 3'
position of the sugar on the 3' terminal nucleotide and the 5' position of 5' terminal
                                            - 67 -

the pentofuranosyl group.
[002591      Oligonucleotides may also include, additionally or alternatively, nucleobase (often
referred to in the art simply as "base") modifications or substitutions. As used herein,
"unmodified" or "natural" nucleobases include adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T),
cytosine (C) and uracil (U). Modified nucleobases include nucleobases found only
infrequently or transiently in natural nucleic acids, e.g., hypoxanthine, 6-methyladenine, 5
Me pyrimidines, particularly 5-methylcytosine (also referred to as 5-methyl-2' deoxycytosine
and often referred to in the art as 5-Me-C), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC), glycosyl HMC
and gentobiosyl HMC, as well as synthetic nucleobases, e.g., 2-aminoadenine, 2
(methylamino)adenine, 2-(imidazolylalkyl)adenine, 2-(aminoalklyamino)adenine or other
heterosubstituted alkyladenines, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine, 5-bromouracil, 5
hydroxymethyluracil, 8-azaguanine, 7-deazaguanine, N6 (6-aminohexyl)adenine and 2,6
diaminopurine. Kornberg, A., DNA Replication, W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco,
1980, pp75-77; Gebeyehu, G., et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 1987, 15:4513). A "universal" base
known in the art, e.g., inosine, may be included. 5-Me-C substitutions have been shown to
increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2'C. (Sanghvi, Y. S., in Crooke, S. T. and
Lebleu, B., eds., Antisense Research and Applications, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993, pp.
276-278) and are presently preferred base substitutions.
[002601      Another modification of the oligonucleotides of the invention involves chemically
linking to the oligonucleotide one or more moieties or conjugates which enhance the activity
or cellular uptake of the oligonucleotide. Such moieties include but are not limited to lipid
moieties such as a cholesterol moiety, a cholesteryl moiety (Letsinger et al., Proc. Nat!. Acad.
Sci. USA 1989, 86, 6553), cholic acid (Manoharan et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let. 1994, 4,

Anti-STING Molecules
[00272]     Antibodies and Aptaners: In addition to the detection of STING gene and gene
expression using nucleic acid hybridization technology, immunoassays can also be used to
detect STING proteins of the invention. Such assays are useful for screening for modulators
of STING, as well as for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Immunoassays can be used
to qualitatively or quantitatively analyze STING protein. A general overview of the
applicable technology can be found in Harlow & Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual
(1988).
[00273]      Antibodies that specifically bind to: STING, a STING complexed with another
molecule, STING fragments, mutants, variants and complementary sequences thereof are
provided.
[002741      As used herein, the term "antibody" is meant to refer to complete, intact
antibodies, and Fab fragments and F(ab) 2 fragments thereof. Complete, intact antibodies
include monoclonal antibodies such as murine monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies
and humanized antibodies. Antibodies that bind to an epitope which is present on, for
example, Rad50, are useful to isolate and purify the Rad50 from both natural sources and
recombinant expression systems using well known techniques such as affinity
chromatography. Such antibodies are useful to detect the presence of such protein in a
sample and to determine if cells are expressing the protein.
[002751      Once the specific antibodies against STING are available, STING can be detected
by a variety of immunoassay methods. In addition, the antibody can be used therapeutically
as a STING modulators. For a review of immunological and immunoassay procedures, see
                                             - 72 -

Basic and Clinical Immunology (Stites & Terr eds., 7th ed. 1991). Moreover, the
immunoassays of the present invention can be performed in any of several configurations,
which are reviewed extensively in Enzyme Immunoassay (Maggio, ed., 1980); and Harlow &
Lane, supra.
[00276]     In a preferred embodiment, an antibody is specific for STING, variants, mutants
and fragments thereof. Preferred STING molecules are human STING molecules. For
example, mouse anti-human STING; rabbit anti-human STING; mouse anti-human STING;
goat-anti-, mouse STING, etc. The species of the antibody can be any species. However,
human or humanized antibodies are preferred. The antibodies can be directed to epitopes on
linearized STING peptides or peptides in a native conformation.
[002771     In another preferred embodiment, a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody is specific
for one or more antigenic epitopes of a peptide, polypeptide or protein encoded by a nucleic
acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant
thereof.
[00278]     In another preferred embodiment, aptamers to STING are also contemplated. As
used herein, the term "aptamer" or "selected nucleic acid binding species" include non
modified or chemically modified RNA or DNA. The method of selection may be by, but is
not limited to, affinity chromatography and the method of amplification by reverse
transcription (RT) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Candidate TherapeuticAgents
[002791     High throughput functional genomics assays can be used to identify modulators of
STING function and/or expression. Detailed methods for measuring functions of STING,
such as for example, STING mediated interferon induction, are provided in the examples
which follow. Typically, the cells are contacted with a cDNA or a random peptide library
(encoded by nucleic acids). The cDNA library can comprise sense, antisense, full length, and
truncated cDNAs. The peptide library is encoded by nucleic acids. The effect of the cDNA
or peptide library on STING is then monitored. The effect of the cDNA or peptide can be
validated and distinguished from somatic mutations, using, e.g., regulatable expression of the
nucleic acid such as expression from a tetracycline promoter. cDNAs and nucleic acids
encoding peptides can be rescued using techniques known to those of skill in the art, e.g.,
using a sequence tag.
[002801     Proteins interacting with the peptide or with the protein encoded by the cDNA
(e.g., STING) can be isolated using a yeast two-hybrid system, mammalian two hybrid

system, or phage display screen, etc. Targets so identified can be further used as bait in these
assays to identify additional members of the STING functional pathways, which members are
also targets for drug development (see, e.g., Fields et al., Nature 340:245 (1989); Vasavada et
al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 88:10686 (1991); Fearon et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA
89:7958 (1992); Dang et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:954 (1991); Chien et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad.
Sci. USA 9578 (1991); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,283,173, 5,667,973, 5,468,614, 5,525,490, and
5,637,463).
[002811     In a preferred embodiment, a method of identifying therapeutic agents comprises
contacting: (i) a peptide encoded by nucleic acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2,
an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof; or, (ii) a nucleic acid sequence (STING) set
forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 or 2, an active fragment, variant, or mutant thereof, with a candidate
therapeutic agent; determining whether (i) the agent modulates a function of the peptide or
interaction of the peptide with a partner molecule; or (ii) the agent modulates expression
and/or function of the nucleic acid sequence (STING).
[00282]     In another preferred embodiment, a method of identifying candidate therapeutic
agents for treatment of disease, comprises culturing an isolated cell expressing STING,
administering a candidate therapeutic agent to the cultured cell; correlating STING
expression and/or function in the presence or absence of a candidate therapeutic agent as
compared to control cells, wherein a drug is identified based on desirable therapeutic
outcomes. For example, a drug which modulates expression of STING; a drug which
modulates interferon production; association of STING with various molecules; modulation
of pathways;    p2-microglobulin expression   and the like; thereby, identifying candidate
therapeutic agents that regulates STING expression and/or function.
[002831     Another suitable method for diagnosis and candidate drug discovery includes
contacting a test sample with a cell expressing STING, an allele or fragment thereof; and
detecting interaction of the test sample with STING, an allele or fragment thereof, or
expression product of STING, an allele or fragment thereof. STING, an allele or fragment
thereof, or expression product of the gene, an allele or fragment thereof suitably can be
detectably labeled e.g. with a fluorescent or radioactive component.
[002841     In another preferred embodiment, a cell from a patient is isolated and contacted
with a candidate therapeutic molecule. The genes, expression products thereof, are
monitored to identify which genes or expression products are regulated by the drug.
[002851     Nucleic Acid Microarrays:Identification of a nucleic acid sequence capable of
binding to STING can be achieved by immobilizing a library of nucleic acids onto the
                                            - 74 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
substrate surface so that each unique nucleic acid is located at a defined position to form an
array. Details are provided in the examples section which follows. In general, the
immobilized library of nucleic acids are exposed to a biomolecule or candidate agent under
conditions which favored binding of the biomolecule to the nucleic acids. Non-specifically
binding biomolecules could be washed away using mild to stringent buffer conditions
depending on the level of specificity of binding desired. The nucleic acid array would then
be analyzed to determine which nucleic acid sequences bound to the biomolecule. Preferably
the biomolecules would carry a fluorescent tag for use in detection of the location of the
bound nucleic acids.
[00286]      An assay using an immobilized array of nucleic acid sequences may be used for
determining the sequence of an unknown nucleic acid; single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) analysis; analysis of gene expression patterns from a particular species, tissue, cell
type, etc.; gene identification; etc.
[00287]      Additional diagnostic uses for oligonucleotides designed from the sequences
encoding a desired gene expression product may involve the use of PCR. These oligomers
may be chemically synthesized, generated enzymatically, or produced in vitro. Oligomers
will preferably contain a fragment of a polynucleotide encoding the expression products, or a
fragment of a polynucleotide complementary to the polynucleotides, and will be employed
under optimized conditions for identification of a specific gene. Oligomers may also be
employed under less stringent conditions for detection or quantitation of closely-related DNA
or RNA sequences.
[00288]      In further embodiments, oligonucleotides or longer fragments derived from any of
the polynucleotide sequences, may be used as targets in a microarray. The microarray can be
used to monitor the identity and/or expression level of large numbers of genes and gene
transcripts simultaneously to identify genes with which target genes or its product interacts
and/or to assess the efficacy of candidate therapeutic agents in regulating expression products
of genes that mediate, for example, neurological disorders. This information may be used to
determine gene function, and to develop and monitor the activities of therapeutic agents.
[00289]      Microarrays may be prepared, used, and analyzed using methods known in the art
(see, e.g., Brennan et al., 1995, U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,796; Schena et al., 1996, Proc. Nat.
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93: 10614-10619; Baldeschweiler et al., 1995, PCT application

other embodiments, a microarray comprises peptides, or other desired molecules which can
be assayed to identify a candidate agent.
[00290]      Candidate agents include numerous chemical classes, though typically they are
organic compounds including small organic compounds, nucleic acids including
oligonucleotides, and peptides. Small organic compounds suitably may have e.g. a molecular
weight of more than about 40 or 50 yet less than about 2,500. Candidate agents may
comprise functional chemical groups that interact with proteins and/or DNA.
[00291]      Candidate agents may be obtained from a wide variety of sources including
libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. For example, numerous means are available for
random and directed synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds and biomolecules,
including expression of randomized oligonucleotides. Alternatively, libraries of natural
compounds in the form of e.g. bacterial, fungal and animal extracts are available or readily
produced.
[00292]      Therapeutic agent assays of the invention suitably include, animal models, cell
based systems and non-cell based systems.
[00293]      Preferably, identified genes, variants, fragments, or oligopeptides thereof are used
for identifying agents of therapeutic interest, e.g. by screening libraries of compounds or
otherwise identifying compounds of interest by any of a variety of drug screening or analysis
techniques. The gene, allele, fragment, or oligopeptide thereof employed in such screening
may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located
intracellularly.
[00294]      Another technique for drug screening provides for high throughput screening of
compounds having suitable binding affinity to the protein of interest (see, e.g., Geysen et al.,
1984, PCT application W084/03564). In this method, large numbers of different small test
compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate. The test compounds are reacted with
identified genes, or fragments thereof, and washed. Bound molecules are then detected by
methods well known in the art. Alternatively, non-neutralizing antibodies can be used to
capture the peptide and immobilize it on a solid support.
[00295]      The methods of screening of the invention comprise using screening assays to
identify, from a library of diverse molecules, one or more compounds having a desired
activity. A "screening assay" is a selective assay designed to identify, isolate, and/or
determine the structure of, compounds within a collection that have a preselected activity. By
"identifying" it is meant that a compound having a desirable activity is isolated, its chemical
structure is determined (including without limitation determining the nucleotide and amino

acid sequences of nucleic acids and polypeptides, respectively) the structure of and,
additionally or alternatively, purifying compounds having the screened activity).
Biochemical and biological assays are designed to test for activity in a broad range of
systems ranging from protein-protein interactions, enzyme catalysis, small molecule-protein
binding, to cellular functions. Such assays include automated, semi-automated assays and
HTS (high throughput screening) assays.
[002961      In HTS methods, many discrete compounds are preferably tested in parallel by
robotic, automatic or semi-automatic methods so that large numbers of test compounds are
screened for a desired activity simultaneously or nearly simultaneously. It is possible to
assay and screen up to about 6,000 to 20,000, and even up to about 100,000 to 1,000,000
different compounds a day using the integrated systems of the invention.
[002971      Typically in HTS, target molecules are administered or cultured with isolated cells
with modulated receptors, including the appropriate controls.
[00298]      In one embodiment, screening comprises contacting each cell culture with a
diverse library of member compounds, some of which are ligands of the target, under
conditions where complexes between the target and ligands can form, and identifying which
members of the libraries are present in such complexes. In another non limiting modality,
screening comprises contacting a target enzyme with a diverse library of member
compounds, some of which are inhibitors (or activators) of the target, under conditions where
a product or a reactant of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme produce a detectable signal.
In the latter modality, inhibitors of target enzyme decrease the signal from a detectable
product or increase a signal from a detectable reactant (or vice-versa for activators).
[00299]      In one embodiment the invention provides soluble assays using a STING protein,
or a cell or tissue expressing an STING protein, either naturally occurring or recombinant. In
another embodiment, the invention provides solid phase based in vitro assays in a high
throughput format, where the STING protein or fragment thereof, is attached to a solid phase
substrate. Any one of the assays described herein can be adapted for high throughput
screening, e.g., ligand binding, cellular proliferation, cell surface marker flux, e.g., CD-69,
screening, radiolabeled GTP binding, second messenger flux, e.g., Ca?-, IP3, cGMP, or
cAMP, cytokine production, etc. In one preferred embodiment, the cell-based system using
p2-microglobulin modulation and FACS assays is used in a high throughput format for
identifying modulators of STING proteins, and therefore modulators of T cell activation.
[003001      In the high throughput assays of the invention, either soluble or solid state, it is
possible to screen up to several thousand different modulators or ligands in a single day. This

methodology can be used for STING proteins in vitro, or for cell-based or membrane-based
assays comprising an STING protein. In particular, each well of a microtiter plate can be
used to run a separate assay against a selected potential modulator, or, if concentration or
incubation time effects are to be observed, every 5-10 wells can test a single modulator.
Thus, a single standard microtiter plate can assay about 100 (e.g., 96) modulators. If 1536
well plates are used, then a single plate can easily assay from about 100- about 1500 different
compounds. It is possible to assay many plates per day; assay screens for up to about 6,000,
20,000, 50,000, or more than 100,000 different compounds are possible using the integrated
systems of the invention.
[00301]     For a solid state reaction, the protein of interest or a fragment thereof, e.g., an
extracellular domain, or a cell or membrane comprising the protein of interest or a fragment
thereof as part of a fusion protein can be bound to the solid state component, directly or
indirectly, via covalent or non covalent linkage e.g., via a tag. The tag can be any of a variety
of components. In general, a molecule which binds the tag (a tag binder) is fixed to a solid
support, and the tagged molecule of interest is attached to the solid support by interaction of
the tag and the tag binder.
[003021     A number of tags and tag binders can be used, based upon known molecular
interactions well described in the literature. For example, where a tag has a natural binder,
for example, biotin, protein A, or protein G, it can be used in conjunction with appropriate tag
binders (avidin, streptavidin, neutravidin, the Fc region of an immunoglobulin, etc.)
Antibodies to molecules with natural binders such as biotin are also widely available and
appropriate tag binders; see, SIGMA Immunochemicals 1998 catalogue SIGMA, St. Louis
Mo.).
[003031     Similarly, any haptenic or antigenic compound can be used in combination with
an appropriate antibody to form a tag/tag binder pair. Thousands of specific antibodies are
commercially available and many additional antibodies are described in the literature. For
example, in one common configuration, the tag is a first antibody and the tag binder is a
second antibody which recognizes the first antibody. In addition to antibody-antigen
interactions, receptor-ligand interactions are also appropriate as tag and tag-binder pairs. For
example, agonists and antagonists of cell membrane receptors (e.g., cell receptor-ligand
interactions such as transferrin, c-kit, viral receptor ligands, cytokine receptors, chemokine
receptors, interleukin receptors, immunoglobulin receptors and antibodies, the cadherein
family, the integrin family, the selection family, and the like; see, e.g., Pigott & Power, The
Adhesion Molecule Facts Book 1 (1993). Similarly, toxins and venoms, viral epitopes,

hormones (e.g., opiates, steroids, etc.), intracellular receptors (e.g. which mediate the effects
of various small ligands, including steroids, thyroid hormone, retinoids and vitamin D;
peptides), drugs, lectins, sugars, nucleic acids (both linear and cyclic polymer
configurations), oligosaccharides, proteins, phospholipids and antibodies can all interact with
various cell receptors.
[00304]      Synthetic polymers, such as polyurethanes, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyureas,
polyamides, polyethyleneimines, polyarylene sulfides, polysiloxanes, polyimides, and
polyacetates can also form an appropriate tag or tag binder. Many other tag/tag binder pairs
are also useful in assay systems described herein, as would be apparent to one of skill upon
review of this disclosure.
[003051      Common linkers such as peptides, polyethers, and the like can also serve as tags,
and include polypeptide sequences, such as poly gly sequences of between about 5 and 200
amino acids. Such flexible linkers are known to persons of skill in the art. For example,
poly(ethelyne glycol) linkers are available from Shearwater Polymers, Inc. Huntsville, Ala.
These linkers optionally have amide linkages, sulfhydryl linkages, or heterofunctional
linkages.
[003061      Tag binders are fixed to solid substrates using any of a variety of methods
currently available. Solid substrates are commonly derivatized or functionalized by exposing
all or a portion of the substrate to a chemical reagent which fixes a chemical group to the
surface which is reactive with a portion of the tag binder. For example, groups which are
suitable for attachment to a longer chain portion would include amines, hydroxyl, thiol, and
carboxyl groups. Aminoalkylsilanes and hydroxyalkylsilanes can be used to functionalize a
variety of surfaces, such as glass surfaces. The construction of such solid phase biopolymer
arrays is well described in the literature. See, e.g., Merrifield, J Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149
2154 (1963) (describing solid phase synthesis of, e.g., peptides); Geysen et al., J Inmmun.
Meth. 102:259-274 (1987) (describing synthesis of solid phase components on pins); Frank &
Doring, Tetrahedron 44:60316040 (1988) (describing synthesis of various peptide sequences
on cellulose disks); Fodor et al., Science, 251:767-777 (1991); Sheldon et al., Clinical
Chemistry 39(4):718-719 (1993); and Kozal et al., Nature Medicine 2(7):753759 (1996) (all
describing arrays of biopolymers fixed to solid substrates). Non-chemical approaches for
fixing tag binders to substrates include other common methods, such as heat, cross-linking by
U.V radiation, and the like.
[003071      Chemical Libraries:Developments in combinatorial chemistry allow the rapid and
economical synthesis of hundreds to thousands of discrete compounds. These compounds are
                                              - 79 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
typically arrayed in moderate-sized libraries of small molecules designed for efficient
screening. Combinatorial methods, can be used to generate unbiased libraries suitable for the
identification of novel compounds. In addition, smaller, less diverse libraries can be
generated that are descended from a single parent compound with a previously determined
biological activity. In either case, the lack of efficient screening systems to specifically target
therapeutically relevant biological molecules produced by combinational chemistry such as
inhibitors of important enzymes hampers the optimal use of these resources.
[003081      A combinatorial chemical library is a collection of diverse chemical compounds
generated by either chemical synthesis or biological synthesis, by combining a number of
chemical "building blocks," such as reagents. For example, a linear combinatorial chemical
library, such as a polypeptide library, is formed by combining a set of chemical building
blocks (amino acids) in a large number of combinations, and potentially in every possible
way, for a given compound length (i.e., the number of amino acids in a polypeptide
compound). Millions of chemical compounds can be synthesized through such combinatorial
mixing of chemical building blocks.
[003091      A "library" may comprise from 2 to 50,000,000 diverse member compounds.
Preferably, a library comprises at least 48 diverse compounds, preferably 96 or more diverse
compounds, more preferably 384 or more diverse compounds, more preferably, 10,000 or
more diverse compounds, preferably more than 100,000 diverse members and most
preferably more than 1,000,000 diverse member compounds. By "diverse" it is meant that
greater than 50% of the compounds in a library have chemical structures that are not identical
to any other member of the library. Preferably, greater than 75% of the compounds in a
library have chemical structures that are not identical to any other member of the collection,
more preferably greater than 90% and most preferably greater than about 99%.

[00312]      Devices for the preparation of combinatorial libraries are commercially available
(see, e.g., 357 MPS, 390 MPS, Advanced Chem. Tech, Louisville Ky., Symphony, Rainin,
Woburn, Mass., 433A Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., 9050 Plus, Millipore,

[003131      High throughput screening can be used to measure the effects of drugs on
complex molecular events such as signal transduction pathways, as well as cell functions
                                             - 81 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                             PCT/US2009/052767
including, but not limited to, cell function, apoptosis, cell division, cell adhesion, locomotion,
exocytosis, and cell-cell communication. Multicolor fluorescence permits multiple targets
and cell processes to be assayed in a single screen. Cross-correlation of cellular responses
will yield a wealth of information required for target validation and lead optimization.
[00314]      In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for analyzing cells
comprising providing an array of locations which contain multiple cells wherein the cells
contain one or more fluorescent reporter molecules; scanning multiple cells in each of the
locations containing cells to obtain fluorescent signals from the fluorescent reporter molecule
in the cells; converting the fluorescent signals into digital data; and utilizing the digital data
to determine the distribution, environment or activity of the fluorescent reporter molecule
within the cells.
[003151      A major component of the new drug discovery paradigm is a continually growing
family of fluorescent and luminescent reagents that are used to measure the temporal and
spatial distribution, content, and activity of intracellular ions, metabolites, macromolecules,
and organelles. Classes of these reagents include labeling reagents that measure the
distribution and amount of molecules in living and fixed cells, environmental indicators to
report signal transduction events in time and space, and fluorescent protein biosensors to
measure target molecular activities within living cells. A multiparameter approach that
combines several reagents in a single cell is a powerful new tool for drug discovery.
[003161      This method relies on the high affinity of fluorescent or luminescent molecules for
specific cellular components. The affinity for specific components is governed by physical
forces such as ionic interactions, covalent bonding (which includes chimeric fusion with
protein-based chromophores, fluorophores, and lumiphores), as well as hydrophobic
interactions, electrical potential, and, in some cases, simple entrapment within a cellular
component. The luminescent probes can be small molecules, labeled macromolecules, or
genetically engineered proteins, including, but not limited to green fluorescent protein
chimeras.
[00317]      Those skilled in this art will recognize a wide variety of fluorescent reporter
molecules that can be used in the present invention, including, but not limited to,
fluorescently labeled biomolecules such as proteins, phospholipids, RNA and DNA
hybridizing probes. Similarly, fluorescent reagents specifically synthesized with particular
chemical properties of binding or association have been used as fluorescent reporter
molecules (Barak et al., (1997), J. Biol. Chem. 272:27497-27500; Southwick et al., (1990),
Cvtometrv 11:418-430; Tsien (1989) in Methods in Cell Biology, Vol. 29 Taylor and Wang

    WO 2010/017248                                                           PCT/US2009/052767
(eds.), pp. 127-156). Fluorescently labeled antibodies are particularly useful reporter
molecules due to their high degree of specificity for attaching to a single molecular target in a
mixture of molecules as complex as a cell or tissue.
[003181     The luminescent probes can be synthesized within the living cell or can be
transported into the cell via several non-mechanical modes including diffusion, facilitated or
active transport, signal-sequence-mediated transport, and endocytotic or pinocytotic uptake.
Mechanical bulk loading methods, which are well known in the art, can also be used to load
luminescent probes into living cells (Barber et al. (1996), Neuroscience Letters 207:17-20;
Bright et al. (1996), Cytometly 24:226-233; McNeil (1989) in Methods in Cell Biology, Vol.
29, Taylor and Wang (eds.), pp. 153-173). These methods include electroporation and other
mechanical methods such as scrape-loading, bead-loading, impact-loading, syringe-loading,
hypertonic and hypotonic loading. Additionally, cells can be genetically engineered to
express reporter molecules, such as GFP, coupled to a protein of interest as previously
described (Chalfie and Prasher U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,084; Cubitt et al. (1995), Trends in
Biochemical Science 20:448-455).
[00319]     Once in the cell, the luminescent probes accumulate at their target domain as a
result of specific and high affinity interactions with the target domain or other modes of
molecular targeting such as signal-sequence-mediated transport. Fluorescently labeled
reporter molecules are useful for determining the location, amount and chemical environment
of the reporter. For example, whether the reporter is in a lipophilic membrane environment
or in a more aqueous environment can be determined (Giuliano et al. (1995), Ann. Rev. of
Biophysics and BiomolecularStructure 24:405-434; Giuliano and Taylor (1995), Methods in
Neuroscience 27.1-16). The pH environment of the reporter can be determined (Bright et al.
(1989), J. Cell Biology 104:1019-1033; Giuliano et al. (1987), Anal. Biochem. 167:362-371;
Thomas et al. (1979), Biochemistry 18:2210-2218). It can be determined whether a reporter
having a chelating group is bound to an ion, such as Ca,      or not (Bright et al. (1989), In
Methods in Cell Biology, Vol. 30, Taylor and Wang (eds.), pp. 157-192; Shimoura et al.
(1988), .1.ofBiochemistry (Tokyo) 251:405-410; Tsien (1989) In Methods in Cell Biology,
Vol. 30, Taylor and Wang (eds.), pp. 127-156).
[003201     Furthermore, certain cell types within an organism may contain components that
can be specifically labeled that may not occur in other cell types. For example, neural cells
often contain polarized membrane components. That is, these cells asymmetrically distribute
macromolecules along their plasma membrane. Connective or supporting tissue cells often
contain granules in which are trapped molecules specific to that cell type (e.g., heparin,
                                              - 83 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                             PCT/US2009/052767
histamine, serotonin, etc.). Most muscular tissue cells contain a sarcoplasmic reticulum, a
specialized organelle whose function is to regulate the concentration of calcium ions within
the cell cytoplasm. Many nervous tissue cells contain secretory granules and vesicles in
which are trapped neurohormones or neurotransmitters. Therefore, fluorescent molecules can
be designed to label not only specific components within specific cells, but also specific cells
within a population of mixed cell types.
[00321]      Those skilled in the art will recognize a wide variety of ways to measure
fluorescence. For example, some fluorescent reporter molecules exhibit a change in
excitation or emission spectra, some exhibit resonance energy transfer where one fluorescent
reporter loses fluorescence, while a second gains in fluorescence, some exhibit a loss
(quenching) or appearance of fluorescence, while some report rotational movements
(Giuliano et at. (1995), Ann. Rev. of Biophysics and Biomol. Structure 24:405-434; Giuliano
et al. (1995), Methods in Neuroscience 27:1-16).
[00322]      The whole procedure can be fully automated. For example, sampling of sample
materials may be accomplished with a plurality of steps, which include withdrawing a sample
from a sample container and delivering at least a portion of the withdrawn sample to test cell
culture (e.g., a cell culture wherein gene expression is regulated). Sampling may also include
additional steps, particularly and preferably, sample preparation steps. In one approach, only
one sample is withdrawn into the auto-sampler probe at a time and only one sample resides in
the probe at one time. In other embodiments, multiple samples may be drawn into the auto
sampler probe separated by solvents. In still other embodiments, multiple probes may be
used in parallel for auto sampling.
[00323]      In the general case, sampling can be effected manually, in a semi-automatic
manner or in an automatic manner. A sample can be withdrawn from a sample container
manually, for example, with a pipette or with a syringe-type manual probe, and then
manually delivered to a loading port or an injection port of a characterization system. In a
semi-automatic protocol, some aspect of the protocol is effected automatically (e.g.,
delivery), but some other aspect requires manual intervention (e.g., withdrawal of samples
from a process control line). Preferably, however, the sample(s) are withdrawn from a
sample container and delivered to the characterization system, in a fully automated manner
for example, with an auto-sampler.
[00324]     Labels: The particular label or detectable moiety or tag used in the assay is not a
critical aspect of the invention, as long as it does not significantly interfere with the specific
binding of the ORF phage to their ligands. The detectable group can be any material having a
                                              - 84 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
detectable physical or chemical property. Such detectable labels have been well developed in
the field of immunoassays and, in general, most labels useful in such methods can be applied
to the present invention. Thus, a label is any composition detectable by spectroscopic,
photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical, or chemical means. Useful
labels in the present invention include magnetic beads (e.g., DYNABEADSTl'), fluorescent
dyes (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate, Texas red, rhodamine, and the like), radiolabels (e.g.,
3H,    1, 5,    C, or 3P), enzymes (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and
others commonly used in an ELISA), and colorimetric labels such as colloidal gold or
colored glass or plastic beads (e.g., polystyrene, polypropylene, latex, etc.).
[00325]      The label may be coupled directly or indirectly to the desired component of the
assay according to methods well known in the art. As indicated above, a wide variety of
labels may be used, with the choice of label depending on sensitivity required, ease of
conjugation with the compound, stability requirements, available instrumentation, and
disposal provisions.
[00326]     Non-radioactive labels are often attached by indirect means. Generally, a ligand
molecule (e.g., biotin) is covalently bound to the molecule. The ligand then binds to another
molecules (e.g., streptavidin) molecule, which is either inherently detectable or covalently
bound to a signal system, such as a detectable enzyme, a fluorescent compound, or a
chemiluminescent compound.
[00327]      The molecules can also be conjugated directly to signal generating compounds,
e.g., by conjugation with an enzyme or fluorophore. Enzymes of interest as labels will
primarily be hydrolases, particularly phosphatases, esterases and glycosidases, or oxidotases,
particularly peroxidases. Fluorescent compounds include fluorescein and its derivatives,
rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, etc. Chemiluminescent compounds
include luciferin, and 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, e.g., luminol. For a review of various
labeling or signal producing systems that may be used, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,391,904.
[00328]      Means of detecting labels are well known to those of skill in the art. Thus, for
example, where the label is a radioactive label, means for detection include a scintillation
counter or photographic film as in autoradiography. Where the label is a fluorescent label, it
may be detected by exciting the fluorochrome with the appropriate wavelength of light and
detecting the resulting fluorescence. The fluorescence may be detected visually, by means of
photographic film, by the use of electronic detectors such as charge-coupled devices (CCDs)
or photomultipliers and the like. Similarly, enzymatic labels may be detected by providing
the appropriate substrates for the enzyme and detecting the resulting reaction product.

Finally simple colorimetric labels may be detected simply by observing the color associated
with the label. Thus, in various dipstick assays, conjugated gold often appears pink, while
various conjugated beads appear the color of the bead.
Formulationsand Administration of STING Compositions
[00329]      The compounds are useful for the in vivo treatment or prevention of diseases in
which STING is implicated. These include viral diseases, bacterial infections, parasitic of
protozoan infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammation, transplantation,
neurological diseases or disorders, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease,
hepatic diseases or disorders, gastrointestinal diseases or disorders, diabetes, cancer,
autoimmunity, immune related diseases or disorders, neurological diseases or disorders,
neurodegenerative diseases or disorders, nerve repair and paralysis, neuroendocrine
differentiation, inflammatory diseases, muscular diseases or disorders, diseases or disorders
associated with infectious organisms, and the like.
[003301      In one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a compound for use in a
medicament, especially for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology
may be modified by modulating the immune response e.g. cancer, infections, autoimmunity,
transplantations etc. In those diseases or conditions where it is desired to suppress an
immune response (e.g. inflammation, autoimmune diseases or disorders, transplantation etc),
STING may be down-regulated, e.g. antisense, siRNA, antibodies, aptamers etc. In those
conditions whereby it is desired to increase or enhance an immune response, STING may be
reconstituted e.g. cancer, viral infection etc, by administration of vector expressing STING,
peptides, polynucleotides, oligonucleotides etc.
[003311      STING compounds or identified agents can be evaluated by various means.
Cellular assays evaluate the ability of a compound to interfere with the infectious life cycle of
a parasite or the migration of a cancer or inflammatory cell ex vivo, while not exhibiting
toxicity against the host cell. Cellular assays measure the survival of a parasite-infected or
viral infected cell in culture. In vivo assays evaluate the efficacy of test compounds to
prevent or ameliorate disease symptoms, such as those associated with for example, infection,
cancer invasion or growth, or inflammatory cell migration. Further, preferred compounds
delay, interfere with, prevent or eliminate the completion of the infectious life cycle of a
disease agent, the migratory ability of a cancer cell or an inflammation cell. etc Additionally,

preferred compounds prevent or diminish a an infection in an individual or the migration of
cancer cells or inflammatory cells in an individual, thereby preventing or ameliorating the
pathogenic symptoms associated with such infections or the migration of rogue cells.
[003321      The compositions and methods of the invention are preferably employed for
treatment or prophylaxis against diseases caused abnormal cell growth and by infectious
agents, particularly for treatment of infections as may occur in tissue such as lung, heart,
liver, prostate, brain, testes, stomach, intestine, bowel, spinal cord, sinuses, urinary tract or
ovaries of a subject. The methods of the invention also may be employed to treat systemic
conditions such as viremia or septicemia. The methods of the invention are also preferably
employed for treatment of diseases and disorders associated with viral infections or bacterial
infections, as well as any other disorder caused by an infectious agent.
[003331      To examine the extent of the effects of the compounds, samples, assays, cultures
or test subjects comprising or lacking STING, are treated with a potential compound and are
compared to negative control samples without the test compound, and positive control
samples, treated with a compound known to inhibit the STING. Negative control samples
(not treated with a test compound), are assigned a relative STING activity level of 100%.
Inhibition of STING expression, activity, and/or function is achieved when the STING
expression, activity, and/or function relative to the control is about 90%, preferably 75% or
50%, more preferably 25-0%.
[003341      The invention is useful in the prevention and/or treatment of the disease states
mentioned or implied herein. The present invention also is useful in a method of treatment or
prevention of diseases caused by deregulation of STING expression, activity, and/or function,

[003401      In another preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be
administered to patients for prevention or treatment, with combinations of one or more the
compounds and other known therapies. For example, in the case of cancer, the STING
compositions can be administered with chemotherapeutic or surgical treatments.
[003411      The compounds of this invention may also be administered orally to the patient, in
a manner such that the concentration of drug is sufficient to inhibit bone resorption or to
achieve any other therapeutic indication as disclosed herein. Typically, a pharmaceutical
composition containing the compound is administered at an oral dose of between about 0.1 to
about 50 mg/kg in a manner consistent with the condition of the patient. Preferably the oral
dose would be about 0.5 to about 20 mg/kg.
[00342]      An intravenous infusion of the compound in 5% dextrose in water or normal
saline, or a similar formulation with suitable excipients, is most effective, although an
intramuscular bolus injection is also useful. Typically, the parenteral dose will be about 0.01
to about 100 mg/kg; preferably between 0.1 and 20 mg/kg, in a manner to maintain the
concentration of drug in the plasma at a concentration effective to inhibit a cysteine protease.
The compounds may be administered one to four times daily at a level to achieve a total daily
dose of about 0.4 to about 400 mg/kg/day. The precise amount of an inventive compound
which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best
administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood
level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect. Prodrugs of
compounds of the present invention may be prepared by any suitable method. For those
compounds in which the prodrug moiety is a ketone functionality, specifically ketals and/or
hemiacetals, the conversion may be effected in accordance with conventional methods.
[00343]     No unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds, derivatives,
salts, compositions etc, of the present invention are administered in accordance with the
present invention. The compounds of this invention, which may have good bioavailability,

may be tested in one of several biological assays to determine the concentration of a
compound which is required to have a given pharmacological effect.
[003441     In another preferred embodiment, there is provided a pharmaceutical or veterinary
composition comprising one or more STING compounds and a pharmaceutically or
veterinarily acceptable carrier. Other active materials may also be present, as may be
considered appropriate or advisable for the disease or condition being treated or prevented.
[003451     The carrier, or, if more than one be present, each of the carriers, must be
acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and
not deleterious to the recipient.
[00346]     The compounds described herein are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery
systems described above. Additionally, in order to enhance the in vivo serum half-life of the
administered compound, the compounds may be encapsulated, introduced into the lumen of
liposomes, prepared as a colloid, or other conventional techniques may be employed which
provide an extended serum half-life of the compounds. A variety of methods are available
for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka, et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871,
4,501,728 and 4,837,028 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore,
one may administer the drug in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome
coated with a tissue-specific antibody. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up
selectively by the organ.
[003471     The formulations include those suitable for rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal
and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous
and intradermal) administration, but preferably the formulation is an orally administered
formulation. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, e.g.
tablets and sustained release capsules, and may be prepared by any methods well known in
the art of pharmacy.
[00348]     Such methods include the step of bringing into association the above defined
active agent with the carrier. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and
intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided
solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to
methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compound, for
example, of general formula (I) in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically or
veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle.
[003491     The STING or any other compound identified using these methods can be
formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions,

whereby the compound is combined in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
vehicle. Therapeutic formulations are prepared for storage by mixing the active ingredient
having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers,
excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.
(1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers,
excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations
employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants
including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides;
proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as
polyvinylpyrrolidone, amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine;
monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or
dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt
forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN TM. (ICI
Americas Inc., Bridgewater, N.J.), PLURONICS TM . (BASF Corporation, Mount Olive, N.J.)
or PEG.
[003501      The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile and pyrogen
free. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to
or following lyophilization and reconstitution.
[00351]      The route of administration is in accord with known methods, e.g. injection or
infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial
or intralesional routes, topical administration, or by sustained release systems.
[003521      Dosages and desired drug concentrations of pharmaceutical compositions of the
present invention may vary depending on the particular use envisioned. The determination of
the appropriate dosage or route of administration is well within the skill of an ordinary
physician. Animal experiments provide reliable guidance for the determination of effective
doses for human therapy. Interspecies scaling of effective doses can be performed following
the principles laid down by Mordenti, J. and Chappell, W. "The use of interspecies scaling in
toxicokinetics" In Toxicokinetics and New Drug Development, Yacobi et al., Eds., Pergamon
Press, New York 1989, pp. 42-96.
[003531      Formulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as:
discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of
the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension of the active agent in
an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water in
oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus etc.

[00354]     For compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term
"acceptable carrier" includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for
example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone),
methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose,
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn
starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium
phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate,
sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc
waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen,
cherry flavoring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a coloring agent to
make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well
known in the art.
[00355]     A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more
accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable
machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally
mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent.
Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered
compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may be optionally be coated or
scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent.
[00356]     Other formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising
the active agent in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles
comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and
acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.
[00357]     Parenteral formulations will generally be sterile.
Kits
[00358]     Kits according to the present invention include at least one of STING molecules,
antibodies, etc.. The kits may also include buffer and/or excipient solutions (in liquid or
frozen form)--or buffer and/or excipient powder preparations to be reconstituted with water.
Thus, preferably the kits containing the STING peptides, are frozen, lyophilized, pre-diluted,
or pre-mixed at such a concentration that the addition of a predetermined amount of heat, of
water, or of a solution provided in the kit will result in a formulation of sufficient
concentration and pH as to be effective assaying any compound for therapeutic value in the
treatment of disease. Preferably, such a kit will also comprise instructions for reconstituting

the invention. It will be appreciated that variations in proportions and alternatives in
elements of the components shown will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are within

Example 1: STING, an Endoplasmic Reticulum Adaptor that FacilitatesInnate Immune
Signaling
[00362]      Cellular host defense responses to pathogen invasion principally involves the
detection of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as viral nucleic acid or
bacterial cell wall components including lipopolysaccharide or flagellar proteins that results
in the induction of anti-pathogen genes. For example, viral RNA can be detected by
membrane bound Toll-like receptors (TLR's) present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
and/or endosomes (e.g. TLR 3 and 7/8) or by TLR-independent intracellular DExD/H box
RNA helicases referred to as retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) or melanoma
differentiation associated antigen 5 (MDA5, also referred to as IFIH I and helicard). These
events culminate in the activation of downstream signaling events, much of which remains

[00369]      DNA Microarrayanalysis: Total RNA was extracted from 293T cells transfected
with STING expressing vectors. Preparation of cDNA and microarray analysis was
performed at the W.M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Research Laboratory DNA
microarray facility at Yale University (New Haven, CT). The Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0
Array (Affymetrix, CA) was used. Data analysis was performed with GeneSpring software
(Silicon Genetics, CA).
[00370]      Confocal microscopy: ER-DsRED and Golgi-DsRED (Clontech, CA) were used
for ER and Golgi marker, respectively. For mitochondria staining, living cells were
incubated with 300 nM of Mito Tracker Red (Invitrogen, CA) for 45 min at 37'C.
[00371]      Mitochondria and ER fraction isolation:Mitochondria and ER membranes were
purified on discontinuous sucrose gradients as previously described (Bozidis, P., C.D.
Williamson, and A.M. Colberg-Poley, Isolation of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and
mitochondria-associatedmembranefractionsfrom transfected cells andfrom human
cytomegalovirus-infectedprimaryfibroblasts. Curr Protoc Cell Biol, 2007. Chapter 3: p. Unit
3 27). Briefly, HUVEC cells in MTE buffer (0.27M mannitol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1mM
EDTA, pH 7.4) were lysed by sonication. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 700 x g for 10 min
to remove nuclei and cellular debris. Mitochondria were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000
x g for 10 min, and post mitochondrial supernatant was used for purification of ER fractions.
Mitochondria pellet was resuspended in MTE buffer, and was layered on discontinuous
sucrose gradients consisting of 1.0 M and 1.7M sucrose and banded by centrifugation at
40,000 x g for 22 min. Mitochondria fraction was collected and pelleted by centrifugation at
15,000 x g for 10 min. Purified mitochondria were resuspended in PBS and used for Western
blot analysis. To isolate ER fractions, post-mitochondrial supernatant described above was
layered on discontinuous sucrose gradients consisting of 1.3M, 1.5 M and 2.OM sucrose, and
banded by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 70 min. The ER fraction at the interface between
the supernatant and the 1.3 M sucrose was collected, and pelleted by centrifugation at
100,000 x g for 45 min. The ER membranes were resuspended in PBS and were used for
Western blot analysis.
[00372]      RNA interference: Chemically synthesized 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes were
obtained from Dharmacon, Inc (Lafayette, CO). RNA oligonucleotides used for human and
murine STING were as follows: hSTING(a), GCAUCAAGGAUCGGGUUIJ                  (SEQ ID NO:
3); hSTING(b), GGUCAUAUUACAUCGGAU (SEQ ID NO: 3); mSTING,
CCAACAGCGUCUACGAGA (SEQ ID NO: 5). 293T cells were plated on 24-well plates at
5  x 104 cells per well and transfected with 10 pmol of siRNA duplex per well using
                                            - 96 -

Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, CA). MEFs were transfected by using an Amaxa
nucleofector apparatus (program A-023) and Amaxa MEF nucleofector kit 1 according to the
manufacturer's recommendations. At 72 hours after transfection, cells were used for further
experiments.
[003731      Co-immunoprecipitation,native PAGE and immunoblot analysis: 293T cells were
seeded on 100-mm dishes at 1     x 106 cells per dish. Cells were transfected with a total of 10
gg of empty plasmid or various expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. At 36 hours
after transfection, cells were lysed in M-PER buffer (PIERCE, IL) or 1% digitonin
(Calbiochem, CA) buffer (20 mM Tris-HCI, 150 mM NaCl, 1% digitonin) containing
protease inhibitors (Roche, IN). Lysates were incubated with HA affinity matrix
(COVANCE, WI) or FLAG affinity beads (SIGMA) overnight. The beads were washed
three times by TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and immunoprecipitates were eluted with
non-reducing sample buffer by boiling for 5 min. For endogenous STING
immunoprecipitation, HUVEC were lysed in 1% digitonin lysis buffer. Cleared supernatants
were incubated with 10Ig of anti-STING antibody, followed by incubation with immobilized
protein G (PIERCE). The beads were washed four times by I% digitonin lysis buffer and
iminunoprecipitates were eluted with SDS sample buffer by boiling for 5 min. Native PAGE
and Immunoblotting was carried out as previously described (Balachandran, S., et al., J
Immunol, 2007. 178(4): p. 2429-39).
[00374]      Generationof the STING knockout mice: The linearized targeting vector was
electroporated into E14.1 ES cells originated from 129SvEv strain, followed by the selection
in G418. Targeted clones were screened by PCR. From 90 clones, I positive clone was
identified. This ES clone was subjected to the generation of chimera mice by injection using
C57BL/6J blastocysts as the host. The resulting male chimeras were further mated with
C57BL/6J female mice for germline transmission. The heterozygous mice (F1 mice) were
interbred to obtain wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous littermates (F2). The genotypes
of the mice were determined by PCR. Animals were generated at the University of Miami
School of Medicine Transgenic Core Facility. Mice were allowed to freely access to food
and water and housed at an ambient temperature of 23'C and at a 12 h light/dark cycle.
Animal care and handling was performed as per IACUC guidelines.
[00375]      Preparationof DendriticCells and Macrophages:Bone marrow derived
macrophage (BMDM) and dendritic cells (GM-DCs) were prepared from femurs and tibia
isolated from wild-type and knockout mice. A single cell suspension (per mouse) was
prepared and red blood cells were lysed. For GM-DCs, cells were cultured in DMEM
                                             - 97 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 M 2-Mercaptoethanol, 100 U/ml Penicillin, 100 g/ml
Streptomycin and GM-CSF (20ng/mi). For BMDM, cells were cultured in RPMI 1649
supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics, and 20% conditioned medium from NIH3T3 cells.
Medium was replaced every two days. After 8 days, cells are used for experiments.
[00376]      IFN induced library construction: To screen for interacting partners of STING we
used the Yeast two Hybrid approach. A novel IFN-induced cDNA library from human cells
was prepared. To construct this library, telomerase immortalized human fibroblast cells were
treated overnight with 1000 units each of human IFN-a and -P to induce interferon
dependent genes. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from the pelleted cells and confirmed to be
of high quality. After confirmation, cDNA synthesis was carried out using 'BD
POWERSCRIPTTM' RT (Clontech). T his procedure allows tagging either side of the
resultant first strand with adaptors containing distinct Sfi sites (A and B) for directional
cloning. This also simultaneously ensures that the cDNA population is enriched for full
length clones. The cDNA was then amplified by PCR, digested with SfiI and ligated to the
yeast prey vector pGADT7-RecAB. The ligated mixture was transformed into E. coli strain
DH1OB. The number of independent clones in the unamplified library was estimated to be
3.2 x 106,  with an average size of 1.52 kb and inserts ranging in size from 0.8 to 3.0 kb. 15
independent colonies were isolated and DNA extracted to check for size by PCR.
[00377]      Yeast two-hybrid analyses: hSTING-C (amino acids 173-379) sequence was
amplified by PCR and was cloned into pGBK-T7 (Clontech) to generate a bait plasmid
pGBK-T7-hSTING-C.         100ptg of the IFN-induced library's plasmid DNA was used to
perform a library-scale transformation of yeast strain Y 187. Yeast library screens were
performed by yeast mating. Briefly, pGBK-T7-hSTING-C was transformed into yeast strain
AH109 and grown overnight in 50ml minimal medium lacking Tryptophan. A 1ml aliquot of
pre-transformed library in Y 187 was mixed with the above and yeast mating was allowed to
proceed overnight before being plated. Positive colonies from the high-stringency plates
were isolated and plasmid DNA extracted by the 'glass-bead' protocol. Briefly, yeast
colonies were grown in minimal medium lacking Leucine overnight. 1.5ml of culture was
spun down and the pellet was resuspended in 300[L of Yeast Breaking Buffer (2% Triton X
100, 1% SDS, 100mM NaCl, 10mM Tris 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) along with an equal volume of
acid washed glass beads (Sigma Cat# G-8772). 300ptl of Phenol:Chloroform (1:1, pH 8.0)
was added and the tube was vortexed for at least 15 minutes. Samples were centrifuged and
the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and the DNA was precipitated with 2
volumes of Ethanol. The recovered pellet was washed in 70% Ethanol, dried and dissolved
                                             - 98 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
in 501l of Milli-Q water. 2-5ptl were used to transform bacterial competent cells and plated
on LB-Ampicillin plates. Individual colonies were grown and plasmid DNA extracted.
Extracted DNA was used to re-transform yeast to reconfirm interactions and eliminate auto
activating false positives. Positive clones were sequenced for identification.
[00378]      Results and Discussion:
[00379]      To further determine the mechanisms of innate immune signaling, an expression
screening system was employed in which approximately 5,500 human and 9,000 murine full
length cDNA's were individually transfected into 293T cells harboring a luciferase gene
under control of the IFN3 promoter (IFN-Luc). Five genes whose overexpression lead to
the induction of IFN3-Luc approximately 250-fold but not control vectors was found to be
IPS- 1 (also referred to as VISA/CARDIF/MAVS), a putative CARD containing mitochondria
protein and known inducer of type I IFN that plays a role in facilitating the RIG-I/MDA5
pathway. However, a previously uncharacterized molecule
(gi:38093659/NP_938023/2610307008RIK) was also isolated by this method which is
referred to herein, as STING (for STimulator of INterferon Genes) that harbored 5 predicted
TM motifs (in humans) and existed as a 379 amino acid protein in human cells and 378
amino acids in murine cells (Figure IA). A putative signal cleavage motif was found to exist
at position 1-36 and a leucine rich region was apparent between amino acids 21-139 (Figures
1A, 1B). The predicted molecular weight of human STING (hSTING) was 42,192 Da, which
approximately corresponded to its observed molecular weight in human 293 cells following
immunoblot analysis using a rabbit antiserum raised to a STING peptide (Figure ID). RNAi
studies confirmed that the observed 42kDa band was indeed STING (Figure ID). STING
was found to be ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues as determined by northern
analysis and was found to predominantly reside in the ER region of the cell as determined by
confocal microscopy and fractionation analysis (Figures IE, IF).

[00381]       Table 2 shows the list of genes that induced the IFN- promoter above 15-fold
compared to a 'vector alone' control. The fold induction was calculated as an average of an
experiment performed in duplicate. Approximately 5,500 human and 9,000 mouse full
length cDNAs cloned into pCMV-Sport6 vector (Invitrogen) generated by the Mammalian
Gene Collection (MGC) were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). To
identify cDNAs that encode protein that alter IFNj-luciferase reporter activity, 40 ng of
empty, IPS-1 or TRIF cDNA positive control expression plasmids or cDNA library were
aliquoted into designated control wells of the 384-well library screening plate. 35 ng of IFN
reporter were dispensed into each well with a MultiDrop robot (TiterTek). After incubation,
HEK293T cells were dispensed into each well. After 24 hrs, 40 LIof BriteLite luciferin
reagent (Perkin Elmer) was added to each well with the MultiDrop, incubated for 1 minute at
room temperature, and luminescence levels quantified with an Analyst GT multimode reader
(Molecular Devices). All screens were performed in duplicate. This approach allowed for
the isolation of new molecules, hitherto unknown, as regulators of the IFN pathway.
Interestingly, the top 5 hits were IPS- 1, which activated the IFN promoter significantly.
Another top hit was IRFI (150-fold). This data demonstrated that the screen was functional
and was highly specific. Interestingly, a new molecule was isolated which is referred to
herein as refer to as STING (STimulator of IFN Genes).
[00382]       Overexpression of STING in 293T cells was subsequently confirmed to robustly
induce the expression of the IFN promoter (IFNj-Luc) up to 400-fold, but not a control TK
promoter driving luciferase (pRL-TK), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) responsive
promoters (PRD-III-I-Luc) up to 1000-fold, an NF-cB responsive promoter (NF-KB-Luc) 12
fold and interferon-inducible promoters (interferon sensitive response element- ISRE-Luc) up

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
to 800-fold (Figures 2A-2D). STING did not activate control promoters driving luciferase
reporters such as those derived from the Rb, p53 or E2F genes (Figures 5A-5D). Increased
dimerization of IRF3 was also observed in STING expressing 293T cells confirming that
STING regulates the induction of type I IFN at upstream of IRF3 activation, dimerization and
translocation (Figure 2E). This data was verified by observing that endogenous IFNP mRNA
and IFNP protein was induced significantly in MEFs transiently transfected with STING as
determined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis and ELISA respectively (Figures 2F, 2G).
DNA microarray analysis of STING expression in 293T cells further emphasized STING's
ability to induce primary innate immune response genes as well as IFN-inducible genes
(Figure 2H). Accordingly, MEFs cells expressing STING or IPS-I were significantly
resistant to VSV infection due to the induction of innate immune response genes (Figures 21,
2J). Subsequent analysis indicated that STING function was ablated in the absence of the
IKB kinase family member TBK- 1, confirming that STING's activity involved activation of
IRF3 and was indeed upstream of this kinase (Figure 2K). Finally, it was observed that
STING did not exert robust activity in the absence of FADD, which is important for efficient
innate immune signaling processes (Figures2l). It was also established that while STING,
HA tagged at the carboxyl region, retained activity, this activity was lost when STING was
tagged at the amino terminus or carboxyl terminus with GFP. Subsequent analysis indicated
that the amino terminus region of STING containing the 5 putative TM regions (amino acids
1-230) or just the carboxyl region of STING (amino acids 173-379) did not exhibit significant
ability, alone, to induce the IFNP-Luc promoter when transiently overexpressed in 293T cells
(Figures 2M, 2N). Thus, full length intact STING is required for efficient function.
However, it was further observed that the carboxyl region of STING exerted a dominant
negative inhibitory effect and could impede the ability of full-length STING to stimulate
p1 10-Luc (Figure 20). Collectively, this data indicated that expression of STING activated
the innate immune response including type I IFN leading to the induction of an antiviral state.
[00383]      To further analyze STING function, an RNAi approach was utilized to ablate
STING in a number of cell-types. The data indicated that knockdown of STING in HEK 293
cells, as confirmed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-STING antibody, modestly reduced
the ability of the negative-stranded rhabdovirus VSV-GFP to induce IFN3, presumably since
these viruses are only weak activators of IFNP (Figures 6A, 6B). However, while ablation of
STING by RNAi in MEFs also lead to a slight reduction in IFN3 mRNA production in
response to VSV-GFP, such cells were rendered extremely susceptible to virus infection and
replication (Figures 3B-3D). To confirm a requirement for STING in the regulation of type I

IFN induction and in host defense, STING deficient (STING -)mice were generated by
targeted homologous recombination in ES cells (Figure 3E). Deletion of STING was
confirmed by Southern and Northern analysis as well as by RT-PCR analysis and
immunoblotting of STING -/- MEFs (Figures 3F, 3G). STING -/ animals were born at the
Mendelian ratio and developed and bred normally. Accordingly, MEFs from wild type and
STING - animals were infected with VSV-GFP at varying MOI's (0.01-1) for up to 36 hours
post infection. This study confirmed that VSV-GFP generated more progeny virus (2 logs;
24-36 hours) in MEFs lacking STING compared to controls (Figures 3H, 31). This data was
verified using VSV expressing a luciferase reporter gene (Figures 7A-7E) and VSV-AM,
which exhibits a defect in the viral matrix protein normally responsible for inhibiting cellular
mRNA export from the nucleus (Figure 3J). VSVAM replicates inefficiently in normal cells
since it is incapable of preventing IFN3 mRNA export from the nucleus following infection,
a consequence which results in the enhanced amplification of type I IFN transcription and
antiviral activity. Reconstitution of STING to STING -'-MEF's rescued the susceptibility to
VSV infection (Figures 7A-7E). To evaluate whether loss of STING effected the production
of IFNP in response to negative-stranded viruses other than VSV, which is largely governed
by the intracellular receptor helicase RIG-I, control or STING    '- MEFs were infected with the
negative-stranded Sendai Virus (SeV), a member of the paramyxovirus family. This analysis
indicated that loss of STING also reduced the ability of SeV to induce IFN3 (Figure 3K). In
contrast, a strong requirement was not observed for STING to mediate the ability of
transfected poly I:C to induce IFNP induction, which is largely governed by the intracellular
RIG-I homologue MDA5 (Figures 8A-8B). It was also observed that the positive-stranded
encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a member of the picornavirus family, did not
effectively induce IFN3 in MEFs, regardless of the presence or absence of STING. In
addition, no significant differences in viral titers were observed when comparing EMCV
replication in infected STING _ or -- MEFs (Figures 8A-8B). Thus, it was concluded that
STING may play a more predominant role in facilitating RIG-I mediated innate signaling
rather than MDA5. Interestingly, a significant defect was not detected (>5-fold) in the ability
of transfected B-form DNA (poly dA-dT or non CpG containing interferon stimulating DNA
[ISD]) to induce IFN3 in MEFs lacking STING compared to controls (Figures 3L, 3M;
Figures 9A-9E). TLR9 is considered to govern CpG DNA-mediated induction of IFN$, but
is not active in MEFs. Thus, it is plausible that STING may function in TLR9-independent,
DNA-mediated induction of type I IFN. This effect was similarly observed in murine STING
lacking bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) or bone marrow derived dendritic cells
                                            - 102-

(GM-DC) cultured using granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
(Figures 3N, 30). However, no difference was observed in the ability of exogenous poly I:C
or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce IFN3, when comparing STING -'- BMDM or GM
DC's to controls, events which depend on TLR 3 and 4 respectively (Figures 3N, 30).
While, loss of STING rendered MEFs highly susceptible to VSV-GFP, less susceptibility was
observed following VSV-GFP infection of STING - GM-DC's or BMDM's, indicating that
STING may be more important in facilitating negative-stranded virus-mediated innate
signaling in fibroblasts (Figures 9A-9E). Collectively, the data would indicate that loss of
STING leads to a defect in RIG-I mediated type I IFN induction but does not affect the TLR
pathway. In addition, it is concluded that STING functions in the pathway utilized by B-form
DNA to induce IFN.
[003841     To further examine the mechanisms of STING's function in innate signaling, it
was attempted to determine if STING interacted with RIG-I and/or MDA5, which are
putative innate immune signaling receptors for negative or positive stranded viral RNA
respectively. As mentioned, recent data has indicated that RIG-I may recognize short,
uncapped ssRNA species harboring 5'-triphosphates, generated by many negative-stranded
viruses, such as VSV, while MDA5 may recognize longer RNA's such as those generated by
EMCV as well as poly IC. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in 293T cells principally
indicated that FLAG-tagged RIG-I but not MDA5 could associate with HA-tagged STING in
co-transfection experiments (Figure 4A). The binding of RIG-I to STING was augmented
upon infection of 293T cells with SeV (Figure 4A). It was then confirmed in normal human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that endogenous RIG-I could associate directly,
or indirectly as a complex, with endogenous STING (Figure 4B). This data indicate that
STING seems to preferentially modulate the RIG-I, rather than the MDA5 regulated pathway.
To extend this analysis, which region of RIG-I may associate with STING was next focused
on. A smaller RIG-I construct was constructed comprising the CARD domains (amino acids
1-284) fused to a FLAG sequence. It was noted that the CARD domains of RIG-I, but not the
carboxyl region of RIG-I (amino acids 218-925) were preferentially able to associate with
HA-STING in transfected 293T cells (Figure 4C).
[003851     It was observed that transfected STING was able to modestly augment the ability
of RIGI to activate the IFNP promoter. However, it was noted that the carboxyl region of
STING could inhibit the function of RIG-I, again indicating that this region of STING can
exhibit a dominant-inhibitory effect (Figure 4D). RIG-I was subsequently shown to
colocalize with STING in the co-transfected 293T cells (Figure 4E). The association of the

RIG-I downstream adaptor IPS- 1 with STING was noted although similar to the situation
with RIG-I, it is not clear whether IPS-l directly interacts with STING or exists as a complex
with RIG-I/STING (Supplemental Fig 7). Accordingly, it was observed that STING was able
to induce the induction of an IFN3 driven luciferase construct in MEFs lacking RIG-I or IPS
1, likely confirming that that STING functions downstream of these latter molecules
(Supplemental Fig 8). The ability of ARIG-I or IPS-1 to induce IFNP appeared diminished in
STING -/- MEFs (Figure 4F). However, there was also a marked reduction in the induction
of IFNp by all transfected plasmids (including vector alone) in the absence of STING
compared to control MEFs, since endogenous DNA innate signaling pathways are likely
defective. Collectively, the data indicate that STING may be an important downstream
adaptor molecule that facilitates RIG-I and perhaps IPS- 1 function, as well as intracellular
DNA-mediated innate signaling pathways.
[003861     To identify other proteins that may interact with STING and to shed further
insight into the molecular mechanisms of STING action, a yeast-two hybrid approach was
adopted where an IFN-induced human fibroblast cDNA library, developed by this
laboratory, was screened using STING (amino acids 173-379) as a bait. Following this
approach, it was determined that one molecule repeatedly found to associate with STING was
Ssr2/TRAPP, a member of the TRAP complex comprising four subunits (a-A) that facilitates
translocation of proteins into the ER following translation (Figure 4G). The TRAP complex
associates with the translocon, comprising three subunits, Sec6l u,  p and y. It was confirmed
that TRAPP can indeed associate with endogenous STING in HEK 293 cells following co
immunoprecipitation experiments (Figure 4H). Using this approach, it was confirmed that
TRAPP also co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Sec6 11P, likely as a complex with
TRAP     (Figure 4H). It was next verified that STING could also associate not only with
TRAP     but also Sec611 (Figure 41). This was achieved by co-transfecting FLAG-TRAPP
and HA-STING and immunoprecipitating with an HA antibody. Immunoblot analysis with
an antibody to FLAG confirmed association of STING and TRAPP. An antibody to
endogenous Sec611P confirmed association with the STING/TRAP3 complex (Figure 41).
STING was also observed to co-localize with TRAPP in the ER region of the cell (Figure
4K). Taken together, this data would indicate that the STING may be involved in translocon
function and that the translocon may be able to influence the induction of type I IFN. It was
therefore evaluated whether loss of TRAPP or Sec6113 eliminated STING function and/or
affected type I IFN production using an RNAi approach to ablate these translocon molecules
from 293T cells. Loss of TRAPP or SEC 611 was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR or
                                            - 104-

    WO 2010/017248                                                         PCT/US2009/052767
immunoblot and did not affect cell viability (Figures 12A-12C). This data indicated that loss
of TRAPP or SEC61 P reduced STING's, ability to induce an IFNP promoter driving
luciferase (Figure 4J). Collectively, this data provides novel information indicating that the
translocon may be involved in innate immune signaling processes in the cell. Thus, STING
is predominantly an ER resident protein that may link RIG-I and DNA-mediated intracellular
innate signaling to the translocon. Speculatively, RIG-I may innate immune signaling
receptors for negative or positive stranded viral RNA detect translating viral RNA's at the
intersection of ribosome/ER translocon association and require STING to exert its function.
Alternatively, STING may participate in mediating ER stress response pathways an event that
remains to be verified. While it is not clear how signaling from the translocon to IRF-3/NF
kB occurs, translocon functionally and physically associates with the exocyst - the octomeric
Sec6-Sec8 complex that also associates with the ER and tethers secretory vesicles to
membranes, in preparation for membrane fusion, and facilitates protein synthesis and
secretion. Recently, the exocyst complex was found to recruit and activate TBKI and play a
role in type I IFN-p induction. The preliminary analysis herein, indicates that STING also
co-immunprecipitates with TBK1 and that RNAi ablation of Scc5 also rendered cells
defective in the STING function (Figure 4L). Thus, STING may facilitate the detection of
intracellular viral RNA species as well as B-form DNA indicating convergence of these
PAMP recognition pathways. While these mechanisms need to be clarified it is evident that a
number of infectious agents and toxins target the ER. Accordingly, the ER has evolved to
recognize and respond to these cellular stresses which include mediating innate immune
signaling in the cell following infection.

[00398]      Statistics: Students t-test was used to analyze data.
[00399]      In the previous example, Example 1, demonstrated for the first time a role for
STING (also referred to as MPYS/MITA), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident
transmembrane protein, in facilitating the production of type I IFN in murine embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) response to intracellular B-form DNA (Jin, L. et al. Mol Cell Biol 28,
5014-5026 (2008); Zhong, B. et al. Immunity 29, 538-550 (2008)). To extend the analysis
into evaluating the importance of STING in mediating DNA-induced innate immune
responses, WT E or Sting -'-' low passage number MEFs and compared the induction of

type I IFN (IFNP) in response to a variety of DNA ligands. These results indicated that
STING was essential for inducing IFN3 in response to transfected viral DNA (Adenovirus,
Ad5; Herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and 2), purified E. coli DNA; calf thymus DNA, CT
DNA; and interferon stimulatory DNA, ISD (Figure 13A). Complete abrogation of IFNP
production was also observed following transfection of poly dGC:dGC) in Sting (-) MEF's
and slight IFNP production was observed using poly dAT:dAT likely due to STING
independent, RIG-I dependent signalling. Loss of STING did not significantly affect
poly(IC)-mediated type I IFN production, which is largely governed by MDA5. Concomitant
analysis further indicated a dramatic reduction in IL-6 production in STING lacking MEFs
compared to controls following similar DNA transfections (Figure 13A). ISD mediated
production of Ifnp] and Ijh2a mRNA was not detectable in STING lacking MEFs compared to
controls (Figure 13B). Translocation of IRF3 or IRF7 was thus not observed in ISD
transfected STING lacking MEFs indicating that STING likely functions in mediating
intracellular DNA triggered IFN production upstream of TBK-1 (Figure 13C). NF-KB
signaling was also moderately defective in Sting
[00400]      -'- MEFs following exposure to transfected ISD. Collectively, these data indicate
that STING plays an essential role in the recognition of intracellular DNA in fibroblast type
cells. Given this, the importance of STING in facilitating intracellular DNA-mediated
production of type I IFN in antigen presenting cells including macrophages, was examined.
This analysis indicated that Sting (-/) macrophages transfected with ISD, or infected with the
DNA pathogens HSV- 1 or Listeria monocytogenes were greatly defective in their ability to
manufacture type I IFN (Figure 13D). However, the cleavage of pro-caspase 1 and
production of active IL-I 0, which is AIMII dependent, was unaffected by the loss of STING
(Figure 13E). Thus, STING is essential for the production of IFN in response to intracellular
DNA, though functions independent of the AIMII 'inflammasome' pathway. Further analysis
similarly indicated that STING was required for efficient DNA-mediated production of type I
IFN in GMDC's, as well as plasmacytoid derived DC's (Flt3-DC) (Figures 13E, 13F).
However, exogenous CpG DNA remained able to induce type I IFN in Flt-DC's lacking
STING compared to controls, indicating that TLR9 functions independent of the STING
pathway (Figure 13F). The induction of IL-6 in response to intracellular DNA was also
eliminated, in Sting (-/ macrophages (Figure 17). However, HSV-1 and CpG DNA was able
to induce IL-6 (Figure 17), but not type I IFN in macrophages devoid of STING (Figure
13D), likely in a TLR9-dependent manner. STING thus appears important for intracellular
DNA-mediated production of Type I IFN in fibroblasts, macrophages, conventional DC's as

well as pDC's. Finally, it was further noted that STING was required for the efficient
production of type I IFN by cytomegalovirus (CMV), vaccinia virus (VVAE3L) and
baculovirus. STING thus appears critical for intracellular DNA-mediated production of Type
I IFN in fibroblasts, macrophages, conventional DC's as well as pDC's.
[00401]      Since a significant defect in the production of type I IFN in STING lacking cells,
following infection using HSV- 1 was observed, the in vivo importance of STING in
facilitating effective host defense against virus infection was evaluated. Thus, Sting (-'-) or
control mice were infected intravenously with HSV- 1 and survival monitored. This study
indicated that animals lacking STING died within 7 days of HSV-1 infection (Figure 14A).
In contrast, 80% of similarly infected WT mice survived. Significant amounts of HSV-1
were detected in the brain of infected Sting (-'-) mice, but not in controls at 5 days post
infection (Figure 14B). Analysis of serum from the Sting 'infected         animals indicated a
profound defect in the production of type I IFN, at 6 hours post infection, compared to
infected control animals suggesting that IFN is responsible for preventing HSV-1 from
reaching regions of the central nervous system including brain (Figures 14C, 14D).
RANTES and IL-6 levels were similarly dramatically reduced in STING lacking animals at
the same time point (Figure 14E, 14F). Sting      - mice were also found to be more sensitive to
HSV-1 following intravaginal administration of HSV-1. This data indicated that STING is
important for the effective production of type I IFN and is essential in vivo for protection
against HSV-1 infection.
[00402]      Since it was observed that there is an in vitro defect in the ability of the negative
stranded virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to induce type I IFN in the absence of STING,
the in vivo importance of STING in protecting against VSV-related disease was examined. It
was observed that Sting -/- animals infected with VSV was also significantly sensitive to
lethal infection compared to controls (Figure 14G). Defects in type I IFN production were
seen in STING lacking animals at early time points (6 hours), though less so at 24 hours
(Figures 14H, 141 and Figures 18A-18F). Thus, STING is required for efficient, early
induction of type I IFN production and is required for protection against the negative
stranded virus, VSV infection, possibly through regulating the RIG-I/IPS- 1 pathway.
[00403]      Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a positive-stranded virus of the flavivirus
family or synthetic poly(IC) induces the induction of type I IFN through triggering MDA5
activity. A requirement for STING was not observed in facilitating poly(IC) activity
indicating that STING may not influence MDA5 function (Figure 13A). However, STING
knockout mice were confirmed to be slightly more sensitive to lethal EMCV infection
                                             -110-

    WO 2010/017248                                                          PCT/US2009/052767
compared to controls indicating that STING may exert some influence on host defense
pathways triggered by these viruses (Figure 14J). Nevertheless, significant defects were not
observed in type I IFN production in Sting / mice compared to controls following EMCV
infection (Figures 18A-18F). However, it is known that some flaviviruses such as hepatitis C
virus (HCV) can activate the RIG-I pathway, signaling which is facilitated by STING.
Interestingly, data bank analysis indicated that the flaviviruses yellow fever virus (YFV) and
Dengue virus (DV) encoded a product NS4b, that exhibited strong homology with the amino
terminus of STING (amino acids 125- 222) [Figures 19A-19C]. The importance of this
region in STING activity was emphasized since loss of amino acids 153-173 eliminated
STING function. Various flavivirus NS4b products have been shown to localize in the ER of
the cell and to suppress the induction of type I IFN, although the mechanisms remain unclear.
Given these observations, it was next determined whether YFV NS4b can interfere with
STING's function. These experiments indicated that NS4b was able to inhibit, not only
STING's ability to induce type I IFN, but also RIG-I and MDA5, and VSVAM (Figure 14K).
The effect was not due to NS4b inducing apoptosis. YFV NS4b was shown to co localize
with STING and was subsequently found to directly associate
[004041     with STING, preventing efficient STING function (Figures 18A-I8F). These data
indicate that STING is essential for effective type I IFN production in response to select
DNA viruses as well as the negative-stranded virus VSV. Moreover, STING may be targeted
by select flaviviruses for suppression.
[004051     STING partially exerts its function through the non-canonical IkB kinase TBK-1,
which triggers interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) dependent stimulation of type-I IFN4.
TBK-1 plays an important role in mediating the adjuvant activity of DNA vaccines in vivo.
TBK-1 activation in response to plasmid DNA was found to occur in the absence of the DNA
sensors, TLR9 or DAI/ZBP-1, indicating that other pathways exist to facilitate DNA
mediated immunization. To evaluate if STING played a role in this signaling pathway,
STING-/ or control mice were immunized with plasmid DNA encoding the ovalbumin gene.
While normal B and T cell subsets were noted in unstimulated STING -/- animals, following
immunization Sting -/-mice exhibited significantly less serum ovalbumin (OVA) specific
immunoglobulin (Ig)G's compared to controls. (Figure 15A). In addition, spleen CD8+ T
cell frequency and IFN-y secretion was markedly reduced in Sting -/- mice following
immunization, compared to wild type mice (Figures 15B, 15C). Since immunoglobulin
responses to OVA peptide were normal, these data emphasized that the STING-governed
DNA sensor pathway is essential for efficient DNA vaccine-induced T-cell responses to
                                           - 111 -

    WO 2010/017248                                                        PCT/US2009/052767
antigen. Given this information, it was next evaluated whether STING played a role in
facilitating T-cell responses following infection with the DNA virus vaccinia that expresses
ovalbumin (VV-OVA). This study indicated that control mice, but not Sting (-/-) mice elicited
strong T-cell responses to viral encoded OVA, verifying the importance of STING in innate
immune signaling processes required for DNA adjuvant activity.
[00406]      STING is a predominantly an ER resident protein that can associate with RIG-I
and the mitochondrial innate immune signaling adaptor IPS- 1, events that may explain
STINGs importance in facilitating negative-stranded virus mediated type-I IFN production.
STING associates with the translocon-associated protein complex (TRAP) in the ER.
Physical association of mitochondria and the ER, referred to as mitochondria -associated ER
membrane (MAM), is important for transmission of Ca 2 - to the mitochondria and for
oxidative metabolism. The next experiments examined whether STING could associate with
MAM's, interactions that may help explain IPS- l/STING interactions. First, HA-tagged
STING was reconstituted into Sting (/ MEFs, to follow endogenous STING localization
using HA antibody. This analysis confirmed that STING is predominantly associated with
the ER as determined by calreticulin marker co-staining (Figure 16A). Mitotracker co
staining also indicated that STING may co-localize with mitochondria associated with the ER
(Figure 13B). Fractionation analysis subsequently indicated that STING is associated with
microsomes, a complex of continuous membranes that comprise the ER, Golgi and transport
vesicles. Endogenous STING was also found to fractionate with MAM and mitochondria
fractions under unstimulated conditions in MEF's (Figure 14C). Calreticulin, known to be a
chaperone involved in regulating the association of the ER and mitochondria, was observed
to fractionate similarly. This data may indicate that in the case of VSV infection, STING
could associate with IPS-1 through MAM interaction, to facilitate RIG-I signaling.
Interestingly, following HSV-1 infection, STING was observed to become predominantly
associated only with microsome fractions only (Figure 14C). To clarify these observations,
HA-STING MEFs were infected with HSV-1 or transfected these cells with stimulatory ISD
or negative-control ssDNA. These results indicated that in response to HSV-1 infection or
ISD transfection, STING translocated from the ER and predominantly congregated to
perinuclear, non-ER microsome compartments in the cell (Figure 16D). That STING
trafficked from the ER and MAM fractions was confirmed by staining cells with calreticulin
and Mitotracker markers (Figure 20). Brefeldin A but not chloroquine blocked STING
trafficking indicating that STING locates from the ER via the Golgi to vesicles in the
perinuclear region. This trafficking, in response to intracellular DNA, was similarly observed
                                           -112-

    WO 2010/017248                                                         PCT/US2009/052767
for TBK-I which associates with STING. Significantly, in the absence of STING, TBK-1
failed to relocate to perinuclear regions in response to ISD transfection. Loss of STING's
predicted 36 amino acid amino terminal signal peptide sequence eliminated STING
trafficking and function, emphasizing the importance of this region in STING activity.
Collectively, it is plausible that STING translocates as a complex with TBK-I (Figure 16E).
[00407]      To evaluate the sub-cellular localization of STING after DNA mediated
intracellular stimulation, antibodies that recognize molecules associated with specific cellular
organelles were used. It was observed that in the presence of DNA, STING most
predominantly localized with the early endosome marker protein EEA1 and recycling
endosome marker TfR (Figure 16F and Figure 20). TBK-1, which trafficked similarly in
response to intracellular DNA, has also been demonstrated to associate with Sec 5, a
component of the exocyst 8 subunit complex that facilitates vesicular transport processes.
Upon intracellular DNA stimulation, STING was found to strongly co-localize with Sec5,
which has also been demonstrated to associate in perinuclear endosome compartments
(Figure 16G). The RaIB/Sec5 pathway is required for efficient Sendai Virus (SV)-mediated
type I IFN production. However, the data herein indicates that STING/TBK- 1 complexes
may traffic to endosome compartments to associate with Sec5/exocyst components and
facilitate the production of type I IFN in response to intracellular DNA. To evaluate whether
Sec5 also modulates the production of IFNp in response to ISD, Sec5 production in normal
MEF's was suppressed using RNAi (Figures 21A, 21B). This study indicated that in the
absence of Sec5, ISD-mediated IFN production was significantly impaired (Figure 16G). A
similar effect was observed upon knockdown of TRAPP and Sec61l , components of the
TRAP complex. The data thus indicates that intracellular DNA may induce STING to
complex with TBK- 1 and traffic to Sec5 containing endosome compartments, events that
facilitate the production of type I IFN.
[00408]      In conclusion, it was demonstrated that STING is essential for the recognition of
intracellular DNA and efficient production of type I IFN in all cell types examined. Loss of
STING renders mice susceptible to lethal DNA virus infection (HSV-1). However STING
also facilitates host defense responses to negative-stranded viruses such as VSV, plausibly
through RIG-I and IPS-1/MAM-ER translocon interactions. While STING-independent,
VSV-mediated type I IFN-induction pathways exist, they do not appear sufficient on their
own to protect mice against lethal VSV infection. It was concluded that in response to
intracellular DNA, STING/TBK-1 complexes traffic to endosomal compartments to associate
with exocyst components including Sec5, resulting in the induction of type I IFN. These
                                            -113-

events are impeded by select viruses such as YFV, implicating a new mechanism of viral
suppression of host defense.
