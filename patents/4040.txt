                                      TECHNICAL FIELD
[0003]     The present specification generally relates to housings for optical fibers, and more
particularly, high-density multi-fiber adapter housings.
                                        BACKGROUND
[0004]     Typical optical telecommunication systems and networks include one or more
telecommunications data centers that provide large numbers of optical and electrical cable
connections that join various types of network equipment. The typical system also includes a
number of outlying stations that extend the system into a network. Examples of network
equipment include electrically-powered (active) units such as optical line terminals (OLTs),
optical network terminals (ONTs), network interface devices (NIDs), servers, splitters,
combiners, multiplexers, switches and routers, fanout boxes and patch panels. This network
equipment is often installed within cabinets in standard-sized equipment racks. Each piece of
equipment typically provides one or more adapters where optical or electrical patch cables
("jumper cables") can be physically connected to the equipment.        These patch cables are
generally routed to other network equipment located in the same cabinet or in another
cabinet.
                                                1

[0005]     A common problem in telecommunications systems, and in particular with optical
telecommunications      equipment,     is   space    management.        Current   practice   in
telecommunications is to utilize standard electronics racks or frames that support standards
sized stationary rack-mounted housings of various widths. Vertical spacing has been divided
into rack units "U", where IU=1.75 inches. The housings may be fixed, slide-out, or swing
out patch/splice panels or shelves.     However, the configurations and sizes of present-day
housings for optical telecommunications equipment have been defined largely by the
properties of the fiber optic cables that connect to the devices supported by the housings. In
particular, the configurations and sizes have been established based on the particular ability
of the fiber optic cables and optical fibers therein to interface with the devices without
exceeding the bending tolerance of the fiber optic cable and/or the optical fibers. This has
resulted in telecommunications equipment that occupies relatively large amounts of space,
and in particular a relatively large amount of floor space in a central office of a
telecommunications network. It has also led to data center patch panels being increasingly
overpopulated due to connector and cable volumes.

is not to be taken as an admission that the document or other matter was known or that the
information it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of
any of the claims.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0017]     Embodiments described herein generally relate to high-density multi-fiber adapter
housings that are used to receive and house a plurality of multi-fiber connectors (MTP based
connectivity) to establish and maintain connections therewith. An array or set of tightly
packed adapters provide individual connector-adapter-connector locations that provide a
relatively high density of connector/adapter pairs in a housing structure adapted to be
mounted in a 2U space of an equipment rack., which will be described in greater detail
below.
[0018]     Referring to FIG. 1, a multi-fiber adapter housing 10 includes a rectangular, box
like housing structure 12 having a top portion 14 and a bottom portion 16. In the illustrated
embodiment, the top portion 14 is removeable from the bottom portion 16 (e.g., using
releasable fasteners) to provide access to an interior 18 of the housing structure 12. One or
both of the top portion 14 and bottom portion 16 may have one or more moveable panels,
doors or other opening features for providing access to the interior 18 of the housing structure
12. In the illustrated embodiment, the top portion 14 includes a ceiling or top wall 20 and a
back wall 22 connected to the top wall 20. The bottom portion 16 includes a floor or bottom
wall 23 and opposing side walls 24 and 26 extending upwardly therefrom. When the top
portion 14 and the bottom portion 16 are connected together, a 2-U sized housing structure 12
may be provided adapted to be mounted in a 2-U space of an equipment rack. A "U" space
referred to herein may be defined as having a width W of no more than about 17.75 inches
and a height H of no more than about 1.75 inches. The width W may be the available space
between the inside dimensions of uprights of the equipment rack. Thus, a 2-U space, as used
herein, refers to a space having a height H of no more than 3.50 inches for the given width W
of 17.75 inches.
[0019]     The multi-fiber adapter housing 10 includes a plurality of extendable shelves 30
that each carries at least one adapter row 32 of individual adapters 34 providing connector
                                                4

adapter-connector locations.    The adapters 34 may be single fiber or multi-fiber adapters.
Multi-fiber adapters may be MTP-type adapters.        As used herein, an "MTP-type adapter"
refers to any type of multi-fiber adapter.      As used herein, the term "connector-adapter
connector location" refers to a location in which a MTP-type adapter may be positioned,
which is configured to accept two multi-fiber connectors such that the multi-fiber connectors
may be connected together to transmit a fiber optic signal therebetween using the MTP-type
adapter.    In the illustrated embodiment, the adapter housing 10 includes five extendable
shelves 30 and five adapter rows 32 in the interior of the 2-U housing structure 12.        The
adapter rows 32 together provide a bank 36 of adapters 34 having adapters 34 each providing
an individual connector-adapter-connector location in the interior 18 of the 2-U housing
structure 12. As can be seen, a single fiber optic cable 40 may enter the housing structure 12,
for example, through side wall 26.      The fiber optic cable 40 may separate into multiple,
multi-fiber ribbon cables 42, each having an MTP-type connector 46.              The MTP-type
connectors 46 are received by the individual adapters 34 for connection with other MTP-type
connectors 48. The type of cables 40 entering and exiting the adapter housing 10 will depend
on the ultimate end use; however, in the illustrated embodiment, there may be one cable 40
for each shelf 30 and associated adapter rows 32 (e.g., dividing into 40 multi-fiber ribbon
cables 42).
[0020]     Referring to FIG. 2, an individual adapter 34 is illustrated that provides a
connector-adapter-connector location 50 for operably connecting the MTP-type connectors
46 and 48. The adapter 34 includes an adapter body 52 having a first connector end 54 for
receiving the connector 48 and a second connector end 56 for receiving the connector 46.
The adapter body 52 further includes a first minor sidewall 58, a second minor side wall 60, a
first major side wall 62 and a second major side wall 64 that extend between the first and
second connector ends 54 and 56.         A connector channel 66 extends between the first
connector end 54 and the second connector end 56. Guide slots 68 and 70 may be provided
on the first minor side wall 58 and second minor side wall 60 of the adapter body 52 and may
extend through channel 66 from the first connector end 54 and the second connector end 56,
respectively, which can be used to accept the MTP-type connectors 48 and 46 to connect the
optical fibers (e.g., 12, 24 or more optical fibers). In this regard, the cable 42 and cable 72
may be terminated with the MTP-type connectors 48 and 46 and the MTP-type connectors 48
and 46 may then be received by the adapter 34 within the connector channel 66 to connect the
optical fibers in cable 42 to the optical fibers in cable 72. In some embodiments, the guide
                                                5

slots 68 and 70 may be configured to receive the MTP-type connectors 48 and 46 in a
particular orientation only to reliably achieve the connection.
[0021]      Referring now to FIG. 3, a grouping 80 of the adapters 34 is illustrated. As can be
seen, the adapters 34 can be oriented vertically with a long axis of the guide slots 68 and 70
(FIG. 2) oriented in vertical direction.     Such a vertical orientation can facilitate a higher
density of the adapters 34 within a U space. In the illustrated embodiment, the adapters 34
are aligned side-by-side with first and second major walls 62 and 64 of adjacent adapters 34
facing each other. Therefore, the grouping 80 is oriented such that the first and second minor
side walls 58, 60 of the adapters 34 are in a vertical position, for example, at the top or
bottom of the grouping 80. Orienting the adapters 34 in the grouping 80 in this manner,
facilitates the alignment of the highest number of adapters 34 in a certain width in the interior
18 of housing structure 12. In some embodiments, adjacent adapters 34 of the grouping 80
may be connected together, for example, by welding or adhesive. In other embodiments, the
adapters 34 of the grouping 80 may be formed together as an integral group, for example, by
a molding process. As can be seen, each of the adapters 34 of the grouping 80 provides a
connector-adapter-connector location 50 where the connectors 46 and 48 are connected
together.    In the illustrated example, the grouping 80 includes ten adapters 34 and ten
corresponding connector-adapter-connector        locations 50.    The grouping 80, in other
embodiments, may include from about two adapters 34 to about 40 adapters 34. More than
40 adapters 34 may be used in a grouping in some embodiments, for example, depending on
the width of the housing structure 12 (FIG. 1).
[0022]      Referring to FIG. 4, one of the extendable shelves 30 (FIG. 1) is illustrated in
isolation. In this embodiment, the shelf 30 includes a single adapter row 32 of the grouping
80 of the individual adapters 34. The number of groupings 80 the shelf 30 may accommodate
depends, for example, on the number of adapters 34 per grouping 80 and the width of the
housing structure 12. In the illustrated embodiment, for a housing adapted to be mounted in a
2-U space of 17.75 inches wide, the shelf 30 may accommodate four groupings 80, each
grouping 80 including ten individual adapters 34.         As described above, each adapter 34
provides a connector-adapter-connector location 50. Thus, the shelf 30 supports 40 or more,
such as 40 connector-adapter-connector locations 50 that can connect the connectors 46 and
48.
                                                 6

[0023]      The extendable shelf 30 may include any variety of connectors and routers for
connecting the groupings 80 and routing the cables 42 and 72. For example, the extendable
shelf 30 may include extension members 90 that include routing guides 92 disposed on the
extension members 90 to provide for routing for the cables 72 connected to the adapters 34
and the cables 42. Referring also to FIG. 1, the extendable shelf 30 may also contain shelf
rails 94. The shelf rails 94 can be configured to be received in shelf guides 96 disposed in the
housing structure 12 to retain and allow the extendable shelves 30 and the adapters 34
disposed thereon to move in and out of the housing structure 12. The extendible shelves 30
can be moved in and out of the housing structure 12 by their shelf rails 94 moving within the
shelf guides 96. In this manner, the extendable shelves 30 can be independently movable
within the shelf guides 96 in the housing structure 12. The shelf guides 96 may be disposed
on both a left side end 100 and a right side end 102 of the extendable shelf 30. The shelf
guides 96 may be installed opposite and facing each other in the housing structure 12 to
provide complementary shelf guides 96 for the shelf rails 94 of the extendable shelves 30
received therein. If it is desired to access a particular extendable shelf 30 and/or a particular
adapter 34, a pull tab 106 of the desired extendable shelf 30 can be pulled forward to cause
the extendable shelf 30 to extend forward out from the housing structure 12. When access is
completed, the extendable shelf 30 can be pushed back into the housing structure 12 wherein
the shelf rails 94 move within the shelf guides 96 disposed in the housing structure 12.
[0024]      Referring now to FIG. 5, a schematic representation of a bank 120 of adapters 122
is illustrated. The bank 120 of adapters 122, as described above, provides connector-adapter
connector locations 124 for connecting MTP connectors.         The bank 120 of adapters has a
width W (e.g., of about 15 inches) and a height H (of about 3 inches) that is sized to fit within
a 2-U space. The bank 120 of adapters 122 is formed of multiple rows 126, 128, 130, 132
and 134 of the individual adapters 122. In this embodiment, each row 126, 128, 130, 132 and
 134 includes the same number of individual adapters 122, such as 40 or more.           In other
embodiments, certain ones of the rows 126, 128, 130, 132 and 134 may include different
numbers of adapters 122. In the bank 120 of FIG. 5, there are five rows 126, 128, 130, 132
and 134 adapted to have 40 adapters per row for a total of 200 adapters in a 2-U space. For
an MTP-type connector that includes 12 optical fibers, there may be 2400 optical fiber pairs
or 4800 optical fibers coming into or leaving from the adapter housing 10 (FIG. 1).
                                                7
