   Technical Field
            1002]    Materials, components, and methods consistent with the present disclosure are
   directed to the fabrication and use of micro-scale channels with a gas, where the micro-scale
   channels are configured to control the temperature of the gas.
            [003]   A volume of fluid, such as air, can be characterized by a temperature and
   pressure. When considered as a collection of constituent particles, comprising, for example,
   molecules of oxygen and nitrogen, the volume of fluid at a given temperature can be understood
   as a distribution of constituent particle speeds. This distribution can be characterized, generally,
20 by an average speed which can bear a relationship with the temperature of the gas.
            [004]   The internal atomic and molecular structure of constituent particles, which can
   provide a range of accessible internal energy states, can also affect the temperature distribution
   of the gas. The range of accessible internal energy states associated with an atom or molecule, in
   turn, can be affected by the geometry and properties of its surroundings.

15         [016]    Reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments (exemplary
   embodiments) of the disclosure, characteristics of which are illustrated in the accompanying
   drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings
   to refer to the same or like parts.
            [0171    FIG. I depicts two views of a base 110 and an arrangement of sides 120 for
20 forming a set of exemplary micro channels consistent with the disclosure. The lower portion of
   FIG. I depicts a "top" view of the arrangement of the sides 120 on the base 110, and the upper
   portion of FIG. I depicts an "edge" view of the arrangement of the sides 120 on the base 110.
   For reference, an axis 145 assigns an "x"-direction and a "z"-direction to the figure in the upper
   portion, and an axis 155 assigns an "x"-direction and a "y"-direction to the figure in the lower
25 portion. The material of the base 110 can include aluminum sheet metal, anodized aluminum,
   Teflon-coated aluminum, painted aluminum, graphene, pyrolytic graphite, copper sheet metal,
   and/or any other thermally conductive material that is relatively smooth and flat. The material of
   the sides 120 can include aluminum foil, copper foil, other metal foils, graphene, pyrolytic
    graphite, and any other thermally conductive material that is relatively smooth and flat. In the
30  depicted "z"-direction of FIG. 1, the side 120 can have a thickness in a range from approximately
    0.5 pm thick to approximately 500 tm.
            [018]    As illustrated in FIG. 1, the shape of the sides 120 can be selected to form a
    micro channel that is gradually increasing in cross section as a gas moves (for example) in the
    negative "y"direction, However, the depicted shape is not limiting. The overall cross section of
                                                      4

   WO 2014/055323                                                                 PCT/US2013/061887
   the micro channel can be configured to exhibit macroscopic length scales in the      'x direction
   (i.e., meters) and smaller length scales in the "z' direction (i.e., 0.5 to 500 tm). From the
   perspective of the upper-portion figure shown in FIG. 1, the cross section of the micro channel
   shown "nearest" the edge that is viewed is depicted as larger than the cross section of the micro
 5 channel that is furthest away from the edge that is viewed. The thickness of the "z"-dimension
   of the sides 120 can be approximately 15 im, but can be anywhere in a range from
   approximately 0.5 pm to approximately 500 gm. An inflow width 125 (ie., the variable "w<" in
   FIG. 1) in the ''-direction     between the arranged sides 120 in FIG. I can be 10 mm, but can be
   anywhere in a range from approximately I gm to several centimeters. An outflow width 115
10 (i.e., the variable "w>" in FIG. 1) in the "x"-direction between the arranged sides 120 in FIG. 1
   can be 20 mm, but can be anywhere in a range from approximately I pm to several centimeters.
   The length of base 110 and side 120 in the "Y"direction can be anywhere in a range from 1 mm
   to lengths in the scale of meters, At lengths of approximately hundreds of millimeters and more
    in the "y" direction, however, micro channel support can be required to maintain a 0.5 pn to 500
15  gin micro channel opening thickness (whether as an inflow opening or as an outflow opening).
    Further, the dimensions of the micro channel in the "z" direction from the inflow to the outflow
    need not remain at a constant height and can vary both along the "y" axis direction and the "x"
    axis direction between approximately 0.5 pm and approximately 500 gpm consistent with the
    current disclosure. (Note that FIG. 1, and all of the figures, FIGS. 2-5, are not necessarily
20  depicted to scale.)
             [019]    As illustrated in FIG. 2. an additional base 210 can be positioned over the
    arrangement depicted in FIG, I in order to form a set of micro channels with an inflow width 125
    (the variable "w<") and an outflow width 115 (the variable "w>"). Due to the dimensions of the
    sides 120 in the "z"-direction, the set of micro channels have a dimension in the "z" direction of
25  approximately 15 in, but can be anywhere in the range from approximately 0.5 gm to
    approximately 500 um. The micro channels that are formed can maintain the same,
    approximate, "z" axis dimension along the length of the "x" axis direction, or the "z" axis
    dimension can vary from between approximately 0.5 gmi to approximately 500 Im along both
    the "x" axis direction and the "'   axis direction consistent with the disclosure. The overall width
30  of the entire device 200 in the "x" axis direction can be 40 mm to 100 mm or it can be
    approximately less than I mn to many meters-and could even extend to kilometers, if required,
    based on the application. That is, one of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the scale
    of the device in the "xK" axis can vary by application. A representative device width that is
    intended to fit inside of a semiconductor package can be determined by the "x" axis of the
35  semiconductor package (such as millimeters). However, computer server racks can use devices
                                                       5

   WO 2014/055323                                                                 PCT/US2013/061887
   that are scaled to the rack. Larger applications like commercial air conditioning devices can be of
   the scale of tens of meters along the "x" axis.
            [020]     The base 210 can be secured to the base 110 to form device 200 using epoxy,
   and/or other chemical adhesives. One of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the
 5 application of the epoxy and/or chemical adhesive can be accomplished so as avoid adversely
   affecting the size of the micro channels in the "z" direction. For example, the epoxy and/or
   chemical adhesive can be applied in a thin film. Welding, brazing, and metal bonding can also be
   used to secure the base 210 to the base 110 when the surfaces of base 210 and base 110 are
   adequately smooth and flat, and adequate pressure is applied to the parts provide a thermal path
10 without the added thermal resistance of air gaps. Further, fasteners such as pins, rivets screws
   and bolts can also be used.
            [021]     Consistent with a further embodiment, FIG. 3 depicts two views of a base 310
   and an arrangement of raised sides for forming a set of exemplary micro channels 330 consistent
   with the disclosure. The lower portion of FIG. 3 depicts a "top" view of the arrangement of the
15  raised sides on the base 310, and the upper portion of FIG. 3 depicts an "edge" view of the
    arrangement of the raised sides on the base 310, For reference, an axis 345 assigns an "x"
    direction and a "z"-direction to the figure in the upper portion, and an axis 355 assigns an "x"
    direction and a "y"-direction to the figure in the lower portion. The material of the base 3 10 can
    include aluminum sheet metal, anodized aluminum, Teflon-coated aluminum, painted
20  aluminum, graphene, pyrolytic graphite, copper sheet metal, or any other thermally conductive
    material that is relatively smooth and flat. The material of the base 310 can also include
    extrusions of tubing made of thermally conductive metals, graphene, pyrolytic graphite, carbon
    nanotubes, polymers or other thermally conductive materials. Where the material of the base
    310 includes tubing, the tubing can have inside diameters in the range of approximately 0.5 gm
25  to approximately 500 pm. Generally speaking (that is, whether tubing or otherwise), the material
    of the raised sides can be the same material as the base 310, with the micro channels 330 formed
    by extrusion, embossing, coining, stamping, punching, and/or perforating, and/or can be cut with
    fine blanking to maintain integrity of micro channel features.
             [022]    As illustrated in FIG. 3, the shape of the micro channels 330 can be selected so
30  as to be gradually increasing in cross section as a gas moves (for example) in the negative "y"
    direction, However, the depicted shape is not limiting. The overall cross section of the micro
    channel can be configured to be of macroscopic scale, for example, exhibiting a width in the "x"
    axis direction that is greater than 1 mm, with "z" axis heights of approximately 0.5 pm to
    approximately 500 Rm (with overall '"       axis lengths of the device of the scale of meters). From
35  the perspective of the upper-portion figure shown in FIG. 3, the cross section of the micro
                                                        6

   channel shown "nearest" the edge that is viewed is depicted as larger than the cross section of the
   micro channel that is furthest away from the edge that is viewed. The thickness of the "z'
   dimension of the micro channels 330 can be approximately 15 pm, but can be anywhere in a
   range from approximately 0.5 pm to approximately 500 pm. An inflow width 325 (i.e., the
 5 variable "w<" in FIG. 3) in the "x"-direction between the raised sides in FIG. 3 can be 10 mm,
   but can be anywhere in a range from approximately 1 mm to several hundred millimeters, An
   individual micro channel can have a "y"axis length of hundreds of millimeters before micro
   channel support might be required to maintain a 0.5 pum to 500 Pm micro channel opening
   thickness. Further still, the micro channel opening need not remain at a constant "z" axis height
10 and may vary both along the x axis and they axis from 0.5 um to 500 jim consistent with the
   current disclosure, As described above, the "x" axis length can be scaled for the application.
   Examples of devices that can exhibit millimeter-scale "x" axis lengths include devices
   configured to fit inside semiconductor packages, and examples of devices that can exhibit meter
   scale lengths includes devices configured for commercial scale air conditioning system heat
15 exchangers. An outflow width 315 (i.e., the variable "w>" in FIG. 3) in the "x"-direction
   between the raised sides in FIG. 3 can be 20 mm, but can be anywhere in a range from
   approximately 1 mm to hundreds of mm.
            [023]    As illustrated in FIG, 4, an additional base 410 can be positioned over the
   arrangement depicted in FIG. 3 in order to form a set of micro channels 330 with an inflow width
20 325 (the variable "w<") and an outflow width 315 (the variable "iv>"'), The set of micro
   channels 330 can have a dimension in the "z' direction of approximately 15 Vm, but can be
   anywhere in the range from approximately 0.5 pim to 500 jim. The overall width of the entire
   device 400 in the "x" direction can be 40 mm to 100 mm or approximately 1 mm to the scale of
   meters or more (such as kilometers)-based upon the application. That is, the "x" axis length of
25 the overall device can be scaled according to the application. For example, devices that exhibit
    lengths of the scale of millimeters can be used with semiconductor packages, and devices that
   exhibit lengths of the scale of meters can be used with commercial scale air conditioning system
   heat exchangers.
            [024]    The base 410 can be secured to the base 310 to form device 400 using epoxy
30 and/or other chemical adhesives. One of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the
    application of the epoxy and/or chemical adhesive can be accomplished so as avoid adversely
    affecting the size of the micro channels in the "z" direction. For example, the epoxy and/or
    chemical adhesive can be applied in a thin film. Welding, brazing, and metal bonding can be
    used to secure the base 410 to the base 310 when the surfaces of base 410 and base 310 are
35  adequately smooth and flat, and adequate pressure is applied to the parts provide a thermal path

   without the added thermal resistance of air gaps. Further, fasteners such as pins, rivets screws
   and bolts can be used as well.

   channels) constructed consistent with this disclosure. Also depicted in FIG. 5 is gas 540 and a
 5 direction of flow 520 to generate cooling in the device 500. Device 560 is any apparatus which
   can induce a flow between an inflow opening 531 of the micro channel 530 and an outflow
   opening 532 of the micro channel 530.

   example, consistent with the disclosure, the overall shape of the micro channels and the relative
   widths of the inflow opening and the outflow opening that are depicted in FIGS. 1-5 are
15 exemplary only and not limiting. Consistent with the disclosure, a micro channel consistent with
   the current disclosure can exhibit a variety of cross sectional shapes-including variations in
