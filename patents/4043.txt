     IMPROVED PROCESSES IN THE PREPARATION OF COCONUT
                   MEAT BASED COMPOSITIONS AND FILMS
   This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2014284793, the
 5 entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
   TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION
   This invention refers to the processes in the preparation of fresh coconut meat based
10 compositions and films, including its improvements and modifications, comprising
   mainly of coconut meat wherein other fruit and vegetables are added as flavourings and
   enhancers.    These coconut meat based compositions and films can be used as crepes,
   rolls, and or wraps which are usually employed in wrapping any food such as fresh fruits,
   vegetables, salads, or cooked meat and/or vegetables, and any combination thereof, after
15 which are rolled, folded and eaten directly during meals or as snacks.
   DESCRIPTION
   Background of the Invention
20
   The fresh coconut meat based compositions which are produced into films are similar to
   spring rolls or "lumpia" wrappers of Chinese dim sum, or "tortilla" in Spanish meals
   which involved putting an ingredient material on a dough sheet of the spring roll or
   "lumpia" wrapper" or "tortilla", rolling up the dough sheet to wrap the ingredient
25 material, except that no frying is necessary as this coconut meat based composition made
   into films can be eaten directly. Any food material and mixtures can be placed onto a
   portion of the surface area of the films, then rolled and or folded, then is conveniently
   ready for eating. Further, some examples of wrapped foods particularly popular in Japan
   and in the rest of Asian countries are the Japanese temaki sushi and onigiri/omusubi, the
                                                 1

   former is hand roll and cone and the latter is like a rice ball. In this example, the primary
   sheet product used to wrap sushi and onigiri/omusubi is "nori," an algae-based food made
   of seaweed of the genus Porphyra which has been processed and dried into sheets.
   Although such seaweed based wrap for food is popular, many do not find the taste or
 5 texture of seaweed attractive and appealing, especially children.
   Eating healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables has been a universal campaign. Thus
   there is always a challenge to prepare these foods in such a way that they are attractive
   and appealing to people of all ages, and at the same time have the desired variety and
10 convenience added to it. Foods, including handheld foods, snack foods, and convenience
   foods, prepared with a food wrapper made primarily of a delicious and nutritious fruit and
   or vegetable itself can address these challenges.
   The preparation of edible fruit and vegetable foods has been reported already around the
15 world. Fruits and vegetable films and its uses have been reported by McHugh et al. in
   U.S. Patent 8,048,466. Intermediate-moisture formed food products made from partially
   dehydrated fruit or vegetable pieces and a gelled matrix have been reported by Huxsoll et
   al. in U.S. Patent 6,623,779. Seventy to 100% fruit and vegetable bars produced using
   twin screw extrusion have been reported by McHugh et al. in U.S. Patent 6,027,758.

                                                  3

   directly, baked, steamed, or fried, and can remain fresh for up to twelve (12) months or
   longer, without chemical preservatives.
   Summary of the Invention
 5 The object of this invention is to provide an alternative to known spring rolls or tortillas
   or lumpia wrappers, fruit films, vegetable films, fruit and vegetable films, fresh crepe or
   roll or wrap for food and as food, which have the desired properties to serve as nutritious,
   delicious, and appealing food alternate.
10 An exemplary embodiment of the present invention relates to a composition comprising
   at least 90% coconut meat and at most 10% coconut water, preferably derived from a
   fresh and young coconut. The said composition may be combined with other fruits and
   vegetables to serve as nutrition, texture, and flavour enhancers. The said compositions
   makes it suitable in making films having the thinness, strength, flexibility, and crispness
15 to serve as alternates or substitutes for other food-based films which are useful for
   wrapping around a combination and a plurality of foods, and can be employed to provide
   wrapped foods, such as fruit, vegetable, meat, or any combination thereof, the desired
   variety, nutrition, appeal, taste and convenience.
20 More specifically, the present invention pertains to a composition made into a monolayer
   film comprising of at the minimum 90% fresh and young coconut meat calculated on a
   percent by weight basis, and wherein the film has a dry film thickness in the range from
   about 1.0 to about 30 millimeter, more preferably from about 1.5 mm to about 2.5 mm,
   most preferably at about 2.0 mm, a moisture content in the range from about 8 to about
25 10%, and a water activity in the range from about 0.45 to about 0.55. Alternately, virgin
   coconut oil and or fruit polyphenolic extract in the amounts within the range from 0.05%
   to about 0.1% each, calculated on a percent by weight basis. In another alternative, virgin
   coconut oil is added in the amount within the range from 0.05% to about 0.2% and up to
   1.0% to 5.0% calculated on a percent by weight basis. These components are added to
                                                  4

   enhance the flavors, textures, nutritional content and longer shelf-life of the coconut meat
   based compositions which are made into films.
   Alternatively, other fruits, vegetables, and spices and or any combination thereof can be
 5 added to the fresh coconut meat based compositions and films in the amounts within the
   range from about 0.1% to about 0.4% each or 1.0% to 2.0% depending on the variety to
   enhance the flavors, textures, nutritional content, and to add more variety/flavor to the
   coconut meat based compositions which are made into films.
10 The coconut meat based films can be packaged in sheets, rolls, or any convenient form.
   Alternatively, the films can be packed by arranging them in sheets in between food-grade
   paper sheets to keep its desired dryness, flexibility and crispness. The films or film
   products are packaged so as to maintain the desired film water activity and moisture
   content, for example, in food-grade moisture barrier bags or other containers or in oxygen
15 and moisture barrier bags and food-grade containers. A desiccant can be incorporated into
   a film package or film product package to absorb moisture during storage and maintain
   the desired food film properties. Alternatively, the films can be directly used for
   preparing products and directly eaten without frying or cooking.
20 The films can be used for wrapping around foods to provide a wide range of healthy,
   nutritious, delicious, appealing, ready-to-eat and convenient foods, during meal time and
   snack time, for example. The films can also be applied between foods. Since the method
   of producing the composition provides a way to combine any fruit, vegetable and or
   spices, the films have the additional appeal and variety according to individual
25 preferences.
   The shelf life of the product referred to herein can reach about twelve (12) months, when
   packaged and stored at the specified conditions so as not to alter its desired film
   properties of moisture content, water activity, crispness and dryness. With such desirable
                                                 5

   shelf life, the products may be prepared for immediate consumption or for future
   consumption.
   The following advantages can be observed of the coconut meat based compositions and
 5 films, which is the object of this invention. The films when produced as described herein
   provide the important and unique characteristics of thinness, strength, flexibility,
   crispness, and dryness to serve as alternative or substitute for other food-based
   compositions and films, while providing the other important properties of food nowadays
   which should be healthy, nutritious, delicious, appealing and tasty. Notwithstanding these
10 advantages, the products, which are comprised of fruits and vegetables, also have longer
   shelf lives, provide a wide range of variety and texture, are convenient and ready-to-eat.
   The provision of products made from fruits and vegetables can increase consumption of
   fruits and vegetables and afford consumers to meet their daily dietary requirements, thus
   help them achieve a more balanced and nutritious diet. A more specific advantage of the
15 invention is the provision of attractive nutritious low carbohydrate, low calorie product
   which can contribute in addressing the global problem of people's increasing obesity.
   This invention also pertains to the improved methods in making the fresh coconut meat
   based compositions and films. Other important objects and advantages of the invention
20 may also become apparent from the ensuing detailed description.
                                                 6

   The Invention
   The present invention pertains to compositions and films, the processes and the
   modifications of such processes in the preparation thereof, comprising mainly of the
   coconut meat and coconut water, combined with other fruits and vegetables to serve as
 5 nutrition, texture and flavour enhancers        as well as extend its shelf-life. These
   compositions and films have the thinness, strength, flexibility, and crispness to serve as
   alternates or substitutes for other food-based films, which are useful for wrapping around
   a combination and a plurality of foods, and can be employed to provide wrapped foods,
   such as fruit, vegetable, meat, fish or any combination thereof, the desired variety,
10 nutrition, appeal, taste and convenience.
   To promote better understanding and appreciation of the object of this invention, the
   following general definitions are included.
15 A film is a thin layer of material and when the film is edible, it is made of a thin layer of
   edible material. Edible films are pre-formed into solid sheets which can then be applied
   on, around or between foods, food components or ingredients. As an object of this
   invention, a thin single layer of film is made from a composition comprising mainly of
   coconut meat, preferably the fresh and young puree.
20
   The fresh and young coconut meat puree refers to a paste or liquid suspension usually
   made by grinding or blending coconut meat in combination with other fruit and or
   vegetable ingredients, wherein the fresh coconut water obtained from the coconut fruit is
   also mixed in. The coconut puree is prepared from whole flesh. The puree is then the
25 intermediate product that can be employed for processing into different final products.
   Purees can be heat treated, aseptically or otherwise, but do not necessarily have to be heat
   treated. In this invention, the coconut meat "puree" is meant to refer to both heat and non
   heat treated whole coconut meat which have been mechanically transformed, such as
   under a screening or pulping device, into viscous slurries. Thus, this comminuted material
                                                 7

   can be distinguished from individual discrete pieces of intact fruit or vegetable flesh.
   Purees can range in moisture from 4% in dried form to 98% in dilute form.
   Percent ingredient is expressed as [(weight of ingredient/total weight of formulation)x
 5 100].
   Percent ingredient expressed on a percent by weight basis of a formulation is calculated
   as    [(weight  of the   ingredient)/(sum     of (weight      of each   ingredient in the
   formulation))x 100]. Calculations are illustrated in the following examples below.
10
   Water Activity is defined as the amount of unbound, free water in a system available to
   support biological and chemical reactions. Water activity is a concept that differs from
   that of absolute water content of a particular food. Some foods may have high levels of
   total water content while at the same time possess low water activity. The equation for
15 water activity is: A,=VP/VPo, where VP is the partial vapor pressure of the food at
   temperature T and VPo is the saturation vapor pressure of pure water at T. This ratio
   provides the amount of free water present in the food expressed as the equilibrium state of
   the unbound water content in relation to the vapor pressure of the surrounding
   environment in which the food is stored under conditions of room temperature and
20 atmospheric pressure.
   Moisture content is determined by using the AOAC (Association of Analytical
   Communities) official method 22.012. It can also be determined by other methods as
   known in the art.
25 In one of the main embodiments of the present invention, a method of preparing the food
   composition is described comprising the steps:
   (a) grinding the coconut meat,
   (b) mixing the ground coconut meat in (a) with coconut water, and
   (c) drying.
30
                                                  8

   Preferably, the said method of preparing the food composition further comprises the step
   of sieving the mixed coconut meat and coconut water in (b) to form a more homogeneous
   puree or batter before the drying step. More preferably, the drying step is done until the
   moisture content of the mixture ranges from 8% to 10%. This is done for two (2) to five
 5 (5) hours at a temperature range of 35-85'C, preferably 48-65'C, most preferably 50
   60 0 C.
   In another embodiment of the present invention, a method of preparing an edible film
   comprises the steps:
10 (a) grinding coconut meat,
   (b) mixing the ground coconut meat in (a) with coconut water,
   (c) sieving the said mixture in step (b) to achieve a homogenous puree or butter,
   (d) spreading the resulting sieved mixture in a drying sheet, and
   (e) drying the spread mixture up to a moisture content ranging from 8% to 10%.
15
   Preferably, the drying step is done for two (2) to five (5) hours at a temperature range of
   35- 85 0 C, preferably 48-65 0 C, and most preferably 50-60 0 C. The raw ingredients used in
   the above methods preferably comprise the following ratios:
           (a) 88-97 wt% coconut meat, and
20         (b) 3-12 wt% coconut water.
   More preferably, the coconut meat and coconut water used in the above methods are
   derived from fresh and young coconuts with good coconut meat and more coconut water.
25 Alternatively, other fruits, vegetables, and spices, and or any combination thereof can be
   added to the raw ingredients in a combined amount not exceeding 2 wt% of the total
   ingredients. These additives enhance the flavors, textures, nutritional content, and add
   more variety to the coconut meat based compositions especially those which are made
   into films.
30
                                                  9

   Another embodiment of the present invention pertains to a food composition obtainable
   from any of the methods disclosed above. The said resulting food composition and or film
   comprises:
           (a) at least 90 wt% coconut meat, and
 5         (b) at most 10 wt% coconut water.
   Alternatively, the said composition obtainable from any of the methods disclosed above
   comprises:
           (a) at least 88 wt% coconut meat,
           (b) at most 10 wt% coconut water, and
10         (c) at most 2 wt% additives.
   Preferably, any of the said obtainable compositions disclosed above has 8-10% moisture
   content and more preferably having a water activity of 0.45 - 0.55.
15 In another embodiment of the present invention, any of the obtainable compositions
   disclosed above is in the form of an edible film. Preferably, the said edible film is
   monolayer. Most preferably, the dry thickness of the said edible film is in the range of
   1.0- 1.5 millimeter. The said edible film have the thinness, strength, flexibility, and
   crispness to serve as alternate or substitute for other food-based films, which are useful
20 for wrapping around a combination and a plurality of foods, and can be employed to
   provide wrapped foods, such as fruit, vegetable, meat, or any combination thereof, the
   desired variety, nutrition, appeal, taste and convenience.
   In a more specific embodiment of the invention, the methods in the preparation of the
25 coconut meat based compositions and films are described in more detail although are
   intended only to further illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of
   the invention which is defined by the claims. The first step consists of harvesting
   carefully the coconut fruit, preferably fresh and young, which should have the right
   maturity, ripeness, and texture of the coconut meat. Other fruit, vegetables, spices and
                                                  10

   herbs which are used in the process are also harvested and chosen carefully to have its
   desired maturity, texture, color and ripeness.
   The coconut meat and its coconut water are collected separately and stored in clean
 5 containers. The coconut meat is reduced to small pieces by methods already known in the
   art such as chopping, grating, and grinding. The smaller pieces of coconut meat are then
   blended with the right amount of coconut water to obtain a coconut meat puree. The puree
   is preferably blended with the right amount of additional ingredients, fruits and or
   vegetables, herbs and spices to obtain the final product mixture. Please see further the
10 examples below for more detailed description of the combinations of these fruits and
   vegetables. Further, the mixture is then sieved using a stainless steel strainer preferably
   with about 100 to 200 mesh screen. The resulting homogenous puree or butter is then
   spread immediately on high-temperature resistant drying sheets using a template with a
   dimension of about 20 cm x 20 cm. The dimensions of the drying sheet template can be
15 modified further to 25 cm x 25 cm, 28 cm x 28 cm, or 40 cm x 40 cm, to allow a variety
   of sizes for different applications. The filled drying sheets are then placed in a dryer to
   dry the film at the desired moisture content. A set of mechanical and solar dryers is
   employed in the drying process to save on fuel and energy. The drying process takes
   about two (2) to five (5) hours at a temperature range from 35'C to 85'C, preferably from
20 48 0 C-650 C, most preferably from 50-60'C, until the desired moisture content within the
   range from 8% to about 10% is attained. Along with the moisture content, the desired
   strength, flexibility and crispness of the dried films are tested before harvesting of the
   dried films. After drying, the films are then allowed to cool down to a temperature range
   of about 18'C to 24'C for about 5-10 minutes. When cooled, the dried films are collected
25 and weighed. Then, they are packed and sealed properly to further improve its shelf life.
   The films produced in this invention comprise the following properties: a monolayer film
   comprising of at the minimum 90% fresh and young coconut meat calculated on a per
   cent by weight basis, a dry film thickness in the range from about 1.0 to about 3.0
30 millimetre, more preferably at about 1.5 mm to about 2.5 mm, most preferably at about
                                                 11

   2.0 mm, a moisture content in the range from about 8 to about 10%, and a water activity
   in the range from about 0.45 to about 0.55.
   The amount of coconut water added to the mixture, and thereby the percent moisture of
 5 the starting puree can vary depending on the maturity of the fresh coconut meat being
   used. A base puree may be dried or diluted as needed to obtain the desired percentages.
   Other ingredients may be incorporated into the wet film formulation in an amount
   sufficient to obtain a desired characteristic while maintaining the thinness, strength,
   flexibility, and crispness of the final film produced by the formulation. Without being
10 limiting, examples of other ingredients include flavor ingredients or enhancers and color
   sources or texture enhancers. The other ingredients may be added in an amount to provide
   flexibility, strength, flavor, color or other advantageous        property; however, the
   concentration should not be so high that the added ingredient substantially separates out
   of the wet film formulation. Preferably the other fruit, vegetable and herbs and spices are
15 added in the range from 0. 1% to about 0.4% each calculated on a percent by weight basis.
   The total percentage of all other ingredients is calculated as a percent by weight basis in
   combination with the other main ingredients. Thus, the combination of all other
   ingredients cannot be more than 2% calculated on a percent by weight basis.
20 In a more specific embodiment, the present invention can have a composition wherein
   virgin coconut oil and or fruit polyphenolic extract are added in the amounts within the
   range from 0.05% to about 0. 1% each, calculated on a percent by weight basis. In another
   alternative, only virgin coconut oil is added in the amount within the range from 0.05% to
   about 0.2%, and 1.0% to 5.0% calculated on a percent by weight basis. These components
25 are added to enhance the flavors, textures, nutritional content and extend the shelf-life of
   the coconut meat based compositions which are made into films.
   In general, the fresh and young coconut meat comprises at least 90% of the dry film
   formulation and the coconut water comprises at most 10% of the dry film formulation.
30 The other ingredients such as flavor or color or texture enhancers are combined from a
                                                 12

   range within 0.1% to about 2.0% each, so that the resulting dry film would be comprised
   of at least 90% of the basic ingredients.
   Drying may be carried out as needed to obtain the desired dryness by procedures already
 5 known in the art, including solar and or mechanical dehydrator and the like. Additional
   drying steps or a combination of different drying systems may be carried out as desired.
   In another embodiment of the invention, the modified methods in the preparation of the
   coconut meat based compositions and films are described in more detail. The first step
10 consists of harvesting carefully the fresh and young coconut fruit, which should have the
   right maturity, ripeness, and texture of the coconut meat. Other fruit, vegetables, spices
   and herbs which are used in the process are also harvested and chosen carefully to have
   its desired maturity, texture, color and ripeness. It is important that the harvesting and
   dehusking of young coconut are done on-site, where the actual processing can proceed
15 immediately.
   The fresh and young coconut meat and its coconut water are collected separately and
   stored in clean containers. The coconut water is further filtered in a 3-stage microfiltration
   system with 0.1 -5 micron filters in order to eliminate unnecessary sediments and to
20 disinfect the coconut water.
   In another embodiment of this invention, the process of coconut meat collection and
   storage is modified by placing the harvested coconut meat in a blast-freezer, also known
   as contact- freezer, prior to use in order to prevent the onset of natural fermentation,
25 which can lead to product spoilage. Alternatively, the coconut meat is then chopped and
   immediately blended with the right amount of filtered coconut water to obtain a coconut
   meat puree. The puree is further blended with the right amount of additional ingredients,
   fruits and or vegetables, herbs and spices to obtain the final product mixture. The
   blending process is done in approximately 6-8 minutes only to reduce operating costs.

                                                13

   Further, the mixture is then sieved using a stainless steel strainer with about 100 to 200
   mesh screen. The resulting homogenous puree or batter is then spread immediately on
   high-temperature resistant drying sheets using a template with a dimension of about 20
   cm x 20 cm. The dimensions of the drying sheet template can be modified further to 25
 5 cm x 25 cm, 28 cm x 28 cm, or 40 cm x 40 cm, to allow a variety of sizes for different
   applications. The filled drying sheets are then placed in a dryer to dehydrate or dry the
   film at the desired moisture content. A set of mechanical and solar dryers is employed in
   the drying process to save on fuel and energy. The drying process takes about two (2) to
   five (5) hours at a temperature range from 35'C to 85'C, preferably from 48 0 C-65 0 C,
10 most preferably from 50-60'C, until the desired moisture content within the range from
   8% to about 10% is attained. Along with the moisture content, the desired strength,
   flexibility and crispness of the dried films are tested before harvesting of the dried films.
   After drying, the films are then allowed to cool down to a temperature range of about
   18'C to 24'C for about 5-10 minutes. When cooled, the dried films are collected,
15 weighed, packed and sealed properly.
   In the embodiment of this invention, the drying process is afforded careful attention and
   modified with the object of reducing the energy costs during the drying process and
   obtaining the most desirable properties of the coconut film product. Four sources of
20 energy are considered in the drying process, namely: liquefied petroleum gas (LPG),
   electrical heat, solar energy, biomass or other alternative renewable energy source. In
   order to achieve the most desirable properties of the coconut film product, these are
   initially dried at 80-85'C for about 30-60 minutes, then decreased to 70-80'C for about
   30-60 minutes, then 60-70'C for about 30-60 minutes in mechanical dryer with LPG or
25 electrical heat as energy source. Then, the coconut film product is transferred to a solar
   dryer in which the drying temperature is ranging from 45-55'C for about one hour until
   the desired moisture content within the range from 8% to about 10% is attained. Along
   with the moisture content, the desired strength, flexibility and crispness of the dried films
   are tested before harvesting of the dried films. After drying, the films are then allowed to
                                                 14

   cool down to a temperature range of about 18'C to 24'C for about 5-10 minutes. When
   cooled, the dried films are collected, weighed, packed and sealed properly.
   In another embodiment of this invention, a step may be added prior to the drying
 5 operations disclosed above in order to increase the drying capacity and or hasten the
   drying process of the food composition without incurring substantial additional drying
   costs. The provision of a walk-in warm chamber whereby room temperature is set in the
   range from 45-50'C, more preferably 46-49'C, and most preferably at 47-48'C, wherein
   the food compositions spread on drying sheets are arranged and set aside for a few
10 minutes until the ideal moisture content is attained, before the series of post-drying
   operations will start.
   In another embodiment of this invention, the preparation of the coconut film product is
   done by modifying the formula of the mixture of ingredients in such a way as to eliminate
15 the salt, which results to a much healthier coconut film products with higher moisture
   content of about 10-13.5% and water activity of about 0.55 to 0.625 at the same drying
   conditions described above. Thus, to achieve the same moisture content of about or less
   than 10% and water activity of about 0.55, the total drying time of the coconut film
   product without salt, is increased to about 30 minutes.
20
   In another embodiment of the invention, the preparation of the coconut film product is
   modified to increase the protein and fiber contents and reduce the carbohydrate content of
   the final product, by adding fresh egg white into the mixture of coconut puree batter, in a
   range of 4-7% based on the wet formula. Alternatively, powdered egg white or xanthan
25 gum can be used instead of the fresh egg white. The final product is referred to as "high
   protein" and "high-fiber" coconut film or wrap.
   In another embodiment of this invention, the preparation of the coconut film product is
   modified to increase the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) content of the product which
30 results in an increase in good or beneficial fat content of the product. This is implemented
                                                 15

   by doubling the dosage of the unrefined virgin coconut oil added into the coconut puree
   and/or doubling the dosage of the fresh young (macapuno) coconut added into the
   coconut puree or batter. In this modified formula, the ingredients also prevent the
   formation of bubbles of the coconut puree, which leads in the formation of undesirable
 5 holes in the coconut film. The MCTs are known to be anti-fungal and anti-bacterial
   agents. Including this as ingredient in the coconut film also results in a longer shelf life of
   the coconut film product from nine (9) months to about twelve (12) months.
   In another embodiment of the invention, the thickness of the drying sheet template is
10 increased from a range of 1.0-1.5 mm to 1.0-3.0 mm, more specifically to about 1.5 mm
   to 2.5 mm, more specifically to about 2.0 mm, to provide an enhanced stability of the
   coconut film or wrap product itself.
