[TECHNICAL FIELD]
[0002]      The present invention relates to a process cartridge,
an electrophotographic image forming apparatus to which the
process cartridge is detachably mountable, and an
electrophotographic photosensitive drum unit.
[0003]      Examples of the electrophotographic image    forming
apparatus include an electrophotographic copying machine, an
electrophotographic printer    (a laser beam printer, an LED
printer, and so on),    and the like.
[0004]      The process cartridge   is prepared by integrally
assembling an electrophotographic photosensitive member and
process means acting on the electrophotographic photosensitive
member into a unit    (cartridge) and is mounted to and demounted
from a main assembly of the electrophotographic image forming
14522518 1

                                  -  2
   apparatus.    For example, the process cartridge    is prepared by
   integrally assembling the electrophotographic photosensitive
   member and at least one of a developing means, a charging
   means, and a cleaning means as the process means into a
 5 cartridge.    Accordingly, examples of the process cartridge
   include a process cartridge prepared by integrally assembling
   the electrophotographic photosensitive member and three
   process means consisting of the developing means, the charging
   means, and the cleaning means into a cartridge;      a process
10 cartridge prepared by integrally assembling the
   electrophotographic photosensitive member and the charging
   means as the process means   into a cartridge;   and a process
   cartridge prepared by integrally assembling the
   electrophotographic photosensitive member and two process
15 means consisting of the charging means and the cleaning means.
   [00051      The process cartridge   is detachably mountable to an
   apparatus main assembly by a user by himself      (herself).
   Accordingly, maintenance of the apparatus can be performed by
   the user by himself without relying on a service person.         As a
20 result, operability of the maintenance of the
   electrophotographic image forming apparatus.
   [BACKGROUND ART]
   [00061      In a conventional process cartridge, the following
25 constitution for receiving a rotational driving force, for
   rotating a drum shaped electrophotographic photosensitive
   member   (hereinafter referred to as a "photosensitive drum"),
   from an apparatus main assembly is known.
   [0007]      On a main assembly side, a rotatable member for
30 transmitting a driving force of a motor and a non circular
   twisted hole, which is provided at a center portion of the
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                  - 3
   rotatable member and has a cross   section integrally rotatable
   with the rotatable member and provided with a plurality of
   corners, are provided.
   [00081      On a process cartridge side, a non circular twisted
 5 projection, which is provided at one of longitudinal ends       of a
   photosensitive drum and has   a cross section provided with a
   plurality of corners, is provided.
   [00091      When the rotatable member is  rotated in an engaged
   state between the projection and the hole in the case where
10 the process cartridge   is mounted to the apparatus main
   assembly, a rotational   force of the rotatable member is
   transmitted to the photosensitive drum in a state in which an
   attraction force toward the hole is exerted on the projection.
   As  a result, the rotational  force for rotating the
15 photosensitive drum is   transmitted from the apparatus main
   assembly to the photosensitive drum    (U.S. Patent No.
   5,903,803).
   [0010]      Further, a method in which a photosensitive drum is
   rotated by engaging a gear fixed to the photosensitive drum
20 constituting a process cartridge has been known     (U.S. Patent
   No.  4,829,335).
   [0011]      However, in the conventional constitution described
   in U.S.   Patent No. 5,903,803, the rotatable member is    required
   to be moved in a horizontal direction when the process
25 cartridge is mounted to or demounted from the main assembly by
   being moved in a direction substantially perpendicular to an
   axial line of the rotatable member.     That is, the rotatable
   member is required to be horizontally moved by an opening and
   closing operation of a main assembly cover provided to the
30 apparatus main assembly.    By the opening operation of the main
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                 4
assembly cover, the hole is moved apart from the projection.   On
the other hand, by the closing operation of the main assembly
cover, the hole is moved toward the projection so as to be
engaged with the projection.
[0012]      Accordingly, in the conventional process cartridge, a
constitution for moving the rotatable member in a rotational
axis direction by the opening and closing operation of the main
assembly cover is required to be provided to the main assembly.
[0013]      In the constitution described in U.S. Patent No.
4,829,335, without moving the driving gear provided to the main
assembly along the axial line direction thereof, the cartridge
can be mounted to and demounted from the main assembly by being
moved in a direction substantially perpendicular to the axial
line.  However, in this constitution a driving connection
portion between the main assembly and the cartridge is  an
engaging portion between gears, so that it is difficult to
prevent rotation non uniformity of the photosensitive drum.

    (1) Brief description of process cartridge
    [0148]     A process cartridge B to which an embodiment of the
   present invention is applied will be described with reference
   to Figures 1 to 4.     Figure 1 is a sectional view of the
 5 cartridge B.    Figures 2 and 3 are perspective views of the
   cartridge B.    Figure 4 is a sectional view of an
   electrophotographic image forming apparatus main assembly A
    (hereinafter referred to as an "apparatus main assembly A").
   The apparatus main assembly A corresponds to a portion of the
10 electrophotographic image forming apparatus from which the
   cartridge B   is excluded.
    [0149]     Referring to Figures 1 to 3,   the cartridge B
   includes an electrophotographic photosensitive drum 107.        The
   photosensitive drum 107    is rotated by receiving a rotational
15 force from the apparatus main assembly A by a coupling
   mechanism when the cartridge B is mounted in the apparatus
   main assembly A as shown in Figure 4.      The cartridge B is
   mountable to and demountable from the apparatus main assembly
   A by a user.
20  [0150]     A charging roller 108 as a charging means    (process
   means)   is provided in contact with an outer peripheral surface
   of the photosensitive drum 107.      The charging roller 108
   electrically charges the photosensitive drum 107 by voltage
   application from the apparatus main assembly A.      The  charging
25 roller 108 is   rotated by the rotation of the photosensitive
   drum 107.
    [0151]     The cartridge B includes a developing roller 110      as
   a developing means    (process means).   The developing roller 110
   supplies a developer to a developing area of the
30 photosensitive drum 107.     The developing roller 110 develops
   an electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                    -   28
   drum 107 with the developer t.         The developing roller 110
   contains therein a magnet roller         (fixed magnet) 111.    In
   contact with a peripheral surface of the developing roller
   110,  a developing blade 112    is provided.      The developing blade
 5 112 defines an amount of the developer t to be deposited on
   the peripheral surface of the developing roller 110.            The
   developing blade    112 imparts    triboelectric charges to the
   developer t.
   [0152]      The developer t contained in a developer
10 accommodating container 114     is sent to a developing chamber
   113a by rotation of stirring members 115 and 116,         so that the
   developing roller 110    supplied with a voltage is      rotated.      As
   a result, a developer layer to which the electric charges are
   imparted by the developing blade 112         is formed on the surface
15 of the developing roller 110.         The developer t is transferred
   onto the photosensitive drum 107 depending on the latent
   image.    As a result, the latent image is developed.
   [0153]      The developer image formed on the photosensitive
   drum 107   is transferred onto a recording medium 102 by a
20 transfer roller 104.     The recording medium 102      is used for
   forming an image of the developer thereon and, e.g.,           is
   recording paper, label, OHP sheet, and so on
   [0154]      In contact with the outer peripheral       surface of the
   photosensitive drum 107,    an elastic cleaning blade       117a as a
25 cleaning means    (process means) is disposed.       The cleaning
   blade   117a elastically contacts the photosensitive drum 107 at
   its end and removes the developer t remaining on the
   photosensitive drum 107    after the developer image is
   transferred onto the recording medium 102.          The developer t
30 removed from the surface of the photosensitive drum 107 by the
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

                                   -   29
   cleaning blade 117a is    accommodated in a removed developer
   reservoir 117b.
    [0155]      The cartridge B is   integrally constituted by a first
   frame unit 119 and a second frame unit 120.
 5  [0156]      The first frame unit 119 is    constituted by a first
   frame   113 as a part of a cartridge frame Bl.       The first frame
   unit 119 includes the developing roller 110,       the developing
   blade   112,  the developing chamber 113a, the developer
   accommodating container 114,      and the stirring members 115     and
10 116.
    [0157]      The second frame unit 120 is    constituted by a second
   frame   118 as a part of the cartridge     frame Bl.   The second
   frame unit 120 includes the photosensitive drum 107,         the
   cleaning blade 117a, the removed developer reservoir 117b, and
15 the charging roller 108.
    [0158]      The first frame unit 119 and the second frame unit
   120   are rotatably connected with each other by a pin P.         By an
   elastic member 135    (Figure 3) provided between the first and
   second frame units 119 and 120,       the developing roller 110    is
20 pressed against the photosensitive drum 107.
    [0159]      The user attaches  (mounts) the cartridge B to a
   cartridge mounting portion 130a of the apparatus main assembly
   A by gripping a grip.     During the mounting, as described
   later, a driving shaft 180     (Figure 17)   of the apparatus main
25 assembly A and a coupling member 150       (described later) as a
   rotational force transmitting part of the cartridge B are
   connected with each other in synchronism with the mounting
   operation of the cartridge B.       The photosensitive drum 107      or
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

                                   - 30
   the like is rotated by receiving the rotational    force from the
   apparatus main assembly A.
    (2)   Description of electrophotographic image forming
   apparatus
 5 [0160]      With reference to Figure 4,  the electrophotographic
   image forming apparatus using the above described cartridge B
   will be described.
   [0161]      In the following, a laser beam printer will be
   described as an example of the apparatus main assembly A.
10 [0162]      During image formation, the surface of the rotating
   photosensitive drum 107   is electrically charged uniformly by
   the charging roller 108.     Then, the surface of the
   photosensitive drum 107   is  irradiated with laser light,
   depending on image information, emitted from an optical means
15 101   including unshown members such as a laser diode, a
   polygonal mirror, a lens,    and a reflecting mirror.  As a
   result, on the photosensitive drum 107,    an electrostatic
   latent image depending on the image information is formed.
   The latent image   is developed by the above described
20 developing roller 110.
   [0163]      On the other hand, in synchronism with the image
   formation, the recording medium 102 set in a cassette 103a is
   conveyed to a transfer position by a feeding roller 103b and
   conveying roller pairs 103c, 103d and 103e.     At the transfer
25 position, the transfer roller 104    as a transfer means is
   disposed.    To the transfer roller 104,  a voltage is applied.
   As   a result, the developer image formed on the photosensitive
   drum 107   is transferred onto the recording medium 102.
   11849383 1                                              902028D4

                                    - 31
   [0164]      The recording medium 102 onto which the developer
   image is   transferred is   conveyed to a fixing means  105 through
   a guide 103f.     The fixing means   105 includes a driving roller
   105c and a fixing roller 105b containing therein a heater
 5 105a.    To the passing recording medium 102,    heat and pressure
   are applied, so that the developer image is      fixed on the
   recording medium 102.     As a result, on the recording medium
   102,   an image is  formed.   Thereafter, the recording medium 102
   is   conveyed by roller pairs 103g and 103h and discharged on a
10 tray 106.    The above described roller 103b, the conveying
   roller pairs 103c, 103d and 103e, the guide 103f, the roller
   pairs   103g and 103h, and the like constitute a conveying means
   103   for conveying the recording medium 102.
   [0165]      The cartridge mounting portion 130a is    a portion
15  (space) for mounting the cartridge B therein.      In a state in
   which the cartridge B    is positioned in the space, the coupling
   member 150    (described later) of the cartridge B is connected
   with the driving shaft of the apparatus main assembly A.         In
   this embodiment, the mounting of the cartridge B to the
20 mounting portion 130a is referred to as mounting of the
   cartridge B to the apparatus main assembly A.       Further,
   demounting    (removal) of the cartridge B from the mounting
   portion 130b is referred to as demounting of the cartridge B
   from the apparatus main assembly A.
25  (3)   Description of constitution of drum flange
   [0166]      First, a drum flange at a side where the rotational
   force is   transmitted from the apparatus main assembly A to the
   photosensitive drum 107     (hereinafter simply referred to a
   "drive side") will be described with reference to Figure 5.
30 Figure 5(a) is a perspective view of the drum flange at the
   drive side and Figure 5(b) is a sectional view of the drum
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                    -   32
   flange taken along Si    - Si  line shown in Figure 5(a).
   Incidentally, with respect to an axial line direction of the
   photosensitive drum, a side opposite from the drive side is
   referred to as a "non- drive side").
 5 [0167]     A drum flange 151    is formed of a resinous material
   by ejection molding.     Examples of the resinous material may
   include polyacetal, polycarbonate, and so on        A drum shaft 153
   is  formed of a metallic material such as iron,      stainless
   steel, or the like.     Depending on a load torque for rotating
10 the photosensitive drum 107,       it is possible to select
   appropriately the materials for the drum flange 151 and the
   drum shaft  153.   For example, the drum flange 151 may also be
   formed of the metallic material and the drum shaft       153 may
   also be formed of the resinous material.        When both of the
15 drum flange 151 and the drum shaft 153       are formed of the
   resinous material, they can be integrally molded.
   [0168]      The flange 151 is provided with an engaging portion
   151a which engages with an inner surface of the photosensitive
   drum 107,  a gear portion    (helical gear or spur gear) 151c for
20 transmitting a rotational force to the developing roller 110,
   and an engaging portion 151d rotatably supported on a drum
   bearing.   More specifically, as for the flange 151,      the
   engaging portion 151a engages with one end of a cylindrical
   drum 107a as will be described hereinafter.        These are
25 disposed co-axially with a rotation axis Li       of the
   photosensitive drum 107.      And, the drum engaging portion 151a
   has  a cylindrical shape, and a base      151b perpendicular thereto
   is provided.   The base 151b is provided with a drum shaft 153
   outwardly projected with respect to the direction of the axis
30 Li.   This drum shaft   153 is  co-axial with the drum engaging
   portion 151a.    These are fixed so as to be co-axial with the
   rotation axis Li.    As  for the fixing method thereof the press
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                  -  33
   fitting, the bonding, the insert molding, and so on are
   available, and they are selected properly.
   [0169]      The drum shaft 153 comprises the circular column
   portion 153a which has a projection configuration, and is
 5 disposed so as to be co-axially with the rotation axis of the
   photosensitive drum 107.    The drum shaft 153 is provided on
   the end part of the photosensitive drum 107 on the axis Li of
   the photosensitive drum 107.     In addition, the drum shaft 153
   is about 5 -  15mm in diameter in consideration of the
10 material, the load, and the space.      A free end portion 153b of
   the circular column portion 153a has a semi-spherical surface
   configuration so that it can incline smoothly, when an axis of
   a drum coupling member 150 which is a rotating force
   transmitting portion inclines, as will be described in detail
15 hereinafter.   In addition, in order to receive the rotational
   force from the drum coupling member 150, a rotating force
   transmitting pin   (rotating force receiving member    (portion)
   155 are provided on the photosensitive drum 107 side of the
   free end of the drum shaft 153.      The pin 155 is extended in
20 the direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of the
   drum shaft 153.
   [0170]      The pin 155 as the rotational force receiving
   member has a cylindrical shape which has a diameter smaller
   than that of the circular column portion 153a of the drum
25 shaft 153, and is made of the metal or the resin material.
   And, it is fixed by press-fitting, bonding, and so on to the
   drum shaft 153.   And, the pin 155 is fixed in the direction
   which the axis thereof intersects the axis Li of the
   photosensitive drum 107.    Preferably, it is desirable to
30 dispose the axis of the pin 155 so as to pass the center P2 of
   the spherical surface of the free end portion 153b of the drum
   shaft 153  (figure 5 (b)).   Although the free end portion 153b
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                   - 34
   is  the semi-spherical surface configuration actually, the
   center P2   is  the center of a phantom spherical surface that
   the semispherical surface makes the part thereof.       In
   addition, the number of the pins 155 can be selected properly.
 5 In this embodiment, a single pin 155      is used from the
   standpoint of the assembling property and in order to transmit
   driving torque assuredly.     The pin 155 passes said center P2,
   and is through the drum shaft 153.      And, the pin 155   is
   outwardly projected at the positions of the peripheral surface
10 of the drum shaft 153 which are diametrically opposite        (155al,
   155a2).    More particularly, the pin 155 is projected in the
   direction perpendicular to the axis      (axis Li) of the drum
   shaft   153 relative to the drum shaft    153 at the two opposite
   places   (155al, 155a2).   By this,  the drum shaft 153 receives
15 the rotational force from the drum coupling member 150 at the
   two places.     In this embodiment, the pin 155 is mounted to the
   drum shaft   153 in the range of 5mm from the free end of the
   drum shaft   153.   However, this does not limit the present
   invention.
20 [0171]       In addition, a space portion 15le formed by the
   engaging portion 151d and the base 151b receives a part of
   drum coupling member 150,    in mounting the drum coupling member
   150  (which will be described hereinafter) to the flange 151.
   [0172]       In this embodiment, the gear portion 151a for
25 transmitting the rotational    force to the developing roller 110
   is mounted to the flange 151.      However, the rotation of the
   developing roller 110 may be transmitted not through the
   flange 151.     In that case, the gear portion 151c is
   unnecessary.     However, in the case of disposing the gear
30 portion 151a at the flange 151,     integral molding, with the
   flange 151,    of the gear portion 151a can be utilized.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                  - 35
   [0173]       The flange 151, the drum shaft 153, and the pin 155
   function as the rotational force receiving member which
   receives the rotational force from the drum coupling member
   150 as will be described hereinafter.

   drum unit
   [0174]      Referring to Figure 6 and Figure 7, the structure of
   an electrophotographic photosensitive member drum unit     ("drum
10 unit") will be described.    Figure 6 (a) is a perspective view,
   as seen from the driving side, of the drum unit Ul,   and Figure
   6(b) is a perspective view as seen from the non-driving side.
   In addition, Figure 7 is a sectional view taken along S2-S2 of
   Figure 6 (a).

   107a coated with a photosensitive layer 107b on the peripheral
   surface.
   [0176]      The cylindrical drum 107a has an electroconductive
   cylinder, such as the aluminum, and the photosensitive layer
20 107b applied thereon.    The opposite ends thereof are provided
   with the drum surface and the substantially co-axial opening
   107al,   107a2, in order to engage the drum flange (151, 152).
   More particularly, the drum shaft 153 is provided on the end
   part of the cylindrical drum 107a co-axially with the
25 cylindrical drum 107a.    Designated by 151c is a gear and
   transmits a rotational force which the coupling 150 received
   from a drive shaft 180 to a developing roller 110.    The gear
   151c is integrally molded with the flange 15.
   [0177]      The cylinder 107a may be hollow or solid.
   11849383 1                                             902028D4

                                  -  36
   [0178]     As to the drum flange 151 of the driving side, since
   it has been described in the foregoing, the description is
   omitted.
   [0179]     A drum flange 152 of the non-driving side is made of
 5 the resin material similarly to the driving side with
   injection molding.   And, a drum engaging portion 152b and a
   bearing portion 152a are substantially co-axially disposed
   with each other.   In addition, the flange 152 is provided with
   a drum grounding plate 156.     The drum grounding plate 156 is
10 an electroconductive thin plate      (metal). The drum grounding
   plate 156 includes contact portions 156bl, 156b2 which contact
   the inner surface of the electroconductive cylindrical drum
   107a, and a contact portion 156a which contacts the drum
   grounding shaft 154   (which will be described hereinafter).
15 And, for the purpose of grounding the photosensitive drum 107,
   the drum grounding plate 156 is electrically connected with
   the apparatus main assembly A.
   [0180]     A drum flange 152 of the non-driving side is made of
   the resin material, similarly to the driving side with
20 injection molding.   And, a drum engaging portion 152b and a
   bearing portion 152a are substantially co-axially disposed
   with each other.   In addition, the flange 152 is provided with
   a drum grounding plate 156.     The drum grounding plate 156 is
   an electroconductive thin plate      (metal). The drum grounding
25 plate 156 includes contact portions 156bl, 156b2 which contact
   the inner surface of the electroconductive cylindrical drum
   107a, and a contact portion 156a which contacts the drum
   grounding shaft 154   (which will be described hereinafter).
   And, for the purpose of grounding the photosensitive drum 107,
30 the drum grounding plate 156 is electrically connected with
   the apparatus main assembly A.

                                  -   37
   [0181]     Although it has been described that the drum
   grounding plate  156 is provided in the flange 152,       the present
   invention is not  limited to such an example.       For example, the
   drum grounding plate  156 may be disposed at the drum flange
 5 151,  and it is possible to select properly the position which
   can be connected with the ground.
   [0182]     Thus, the drum unit Ul     comprises the photosensitive
   drum 107 which has  the cylinder 107a, the flange 151,        the
   flange 152,  the drum shaft  153, the pin 155,     and the drum
10 grounding plate  156.
    (5) Rotational force transmitting portion     (drum coupling
   member)
   [0183]     The description will be made, referring to Figure 8
15 as to an example of the drum coupling member which is         the
   rotational force transmitting portion.       Figure 8   (a) is a
   perspective view, as seen from the apparatus main assembly
   side, of the drum coupling member, Figure 8       (b) is a
   perspective view, as seen from the photosensitive drum side,
20 of the drum coupling member, and Figure 8      (c) is   a view seen
   in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the
   coupling rotation shaft L2.      In addition, Figure 8     (d) is  the
   side view, as seen from the apparatus main assembly side, of
   the drum coupling member, Figure 8      (e) is the Figure, as seen
25 from the photosensitive drum side, and Figure 8        (f) is a
   sectional view taken along S3 in Figure 8      (d).
   [0184]     The drum coupling member     ("coupling") 150 engages
   with a drive shaft 180   (Figure 17)    of the apparatus main
   assembly A in the state where the cartridge B is mounted set
30 to the installation section 130a.       In addition, the coupling
   150  is disengaged from the drive shaft 180,     when the cartridge
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

                                 - 38
   B is taken out from the apparatus main assembly A.      And, the
   coupling 150 receives a rotational force from a motor provided
   in the apparatus main assembly A through the drive shaft 180
   in the state where it is engaged with the drive shaft 180.         In
 5 addition, the coupling 150 transmits the rotational force
   thereof to the photosensitive drum 107.    The materials
   available for the coupling 150 are the resin materials, such
   as polyacetal and the polycarbonate PPS.     However, in order to
   raise a rigidity of the coupling 150,   the glass fibers, the
10 carbon fibers, and so on may be mixed in the above described
   resin material correspondingly to a required load torque.         In
   the case of mixing said material, the rigidity of the coupling
   150 can be raised.   In addition, in the resin material, the
   metal may be inserted, then the rigidity may further be
15 raised, and the whole coupling may be manufactured from the
   metal and so on.
   [0185]     The coupling 150 mainly comprises three portions.
   [0186]     The first portion is engageable with the drive shaft
   180  (which will be described hereinafter),    and it is a
20 coupling side driven portion 150a for receiving the rotational
   force from the rotational force transmitting pin 182 which is
   a rotational force applying portion   (main assembly side
   rotational force transmitting portion) provided on the drive
   shaft 180.   In addition, the second portion is engageable with
25 the pin 155, and it is a coupling side driving portion 150b
   for transmitting the rotational force to the drum shaft 153.
   In addition, the third portion is a connecting portion 150c
   for connecting the driven portion 150a and the driving portion
   150b with each other   (Figure 8 (c) and (f)).
30 [0187]     The driven portion 150a, the driving portion 150b,
   and the connecting portion 150c may be molded integrally, or,
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                  - 39
   alternatively, the separate parts may be connected with each
   other.    In this embodiment, these are integrally molded with
   resin material.    By this, the manufacturing of the coupling
   150 is easy and the accuracy as the parts is high.     As shown
 5 in Figure 8(f) the driven portion 150a is provided with a
   drive shaft insertion opening portion 150m which expands
   toward the rotation axis L2 of the coupling 150.     The driving
   portion 150b has a drum shaft insertion opening portion 1501.
   which expands toward the rotation axis L2.
10 [0188]      The opening 150m has a conical driving shaft
   receiving surface 150f as an expanded part which expands
   toward the drive shaft 180 side in the state where the
   coupling 150 is mounted to the apparatus main assembly A.        The
   receiving surface 150f constitutes a recess 150z as shown in
15 Figure 8 (f).    The recess 150z includes the opening 150m at a
   position opposite the side adjacent the photosensitive drum
   107 with respect to the direction of the axis L2.
   [0189]      By this, regardless of rotation phase of the
   photosensitive drum 107 in the cartridge B, the coupling 150
20 can pivot among a rotational force transmitting angular
   position, a pre-engagement angular position, and a disengaging
   angular position relative to the axis Li of the photosensitive
   drum 107 without being prevented by the free end portion of
   the drive shaft 180.    The rotational force transmitting
25 angular position, the pre-engagement angular position, and the
   disengaging angular position will be described hereinafter.
   [0190]      A plurality of projections  (the engaging portions)
   150dl -   150d4 are provided at equal intervals on a
   circumference about the axis L2 on an end surface of the
30 recess 150z.    Between the adjacent projections 150d 1, 150d 2,
   150d3,   150d4, the standing-by portions 150k1,  150k2, 150k3,
   11849383 1                                              902028D4

                                      -    40
   150k4      are provided.   An intervals between the adjacent
   projections      150dl - 150d4  is   larger   than the outer diameter       of
   the pin 182,      so that the rotational force       transmitting pins of
   the drive shaft      180 provided in the apparatus main assembly A
 5  (rotational force applying portions) 182 are received.               The
   recesses between the adjacent projections are the standing-by
   portions 150kl-k4.       When the rotational force is         transmitted
   to the coupling 150 from the drive shaft            180,  the transmission
   pins 182al,      182a2 are received by any of the standing-by
10 portions 150kl-k4.       In addition, in Figure 8        (d),  the
   rotational force reception surfaces            (rotational force
   receiving portions) 150e       crossing with a rotational direction
   of the coupling 150 and       (150el-150e4) are provided in the
   downstream with respect to the clockwise direction               (Xl) of
15 each projection      150d.   More particularly, the projection          150dl
   has     a receiving surface 150el,       the projection   150d2 has a
   receiving surface 150e2,       the projection 150d3 has a receiving
   surface 150e3,      and, and, a projection 150d4 has         a receiving
   surface 150e4.       In the state where the drive shaft         180
20 rotates, the pin 182al,       182a2 contacts to any of the receiving
   surface 150el-150e4.        By doing so,     the receiving surface 150e
   contacted by the pin 182al,        182a2 is pushed by the pin 182.
   By this, the coupling 150 rotates about the axis L2.                The
   receiving surface 150el-150e4 is extended in the direction
25 crossing with the rotational direction of the coupling 150.
    [0191]        In order to stabilize the running torque transmitted
   to the coupling 150 as much as possible, it is desirable to
   dispose the rotational       force receiving surfaces 150e         on the
   same circumference that has        the center on the axis L2.         By
30 this, the rotational force transmission radius is constant and
   the running torque transmitted to the coupling 150 is
   stabilized.       In addition, as for the projections 150d1-150d4,
   it is preferable that the position of the by coupling 150                is
   11849383 1                                                        902028D4

                                     - 41
   stabilized by the balance of the forces which the coupling
   receives.     For that reason, in this embodiment, the receiving
   surfaces 150e    are disposed at the diametrically opposed
   positions    (180 degrees).   More particularly, in this
 5 embodiment, the receiving surface 150el and the receiving
   surface 150e3 are diametrically opposed relative to each
   other, and the receiving surface 150e2 and the surface 150e4
   are diametrically opposed relative to each other        (Figure 8
    (d)).  By this arrangement, the forces which the coupling 150
10 receives constitute a force couple.        Therefore, the coupling
   150  can continue rotary motion only by receiving the force
   couple.    For this reason, the coupling 150     can rotate without
   the necessity of being specified in the position of the
   rotation axis L2 thereof.       In addition, as for the number
15 thereof, as long as the pins 182       of the drive shaft  180   (the
   rotational force applying portion) can enter the standing-by
   portions 150k1-150k2,     it is possible to select suitably.       In
   this embodiment, as shown in Figure 8 the four receiving
   surfaces are provided.      This embodiment is not   limited to this
20 example.    For example,   the receiving surfaces 150e
    (projections 150d1-150d4) do not need to be disposed on the
   same circumference     (the phantom circle Cl   and Figure 8 (d)).
   Or, it is not necessary to dispose at the diametrically
   opposed positions.      However, the effects described above can
25 be provided by disposing the receiving surfaces 150e         as
   described above.
   [0192]      Here, in this embodiment, the diameter of the pin is
   approximately 2 mm, and a circumferential length of the stand
   by portion 150k is    approximately 8 mm.     The circumferential
30 length of the stand-by portion 150k is       an interval between
   adjacent projections     150d  (on the phantom circle).    The
   dimensions are not limiting to the present invention.
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

                                   -   42
   [0193]      Similarly to the opening 150m, a drum shaft
   insertion opening portion 1501 has a conical rotational force
   receiving surface 150i    of an as an expanded part which expands
   toward the drum shaft    153 in the state where it is mounted to
 5 the cartridge B.     The receiving surface 150i     constitutes a
   recess 150q, as shown in Figure 8       (f).
   [0194]      By this, irrespective of the rotation phase of the
   photosensitive drum 107    in the cartridge B,     the coupling 150
   can pivot among a rotational force transmitting angular
10 position, a pre-engagement angular position, and a disengaging
   angular position to the drum axis Li        without being prevented
   by the free end portion of the drum shaft        153.  The recess
   150q is   constituted in the illustrated example by a conical
   receiving surface 150i which it has centering on the axis L2.
15 The standby openings    150g 1 or 150g2     ("opening") are provided
   in the receiving surface 150i       (Figure 8b).   As for the
   coupling 150,    the pins 155 can be inserted into the inside of
   this opening 150g    1 or 150g2 so that     it may be mounted to the
   drum shaft   153.   And, the size of the openings 150g     1 or 150g2
20 is  larger than the outer diameter of the pin 155.        By doing
   so,  irrespective of the rotation phase of the photosensitive
   drum 107   in the cartridge B,    the coupling 150 is pivotable
   among the rotational force transmitting angular position and
   the pre-engagement angular position        (or disengaging angular
25 position) as will be described hereinafter without being
   prevented by the pin 155.
   [0195]       More particularly, the projection 150d is provided
   adjacent to the free end of the recess 150z. And, the
   projections    (projections) 150d project in the intersection
30 direction crossing with the rotational direction in which the
   coupling 150    rotates, and are provided with the intervals
   along the rotational direction. And, in the state where the
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

                                   - 43
   cartridge B   is mounted to the apparatus main assembly A,    the
   receiving surfaces 150e engage to or abutted to the pin 182,
   and are pushed by the pin 182.
   [0196]       By this, the receiving surfaces 150e  receive the
 5 rotational force   from the drive shaft 180.  In addition, the
   receiving surfaces 150e    are disposed in equidistant from the
   axis L2,   and constitute a pair interposing the axis L2 they
   are constituted by the surface in the intersection direction
   in the projections 150d. In addition, the standing-by portions
10  (recesses) 150k are provided along the rotational direction,
   and they are depressed in the direction of the axis L2.
   [0197]       The standing-by portion 150k is  formed as a space
   between the adjacent projections     150d. In the state where the
   cartridge B   is mounted to the apparatus main assembly A,    the
15 pin 182 enters the standing-by portion 150k, and it stands by
   for being driven. And, when the drive shaft 180    rotates, the
   pin 182 pushes the receiving surface 150e.
   [0198]       By this, the coupling 150 rotates.
   [0199]       The rotational force receiving surface   (rotational
20 force receiving member    (portion)) 150e may be disposed inside
   of the driving shaft receiving surface 150f.     Or, the
   receiving surface 150e may be provided in the portion
   outwardly projected from the receiving surface 150f with
   respect to the direction of the axis L2.     When the receiving
25 surface 150e   is disposed inside of the receiving surface 150f,
   the standing-by portion 150k is disposed inside of the
   receiving surface 150f
   [0200]      More particularly, the standing-by portion 150k is
   the recess provided between the projections 150d in the inside
   11849383 1                                              902028D4

                                   -  44
   of the arc part of the receiving surface 150f. In addition,
   when the receiving surface 150e      is disposed at the position
   which outwardly projects, the standing-by portion 150k is        the
   recess positioned between the projections      150d.  Here,  the
 5 recess may be a through hole extended in the direction of the
   axis L2,   or it may be closed at one end thereof.     More
   particularly, the recess is provided by the space region
   provided between the projection      150d.  And, what is necessary
   is  just to be able to enter the pin 182 into the region in the
10 state where the cartridge B is mounted to the apparatus main
   assembly A.
   [0201]       These structures of the standing-by portion apply
   similarly to the embodiments as will be described hereinafter.
   [0202]      In Figure 8(e),  the rotational force transmission
15 surfaces   (the rotational force transmitting portions) 150h and
    (150h 1 or 150h2)   are provided in the upstream, with respect
   to the clockwise direction     (Xl),  of the opening 150g  1 or
   150g2.    And, the rotational   force is transmitted to the
   photosensitive drum 107    from the coupling 150 by the
20 convection sections 150h 1 or 150h2 contacting to any of the
   pins 155al,   155a2.   More particularly, the transmitting
   surfaces 150h 1 or 150h2 push the side surface of the pin 155.
   By this, the coupling 150 rotates with the center thereof
   aligned with the axis L2.     The transmitting surface 150h 1 or
25 150h2  is extended in the direction crossing with the
   rotational direction of the coupling 150.
   [0203]      Similarly to the projection 150d, it is desirable to
   dispose the transmitting surfaces 150h 1 or 150h2
   diametrically opposed relative to each other on the same
30 circumference.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                   -  45
   [0204]     At the time of manufacturing the drum coupling
   member 150 with an injection molding, the connecting portion
   150c may become thin.    This  is because the coupling is
   manufactured so that the driving force receiving portion 150a,
 5 the driving portion 150b and the connecting portion 150c have
   a substantially uniform thickness.       When the rigidity of the
   connecting portion 150c is    insufficient, therefore,    it is
   possible to make the connecting portion 150c thick so that
   driven portion 150a, the driving portion 150b, and the
10 connecting portion 150c have the substantially equivalent
   thickness.
    (6) drum bearing member
   [0205]     The description will be made, referring to Figure 9,
15 about a drum bearing member.      Figure 9   (a) is a perspective
   view, as seen from a drive shaft side, and Figure 9        (b) is   a
   perspective view, as seen from the photosensitive drum side.
   [0206]     The drum bearing member 157     rotatably supports the
   photosensitive drum 107   on the second frame 118.      In addition,
20 the bearing member 157 has a function of positioning the
   second frame unit 120  in the apparatus main assembly A.
   Further, it has the function of retaining the coupling 150          so
   that the rotational force can be transmitted to the
   photosensitive drum 107.
25 [0207]     As shown in Figure 9 an engaging portion 157d
   positioned to the second frame      118 and a peripheral part 157c
   positioned in the apparatus main assembly A are substantially
   co-axially disposed.   The engaging portion 157d and the
   peripheral part  157c are annular.      And, the coupling 150    is
30 disposed in the space portion 157b inside thereof.        The
   engaging portion 157d and the peripheral part       157c are
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                     -  46
   provided with a rib 157e for retaining the coupling 150 in the
   cartridge B    in the neighborhood of the central portion with
   respect to the axial direction.         The bearing member 157 is
   provided with holes 157g 1 or 157g2 which penetrate the
 5 abutment surface 157f and the fixing screw for fixing the
   bearing member 157     to the second frame 118.       As will be
   described hereinafter,      the guide portion 157a for mounting and
   demounting on and the cartridge B relative to the apparatus
   main assembly A is     integrally provided on the bearing member
10 157.
    (7) Coupling mounting method
   [0208]      Referring to Figure 10      -  Figure 16,  the description
   will be made as to the mounting method of the coupling.
15 Figure 10    (a) is an enlarged view, as seen from the driving
   side surface, of the major part around the photosensitive
   drum.   Figure 10    (b) is  an enlarged view, as seen from the
   non-driving side surface, of the major part.           Figure 10    (c) is
   a sectional view taken along S4-S4 of Figure 10           (a).   Figure
20 11  (a) and   (b) are an exploded perspective views which
   illustrate the state before attachment of the primary members
   of the second frame unit.       Figure 11    (c) is a sectional view
   taken along S5-S5 in Figure 11        (a).   Figure 12  is a sectional
   view which illustrates      a state after attaching.       Figure 13 is
25 a sectional view taken along S6-S6 of Figure 11           (a).   Figure
   14  is a sectional view which illustrates a state after
   rotating the coupling and the photosensitive drum through 90
   degrees from the state of Figure 13.          Figure 15  is a
   perspective view which illustrates the combined state of the
30 drum shaft and the coupling.        Figure 15(al)-(a5) are front
   views, as seen from the axial direction of the photosensitive
   drum, and Figure 15(bl)-(b5) are perspective views.             Figure 16
   11849383 1                                                     902028D4

                                     - 47
   is  a perspective view which illustrates the state where the
   coupling is     inclined in the process cartridge.
   [0209]       As  shown in Figure 15 the coupling 150         is mounted so
   that the axis L2 thereof can incline in any direction relative
 5 to the axis Li     of the drum shaft 153     (coaxial with the
   photosensitive drum 107).
   [0210]       In Figure 15   (al) and Figure 15     (b1),    the axis L2 of
   the coupling 150      is co-axial with the axis Li       of the drum
   shaft   153.    The state when the coupling 150       is  inclined upward
10 from this state is      illustrated in Figure 15      (a2)   and  (b2).   As
   shown in this Figure, when the coupling 150           is  inclined toward
   the opening 150g      side, the opening 150g moves along the pin
   155.   As  a result, the coupling 150 is       inclined about an axis
   AX perpendicular to the axis of the pin 155.
15 [0211]       In Figure 15   (a3) and   (b3),  the state where the
   coupling 150     is inclined rightward is     shown.     As  shown in this
   Figure, when the coupling 150 inclines in the orthogonality
   direction of the opening 150g, the opening 150g             rotates about
   the pin 155.      The  axis of rotation is    the axis    line AY of the
20 pin 155.
   [0212]       The state where the coupling 150       is inclined
   downward is     shown in Figure 15   (a4) and    (b4),   and the state
   where the coupling 150      is inclined leftward is       shown in Figure
   15  (a5) and    (b5).   The rotation axes AX and AY have been
25 described in the foregoing.
   [0213]       In the directions different from the inclining
   direction described in the foregoing, for example, in the 45
   degree direction in Figure 15       (al) and so on, the inclination
   is made by combining the rotations in the axes AX and the
   11849383 1                                                       902028D4

                                    - 48
   directions of AY.     Thus,  the axis L2 can be pivoted in any
   direction relative to the axis Li.
   [0214]       More particularly, the transmitting surface
    (rotational force transmitting portion) 150h is movable
 5 relative to the pin     (rotational force receiving portion) 155.
   The pin 155 has the transmitting surface 150 in the movable
   condition.    And, the transmitting surface 150h and the pin 155
   are engaged to each other in the rotational direction of the
   coupling 150.   In this manner, the coupling 150    is mounted to
10 the cartridge.     In order to accomplish this, the gap is
   provided between the transmitting surface 150h and the pin
   155.   By this, the coupling 150     is pivotable in all directions
   substantially relative to the axis Li.
   [0215]      As described above, the opening 150g    is extended in
15 the direction    (the rotational axis direction of the coupling
   150)  crossing with the projection direction of the pins       155 at
   least.    Therefore, as has been described hereinbefore, the
   coupling 150   is pivotable in all the directions.
   [0216]      It has been mentioned that the axis L2 is    slantable
20 or inclinable in any direction relative to the axis Li.
   However, the axis L2 does not necessarily need to be linearly
   slantable to the predetermined angle in the full range of 360
   degree direction in the coupling 150.       For example, the
   opening 150g   can be selected to be slightly wider in the
25 circumferential direction.      By doing so, the time of the axis
   L2 inclining relative to the axis Li,      even if it is the case
   where it cannot incline to the predetermined angle linearly,
   the coupling 150 can rotate to a slight degree around the axis
   L2.   Therefore, it can be inclined to the predetermined angle.
30 In other words, the amount of the play in the rotational
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                   -  49
   direction of the opening 150g     is  selected properly if
   necessary.
   [0217]     In this manner, the coupling 150     is revolvable or
   swingable over the full-circumference substantially relative
 5 to drum shaft   (rotational force receiving member) 153.        More
   particularly, the coupling 150 is pivotable over the full
   circumference thereof substantially relative to the drum shaft
   153.
   [0218]     Furthermore, as will be understood from the
10 foregoing explanation, the coupling 150 is      capable of whirling
   in and substantially over the circumferential direction of the
   drum shaft  153.   Here, the whirling motion is not a motion
   with which the coupling itself rotates about the axis L2,          but
   the inclined axis L2 rotates about the axis Li        of the
15 photosensitive drum, although the whirling here does not
   preclude the rotation of the coupling per se about the axis L2
   of the coupling 150.
   [0219]     The process of the assembling the parts will be
   described.
20 [0220]     First, the photosensitive drum 107 is mounted in the
   direction Xl  in Figure 11   (a) and Figure 11    (b).   At this
   time, the bearing portion 151d of the flange 151        is made to
   substantially co-axially engage with the centering portion
   118h of the second frame 118.       In addition, bearing hole 152a
25  (Figure 7 of the flange 152   (a))   is substantially co-axially
   engaged with the centering portion 118g of the second frame
   118.
   [0221]     The drum grounding shaft 154     is inserted into the
   direction X2.    And, the centering portion 154b is penetrated
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

                                     -   50
   through the bearing hole 152a        (Figure 6b)  and the centering
   hole 118g    (Figure 10  (b)).   At this time, the centering
   portion 154b and the bearing hole 152a are supported so that
   the photosensitive drum 107      is rotatable.     On the other hand,
 5 the centering portion 154b and the centering hole 118g are
   supported fixedly by the press-fitting and so on.          By this,
   the photosensitive drum 107      is rotatably supported relative to
   the second frame.     Alternatively, it may be fixed non
   rotatably relative to the flange 152,         and the drum grounding
10 shaft   154  (centering portion 154b) may be rotatably mounted to
   the second frame    118.
   [0222]      The coupling 150 and the bearing member 157        are
   inserted in the direction X3.          First, the driving portion 150b
   is  inserted toward the direction X3 downstream, while
15 maintaining the axis L2      (Figure 11c)    in parallel with X3.     At
   this time, the phase of the pin 155 and the phase of the
   opening 150g    are matched with each other, and the pin 155        is
   made inserted into the openings 150g         1 or 150g2.  And, the
   free end portion 153b of the drum shaft 153         is abutted to the
20 drum bearing surface 150i.       The    free end portion 153b is the
   spherical surface and the drum bearing surface 150i         is a conic
   surface.    That is,  the drum bearing surface 150i      of the conic
   surface which is the recess,        and the free end portion 153b of
   the drum shaft 153 which is      the projection contact to each
25 other.    Therefore, the driving portion 150b side is positioned
   relative to the free end portion 153b.          As has been described
   hereinbefore, when the coupling 150 rotates by the
   transmission of the rotational force         from the apparatus main
   assembly A,    the pin 155 positioned in the opening 150g will be
30 pushed by the rotational force transmission surfaces          (the
   rotational force transmitting portions) 150h 1 or 150h2 and
    (Figure 8b).    By this,  the rotational     force is transmitted to
   the photosensitive drum 107.         Thereafter, the engaging portion
   11849383 1                                                   902028D4

                                   -  51
   157d is   inserted downstream with respect to the direction X3.
   By this, a part of coupling 150      is received in the space
   portion 157b.    And, the engaging portion 157d supports the
   bearing portion 151d of the flange 151,      so that the
 5 photosensitive drum 107    is rotatable.    In addition, the
   engaging portion 157d engages with the centering portion 118h
   of the second frame 118.     The abutment surface 157f of the
   bearing member 157   abuts to the abutment surface 118j      of the
   second frame 118.    And, the screws 158a,    158b are penetrated
10 through the holes 157g 1 or 157g2,      and they are fixed to the
   screw holes 118k1,   118k2  of the second frame 118,    so that the
   bearing member 157   is fixed to the second frame 118      (Figure
   12).
   [0223]      The dimensions of the various portions of the
15 coupling 150 will be described.       As shown in Figure 11    (c),   a
   maximum outer diameter of the driven portion 150a is TD2,          a
   maximum outer diameter of the driving portion 150b is TD1,           and
   a small diameter of the standby opening 150g is TD3.         In
   addition, a maximum outer diameter of the pin 155 is TD5, and
20 an inner diameter of the retention rib 157e of the bearing
   member 157 is TD4.    Here, the maximum outer diameter is the
   outer diameter of a maximum rotation locus about the axis Li
   or the axis L2.    At this time,    since TD5 < TD3  is satisfied,
   the coupling 150 can be assembled to the predetermined
25 position by the straight mounting operation in the direction
   X3  therefore, the assembling property is high      (the state after
   the assembly is shown in Figure 12).       The diameter of the
   inner surface TD4   of the retention rib 157e of the bearing
   member 157 is larger than TD2 of the coupling 150, and smaller
30 than @D1   (@D2 < TD4 < TD1) .   By this,  just the step attached
   to the direction X3 straight is      sufficient to assemble the
   bearing member 157   to the predetermined position.      For this
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                 -   52
   reason, the assembling property can be improved       (the state
   after the assembly is  shown in Figure 12).
   [0224]     As shown in Figure 12,    the retention rib   157e of the
   bearing member 157  is disposed closely to a flange portion
 5 150j  of the coupling 150 in the direction of the axis Li.
   More specifically, in the direction of the axis Li,       the
   distance from an end surface 150jl     of the flange portion 150j
   to the axis L4 of the pin 155 is ni.      In addition, the
   distance from an end surface 157el of the rib      157e to the
10 other end surface 157j2  of the flange portion 150j      is n2.     The
   distance n2< distance nl is   satisfied.
   [0225]     In addition, with respect to the direction
   perpendicular to the axis Li,    the flange portion 150j     and the
   rib 157e are disposed so that they are overlapped relative to
15 each other.   More specifically, the distance n4 from the inner
   surface 157e3 of the rib 157e to the outer surface 150j3 of
   the flange portion 150j  is the overlap amount n4 with respect
   to the orthogonality direction of the axis Li.
   [0226]     By such settings, the pin 155 is prevented from
20 disengaging from the opening 150g.      That is,  the movement of
   the coupling 150  is limited by the bearing member 157.        Thus,
   the coupling 150 does not disengage from the cartridge.          The
   prevention of disengagement can be accomplished without
   additional parts.   The dimensions described above are
25 desirable from the standpoint of reduction of manufacturing
   and assembling costs.   However, the present invention is not
   limited to these dimensions.
   [0227]     As described above   (Figure 10   (c) and Figure 13),
   the receiving surface 150i which is the recess 150q of the
30 coupling 150  is in contact with the free end surface 153b of
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                   - 53
   the drum shaft 153 which is the projection.        Therefore, the
   coupling 150 is swung along the free end portion       (the
   spherical surface) 153b about the center P2 of the free end
   portion    (the spherical surface) 153b in other words, the axis
 5 L2 is pivotable substantially in all directions irrespective
   of the phase of the drum shaft 153.        The axis L2 of the
   coupling 150 is pivotable in all directions substantially.          As
   will be described hereinafter, in order that the coupling 150
   may engage with the drive shaft 180, the axis L2 is inclined
10 toward the downstream with respect to the mounting direction
   of the cartridge B relative to the axis Li,       just before the
   engagement.     In other words, as shown in Figure 16, the axis
   L2 inclines so that the driven portion 150a positions at the
   downstream side with respect to the mounting direction X4
15 relative to the axis Li of the photosensitive drum 107         (the
   drum shaft 153).     In Figures 16   (a)-(c), although the
   positions of the driven portion 150a slightly differ relative
   to each other, they are positioned at the downstream side with
   respect to the mounting direction X4 in any case.
20 [0228]       The still more detailed description will be made.
   [0229]       As shown in Figure 12,   a distance n3 between a
   maximum outer diameter part and bearing member 157 of the
   driving portion 150b is selected so that a slight gap is
   provided between them.     By this, as has been described
25 hereinbefore, the coupling 150 is pivotable.
   [0230]       As shown in Figure 9, the rib 157e is a semi
   circular rib.     The rib 157e is disposed at the downstream with
   respect to the mounting direction X4 of the cartridge B.
   Therefore, as shown in Figure 10      (c),  the driven portion 150a
30 side of the axis L2 is greatly pivotable in the direction X4.
   In other words, the driving portion 150b side of the axis L2
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                  - 54
   is greatly pivotable in the direction of angle a3) at phase
    (Figure 9(a)  at which the rib 157e is not disposed.      Figure 10
    (c) illustrates the state where the axis L2 inclined.       In
   addition, it can also be pivoted to the state substantially
 5 parallel to the axis Li by which it is     shown in Figure 13     from
   the state of the inclined axis L2 shown in Figure 10       (c).    In
   this manner, the rib   157e is disposed.    By this, the coupling
   150  can be mounted by the simple method to the cartridge B.
   Further, in addition, no matter the drum shaft      153 may stop
10 with what phase, the axis L2 is pivotable relative to the axis
   L1.   The rib is not limited to the semi-circular rib.       As   long
   as the coupling 150 is pivotable to the predetermined
   direction, and it is possible to mount the coupling 150 to
   Cartridge B   (photosensitive drum 107),   any rib is usable.      In
15 this manner, the rib   157e has a function as the regulating
   means for regulating the inclining direction of the coupling
   150.
   [0231]     In addition, a distance n2    (Figure 12)  in the
   direction of the axis Li   from the rib 157e to the flange
20 portion 150j   is shorter than a distance ni   from the center of
   the pin 155 to the driving portion 150b side edge.       By this,
   the pin 155 does not disengage from the opening 150g.
   [0232]     As described above, the coupling 150     is supported by
   the both of the drum shaft   153 and the drum bearing 157
25 substantially.    More particularly, the coupling 150    is mounted
   to the cartridge B by the drum shaft    153 and the drum bearing
   157  substantially.
   [0233]     The coupling 150 has a play    (the distance n2)    in the
   direction of the axis Li   relative to the drum shaft    153.
30 Therefore, the receiving surface 150i     (the conic surface) may
   not contact snuggly the drum shaft free end portion 153b         (the
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                     - 55
   spherical surface).       In other words, the center of the
   pivoting may deviate from the center of curvature P2 of the
   spherical surface.       However, even in such a case, the axis L2
   is pivotable relative to the axis Li.         For this reason, the
 5 purpose of this embodiment can be accomplished.
   [0234]       In addition, maximum possible inclination angle a4
    (Figure 10    (c))  between the axis Li and the axis L2 is the one
   half of the taper angle (al, Figure 8 (f))       between the axis L2
   and the receiving surface 150i.        The receiving surface 150i
10 has conical shape and the drum shaft 153 has the cylindrical
   shape.     For this reason, the gap g of angle a1/2 is provided
   between them.       By this, the taper angle a 1 changes, and
   therefore, the inclination angle a 4 of the coupling 150 are
   set to the optimal value.       In this manner, since the receiving
15 surface 150i is the conic surface, the circular column portion
   153a of the drum shaft 153 is satisfactory with the simple
   cylindrical shape.       In other words, the drum shaft does not
   need to have a complicated configuration.         Therefore, the
   machining cost of the drum shaft can be suppressed.
20 [0235]       In addition, as shown in Figure 10      (c), when the
   coupling 150 inclines, a part of coupling can circumvent into
   illustration) by space portion 15le        (hatching of the flange
   151.    By this, the lightening cavity (Space portion 151e) of
   the gear portion 151c can be used without futility.
25 Therefore, effective use of the space can be done.
   Incidentally, the lightening cavity (Space portion 151e) is
   not usually used.
   [0236]       As described above, in the embodiment of Figure 10
    (c), the coupling 150 is mounted so that a part of a coupling
30 150 may locate at the position which overlaps the gear portion
   151c with respect to the direction of the axis L2.          In the
   11849383  1                                                  902028D4

                                  - 56
   case of the flange which does not have the gear portion 151c,
   a part of coupling 150 can further enter into the cylinder
   107a.
   [0237]      When the axis L2 inclines, the width of the opening
 5 150g is selected in consideration of the size of the pin 155
   so that the pin 155 may not interfere.
   [0238]      More particularly, the transmitting surface
    (rotational force transmitting portion) 150h is movable
   relative to the pin   (rotational force receiving portion) 155.
10 The pin 155 has the transmitting surface 150 in the movable
   condition.   And, the transmitting surface 150h and the pin 155
   are engaged to each other in the rotational direction of the
   coupling 150.   In this manner, the coupling 150 is mounted to
   the cartridge.   In order to accomplish this, the gap is
15 provided between the transmitting surface 150h and the pin
   155.   By this, the coupling 150 is pivotable in all directions
   substantially relative to the axis Li.
   [0239]      The locus of the flange portion 150j when the
   driven portion 150a side inclines in the direction X5 is
20 illustrated by the region Ti in Figure 14.    As shown in the
   Figure, even if the coupling 150 inclines, the interference
   with the pin 155 does not occur, and therefore, the flange
   portion 150j  can be provided over the full-circumference of
   the coupling 150   (Figure 8 (b)).  In other words, the shaft
25 receiving surface 150i has conical shape, and therefore, when
   the coupling 150 inclines, the pin 155 does not enter in the
   region Ti.   For this reason, the cutting away range of the
   coupling 150 is minimized.    Therefore, the rigidity of the
   coupling 150 can be assured.
   11849383 1                                             902028D4

                                   - 57
   [0240]      In the above described mounting process, the process
    (the non-driving side) in the direction X2     and the process
    (the driving side) in the direction X3 may be exchanged.
   [0241]      The bearing member 157 has been described as being
 5 fixed on the screws to the second frame 118.       However, the
   present invention is not limited to such an example.        For
   example, like the bonding, if the bearing member 157       is
   fixable to the second frame 118,     the any method will be
   usable.
10  (8) drive shaft and driving structure of the apparatus main
   assembly
   [0242]      Referring to Figure 17,   the description will be made
   as to the structure for driving the photosensitive drum 107 in
15 the apparatus main assembly A.      Figure 17  (a) is a partly
   broken perspective view of the side plate of the driving side
   in the state where the cartridge B is not mounted to the
   apparatus main assembly A.     Figure 17   (b) is a perspective
   view which illustrates    only the drum driving structure.
20 Figure 17    (c) is the sectional view taken along S7-S7 of
   Figure 17    (b).
   [0243]      The drive shaft  180 has  the substantially similar
   structure as the above described drum shaft 153.       In other
   words, the free end portion 180b thereof forms a semispherical
25 surface.    In addition, it has a rotational    force transmitting
   pin 182   as a rotational force applying portion of the main
   part 180a of the cylindrical shape which penetrates the center
   substantially.     The rotational force  is transmitted to the
   coupling 150 by this pin 182.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                 - 58
   [0244]     A drum driving gear 181 substantially co-axial with
   the axis of the drive shaft 180 is provided on the
   longitudinally opposite side of the free end portion 180b of
   the drive shaft 180.   The gear 181 is fixed non-rotatably
 5 relative to the drive shaft 180.   Therefore, the rotation of
   the gear 181 will also rotate the drive shaft 180.
   [0245]     In addition, the gear 181 is engaged with a pinion
   gear 187 for receiving the rotational force from the motor
   186.   Therefore, the rotation of the motor 186 will rotate the
10 drive shaft 180 through the gear 181.
   [0246]     In addition, the gear 181 is rotatably mounted to
   the apparatus main assembly A by the bearing members 183, 184.
   At this time, the gear 181 does not move relative to the
   direction of the axial direction L3 of the drive shaft 180
15  (the gear 181), that is, it is positioned with respect to the
   axial direction L3.   Therefore, the gears 181 and the bearing
   members 183 and 184 can be closely disposed relative to each
   other with respect to the axial direction.   In addition, the
   drive shaft 180 does not move with respect to the direction
20 thereof of the axis L3.   Therefore, the drive shaft 180 and
   the gap between the bearing members 183 and 184 have the sizes
   which permit the rotation of the drive shaft 180.   For this
   reason, the position of the gear 181 with respect to the
   diametrical direction relative to the gear 187 is determined
25 correctly.
   [0247]     In addition, although it has been described that the
   drive is directly transmitted to the gear 181 from the gear
   187,  the present invention is not limited to such an example.
   For example, it is the satisfactory using a plurality of gears
30 on account of the motor disposed at the apparatus main
   11849383 1                                            902028D4

                                  -  59
   assembly A.    Alternatively, it is possible to transmit the
   rotational force by a belt and so on.
    (9) Main assembly side mounting guide for guiding cartridge B
 5 [0248]      As shown in Figs. 18 and 19,    the mounting means 130
   of this embodiment includes main assembly guides 130R1,        130R2,
   130L1,   130L2 provided in the apparatus main assembly A.
   [0249]      They are provided opposed to the both side surfaces
   of the cartridge mounting space      (the cartridge set portion
10 130a) provided in the apparatus main assembly A      (the driving
   side surface in Figure 18)    (the side surface in Figure 19 in
   which it does not drive).    The main assembly guides 130R1,
   130R2 are provided in the main assembly opposed to the driving
   side of the cartridge B, and they are extended along the
15 mounting direction of the cartridge B.       On the other hand, the
   main assembly guides 130L1, 130L2 are provided in the main
   assembly side opposed to the non-driving side of the cartridge
   B, and they are extended along the mounting direction of the
   cartridge B.    The main assembly guides 130R1,    130R2 and the
20 main assembly guides 130L1, 130L2 are opposed to each other.
   At the time of mounting the cartridge B to the apparatus main
   assembly A these guides 130R1,     130R2, 130L1, 130L2 guide the
   cartridge guides as will be described hereinafter.       At the
   time of mounting the cartridge B to the apparatus main
25 assembly A, the cartridge door 109 which can be opened and
   closed relative to the apparatus main assembly A about a shaft
   109a is opened.    And, the mounting, into the apparatus main
   assembly A, of the cartridge B is completed by closing the
   door 109.    At the time of taking out the cartridge B from the
30 apparatus main assembly A, the door 109 is opened.       These
   operations are effected by the user.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

    (10) Positioning portion, relative to mounting guide and
   apparatus main assembly A for cartridge B
   [0250]     As  shown in Figs.  2 and 3,   in this embodiment, the
 5 outer periphery 157a of the outside end of the bearing member
   157  functions also as a cartridge guide 140R1.      In addition,
   the outer periphery 154a of the outside end of the drum
   grounding shaft   154 functions also as a cartridge guide 140L1.
   [0251]     In addition, the one longitudinal end      (the driving
10 side) of the second frame unit 120 is provided with the
   cartridge guide 140R2 on the upper portion of the cartridge
   guide 140R1.    And, the other end    (the non-driving side) in the
   longitudinal direction is provided with the cartridge guide
   140L2  on the upper portion of the cartridge guide 140L1.
15 [0252]     More particularly, the one longitudinal end of the
   photosensitive drum 107    is provided with the cartridge side
   guides 140R1,   140R2  outwardly projected from the cartridge
   frame Bl.   In addition, the other end in the longitudinal
   direction is provided with the cartridge side guides 140L1,
20 140L2  outwardly projected from the cartridge frame Bl.        The
   guides 140R1,   140R2,  140L1, 140L2 is projected toward the
   along said longitudinal direction here and there outside.
   More particularly, the guides 140R1,      140R2, 140L1,  140L2 are
   projected from the cartridge frame B1      along the axis Li.     And,
25 at the time of mounting the cartridge B to the apparatus main
   assembly A,   and at the time of demounting the cartridge B from
   the apparatus main assembly A the guide 140R1 is guided by the
   guide 130R1,   and the guide 140R2 is guided by the guide 130R2.
   In addition, at the time of mounting the cartridge B to the
30 apparatus main assembly A and at the time of demounting the
   cartridge B   from the apparatus main assembly A the guide 140L1
   is guided by the guide 130L1,     and the guide 140L2 is guided by
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                      - 61
   the guide 130L2.      In this manner, the cartridge B is mounted
   to the apparatus main assembly A,         moving in the direction
   substantially perpendicular to the axial direction L3 of the
   drive shaft    180,  and it is   similarly demounted from the
 5 apparatus main assembly A.        In addition, in this embodiment,
   the cartridge guides      140R1,  140R2 are molded integrally with
   the second frame     118.   However, separate members are usable as
   the cartridge guides      140R1,  140R2.
    (11) Mounting operation of process cartridge
10
   [0253]      Referring to Figure 20,       the mounting operation, into
   the apparatus main assembly A,        of the cartridge B will be
   described.     Figure 20   shows the mounting process.       Figure 20
   is  a sectional view taken along S9-S9 of Figure 18.
15 [0254]      As  shown in Figure 20      (a), the door 109 is    opened by
   the user.    And, the cartridge B      is dismountably mounted
   relative to the cartridge mounting means         130   (the installation
   section 130a) provided in the apparatus main assembly A.
   [0255]      At the time of mounting the cartridge B to the
20 apparatus main assembly A,       in the driving side, the cartridge
   guides 140R1,     140R2  are inserted along the main assembly
   guides 130R1,     130R2,  as shown in Figure 20     (b).   In addition,
   also about the non-driving side, the cartridge guides 140L1,
   140L2   (Figure 3) are inserted along the main assembly guides
25 130L1,   130L2   (Figure 19).
   [0256]      When the cartridge B is       further inserted in the
   direction of the arrow X4,       the coupling between the drive
   shaft   180 and the cartridge B is established and then, the
   cartridge B    is mounted to the predetermined position         (the
30 installation section 130a)       (the provision).     In other words,
   11849383 1                                                     902028D4

                                      - 62
   as shown in Figure 20       (c), the cartridge guide 140R1 contacts
   to the positioning portion 130R1a of the main assembly guide
   130R1,    and the cartridge guide 140R2 contacts to the
   positioning portion 130R2a of the main assembly guide 130R2.
 5 In addition, the cartridge guide 140L1       contacts to the
   positioning portion 130Lla       (Figure 19) of the main assembly
   guide 130L1,     and the cartridge guide 140L2 contacts to the
   positioning portion 130L2a of the main assembly guide 130L2
   since this state      is substantially symmetrical, the
10 illustration is not made.        In this manner, the cartridge B is
   dismountably mounted to the installation section 130a by the
   mounting means 130.       More particularly, the cartridge B is
   mounted in the state positioned in the apparatus main assembly
   A.   And, in the state where the cartridge B is mounted to the
15 installation section 130a, the drive shaft 180 and the
   coupling 150     are in the engaged state relative to each other.
    [0257]       More particularly, the coupling 150 is    in a
   rotational force transmitting angular position as will be
   described hereinafter.
20  [0258]       The image forming operation is enabled by the
   cartridge B being mounted to the set portion 130a.
    [0259]       When the cartridge B is provided at the
   predetermined position, a pressing receptor portion 140R1b
    (Figure 2) of the cartridge B receives the urging force from
25 an urging spring 188R       (Figure 18, Figure 19,  and Figure 20).
   In addition, from an urging spring 188L, a pressing receptor
   portion 140L1b      (Figure 3) of the cartridge B receives the
   urging force.      By this, the cartridge B    (photosensitive drum
   107)   is   correctly positioned relative to the transfer roller,
30 the optical means, and so on of the apparatus main assembly A.
   11849383   1                                                902028D4

                                  -  63
   [0260]     The user may enter the cartridge B to the set
   portion 130a as described above.     Alternatively, the user
   enters the cartridge B to the position halfway, and the last
   mounting operation may be effected by another means.      For
 5 example, utilizing the operation which shuts the door 109, a
   part of door 109 acts on the cartridge B which is in the
   position in the course of the mounting to push the cartridge B
   into the final mounted position.     Further alternatively, the
   user pushes, into the cartridge B to the middle, the cartridge
10 B, and lets it fall into the set portion 130a by the weight,
   after that.
   [0261]     Here, as shown in Figure 18-20, the mounting and
   demounting of the cartridge B relative to the apparatus main
   assembly A is effected by the movement in the direction
15 substantially perpendicular to the direction of the axis L3 of
   the drive shaft 180   (Figure 21) corresponding to these
   operations, the position between the drive shaft 180 and the
   coupling 150 change between the engaged state and the
   disengagement state.
20 [0262]     Here, the description will be made about
   "perpendicular substantially".
   [0263]     Between the cartridge B and the apparatus main
   assembly A, in order to mount and demount the cartridge B
   smoothly, small gaps are provided.     More specifically, the
25 small gaps are provided $ between the guide 140R1 and the
   guide 130R1 with respect to the longitudinal direction,
   between the guide 140R2 and the guide 130R2 with respect to
   the longitudinal direction, between the guide 140L1 and the
   guide 130L1 with respect to the longitudinal direction, and
30 between the guide 140L2 and the guide 130L2 with respect to
   the longitudinal direction.     Therefore, at the time of the
   11849383 1                                              902028D4

                                  -  64
   mounting and demounting of the cartridge B relative to the
   apparatus main assembly A,   the whole cartridge B can slightly
   incline within the limits of the gaps.      For this reason, the
   perpendicularity is not meant strictly.      However, even in such
 5 a case,   the present invention is   accomplished with the effects
   thereof.    Therefore, the term "perpendicular substantially"
   covers the case where the cartridge slightly inclines.
    (12) Coupling engaging operations and drive transmission
10 [0264]      As stated in the foregoing, immediately before or
   substantially simultaneously with positioning in a
   predetermined position of the apparatus main assembly A,         the
   coupling 150   is engaged with the drive shaft 180.      More
   particularly, the coupling 150 positions at the rotational
15 force transmitting angular position.      Here,  the predetermined
   position is the set portion 130a.      Referring to Figures 21,
   22,  and 23, the description will be made with respect to the
   engaging operation of this coupling.      Figure 21   is a
   perspective view which illustrates the major part of the drive
20 shaft and the driving side of the cartridge.       Figure 22 is     a
   longitudinal sectional view, as seen from the lower part of
   the apparatus main assembly.     Figure 23 is   a longitudinal
   sectional view, as seen from the lower part of the apparatus
   main assembly.    Here, the engagement means the state in which
25 the axis L2 and the axis L3 are substantially co-axial
   relative to each other, and the drive transmission is
   possible.
   [0265]      As shown in Figure 22,   the cartridge B is mounted to
   the apparatus main assembly A in the direction       (arrow X4)
30 substantially perpendicular to the axis L3 of the drive shaft
   180.   Or, it is demounted from the apparatus main assembly A.
   In the pre-engagement angular position, the axis L2        (Figure 22
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                   - 65
   a) of the coupling 150 inclines toward downstream with respect
   to the mounting direction X4 beforehand relative to the axis
   Li  (Figure 22(a) of the drum shaft 153      (Figure 21 a and Figure
   22 (a).
 5 [0266]      In order to incline the coupling toward the pre
   engagement angular position beforehand, the structure of the
   embodiment 3-embodiment 9 as will be described hereinafter is
   used, for example.
   [0267]      Because of the inclination of the coupling 150,        the
10 downstream free end 150Al with respect to the mounting
   direction X4 is closer to the photosensitive drum 107 than the
   drive shaft free end 180b3 in the direction of the axis Li.
   In addition, the upstream free end 150A2 with respect to the
   mounting direction is closer to the pin 182 than the drive
15 shaft free end 180b3    (Figure 22 (a),  (b)).   Here, the free end
   position is the position nearest to the drive shaft of the
   driven portion 150a shown in Figure 8(a) and        (c) with respect
   to the direction of the axis L2,      and it is the remotest
   position from the axis L2.     In other words, it is an edge line
20 of the driven portion 150a of the coupling 150,        or an edge
   line of the projection 150d depending on the rotation phase of
   the coupling 150    (150A) in Figure 8(a) and (c).
   [0268]      The free end position 150Al    of the coupling 150
   passes by the drive shaft free end 180b3.        And, after the
25 coupling 150 carries out by passage of the drive shaft free
   end 180b3, the receiving surface      (cartridge side contact
   portion) 150f or the projection      (cartridge side contact
   portion) 150d contacts with the free end portion 180b of drive
   shaft   (main assembly side engaging portion) 180,      or pin   (main
30 assembly side engaging portion)      (rotational force applying
   portion) 182.    And, corresponding to the mounting operation of
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

   the cartridge    (B),  the axis L2 is inclined so that it may
   align substantially with the axis Li        (Figure 22  (c)).    And,
   when the coupling 150 inclines from said pre-engagement
   angular position and the axis L2 thereof aligns substantially
 5 with the axis Li,     the rotational force transmitting angular
   position is reached.      And, finally, the position of the
   cartridge    (B) is determined relative to the apparatus main
   assembly (A).     Here, the drive shaft 180 and the drum shaft
   153 are substantially co-axial relative to each other.             In
10 addition, the receiving surface 150f opposes to the spherical
   free end portion 180b of the drive shaft 180.          This state is
   the engaged state between the coupling 150 and the drive shaft
   180   (Figure 21   (b) and Figure 22   (d)).   At this time, the pin
   155   (unshown) is positioned in the opening 150g       (Figure 8
15  (b)).   In other words, the pin 182 takes the standing-by
   portion 150k.     Here, the coupling 150 covers the free end
   portion 180b.
   [0269]      The receiving surface 150f constitutes the recess
   150z.    And, the recess 150z has the conical shape.
20 [0270]      As has been described above, the coupling 150 is
   pivotable relative to the axis Li.        And, corresponding to the
   movement of the cartridge      (B),  a part of coupling 150     (the
   receiving surface 150f and/or 150d of projections) which is
   the cartridge side contact portion contacts to the main
25 assembly side engaging portion       (the drive shaft 180 and/or the
   pin 182).     By this, the pivoting motion of the coupling 150 is
   effected.    As shown in Figure 22,     the coupling 150 is mounted
   with the state of overlapping, with respect to the direction
   of the axis Li, with the drive shaft 180.         However, the
30 coupling 150 and the drive shaft 180 are engageable relative
   to each other with the overlapping state by the pivoting
   motion of the couplings, as described above.
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

                                      -  67
   [0271]      The mounting operation of the coupling 150 described
   above can be performed regardless of the phases          of the drive
   shaft   180 and the coupling 150.        Referring to Figure 15 and
   Figure 23,    the detailed description will be made.        Figure 23
 5 illustrates the phase relation between the coupling and the
   drive shaft.      In Figure 23   (a),   in a downstream position with
   respect to the mounting direction X4 of the cartridge, the pin
   182  and the receiving surface 150f        face to each other.     In
   Figure 23    (b),  the pin 182 and the projection      150d face to
10 each other.      In Figure 23   (c),   the free end portion 180b and
   the projection 150d face to each other.           In Figure 23  (d),   the
   free end portion 180b and the receiving surface 150f           face to
   each other.
   [0272]      As   shown in Figure 15,     the coupling 150 is pivotably
15 mounted in any direction relative to the drum shaft          153.     More
   particularly, the coupling 150 is         revolvable.   Therefore, as
   shown in Figure 23,      it can incline toward the mounting
   direction X4     irrespective of the phase of the drum shaft        153
   relative to the mounting direction X4         of the cartridge    (B).
20 In addition, the inclination angle of the coupling 150 is             set,
   so that regardless of the phases         of the drive shaft  180 and
   the coupling 150,      the free end position 150Al     is made closer
   to the photosensitive drum 107 than the axial free end 180b3
   with respect to the direction of the axis Li.           In addition,
25 the inclination angle of the coupling 150          is set, so that the
   free end position 150A2      is made closer to the pin 182      than the
   axial free end 180b3.       With such a setting, corresponding to
   the mounting operation of the cartridge          (B), the free end
   position 150Al     is passed by the axial     free end 180b3 in the
30 mounting direction X4.       And, in the case of Figure 23      (a),   the
   receiving surface 150f      contacts the pin 182.      In the case of
   Figure 23    (b),  the projection     (the engaging portion) 150d
   contacts the pin      (rotational force applying portion) 182.         In
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

                                   - 68
   the case of Figure 23   (c),  the projection 150d contacts to the
   free end portion 180b.    In the case of Figure 23     (d),   the
   receiving surface 150f contacts to the free end portion 180b.
   In addition, by the contact force generated at the time of
 5 mounting the cartridge   (B),  the axis L2 of the coupling 150
   moves so that it substantially becomes co-axial with the axis
   Li.   By this, the coupling 150 is engaged with the drive shaft
   180.   More particularly, the coupling recess 150z covers the
   free end portion 180b.    For this reason, the coupling 150 can
10 be engaged with the drive shaft 180      (the pin 182)  irrespective
   of the phases of the drive shaft 180,      the coupling 150 and the
   drum shaft 153.
   [0273]     In addition, as shown in Figure 22,     the gap is
   provided between the drum shaft 153 and the coupling 150,          so
15 that the coupling is swingable     (revolvable, pivotable).
   [0274]     In this embodiment, the coupling 150 moves in a
   plane of the sheet of the drawing of Figure 22.        However, the
   coupling 150 of this embodiment is capable of whirling, as
   described above.   Therefore, the motion of the coupling 150
20 may include motion not included in the plane of the sheet of
   the drawing of Figure 22.     In such a case, the change from the
   state of Figure 22(a) to the state of Figure 22(d) occurs.
   This applies to the embodiments which will be described
   hereinafter unless otherwise stated.
25 [0275]     Referring to Figure 24,    the rotational force
   transmitting operation at the time of rotating the
   photosensitive drum 107 will be described.       The drive shaft
   180 rotates with the gear 181 in the direction       (Figure, X8) by
   the rotational force received from the driving source (the
30 motor 186).   And, the pin 182 integral with the drive shaft
   180  (182al, 182a2) contacts to any of the rotational force
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

                                  -  69
   receiving surfaces   (rotational force receiving portion) 150el
   150e4.    More particularly, the pin 182al contacts any one of
   the rotational force receiving surfaces 150el-150e4.       In
   addition, the pin 182a2 contacts with any of the rotational
 5 force receiving surfaces 150el-150e4.      By this, the rotational
   force of the drive shaft 180 is transmitted to the coupling
   150 to rotate the coupling 150.      Furthermore, by the rotation
   of the coupling 150, the rotational force transmission
   surfaces   (the rotational force transmitting portion) 150h 1 or
10 150h2 of the coupling 150 contact to the pin 155 integral with
   the drum shaft 153.    By this, the rotational force of the
   drive shaft 180 is transmitted to the photosensitive drum 107
   through the coupling 150, the rotational force transmission
   surface 150h 1 or 150h2, the pin 155, the drum shaft 153, and
15 the drum flange 151.    In this manner, the photosensitive drum
   107 is rotated.
   [0276]      In the rotational force transmitting angular
   position, the free end portion 153b is contacted with the
   receiving surface 150i.    And, the free end portion    (the
20 positioning portion) 180b of the drive shaft 180 is contacted
   with the receiving surface    (the positioning portion) 150f.     By
   this, the coupling 150 is positioned relative to the drive
   shaft 180 in the state where it is over the drive shaft 180
    (Figures 22 (d)).
25 [0277]      Here, in this embodiment, even if the axis L3 and
   the axis Li deviate from the co-axial relations somewhat, the
   coupling 150 can effect the transmission of the rotational
   force because the coupling 150 inclines slightly.      Even if it
   is such a case, the coupling 150 can rotate without covering
30 the large additional load over the drum shaft 153 and the
   drive shaft 180.    Therefore, the high precision position
   arrangement operation of the drive shaft 180 and the drum
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                    -  70
   shaft   153 at the time of the assembling is easy.        For this
   reason, the assembling operativity can be improved.
   [0278]      This is  also one of the effects of this embodiment.
   [0279]      In addition, in Figure 17,      as has been described,
 5 the position of the drive shaft       180 and the gear 181    is
   positioned with respect to the diametrical direction and the
   axial direction in the predetermined position         (Set portion
   130a) of the apparatus main assembly        (A).  In addition, the
   cartridge   (B) is positioned in the predetermined position of
10 the apparatus main assembly as described above.          And, the
   drive shaft   180 positioned in said predetermined position and
   the cartridge    (B) positioned in said predetermined position
   are coupled by the coupling 150.        The  coupling 150 is
   swingable   (pivotable) relative to the photosensitive drum 107.
15 For this reason, as described above, the coupling 150          can
   transmit the rotational force smoothly between the drive shaft
   180 positioned in the predetermined position and the cartridge
    (B) positioned in the predetermined position.         In other words,
   even if there is    some axial deviation between the drive shaft
20 180  and the photosensitive drum 107,       the coupling 150   can
   transmit the rotational force smoothly.
   [0280]      This is  also one of the effects of this embodiment.
   [0281]      In addition, as described above, the cartridge         (B)
   is positioned in the predetermined position.         For this reason,
25 the photosensitive drum 107 which is the constituent-element
   of the cartridge    (B) is correctly positioned relative to the
   apparatus main assembly     (A).   Therefore, the spatial
   relationship between the photosensitive drum 107,         and the
   optical means 101,    the transfer roller 104     or recording
   11849383 1                                                   902028D4

                                    -   71
   material 102   can be maintained with high precision.          In other
   words, those position deviations can be reduced.
   [0282]      The coupling 150 contacts to the drive shaft 180.
   By this, although it has been mentioned that the coupling 150
 5 swings   from the pre-engagement angular position to the
   rotational force transmitting angular position, the present
   invention is not   limited to such an example.        For example, it
   is possible to provide the abutting portion as the main
   assembly side engaging portion in the position other than the
10 drive shaft of the apparatus main assembly.          And, in the
   mounting process of the cartridge       (B),  after the free end
   position 150Al   passes by the drive shaft free end 180b3,          a
   part of coupling 150    (cartridge side contact portion) contacts
   with this abutting portion.       By this,   the coupling can receive
15 the force of the shaking direction        (pivoting direction),     and
   it can also be made to swing so that the axis L2 becomes
   substantially co-axial with the axis L3         (the pivoting).     In
   other words,   another means   is sufficient,     if the axis Li    can
   substantially co-axially position with the axis L3 in
20 interrelation with the mounting operation of the cartridge
    (B).
    (13) The disengaging operation of the coupling, and the
   removing operation of the cartridge
25 [0283]      Referring to Figure 25,     the operation for
   disengaging the coupling 150       from the drive shaft 180 will be
   described at the time of taking out the cartridge          (B) from the
   apparatus main assembly    (A).     Figure 25 is   the longitudinal
   sectional view, as seen from the apparatus main assembly
30 lower.
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

                                      -   72
   [0284]      First, the position of the pin 182 at the time of
   demounting the cartridge      (B) will be described.          After the
   image formation finishes, as will be apparent from the
   foregoing description, the pin 182 is positioned at any 2 of
 5 the standing-by portions 150k1-150k4            (Figure 8).    And, the pin
   155  is positioned in the opening 150g           1 or 150g2.
   [0285]      The description will be made with respect to the
   operation for disengaging the coupling 150            from the drive
   shaft   180 in interrelation with the operation for taking out
10 the cartridge     (B).
   [0286]      As  shown in Figure 25,        the cartridge    (B) is drawn
   out in the direction      (the direction of the arrow X6)
   substantially perpendicular to the axis L3,            at the time of
   demounting from the apparatus main assembly            (A).
15 [0287]      In the state where the drive for the drum shaft 153
   has  stopped, the axis L2 is      substantially co-axial relative to
   the axis Li    in the coupling 150        (rotational force transmitting
   angular position)      (Figure 25    (a)).    And, the drum shaft       153
   moves in the dismounting direction X6 with the cartridge                  (B),
20 and the receiving surface 150f or the projection 150d in the
   upstream of the coupling 150 with respect to the dismounting
   direction contacts at least to the free end portion 180b of
   the drive shaft     180(Figure 25     (a)).    And, the axis L2 begins
   to incline toward the upstream with respect to the dismounting
25 direction X6     (Figure 25  (b)).      This direction is     the same as
   that of the inclination of the coupling 150            at the time of the
   mounting of the cartridge       (B)   (the pre-engagement angular
   position).     It moves, while the upstream free end portion 150
   A3 with respect to the dismounting direction X6              contacts to
30 the free end portion 180b by the dismounting operation from
   the apparatus main assembly       (A) of this cartridge         (B).    In
   11849383 1                                                         902028D4

                                     -   73
   more detail, corresponding to the movement to the dismounting
   direction of the cartridge      (B),    while a part of coupling 150
    (the receiving surface 150f     and/or 150d of projections) which
   is  the cartridge   side contact portion contacts with the main
 5 assembly side engaging portion         (the drive shaft 180 and/or the
   pin 182),   the coupling moves.       And, in the axis L2,      the free
   end portion 150 A3     inclines to the free end 180b3         (disengaging
   angular position)     (Figure 25    (c)).    And, in this state, the
   coupling 150    is passed by the drive shaft        180,  contacting to
10 the free end 180b3,     and is disengaged from the drive shaft 180
    (Figure 25   (d)).  Thereafter, the cartridge         (B) follows the
   process opposite from that of the mounting process described
   in Figure 20,    and is taken out from the apparatus main
   assembly   (A).
15 [0288]      As will be apparent from the foregoing description,
   the angle of the pre-engagement angular position relative to
   the axis Li    is larger than the angle of the disengaging
   angular position relative to the axis Li.            This  is because it
   is preferable that the free end position 150Al            passes
20 assuredly by the free end portion 180b3 in the pre-engagement
   angular position in consideration of the dimensional tolerance
   of the parts at the time of the engagement of the coupling.
   More particularly, it is preferable that the gap exists
   between the coupling 150 and the free end portion 180b3 in the
25 pre-engagement angular position          (Figure 22  (b)).   On the
   contrary, at the time of the coupling disengagement, the axis
   L2 inclines in interrelation with the dismounting operation of
   the cartridge in the disengaging angular position.              Therefore,
   the coupling 150 A3 moves along the free end portion 180b3.
30 In other words, the upstream portion, with respect to the
   cartridge dismounting direction, of the coupling and the free
   end portion of the drive shaft are in the substantially same
   position   (Figure 25   (c)).  For this reason, the angle of the
   11849383 1                                                       902028D4

                                      - 74
   pre-engagement angular position relative to the axis Li           is
   larger than the angle of the disengaging angular position
   relative to the axis Li.
   [0289]      In addition, similarly to the case of mounting the
 5 cartridge   (B) to the apparatus main assembly        (A), the
   cartridge   (B) can be taken out irrespective of the phase
   difference between the coupling 150 and the pin 182.
   [0290]      As shown in Figure 22,       in the rotational force
   transmitting angular position of the coupling 150,          the angle
10 relative to the axis Li       of the coupling 150   is  such that   in
   the state where the cartridge        (B) is mounted to the apparatus
   main assembly    (A),   the coupling 150 receives the transmission
   of the rotational      force from the drive shaft 180,     and it
   rotates.
15 [0291]      The rotational force transmitting angular position
   of the coupling 150,       the rotational force   for rotating the
   photosensitive drum is       transmitted to the drum.
   [0292]      In addition, in the pre-engagement angular position
   of the coupling 150,       the angular position relative to the axis
20 Li  of the coupling 150      is such that it is   in the state
   immediately before the coupling 150 engages with the drive
   shaft   180 in the mounting operation to the apparatus main
   assembly   (A) of the cartridge      (B).   More particularly, it is
   the angular position relative to the axis Li which the
25 downstream free end portion 150Al         of the coupling 150   can pass
   by the drive shaft 180 with respect to the mounting direction
   of the cartridge      (B).
   [0293]      In addition, the disengaging angular position of the
   coupling 150   is the angular position relative to the axis Li
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

   of the coupling 150 at the time of taking out the cartridge
    (B) from the apparatus main assembly        (A),   in the case that the
   coupling 150 disengages from the drive shaft 180.            More
   particularly, as shown in Figure 25,        it is    the angular
 5 position relative to the axis Li with which the free end
   portion 150 A3 of the coupling 150 can pass by the drive shaft
   180 with respect to the removing direction of the cartridge
    (B).
   [0294]      In the pre-engagement angular position or the
10 disengaging angular position, the angle theta 2 which the axis
   L2 makes with the axis Li    is    larger than the angle theta 1
   which the axis L2 makes with the axis Li           in the rotational
   force transmitting angular position.          As for the angle theta
   1,   0 degree is preferable.    However, in this embodiment, if
15 the angle theta 1 is less than about 15 degrees, the smooth
   transmission of the rotational force        is accomplished.       This is
   also one of the effects of this embodiment.            As for the angle
   theta 2,   the range of about 20 -      60 degrees is preferable.
   [0295]      As has been described hereinbefore, the coupling is
20 pivotably mounted to the axis Li.         And, the coupling 150       in
   the state in which it overlaps with the drive shaft            180 with
   respect to the direction of the axis Li          can be disengaged from
   the drive shaft   180 because the coupling inclines
   correspondingly to the dismounting operation of the cartridge
25  (B).   More particularly, by moving the cartridge         (B) in the
   direction substantially perpendicular to the axial direction
   of the drive shaft 180,   the coupling 150 which covers the
   drive shaft   180 can be disengaged from the drive shaft 180.
   [0296]      In the above described description, the receiving
30 surface 150f   of the coupling 150      or the projection    150d
   contacts with the free end portion 180b           (the pin 182)   in
   11849383 1                                                      902028D4

   interrelation with the movement of the cartridge          (B) in the
   dismounting direction X6.       By this, it has been described that
   the axis Li     starts the inclination to the dismounting
   direction upstream.      However, the present invention is not
 5 limited to such an example          For example, the coupling 150 has
   a structure beforehand, so that         it is urged toward the
   upstream in the dismounting direction.          And, corresponding to
   the movement of the cartridge        (B),  this urging force starts
   the inclination of the axis Li         toward the downstream in the
10 dismounting direction.      And, the free end 150 A3 passes by the
   free end 180b3,     and the coupling 150 disengages from the drive
   shaft   180.    In other words,  the receiving surface 150f      in the
   upstream side with respect to the dismounting direction or
   projection    150d does not contact with the free end portion
15 180b, and therefore, it can be disengaged from the drive shaft
   180.   For this reason, the any structure can be applied if the
   axis Li   can be inclined in interrelation with the dismounting
   operation of the cartridge      (B).
   [0297]       By the point of time immediately before the coupling
20 150  is mounted to the drive shaft 180,        the driven portion of
   the coupling 150     is inclined, so that it is     inclines toward
   the downstream with respect to the mounting direction.             In
   other words,     the coupling 150 is beforehand put on in the
   state of the pre-engagement angular position.
25 [0298]       In the foregoing, the motion in the plane       in the
   sheet of the drawing of Figure 25 has been described, but the
   motion may include the whirling motion as in the case of
   Figure 22.
   [0299]       As  to the structure therefor, the structure of any
30 that will be described in Embodiment 2 et         sq. is usable.
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

   [03001      Referring to Figure 26 and Figure 27,      the
   description will be made about the other embodiment of the
   drum shaft.    Figure 26 is a perspective view of the
   neighborhood of the drum shaft.        Figure 27  illustrates a
 5 characteristic portion.
   [0301]      In the embodiment described above, the free end of
   the drum shaft 153   is formed into the spherical surface, and
   the coupling 150   is in contact with the spherical surface
   thereof.    However, as shown in Figure 26      (a) and 27   (a),  the
10 free end 1153b of the drum shaft 1153 may be a flat surface.
   In the case of this embodiment, the edge portion 1153c of the
   peripheral surface thereof contacts the conic surface of the
   coupling 150,   by which the rotation is     transmitted.     Even with
   such a structure, the axis L2 can be assuredly inclined
15 relative to the axis Li.    In the case of this embodiment,
   there is no necessity for the spherical surface machining.
   Therefore, the machining cost can be reduced.
   [0302]      In the embodiment described above, another
   rotational force transmitting pin is mounted to the drum
20 shaft.    However, as shown in Figure 26     (b) and 27   (b),   it is
   possible to mold the drum shaft      1253 and the pin 1253c
   integrally.    In the case of integral molding using injection
   molding and so on, the geometrical latitude becomes high.             In
   this case, the pin 1253c can be integrally formed with the
25 drum shaft   1253.  For this reason, the wide area of the drive
   transmitting portion 1253d can be provided.         Therefore, the
   running torque can be assuredly transmitted to the drum shaft
   made of the resin material.      In addition,    since integral
   molding is utilized, the manufacturing cost is reduced.
30 [03031      As shown in Figure 26     (c) and 27  (c), the opposite
   ends 1355al,   1355a2 of rotational force transmitting pin
   11849383 1                                                   902028D4

                                    - 78
    (rotational force receiving member) 1355 are beforehand fixed
   by the press-fitting and so on to the standby opening 1350g 1
   or 1350g2 of the coupling 1350.       Thereafter, it is possible to
   insert the drum shaft     1353 which has a free end portion
 5 1353c1,   1353c2 formed into a screw slotted shape     (concave).
   At this time, in order to provide a pivotability of the
   coupling 1350,    the engaging portion 1355b of the pin 1355
   relative to the free end portion      (unshown) of the drum shaft
   1353 is   formed into a spherical shape.     Thus, the pin 1355
10  (rotational force applying portion) is     fixed beforehand.     By
   this, the size of the opening 1350g of the coupling 1350 can
   be reduced.     Therefore, the rigidity of the coupling 1350      can
   be increased.
   [0304]       In the foregoing, the structure by which the
15 inclination of the axis Li     is made along the free end of the
   drum shaft has been described.       However, as shown in Figure 26
    (d), 26   (e), and 27  (d), it is possible to incline along the
   contact surface 1457a of the contact member 1457      on the axis
   of the drum shaft 1453.      In this case, the free end surface
20 1453b of the drum shaft 1453 has      a height comparable to the
   end surface of the contact member 1457.       In addition, the
   rotational force transmitting pin      (the rotational force
   receiving member) 1453c projected beyond the free end surface
   1453b is    inserted into the standby opening 1450g of the
25 coupling 1450.     The pin 1453c contacts to the rotational      force
   transmission surface     (the rotational  force transmitting
   portion) 1450h of the coupling 1450.       By this, the rotational
   force is    transmitted to the drum 107.    In this manner, the
   contact surface 1457a at the time of the coupling 1450
30 inclining is provided in the contact member 1457.        By this,
   there is no necessity of processing the drum shaft directly.
   Therefore, the machining cost can be lowered.
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                 - 79
   [03051     In addition, similarly, the spherical surface at the
   free end may be a molded resin part of separate member.          In
   this case, the machining cost of the shaft can be lowered.
   This is because the configuration of the shaft to be processed
 5 by the cutting and so on can be simplified.      In addition, when
   the range of the spherical surface at the axial       free end is
   decreased, the range of the processing which requires high
   degree of accuracy can be made small.    By this,     the machining
   cost can be lowered.

   [03061     Referring to Figure 28,  the description will be made
   about another embodiment of the drive shaft.       Figure 28 is
   perspective views of a drive shaft and a drum driving gear.
   [0307]     First, as shown in Figure 28   (a),  the free end of
15 the drive shaft  1180 is made into the flat surface 1180b.          By
   this, since the configuration of the shaft is simple,        the
   machining cost can be lowered.
   [03081     In addition, as shown in Figure 28     (b),  it is
   possible to mold the rotational   force applying portion       (drive
20 transmitting portion) 1280(1280c1,   1280c2)   integrally with the
   drive shaft  1280.  When the drive shaft 1280    is   the molded
   resin part, the rotational  force applying portion can be
   molded integrally.   Therefore, the cost reduction can be
   accomplished.   Designated by 1280b is  the flat surface
25 portion.
   [03091     In addition, as shown in Figure 28     (c),  the range of
   the free end portion 1380b of the drive shaft      1380 is
   decreased.   For this purpose, it is possible to make the outer
   diameter of the shaft  free end 1380c smaller than the outer
30 diameter of the main part  1380a.   As described above, the free
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                     -   80
   end portion 1380b requires a certain amount of accuracy, in
   order to determine the position of the coupling 150.
   Therefore, the spherical range is          limited only to the contact
   portion of the coupling.       By this, the portion other than the
 5 surface where accuracy of finishing is          required is omitted.
   By this, the machining cost is lowered.           In addition,
   similarly, it is possible to cut the free end of the
   unnecessary spherical surface.          Designated by 1382 is    a pin
    (the rotational force applying portion).
10 [0310]      The positioning method of the photosensitive drum
   107 with respect to the direction of the axis Li will be
   described.     In other words,   the coupling 1550 is provided with
   a tapered surface     (the inclined plane) 1550e,       1550h.   And, a
   force is produced in the thrust direction by the rotation of
15 the drive shaft    181.   The positioning, with respect to the
   direction of the axis Li,      of the coupling 1550 and the
   photosensitive drum 107     is effected by this thrust force.
   Referring to Figure 29 and Figure 30,          this will be described
   in detail.     Figure 29 is a perspective view and a top plan
20 view of the coupling alone.         Figure 30   is an exploded
   perspective view which illustrates the drive shaft, the drum
   shaft, and the coupling.
   [0311]      As  shown in Figure 29       (b), the rotational   force
   receiving surface 1550e      (the inclined plane)      (rotational force
25 receiving portion) is inclined by the angle a5           relative to the
   axis L2.    When the drive shaft       180 rotates in the direction
   Ti,  the pin 182 and the rotational force receiving surface
   1550e contact to each other.         Then, a component force is
   applied to the coupling 1550        in the direction T2,    and it moves
30 in the direction T2.      And, the coupling 1550 moves to the
   axial direction until the driving shaft receiving surface
   1550f   (Figure 30a) abuts to the free end 180b of the drive
   11849383 1                                                     902028D4

                                      -  81
   shaft   180.    By this, the position of the coupling 1550 with
   respect to the direction of the axis L2 is determined.              In
   addition, the free end 180b of the drive shaft           180 is  formed
   into the spherical surface, and the receiving surface 1550f
 5 has  the conic surface.       Therefore, with respect to the
   direction perpendicular to the axis L2,          the position of the
   driven portion 1550a relative to the drive shaft 180            is
   determined.      In cases where the coupling 1550 is mounted to
   the drum 107,      the drum 107 also moves to the axial direction
10 depending on the size of the force in which it is added in the
   direction T2.       In this case, with respect to the longitudinal
   direction, the position of the drum 107 relative to the
   apparatus main assembly is determined.           The drum 107   is
   mounted with play in the longitudinal direction thereof in the
15 cartridge frame Bl.
   [0312]       As  shown in Figure 29      (c), the rotational  force
   transmission surface       (the rotational    force transmitting
   portion) 1550h is      inclined by the angle a     6 relative to the
   axis L2.     When the coupling 1550       rotates in the direction Ti,
20 the transmitting surface 1550h and the pin 155 abut relative
   to each other.       Then, a component force is     applied to the pin
   155  in the direction T2,      and it moves in the direction T2.
   And, the drum shaft 153 moves until the free end 153b of the
   drum shaft    153 contacts to the drum bearing surface 1550i
25  (Figure 30    (b))  of the coupling 1550.      By this,  the position
   of the drum shaft 155       (the photosensitive drum) with respect
   to the direction of the axis L2         is determined.    In addition,
   the drum bearing surface 1550i has a conic surface, and the
   free end 153b of the drum shaft         153 is  formed into a spherical
30 surface.     Therefore, with respect to the direction
   perpendicular to the axis L2,        the position of the driving
   portion 1550b relative to the drum shaft          153 is determined.
   11849383 1                                                     902028D4

                                   -   82
   [0313]       The taper angles a5 and a6 are    set to the degree
   with which the force effective to move the coupling and the
   photosensitive drum in the thrust direction is produced.
   However, the forces thereof differ depending on the running
 5 torque of the photosensitive drum 107.        However, if there is
   provided means which is effective to determine the position in
   the thrust direction, the taper angles a5 and ao6 may be small.
   [0314]       As has been described hereinbefore, the taper for
   being drawn in the coupling in the direction of the axis L2
10 and the conic surface for determining the position at the axis
   L2 with respect to the orthogonality direction are provided.
   By this, a position with respect to the direction of the axis
   Li  of the coupling and a position with respect to the
   direction perpendicular to the axis Li,       are determined
15 simultaneously.     In addition, the coupling can transmit the
   rotational force assuredly.       Furthermore, as compared with the
   case where the rotational force receiving surface        (rotational
   force receiving portion) or the rotational       force transmission
   surface    (the rotational force transmitting portion) of the
20 coupling does not have the taper angle as described above, the
   contact between the rotational force applying portion of the
   drive shaft and the rotational force receiving portion of the
   coupling can be stabilized.       In addition, the contact abutment
   between the rotational    force receiving portion of the drum
25 shaft and the rotational force transmitting portion of the
   coupling can be stabilized.
   [0315]       However, the tapered surface    (the inclined plane)
   for pulling in the coupling in the direction of the axis L2
   and the conic surface for determining the position of the axis
30 L2 with respect to the orthogonal direction may be omitted.
   For example,    in place of the taper for drawing in the
   direction of the axis L2,    it is possible to add a part for
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                 - 83
   urging the drum in the direction of the axis L2.      Hereinafter,
   as long as there is no particular mentioning, the tapered
   surface and the conic surface are provided.     In addition, the
   tapered surface and the conic surface are provided also in the
 5 coupling 150 described above.
   [0316]     Referring to Figure 31,  the regulating means for
   regulating the inclining direction relative to the cartridge
   of the coupling will be described.    Figure 31   (a) is a side
   view which illustrates the major part of the driving side of
10 the process cartridge, and Figure 31   (b) is a sectional view
   taken along S7-S7 of Figure 31   (a).
   [0317]     In this embodiment, the coupling 150 and the drive
   shaft 180 of the apparatus main assembly can be more assuredly
   engaged by providing the regulating means.
15 [0318]     In this embodiment, as the regulating means, the
   regulating portions 1557h 1 or 1557h2 are provided on the drum
   bearing member 1557.   The coupling 150 can be regulated in
   swinging directions relative to the cartridge     (B) by this
   regulating means.   The structure is such that by the time,
20 immediately before the coupling 150 engages with the drive
   shaft 180, this regulating portion 1557h 1 or 1557h2 is
   parallel to the mounting direction X4 of the cartridge       (B).
   In addition, the intervals D6 is slightly larger than the
   outer diameter D7 of the driving portion 150b of the coupling
25 150.   By doing so, the coupling 150 is pivotable only to the
   mounting direction X4 of the cartridge   (B).   In addition, the
   coupling 150 can be inclined in any direction relative to the
   drum shaft 153.   Therefore, irrespective of the phase of the
   drum shaft 153, the coupling 150 can be inclined in the
30 regulated direction.   Therefore, the opening 150m of the
   coupling 150 can receive the drive shaft 180 more assuredly.
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                   -   84
   By this, the coupling 150 is more assuredly engageable with
   the drive shaft  180.
   [0319]     Referring to Figure 32,      another structure for
   regulating the inclining direction of the coupling will be
 5 described.   Figure 32  (a) is    a perspective view which
   illustrates the inside of the apparatus main assembly driving
   side, and Figure 32   (b) is a side view of a cartridge, as seen
   from the upstream with respect to the mounting direction X4.
   [0320]     The regulating portions 1557h 1 or 1557h2 are
10 provided in the cartridge    (B) in the above described
   description.   In this embodiment, a part of mounting guide
   1630R1 of the driving side of the apparatus main assembly            (A)
   is  a rib-like regulating portion 1630R1a.        The regulating
   portion 1630R1a is  the regulating means for regulating the
15 swinging directions of the coupling 150.        And, the structure
   is  such that, when the user inserts the cartridge         (B),  the
   outer periphery of a connecting portion 150c of the coupling
   150  contacts to the upper surface 1630R1a-1 of the regulating
   portion 1630R1a.   By this, the coupling 150       is guided by the
20 upper surface 1630R1a-1.    For this reason, the inclining
   direction of the coupling 150 is       regulated.   In addition,
   similarly to the embodiment described above, irrespective of
   the phase of the drum shaft 153,       the coupling 150 is     inclined
   in the direction in which it regulated.
25 [0321]     The regulating portion 1630R1a is provided below the
   coupling 150  in the example shown in Figure 32       (a).     However,
   similarly to the regulating portion 1557h2 shown in Figure 31,
   the more assured regulation can be accomplished when the
   regulating portion is added to the upper side.
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

                                     -   85
   [0322]     As described above, it may be combined with the
   structure in which the regulating portion is provided in the
   cartridge   (B).   In this case, more assured regulation can be
   accomplished.
 5 [0323]     However, in this embodiment, by which the means for
   regulating the inclining direction of the coupling may be
   omitted for example, the coupling 150 is beforehand inclined
   downstream with respect to the mounting direction of the
   cartridge   (B).   And, the driving shaft receiving surface 150f
10 of the coupling is enlarged.         By this, the engagement between
   the drive shaft 180 and the coupling 150 can be established.
   [0324]     In addition, in the foregoing description, the angle
   in the pre-engagement angular position of the coupling 150
   relative to the drum axis Li is larger than the angle in the
15 disengaging angular position        (Figures 22 and 25).    However,
   the present invention is not limited to such an example.
   [0325]     Referring to Figure 33,        the description will be
   made.   Figure 33 is a longitudinal sectional view which
   illustrates the process for taking out the cartridge           (B) from
20 the apparatus main assembly (A).
   [0326]     In the process for taking out the cartridge          (B) from
   the apparatus main assembly (A),         the angle in the disengaging
   angular position     (in the state Figure 33c) of the coupling
   1750 relative to the axis Li may be equivalent to the angle in
25 the pre-engagement angular position of the coupling 1750
   relative to the axis Li at the time of the coupling 1750
   engaging.    Here, the process in which the coupling 1750
   disengages is    shown by   (a) -   (b) -   (c) - (d) in Figure 33.
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

                                     -  86
   [0327]      More particularly, the setting is such that, when
   the upstream free end portion 1750 A3 with respect to the
   dismounting direction X6 of the coupling 1750 passes by the
   free end portion 180b3 of the drive shaft 180, the distance
 5 between the free end portion 1750 A3 and the free end portion
   180b3 is comparable as the distance at the time of the pre
   engagement angular position.        With such a setting, the
   coupling 1750 can be disengaged from the drive shaft 180.
   [0328]      The other operations at the time of demounting the
10 cartridge    (B) are the same as the above described operations,
   and therefore, the description is omitted.
   [0329]      In addition, in the foregoing description, at the
   time of mounting the cartridge        (B) to the apparatus main
   assembly   (A),  the downstream free end with respect to the
15 mounting direction of the coupling is closer to the drum shaft
   than the free end of the drive shaft 180.           However, the
   present invention is not limited to such an example.
   [0330]      Referring to Figure 34,      the description will be
   made.   Figure 34 is a longitudinal sectional view for
20 illustrating the mounting process of the cartridge           (B).    As
   shown in Figure 34,      in the state of    (a) the mounting process
   of the cartridge     (B),  in the direction of the axis Li,       the
   downstream free end position 1850A1 with respect to the
   mounting direction X4 is closer to the direction of the pin
25 182  (the rotational force applying portion) than the drive
   shaft free end 180b3.       In the state of    (b),  the free end
   position 1850A1 is contacted to the free end portion 180b.              At
   this time, the free end position 1850A1 moves toward the drum
   shaft 153 along the free end portion 180b.           And, the free end
30 position 1850A1 passes by the free end portion 180b3 of the
   drive shaft 180 at this position, the coupling 150 takes the
   11849383 1                                                     902028D4

                                        -  87
   pre-engagement angular position            (Figure 34  (c)).   And, finally
   the engagement between the coupling 1850 and the drive shaft
   180   is established     ((rotational     force transmitting angular
   position) Figure 34        (d)).
 5  [0331]      An example of this embodiment will be described.
    [0332]      First, the shaft diameter of the drum shaft 153             is
   QZ1,   the shaft diameter of the pin 155 is OZ2,            and the length
   is  Z3   (Figure 7   (a)).    The maximum outer diameter of the
   driven portion 150a of the coupling 150 is QZ4 the diameter of
10 a phantom circle Cl which passes            the inner ends   of the
   projections 150d 1 or 150d 2 or 150d3, 150d4 is OZ5, and the
   maximum outer diameter of the driving portion 150b is TZ6
    (Figure 8    (d),  (f)).    The angle formed between the coupling
   150   and the receiving surface 150f is a2,           and the angle formed
15 between the coupling 150 and the receiving surface              150i is al.
   A  shaft diameter of the drive shaft           180 is @Z7,   the shaft
   diameter of the pin 182 is TZ8,           and the length is Z9     (Figure
   17   (b)).   In addition, the angle relative to the axis Li             in
   the rotational force transmitting angular position is               p1, the
20 angle in the pre-engagement angular position is P2,              and the
   angle in the disengaging angular position is P3.               In this
   example, Z1= 8mm;        Z2= 2mm;    Z3= 12mm;   Z4= 15mm;   Z5= 10mm;   Z6=
   19mm;   Z7= 8mm;   Z8= 2mm;      Z9= 14mm ;   al= 70 degrees;   a2= 120
   degrees;    P1= 0 degree;      P2= 35 degrees;    P3= 30 degrees.
25  [0333]      It has been confirmed with these settings, the
   engagement between the coupling 150 and the drive shaft                180 is
   possible.      However, these settings do not         limit the present
   invention.      In addition, the coupling 150 can transmit the
   rotational force to the drum 107 with high precision.                The
30 values given above are the examples, and the present invention
   is not    limited to these values.
   11849383 1                                                        902028D4

                                 - 88
   [0334]     In addition, in this embodiment, the pin   (the
   rotational force applying portion) 182 is disposed in the
   range of 5mm from the free end of the drive shaft 180.      In
   addition, the rotational force receiving surface    (rotational
 5 force receiving surface) 150e provided in the projection 150d
   is disposed at the range of 4mm from the free end of the
   coupling 150.   In this manner, the pin 182 is disposed at the
   free end side of the drive shaft 180 in addition, the
   rotational force receiving surface 150e is disposed at the
10 free end side of the coupling 150.
   [03351     By this, at the time of mounting the cartridge     (B)
   to the apparatus main assembly   (A), the drive shaft 180 and
   the coupling 150 can engage smoothly with each other.      In more
   detail, the pin 182 and the rotational force receiving surface
15 150e can engage smoothly with each other.
   [03361     In addition, at the time of demounting the cartridge
    (B) from the apparatus main assembly (A),  the drive shaft 180
   and the coupling 150 can disengage smoothly from each other.
   More particularly, the pin 182 and the rotational force
20 receiving surface 150e can disengage smoothly from each other.
   [0337]     The values are the examples, and the present
   invention is not limited to these values.    However, the
   effects described above are further enhance(d) by the pin
    (rotational force applying portion) 182 and the rotational
25 force receiving surface 150e being disposed in these numerical
   value ranges.
   [03381     As described in the foregoing, in the described
   embodiment, the coupling member 150 is capable of taking the
   rotational force transmitting angular position for
30 transmitting the rotational force for rotating the
   11849383 1                                             902028D4

                                 - 89
   electrophotographic photosensitive drum to the
   electrophotographic photosensitive drum and the disengaging
   angular position in which the coupling member 150 is inclined
   away from the axis of the electrophotographic photosensitive
 5 drum from the rotational force transmitting angular position.
   When the process cartridge is dismounted from the main
   assembly of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus in
   a direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of the
   electrophotographic photosensitive drum, the coupling member
10 moves from the rotational force transmitting angular position
   to the disengaging angular position.   When the process
   cartridge is mounted to the main assembly of the
   electrophotographic image forming apparatus in a direction
   substantially perpendicular to the axis of the
15 electrophotographic photosensitive drum, the coupling member
   moves from the disengaging angular position to the rotational
   force transmitting angular position.   This applies to the
   following embodiments, although the following embodiment 2 is
   related with the dismounting only.
20 [Embodiment 2]
   [03391     Referring to Figure 35 - Figure 40, the second
   embodiment to which applied the present invention will be
   described.
25 [0340]     In the description of this embodiment, the same
   reference numerals as in Embodiment 1 are assigned to the
   elements having the corresponding functions in this
   embodiment, and the detailed description thereof is omitted
   for simplicity.   This applies also about the other embodiment
30 described in the below.
   11849383 1                                            902028D4

                                   - 90
   [0341]      The this embodiment is effective not only for the
   case of the mounting and the dismounting of the cartridge           (B)
   relative to the apparatus main assembly        (A) but also the case
   of the dismounting only of the cartridge        (B) from the
 5 apparatus main assembly    (A).
   [0342]      More particularly, when the drive shaft 180        stops,
   the drive shaft    180 is stopped with the predetermined phase by
   the control of the apparatus main assembly        (A) in other words,
   it stops so that the pin 182 may become at a predetermined
10 position.    Moreover, the phase of the coupling 14150        (150) is
   set in alignment with the phase of the stopped drive shaft 180
   for example,   the position of standing-by portion 14150k         (150k)
   is  set so that it may align with the stop position of the pin
   182 with such a setting, at the time of mounting the cartridge
15  (B) to the apparatus main assembly     (A),  even if the coupling
   14150   (150) is not pivoted, it will become in the state of
   being opposed to the drive shaft 180.        And, the rotational
   force from the drive shaft    180 is  transmitted to the coupling
   14150   (150) by the drive shaft   180 rotating.     By this, the
20 coupling 14150    (150) can rotate with high precision.
   [0343]      However, this embodiment is effective at the time of
   demounting the cartridge    (B) from the apparatus main assembly
    (A) by moving in the direction substantially perpendicular to
   the direction of the axis L3.      This is because$ even if the
25 drive shaft   180 stops with the predetermined phase, the pin
   182  and rotational force receiving surface 14150el,        14150e2
    (150e)  are in engagement relative to each other.        For this
   reason, in order to disengage the coupling 14150         (150) from
   the drive shaft    180, the coupling 14150     (150) needs to pivot.
30 [0344]      In addition, in the embodiment 1 described above, at
   the time of mounting the cartridge      (B) to the apparatus main
   11849383 1                                                   902028D4

                                     -   91
   assembly    (A) and at the time of demounting it, the coupling
   14150    (150) pivots.    Therefore, the control of the apparatus
   main assembly     (A) described above is unnecessary, and, at the
   time of mounting the cartridge         (B) to the apparatus main
 5 assembly    (A),  it is not necessary to set the phase of the
   coupling 14150      (150) in accordance with the phase of the
   stopped drive shaft 180 beforehand.
   [0345]       The description will be made referring to the
   drawing.
10 [0346]       Figure 35 is   a perspective view which illustrates
   the phase control means for the drive shaft, the driving gear,
   and the drive shaft of the apparatus main assembly.             Figure 36
   is  a perspective view and a top plan view of the coupling.
   Figure 37 is     a perspective view which illustrates the mounting
15 operation of the cartridge.         Figure 38   is a top plan view, as
   seen from the direction of the mounting direction at the time
   of the cartridge mounting.        Figure 39 is a perspective view
   which illustrates      in the state of the drive stop of the
   cartridge     (the photosensitive drum).       Figure 40  is a
20 longitudinal sectional view and a perspective view which
   illustrate the operation for taking out the cartridge.
   [0347]       In this embodiment, the description will be made
   about the cartridge detachably mountable to apparatus main
   assembly    (A) provided with the control means        (unshown) which
25 can control the phase of the stop position of the pin 182.
   The one end side      (an unshown photosensitive drum 107       side) of
   the drive shaft      180 is the same as that of the first
   embodiment, as shown in Figure 35         (a),  and therefore, the
   description is omitted.       On the other hand, as shown in Figure
30 35  (b),   the other end side    (the opposite side of the unshown
   photosensitive drum 107      side) is provided with a flag 14195
   11849383 1                                                     902028D4

                                  -  92
   projected from the drive shaft     180 outer periphery of the
   drive shaft  180.  And, the flag 14195 passes through the
   photo-interruptor 14196 fixed to the apparatus main assembly
    (A) by the rotation thereof.    And, a control means   (unshown)
 5 effects the control, so that after the rotation      (for example,
   image forming rotation) of the drive shaft 180,     when the flag
   14195 interrupts the photo-interruptor 14196 first, a motor
   186 stops.   By this, the pin 182    stops at a predetermined
   position relative to the rotation axis of the drive shaft 180.
10 As  for the motor 186, in the case of this embodiment, it is
   desirably a stepping motor with which the positioning control
   is easy.
   [0348]     Referring to Figure 36,    the coupling used in this
   embodiment will be described.
15 [0349]     The coupling 14150 mainly comprises three portions.
   As  shown in Figure 36  (c), they are a driven portion 14150a
   for receiving the rotational force from the drive shaft        180, a
   driving portion 14150b for transmitting the rotational force
   to the drum shaft 153,   and a connecting portion 14150c which
20 connects the driven portion 14150a and the driving portion
   14150b with each other.
   [0350]     The driven portion 14150a has a drive shaft
   inserting portion 14150m constituted by      2 surfaces which
   expand in a direction away from an axis L2.      In addition, the
25 driving portion 14150b has a drum shaft inserting portion
   14150v constituted in the two surfaces which expand away from
   the axis L2.
   [0351]     The inserting portion 14150m has    a tapered driving
   shaft receiving surfaces 14150f 1 or 14150f2.      And, each end
30 surface is provided with a projection 14150d 1 or 14150d2.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                    -  93
   The projections 14150d 1 or 14150d2 are disposed on a
   circumference about the axis L2 of the coupling 14150.           The
   receiving surfaces 14150f 1, 14150f2 constitute a recess
   14150z, as shown in the Figure.        In addition, as shown in
 5 Figure 36   (d), the downstream of the projection 14150d
   1,14150d2 with respect to the clockwise direction is provided
   with a rotational force receiving surface        (rotational force
   receiving portion) 14150e      (14150el, 14150e2).    A pin
    (rotational force applying portion) 182 abuts to this
10 receiving surface 14150el, 14150e2.        By this, the rotational
   force is transmitted to the coupling 14150.         An interval    (W)
   between the adjacent projections 14150d1-d2 is larger than the
   outer diameter of the pin 182, in order to permit the entrance
   of the pin 182.    This interval is the standing-by portions
15 14150k.
   [0352]     In addition, the inserting portion 14150v is
   constituted by the two surfaces 14150il, 14150 i2.          And, the
   standby openings 14150g 1 or 14150g2 are provided in these
   surfaces 14150il, 14150 i2      (the Figure 36a Figure 36e).       In
20 addition, in Figure 36    (e),   at the upstream of the openings
   14150g 1 or 14150g2 with respect to the clockwise direction, a
   rotational force transmission surface       (rotational force
   transmitting portion) 14150h (14150h 1 or 14150h2) is
   provided.    And, as described above, the pin      (the rotational
25 force receiving portion) 155a contacts with the rotational
   force transmission surfaces 14150h 1 or 14150h2.         By this, the
   rotational force is transmitted to the photosensitive drum 107
   from the coupling 14150.
   [03531     With the shape of coupling 1415, the coupling is
30 over the free end of the driving shaft in the state that the
   cartridge is mounted to the main assembly of the apparatus.

   [0354]      And, with the similar structure as the structure
   described by the first embodiment, the coupling 14150 can be
   inclined in any direction relative to the drum shaft 153.
   [03551      Referring to Figure 37       and Figure 38,  a mounting
 5 operation of the coupling will be described.           Figure 37   (a) is
   a perspective view which illustrates the state            before the
   coupling is mounted.       Figure 37    (b) is  a perspective view
   which illustrates     the state     where the coupling engaged.
   Figure 38    (a) is a top plan view thereof, as seen from the
10 mounting direction.      Figure 38    (b) is   a top plan view thereof,
   as seen from the top relative to the mounting direction.
   [03561      An axis L3 of the pin       (rotational force applying
   portion) 182     is parallel to the mounting direction X4 by the
   control means described above.         In addition, as to the
15 cartridge, the phase aligns so that the receiving surfaces
   14150f 1 and 14150f2 are opposite from each other in the
   direction perpendicular to the mounting direction X4
    (Figure 37   (a)).   As a structure for aligning the phase, any
   one side of the receiving surfaces 14150f 1 or 14150f2 is
20 aligned with a mark 14157z provided on the bearing member
   14157,  as shown in the Figure, for example.          This is  carried
   out before shipping the cartridge from the plant.           However,
   the user may carry out, before mounting the cartridge           (B) to
   the apparatus main assembly.        In addition, other phase
25 adjusting means may be used.        By doing so,    the coupling 14150
   and the drive shaft 180      (the pin 182)     are not interfered with
   each other with respect to the mounting direction, as shown in
   Figure 38    (a),  in the positional relation.       Therefore, the
   coupling 14150     and the drive shaft 180      are engageable without
30 the problem     (Figure 37  (b)).   And, the drive shaft    180 rotates
   in the direction X8,     so that the pin 182 contacts to the
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

                                    - 95
   receiving surface 14150el, 14150e2.       By this, the rotational
   force is transmitted to the photosensitive drum 107.
   [0357]      Referring to Figure 39 and Figure 40,    the
   description will be made as to the operation in which the
 5 coupling 14150 disengages from the drive shaft 180 in
   interrelation with the operation for taking out the cartridge
    (B) from the apparatus main assembly (A).      The phase of the
   pin 182 relative to the drive shaft 180 stops at the
   predetermined position by the control means.       As described
10 above, when the easiness of the mounting of the cartridge        (B)
   is considered, it is desirable for the pin 182 to stop with
   the phase parallel to the cartridge dismounting direction X6
    (Figure 39b).    The operation at the time of taking out the
   cartridge    (B) is illustrated in Figure 40.    In this state
15  (Figure 40(al) and(bl)),    the coupling 14150 takes the
   rotational force transmitting angular position and the axis L2
   and the axis Li are substantially co-axial with each other.
   At this time, similarly to the case of mounting the cartridge
    (B), the coupling 14150 can be inclined in any direction
20 relative to the drum shaft 153        (Figure 40 al, Figure 40 bl).
   Therefore, the axis L2 inclines in the direction opposite from
   the dismounting direction relative to the axis Li in
   interrelation with the dismounting operation of the cartridge
    (B).  More particularly, the cartridge     (B) is demounted in the
25 direction    (the direction of the arrow X6) substantially
   perpendicular to the axis L3.      And, in the dismounting process
   of the cartridge, the axis L2 is inclined until the free end
   14150 A3 of the coupling 14150 becomes along the free end 180b
   of the drive shaft 180     (the disengaging angular position).
30 Or, it is inclined until the axis L2 comes to the drum shaft
   153 side with respect to the free end portion 180b3       (Figure
   40(a2),   Figure 40 (b2)).   In this state, the coupling 14150 is
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                  - 96
   passed by near the free end portion 180b3.      By doing so,    the
   coupling 14150 is demounted from the drive shaft 180.
   [03581     In addition, as shown in Figure 39     (a), the axis of
   the pin 182 may stop in the state perpendicular to the
 5 cartridge dismounting direction X6.      The pin 182 usually stops
   at the position shown in Figure 39     (b) by the control of the
   control means.    However, the voltage source of the device       (the
   printer) may become OFF and the control means may not work.
   The pin 182 may stop at the position as shown in Figure 39         (a)
10 in such a case.    However, even in such a case, the axis L2 is
   inclined relative to the axis Li similarly to the above
   described case, and the removal operation is possible.        When
   the device is in the state of the drive stop, the pin 182 is
   in the downstream beyond the projection 14150d2 with respect
15 to the dismounting direction X6.     Therefore, the free end
   14150 A3 of the projection 14150dl of the coupling passes the
   drum shaft 153 side beyond the pin 182 by the axis L2
   inclining.   By this, the coupling 14150 is demounted from the
   drive shaft 180.
20 [03591     As has been described hereinbefore, even if it is
   the case where the coupling 14150 is engaged relative to the
   drive shaft 180 by a certain method on the occasion of the
   mounting of the cartridge    (B)   the axis L2 inclines relative
   to the axis Li in the case of the dismounting operation.         By
25 this, the coupling 14150 can be demounted from the drive shaft
   180 only by such dismounting operation.
   [03601     As has been described hereinbefore, according to
   this embodiment 2, this embodiment is effective even for the
   case of demounting the cartridge from the main assembly of the
30 apparatus, in addition to the case of mounting and demounting
   the cartridge   (B) relative to the apparatus main assembly (A).
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

   [Embodiment   31
   [0361]      Referring to Figure 41  -  Figure 45,  a third
   embodiment will be described.
 5 [0362]      Figure 41 is a sectional view which illustrates      a
   state where a door of an apparatus main assembly A is       open.
   Figure 42 is   a perspective view which illustrates a mounting
   guide.    Figure 43 is the enlarged view of a driving side
   surface of the cartridge.    Figure 44    is a perspective view, as
10 seen from a driving side, of the cartridge.       Figure 45 shows a
   view which illustrates   a state of inserting the cartridge into
   an apparatus main assembly.
   [03631      In this embodiment, for example,    as in the case of
   the clamshell type image forming device, the cartridge is
15 mounted downwardly.    A typical clamshell type image    forming
   apparatus is   shown in Figure 41.    The  apparatus main assembly
   A2  comprises a lower casing D2 and an upper casing E2.       And,
   the upper casing E2 is provided with a door 2109 and an inside
   exposure device 2101 of the door 2109.       Therefore, when the
20 upper casing E2 is   opened upward, the exposure device 2101
   retracts.    And, an upper portion of the cartridge set portion
   2130a is   opened.  When the user mounts the cartridge B-2      to a
   set portion 2130a, the user drops the cartridge B-2 on X4B
   downward.    The mounting completes with this, and therefore,
25 the mounting of the cartridge is easy.       In addition, the jam
   clearance operation of the adjacent a fixing device 105 can
   effect from the device upper portion.       Therefore, it excels in
   the easiness   of the jam clearance.    Here, the jam clearance is
   the operation for a removing a recording material 102       jammed
30 in the course of the feeding.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                 - 98
   [0364]     More specifically, the set portion for the cartridge
   B-2 will be described.   As shown in Figure 42, the image
   forming device A2 is provided with a mounting guide 213CR in a
   driving side, and is provided with a mounting guide unshown in
 5 a non-driving side opposed to it    As mounting means 2130.
   The set portion 2130a is formed as the space surrounded by the
   guides to oppose.   The rotational force is transmitted to the
   coupling 150 of the cartridge B-2 provided at this set portion
   2130a from the apparatus main assembly A.
10 [03651     The mounting guide 213CR is provided with a groove
   2130b which extends in the perpendicular direction
   substantially.   In addition, an abutting portion 2130Ra for
   determining the cartridge B-2 at the predetermined position is
   provided in the lowermost portion thereof.   In addition, a
15 drive shaft 180 projects from the groove 2130b.   In the state
   where the cartridge B-2 is positioned in the predetermined
   position, the drive shaft 180 transmits the rotational force
   to the coupling 150 from the apparatus main assembly A.     In
   addition, in order to position the cartridge B-2 in the
20 predetermined position assuredly, an urging spring 2188R is
   provided in the lower part of the mounting guide 2130R.     By
   the structure described above, the cartridge B-2 is positioned
   in the set portion 2130a.
   [03661     As shown in Figure 43 and Figure 44, the cartridge
25 B-2 is provided with the cartridge side mounting guides 2140R1
   and 2140R2.   The orientation of the cartridge B-2 is
   stabilized by this guide at the time of the mounting.    And,
   the mounting guide 2140R1 is integrally formed on the drum
   bearing member 2157.   In addition, the mounting guide 2140R2
30 is provided substantially above the mounting guide 2140R1.
   And, the guide 2140R2 is provided in the second frame 2118,
   and it is in the form of a rib.
   11849383 1                                            902028D4

                                 - 99
   [0367]     The mounting guides 2140R1, 2140R2 of the cartridge
   B-2 and the mounting guide 213CR of the apparatus main
   assembly A2 have the structures described above.    More
   particularly, it is the same as that of the structure of the
 5 guide which has been described in conjunction with Figs. 2 and
   3.   In addition, the structure of the guide of the other end
   is also the same.   Therefore, the cartridge B-2 is mounted
   while being moved to the apparatus main assembly A2 in the
   direction substantially perpendicular to the direction of the
10 axis L3 of the drive shaft 180, and, in addition, it is
   similarly demounted from the apparatus main assembly A2.
   [03681     As shown in Figure 45,  at the time of mounting the
   cartridge B-2, the upper casing E2 is clockwisely rotated
   about a shaft 2109a and, the user brings the cartridge B-2 to
15 the upper portion of the lower casing D2.    At this time, the
   coupling 150 is inclined downwardly by the weight Figure 43.
   In other words, the axis L2 of the coupling inclines relative
   to the drum axis Li so that the driven portion 150a of the
   coupling 150 may face down the pre-engagement angular
20 position.
   [03691     In addition, as has been described with respect to
   Embodiment 1, Figures 9 and 12,   it is desirable to provide the
   semi-circular retention rib 2157e Figure 43.    In this
   embodiment, the mounting direction of the cartridge B-2 is
25 downward.   Therefore, the rib 2157e is disposed in the lower
   part.   By this, as has been described with respect to
   Embodiment 1, the axis Li and the axis L2 are pivotable
   relative to each other, and the retention of the coupling 150
   is accomplished.   The retention rib prevents the coupling 150
30 from separating from the cartridge B-2.    When the coupling 150
   is mounted to the photosensitive drum 107,   it is preventing
   separation from the photosensitive drum 107k.
   11849383 1                                             902028D4

                                   -  100
   [0370]       In this state, as shown in Figure 45,    the user
   lowers the cartridge B-2 downwardly, aligning the mounting
   guides 2140R1,     2140R2 of the cartridge B-2 with the mounting
   guides 213CR of the apparatus main assembly A2.        The  cartridge
 5 B-2  can be mounted to the set portion 2130a of the apparatus
   main assembly A2 only by this operation.        In this mounting
   process, similarly to Embodiment 1, Figure 22,       the coupling
   150  can be engaged with the drive shaft 180      of the apparatus
   main assembly     (the coupling takes the rotational force
10 transmitting angular position in this state).        More
   particularly, by moving in cartridge B-2 in the direction
   substantially perpendicular to the direction of the axis L3 of
   the drive shaft     180, the coupling 150   is engaged with the
   drive shaft    180.   In addition, at the time of demounting the
15 cartridge, similarly to Embodiment 1,       the coupling 150 can be
   disengaged from the drive shaft      180 only by the operation
   which demounts the cartridge      (the coupling moves to the
   disengaging angular position from the rotational force
   transmitting angular position, Figure 25).        More particularly,
20 by moving the cartridge B-2     in the direction substantially
   perpendicular to the direction of the axis L3 of the drive
   shaft   180,  the coupling 150  is disengaged from the drive shaft
   180.
   [0371]       As has been described hereinbefore, since the
25 coupling inclines downwardly by the weight when downwardly
   mounting the cartridge to the apparatus main assembly, it can
   engage with the drive shaft of the apparatus main assembly
   assuredly.
   [0372]       In this embodiment, the clamshell type image forming
30 device has been described.      However, the present invention is
   not limited to such an example.        For example, the present
   embodiment can be applied if the mounting direction of the
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                  - 101
   cartridge is downward.     In addition, the mounting path thereof
   is not   limited to straight downward.     For example, it may be
   inclined downward in initial mounting stage of the cartridge,
   and it may become downward finally.       The present embodiment is
 5 effective if the mounting path immediately before reaching the
   predetermined position    (the cartridge set portion) is
   downward.
   [Embodiment    4]
10 [0373]      Referring to Figure 46 -   Figure 49, the fourth
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0374]      In this embodiment, means to maintain the axis L2 at
   the inclined state relative to the axis Li will be described.
   [0375]      Only the member relating to the description of this
15 portion of the present embodiment is      shown in the drawing, and
   the other members are omitted.      It is  similar also in the
   other embodiments as will be described hereinafter.
   [0376]      Figure 46 is  a perspective view which illustrates a
   coupling locking member    (this is peculiar to the present
20 embodiment) pasted on the drum bearing member.       Figure 47   is
   an exploded perspective view which illustrates the drum
   bearing member, the coupling, and the drum shaft.       Figure 48
   is  an enlarged perspective view of a major part of the driving
   side of the cartridge.     Figure 49 is a perspective view and a
25 longitudinal sectional view which illustrate an engaged state
   between the drive shaft and the coupling.
   [0377]      As  shown in Figure 46,  the drum bearing member 3157
   has  a space   3157b which surrounds a part of coupling.     A
   coupling locking member 3159 as a maintaining member for
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                 - 102
   maintaining the inclination of the coupling 3150 is pasted on
   a cylinder surface 3157i which constitutes the space thereof.
   As will be described hereinafter, this locking member 3159 is
   a member for maintaining temporarily the state where the axis
 5 L2 inclines relative to the axis Li.     In other words, as shown
   in Figure 48, the flange portion 3150j    of the coupling 3150
   contacts to this  locking member 3159.    By this,  the axis L2
   maintains the state of inclining toward the downstream with
   respect to the mounting direction    (X4) of the cartridge
10 relative to the axis Li   (Figure 49  (al)).  Therefore, as shown
   in Figure 46, the locking member 3159 is disposed on the
   upstream cylinder surface 3157i of the bearing member 3157
   with respect to the mounting direction X4.      As the material of
   the locking member 3159, the material which has     a relatively
15 high coefficient of friction, such as the rubber and the
   elastomer, or the elastic materials,    such as the sponge and
   the flat spring, are suitable.    This  is because, the
   inclination of the axis L2 can be maintained by the frictional
   force, the elastic force, and so on.     In addition, similarly
20 to Embodiment 1  (it illustrates  in Figure 31),   the bearing
   member 3157 is provided with the inclining direction
   regulation rib 3157h.   The  inclining direction of the coupling
   3150 can be assuredly determined by this rib 3157h.       In
   addition, the flange portion 3150j    and the locking member 3159
25 can contact relative to each other more assuredly.      Referring
   to Figure 47, the assembly method of the coupling 3150 will be
   described.  As shown in Figure 47,    the pin  (rotational force
   receiving portion) 155 enters the standing-by space     3150g of
   the coupling 3150.   In addition, a part of coupling 3150 is
30 inserted into the space portion 3157b which the drum bearing
   member 3157 has.   At this time, preferably, a distance D12
   between an inner surface end of the rib 3157e and the locking
   member 3159 is set,  so that it is   larger than maximum outer
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                   - 103
   diameter of the driven portion 3150a        TD10.   In addition, the
   distance D12 is set so that it is      smaller than the maximum
   outer diameter of the driving portion 3150b         TDl1.    By this,
   the bearing member 3157 can be assembled straight.           Therefore,
 5 the assembling property is     improved.    However, the present
   embodiment is not    limited to this relation.
   [0378]      Referring to Figure 49,    the engaging operation       (a
   part of mounting operation of the cartridge) for engaging the
   coupling 3150 with the drive shaft 180 will be described.
10 Figures 49    (al) and  (bl) illustrate the state immediately
   before the engagement, and Figure 49       (a2) and   (b2) illustrate
   the state of the completion of the engagement.
   [0379]      As  shown in Figure 49   (al) and Figure 49     (bl),   the
   axis L2 of the coupling 3150 inclines toward the downstream
15 with respect to the mounting direction X4 relative to the axis
   Li beforehand by the force of the locking member 3159           (pre
   engagement angular position).      By this inclination of the
   coupling 3150, by, in the direction of the axis Li,          the
   downstream    (with respect to the mounting direction) free end
20 portion 3150A1 is    closer to the photosensitive drum 107
   direction side than the drive shaft free end 180b3.            And, the
   upstream   (with respect to the mounting direction) free end
   portion 3150A2 is    closer to the pin 182 than the free end
   180b3 of the drive shaft 180     in addition, at this time, as has
25 been described in the foregoing, the flange portion 3150j            is
   contacted to the locking member 3159.        And, the inclined state
   of the axis L2 is maintained by the frictional         force thereof.
   [0380]      Thereafter, the cartridge B moves to the mounting
   direction X4.     By this, the free end surface 180b or the free
30 end of the pin 182     contacts to the driving shaft receiving
   surface 3150f of the coupling 3150.       And, the axis L2
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

                                      -  104
   approaches to the direction in parallel with the axis Li             by
   the contact force       (mounting force of the cartridge) thereof.
   At this time, the flange portion 3150j          is departed from the
   locking member 3159, and becomes into the non-contact state.
 5 And, finally, the axis Li        and the axis L2 are substantially
   co-axial with each other.         And, the coupling 3150 is     in the
   waiting    (stand-by) state for transmitting the rotational          force
    (Figure 49    (a2),  (b2)).  (rotational force transmitting angular
   position).
10 [0381]       Similarly to Embodiment 1,       from the motor 186, the
   rotational force      is transmitted through the drive shaft        180 to
   the coupling 3150,       the pin  (rotational force receiving
   portion) 155,     the drum shaft 153,     and the photosensitive drum
   107.   The axis L2 is substantially co-axial with the axis Li
15 at the time of the rotation.          Therefore, the locking member
   3159 is not     in contact with the coupling 3150.        Therefore, the
   locking member 3159 does not affect the rotation of the
   coupling 3150.
   [0382]       In addition, the operations       follow the step similar
20 to Embodiment 1 in the process in which the cartridge B is
   taken out from the apparatus main assembly A           (Figure 25).     In
   other words,     the free end portion 180b of the drive shaft 180
   pushes the driving shaft receiving surface 3150f of the
   coupling 3150.       By this, the axis L2     inclines relative to the
25 axis Li,    and the flange portion 3150j       is brought into contact
   to the locking member 3159.          By this,  the inclined state of
   the coupling 3150 is maintained again.           In other words, the
   coupling 3150 moves to the pre-engagement angular position
   from the rotational force transmitting angular position.
30 [0383]       As has been described hereinbefore, the inclined
   state of the axis L2 is maintained by the locking member 3159
   11849383 1                                                     902028D4

                                   - 105
    (maintaining member).     By this, the coupling 3150 can be more
   assuredly engaged with the drive shaft 180.
   [0384]      In this embodiment, the locking member 3159 is
   pasted on the upstreammost portion, with respect to cartridge
 5 mounting direction X4,     of the inner surface 3157i of the
   bearing member 3157.     However, the present invention is not
   limited to this example.      For example, when the axis L2
   inclines, any position which can maintain the inclined state
   thereof is usable.
10 [03851      In addition, in this embodiment, the locking member
   3159 is   contacted to the flange portion 3150j provided in the
   driving portion 3150b     (Figure 49  (bl)) side.   However, the
   contact position may be the driven portion 3150a.
   [03861      In addition, the locking member 3159 used in this
15 embodiment is    a separate member in the bearing member 3157.
   However, the present embodiment is not limited to this
   example.    For example,   the locking member 3159 may be
   integrally molded with the bearing member 3157        (for example,
   two-color molding).     Or, the bearing member 3157 may be
20 directly contacted to the coupling 3150 in place of the
   locking member 3159.     Or the surface thereof may be roughened
   for the purpose of raising the coefficient of friction.
   [0387]      In addition, in this embodiment, the locking member
   3159 is pasted on the bearing member 3157.        However, if the
25 locking member 3159 is     the member fixed to the cartridge B,      it
   may be pasted on any position.

   [03881     Referring to Figure 50    -Figure 53,  the fifth
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [03891     In the present embodiment, another means for
   maintaining in the state of inclining the axis L2 relative to
 5 the axis Li   will be described.
   [03901     Figure 50 is   an exploded perspective view of the
   coupling urging member    (it is peculiar to the present
   embodiment) mounted to the drum bearing member.       Figure 51     is
   an exploded perspective view which illustrates the drum
10 bearing member, the coupling, and the drum shaft.        Figure 52
   is  an enlarged perspective view of a major part of the driving
   side of the cartridge.     Figure 53  is a perspective view and a
   longitudinal sectional view which illustrate the drive shaft
   and the engaged state between the coupling.
15 [0391]     As  shown in Figure 50,   a retaining hole 4157j    is
   provided in the retention rib 4157e of the drum bearing member
   4157.   A coupling urging members 4159a, 4159b as a maintaining
   member for maintaining the inclination of the coupling 4150 in
   the retaining hole 4157j    thereof are mounted.    The urging
20 members 4159a, 4159b urge the coupling 4150,      so that the axis
   L2 inclines toward the downstream with respect to the mounting
   direction of the cartridge B-2 relative to the axis Li.          Each
   urging member 4159a, 4159b is a coiled compression spring
    (elastic material).   As  shown in Figure 51,   the urging members
25 4159a, 4159b urge the flange portion 4150j      of the coupling
   4150 toward the axis Li    (arrow of Figure 51   an X13).    The
   contact position where the urging members contact with the
   flange portion 4150j   is  the downstream of the center of the
   drum shaft  153 with respect to the cartridge mounting
30 direction X4.    Therefore, as for the axis L2,    the driven
   portion 4150a side inclines toward the downstream with respect
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                  - 107
   to the mounting direction    (X4) of the cartridge relative to
   the axis Li   by the elastic force by the urging member 4159a,
   4159b   (Figure 52).
   [0392]      In addition, as shown in Figure 50,  the coupling
 5 side free end of each urging member 4159a, 4159b which is      the
   coil spring is provided with a contact member 4160a, 4160b.
   The contact member 4160a, 4160b contacts the flange portion
   4150j.    Therefore, the material of the contact member 4160a,
   4160b is preferably material of the high slidability.      In
10 addition, by using such the material, as will be described
   hereinafter,   at the time of the rotational  force transmission,
   the influence to the rotation of the coupling 4150 of an
   urging force by the urging member 4159a, 4159b is lessened.
   However, if the load relative to the rotation is    sufficiently
15 small, and the coupling 4150 satisfactorily rotates, the
   contact members 4160a, 4160b is not be inevitable).
   [03931      In the present embodiment, two urging members are
   provided.    However, if the axis L2 can incline toward the
   downstream with respect to the mounting direction of the
20 cartridge relative to the axis Li,    the number of the urging
   members may be any.    For example, in the case of the single
   urging member, as for the energizing position, it is desirably
   the downstreammost position with respect to the mounting
   direction X4   of the cartridge.   By this, the coupling 4150 can
25 be stably inclined toward the downstream with respect to the
   mounting direction.
   [0394]      In addition, the urging member is  a compression coil
   spring in the present embodiment.     However, as the urging
   member, if an elastic force can be produced as with the flat
30 spring, the torsion spring, the rubber, the sponge, and so on,
   it may be any.    However, in order to incline the axis L2,    a
   11849383 1                                              902028D4

                                    - 108
   certain amount of stroke is      required.    Therefore, as with the
   coil spring etc,    it is desirable that the stroke can be
   provided.
   [03951      Referring to Figure 51,     the description will be made
 5 about the mounting method of the coupling 4150.
   [03961      As  shown in Figure 51,    the pin 155 enters the
   standing-by space 4150g of the coupling 4150.          And, a part of
   coupling 4150 is    inserted into the space 4157b of the drum
   bearing member 4157.     At this time, as has been described
10 hereinbefore, the urging members 4159a, 4159b push the flange
   portion 4157j    onto the predetermined position through the
   contact member 4160a, 4160b.       The screw    (4158a of Figure 52,
   4158b) is threaded into the hole 4157g 1 or 4157g2 provided in
   the bearing member 4157, by which, the            bearing member 4157
15 is  fixed to the second frame 118.       By this, the urging force
   to the coupling 4150 by the urging member 4159a, 4159b can be
   assured.    And, the axis L2    is inclined relative to the axis Li
    (Figure 52).
   [0397]      Referring to Figure 53,     the operation    (a part of
20 mounting operation of the cartridge) of engaging the coupling
   4150 with the drive shaft     180 will be described.       Figure 53
    (al) and  (bi)  illustrate the state immediately before the
   engagement, Figure 53     (a2) and   (b2) illustrate the state of
   the engagement completion, and Figure 53         (c1) illustrates    the
25 state therebetween.
   [03981      In Figure 53   (al)  and  (b1),  the axis L2 of the
   coupling 4150 inclines toward the mounting direction X4
   relative to the axis Li beforehand        (pre-engagement angular
   position).     By the coupling 4150 inclining, the downstream
30 free end position 4150A1 with respect to the direction of the
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

                                   -  109
   axis Li   is closer to the photosensitive drum 107     than the free
   end 180b3.     In addition, the free end position 4150A2 is
   closer to the pin 182 than the free end 180b3.        In other
   words, as has been described hereinbefore, the flange portion
 5 4150j  of the coupling 4150 is pressed by the urging member
   4159.    Therefore, the axis L2 is     inclined relative to the axis
   Li by the urging force thereof.
   [03991      Thereafter, by the cartridge B moving to the
   mounting direction X4,    the free end surface 180b or the free
10 end  (the main assembly side engaging portion) of the pin
    (rotational force applying portion) 182 is brought into
   contact to the driving shaft receiving surface 4150f or the
   projection 4150d of the coupling 4150       (the cartridge side
   contact portion).     Figure 53   (c1)  illustrates the state where
15 the pin 182    is in contact with the receiving surface 4150f.
   And, the axis L2 approaches     toward the direction in parallel
   with the axis Li    by the contact force    (mounting force of the
   cartridge).     Simultaneously, the pressing portion 4150jl
   pressed by the elastic force of the spring 4159 provided in
20 the flange portion 4150j moves in the compression direction of
   the spring 4159.     And, finally, the axis Li    and the axis L2
   becomes co-axial.     And, the coupling 4150 takes    the standby
   position for effecting the transmission of the rotational
   force   (Figure (rotational force transmitting angular position)
25 53  (a2, b2)).
   [0400]      Similarly to Embodiment 1, the rotational     force is
   transmitted to the coupling 4150,       the pin 155, the drum shaft
   153,  and the photosensitive drum 107 through the drive shaft
   180  from the motor 186.    The urging force of the urging member
30 4159 act on the coupling 4150 at the time of the rotation.
   However, as has been described hereinbefore, the urging force
   of the urging member 4159 act to the coupling 4150 through the
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                  -  110
   contact member 4160.     Therefore, the coupling 4150 can be
   rotated without high load.     In addition, the contact member
   4160 may not be provided if the driving torque of the motor
   186 is   sufficiently large.   In this case, even if the contact
 5 member 4160 is not provided, the coupling 4150 can transmit
   the rotational force with high precision.
    [0401]     In addition, in the process in which the cartridge B
   is demounted from the apparatus main assembly A,       the step
   opposite from the step to mount     is followed.    In other words,
10 the coupling 4150 is normally urged to the downstream with
   respect to the mounting direction X4 by the urging member
   4159.   Therefore, in the dismounting process of the cartridge
   B,  the receiving surface 4150f is    in contact with the free end
   portion 182A of the pin 182    in the upstream side with respect
15 to the mounting direction X4     (Figure 53  (ci)).   In addition, a
   gap n50   is necessarily provided between the free end 180b of
   the transmitting surface 4150f and the drive shaft       180 in the
   downstream with respect to the mounting direction X4.         In the
   above-described embodiments, in the dismounting process of the
20 cartridge, the receiving surface 150f     or the projection     150d
   in the downstream with respect to the mounting direction X4 of
   the coupling has been described as contacting to the free end
   portion 180b of the drive shaft     180 at least   (for example,
   Figure 25).    However, as in the present embodiment, the
25 receiving surface 150f    or the projection 4150d in the
   downstream with respect to the mounting direction X4        of the
   coupling does not    contact to the free end portion 180b of the
   drive shaft   180 $,  but corresponding to the dismounting
   operation of the cartridge B,     the coupling 4150 can separate
30 from the drive shaft    180.  And, even after the coupling 4150
   departs from the drive shaft 180,     by the urging force of the
   urging member 4159, the axis L2     inclines toward the downstream
   with respect to the mounting direction X4 relative to the axis
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                 - 111
   Li  (disengaging angular position).   More particularly, in this
   embodiment, the angle of the pre-engagement angular position
   and the angle of the disengaging angular position relative to
   the axis Li  are equivalent relative to each other.   This   is
 5 because the coupling 4150 is urged by the elastic force of the
   spring.
   [0402]     In addition, the urging member 4159 has the function
   of inclining the axis L2,   and it further has the function of
   regulating the inclining direction of the coupling 4150.      More
10 particularly, the urging member 4159 functions also as the
   regulating means   for regulating the inclining direction of the
   coupling 4150.
   [0403]     As has been described hereinbefore, in this
   embodiment, the coupling 4150 is urged by the elastic force of
15 the urging member 4159 provided in the bearing member 4157.
   By this, the axis L2 is   inclined relative to the axis Li.
   Therefore, the inclined state of the coupling 4150 is
   maintained.    Therefore, the coupling 4150 can be assuredly
   engaged with the drive shaft 180.
20 [0404]     The urging member 4159 described in this embodiment
   is provided in the rib 4157e of the bearing member 4157.
   However, the present embodiment is not limited to such an
   example.   For example,  it may be another portion of the
   bearing member 4157 and may be any member fixed to the
25 cartridge B   (other than the bearing member).
   [0405]     In addition, in this embodiment, the urging
   direction of the urging member 4159 is   the direction of the
   axis Li.   However, the urging direction may be any direction
   if the axis L2 inclines toward the downstream with respect to
30 the mounting direction X4 of the cartridge B.
   11849383 1                                             902028D4

                                 - 112
   [0406]      In addition, in order to incline the coupling 4150
   more assuredly toward the downstream with respect to the
   mounting direction of the cartridge B,     a regulating portion
   for regulating the inclining direction of the coupling may be
 5 provided in the process cartridge     (Figure 31).
   [0407]      In addition, in this embodiment, the energizing
   position of the urging member 4159 is     at the flange portion
   4150j.    However, the position of the coupling may be any if
   the axis L2   is inclined toward the downstream with respect to
10 the mounting direction of the cartridge.
   [0408]      In addition, the present embodiment may be
   implemented in combination with Embodiment 4.       In this case,
   the mounting and dismounting operation of the coupling can
   further be ensured.

   [0409]      Referring to Figure 54  -  Figure 58,  the sixth
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0410]      In this embodiment, another means to maintain the
20 state where the axis Li   is inclined relative to the axis Li
   will be described.

   modified example of a coupling locking member.
   [0412]      As  shown in Figure 54 and Figure 56, the drum
   bearing member 5157 is provided with a coupling locking member
 5 5157k.    At the time of assembling the bearing member 5157 in
   the direction of the axis Li,    a part of a locking surface
   5157k1 of the locking member 5157k engages with the upper
   surface 5150jl of a flange portion 5150j,     while contacting to
   the inclined surface 5150m of the coupling 5150.       At this
10 time, the flange portion 5150j    is supported with the play
    (angle a  49),  in the rotational direction, between locking
   surface 5157k1 of the locking portion 5157k, and circular
   column portion of the drum shaft 153      153a.  The following
   effects are provided by providing this play     (angle a49).     More
15 particularly, even if the dimensions of the coupling 5150,         the
   bearing member 5157,    and the drum shaft 153 vary within the
   limits of the tolerance thereof, an upper surface 5150jl can
   be locked assuredly in a lock face 5157kl.
   [0413]      And, as shown in Figure 56   (a), as for the axis L2,
20 the driven portion 5150a side relative to the axis Li       inclines
   toward the downstream with respect to the mounting direction
    (X4) of the cartridge.    In addition, since the flange portion
   5150j  exists over the full-circumference, it can retain
   irrespective of the phase of the coupling 5150.       Furthermore,
25 as has been described with respect to Embodiment 1, the
   coupling 5150 can be inclined only in the mounting direction
   X4 by the regulating portion 5157h 1 or 5157h2      (Figure 55)    as
   the regulating means.     In addition, in this embodiment, the
   coupling locking member 5157k is provided in the
30 downstreammost side with respect to the mounting direction
    (X4) of the cartridge.

                                    -  114
   [0414]      As will be described hereinafter, in the state where
   the coupling 5150 is in engagement the drive shaft             180,   the
   flange portion 5150j    is  released from the locking member 5157k
   as shown in Figure 56     (b).   And, the coupling 5150 is          free
 5 from the locking member 5157k.        When it is not able to retain
   the state of inclining the coupling 5150 in the case of the
   assembling of the bearing member 5157,          the driven portion
   5150a of the coupling is pushed by tool and so on             (Figure 56
    (b),  arrow X14).   By doing so, the coupling 5150 can be easily
10 returned to the inclined holding state          (Figure 56    (a)).
   [0415]      In addition, the rib 5157m is provided in order to
   protect from the user touching on the coupling easily.                The
   rib 5157m is   set to the substantially same height as the free
   end position in the inclined state of the coupling             (Figure 56
15  (a)).   Referring to Figure 57,     the operation      (a part of
   mounting operation of the cartridge)         for engaging the coupling
   5150 with the drive shaft      180 will be described.        In Figure
   57,   (a) illustrates the state of the coupling immediately
   before engaging,    (b) illustrates     the state after a part of
20 coupling 5150 passes the drive shaft         180,   (c) illustrates      the
   state where the inclination of the coupling 5150 is released
   by the drive shaft 180,     and   (d) illustrates the engaged state.
   [0416]      In the states of    (a) and    (b),  the axis L2 of the
   coupling 5150 inclines toward the mounting direction X4
25 relative to the axis Li beforehand         (pre-engagement angular
   position).    By the coupling 5150 inclining, the free end
   position 515OAl is    closer to the photosensitive drum than the
   free end 180b3 in the direction of the axis Li.             In addition,
   the free end position 5150A2 is closer to the pin 182               than the
30 free end 180b3.    In addition, as has been described
   hereinbefore, at this time,      the flange portion 5150j         is in
   11849383 1                                                       902028D4

                                      - 115
   contact with the locking surface 5157k1,           and the inclined
   state of the coupling 5150 is maintained.
   [0417]       Thereafter, as shown in      (c),  the receiving surface
   5150f or the projection 5150d contacts to the free end portion
 5 180b or the pin 182 by the cartridge B moving to the mounting
   direction X4.       The flange portion 5150j     separates from the
   locking surface 5157k1 by the contact force thereof.             And, the
   lock relative to the bearing member 5157 of the coupling 5150
   is   released.     And, in response to the cartridge mounting
10 operation, the coupling is        inclined so that the axis L2
   thereof becomes substantially co-axial with the axis Li.
   After the flange portion 5150j passes,          the locking member
   5157k returns to the previous position by restoring force.               At
   this time, the coupling 5150 is        free from the locking member
15 5157k.     And, finally, as shown in      (d),  the axis Li  and the
   axis L2 become substantially co-axial, and the rotation stand
   by state is established        (rotational force transmitting angular
   position).
   [0418]       In addition, the step similar to Embodiment 1 is
20 followed in the process in which the cartridge B is demounted
   from the apparatus main assembly A          (Figure 25).   More
   particularly, the coupling 5150 is changed in the order of
    (d),  (c),   (b),  and  (a) by the movement in the dismounting
   direction X6      of the cartridge.    First, the free end portion
25 180b pushes the receiving surface 5150f           (the cartridge side
   contact portion).        By this,  the axis L2 inclines relative to
   the axis Li,      and the lower surface 5150j2 of the flange
   portion begins to contact to the inclined surface 5157k2 of
   the locking member 5157k.         And, an elastic portion 5157k3      of
30 the locking member 5157k bends, and a locking surface free end
   5157k4 departs from the inclining locus of the flange portion
   5150j   (Figure 57     (c)).  Furthermore, the flange portion 5150j
   11849383 1                                                     902028D4

                                    -  116
   and the locking surface 5157k1       contact relative to each other
   as the cartridge advances in the dismounting direction           (X6).
   By this, the inclination angle of the coupling 5150 is
   maintained    (Figure 57  (b)).    More particularly, the coupling
 5 5150 is   swung  (pivoted) from the rotational force transmitting
   angular position to the disengaging angular position.
   [0419]      As has been described hereinbefore, the angular
   position of the coupling 5150 is maintained by the locking
   member 5157k.     By this, the inclination angle of the coupling
10 is maintained.     Therefore, the coupling 5150 can be assuredly
   engaged with the drive shaft 180.        Furthermore, at the time of
   the rotation, the locking member 5157k is not in contact with
   the coupling 5150.     Therefore, the stabilized rotation can be
   accomplished by the coupling 5150.
15 [0420]      The motion of the coupling shown in Figures 56,         57
   and 58 may include whirling motion.
   [0421]      In this embodiment, the locking member 5157k is
   provided with an elastic portion.        However, it may be the rib
   which does not have the elastic portion.          More particularly,
20 an amount of engagement between the locking member 5157k and
   the flange portion 5150j     is decreased.      By this, the similar
   effect can be provided by making the flange portion 5150j
   deform to a slight degree      (Figure 58   (a)).
   [0422]      In addition, the locking member 5157k is provided in
25 the downstreammost side with respect to the mounting direction
   X4.   However, if the inclination toward the predetermined
   direction of the axis L2 can be maintained, the position of
   the locking member 5157k may be any.
   11849383 1                                                   902028D4

                                  -  117
   [0423]      Figure 58  (b) and  (c) illustrate the example in
   which the coupling locking portion 5357k      (Figure (58b))   and
   5457k   (Figure 58c) are provided in the upstream with respect
   to the mounting direction X4.
 5 [0424]      In addition, the locking member 5157k has been
   constituted by a part of bearing member 5157 in the above
   described embodiment.     However, if it is fixed to the
   cartridge B,   the locking member 5157k may be constituted as a
   part of a member other than the bearing member.       In addition,
10 the locking member may be a separate member.
   [0425]      In addition, the present embodiment may be
   implemented with Embodiment 4 or Embodiment 5.       In this case,
   the mounting and dismounting operation with the more assured
   coupling is accomplished.
15 [Embodiment   7]
   [0426]      Referring to Figure 59 -   Figure 62,  the seventh
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0427]      In this embodiment, another means for maintaining
20 the axis of the coupling at the inclined state relative to the
   axis of the photosensitive drum will be described.
   [0428]      Figure 59 is  a perspective view which illustrates
   the state of pasting a magnet member     (peculiar to the present
   embodiment) on the drum bearing member.      Figure 60 is   an
25 exploded perspective view.     Figure 61 is an enlarged
   perspective view of a major part of the driving side of the
   cartridge.    Figure 62  is a perspective view and a longitudinal
   sectional view which illustrate the drive shaft and an engaged
   state between the coupling.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                    - 118
    [0429]     As shown in Figure 59,     a drum bearing member 8157
   constitutes a space 8157b which surrounds a part of coupling.
   A magnet member 8159 as a maintaining member for maintaining
   the inclination of the coupling 8150        is pasted on a cylinder
 5 surface 8157i which constitutes the space thereof.         In
   addition, as shown in Figure 59,       the magnet member 8159 is
   provided in the upstream      (with respect to the mounting
   direction X4)    of the cylinder surface 8157i.      As will be
   described hereinafter,     this magnet member 8159 is a member for
10 maintaining temporarily the state where the axis L2        inclines
   relative to the axis Li.       Here, a part of coupling 8150 is
   made of magnetic material.       And, the magnetic portion is
   attracted to the magnet member 8159 by a magnetic force of a
   magnet member 8159.     In this embodiment, the substantially
15 full-circumference of the flange portion 8150j        is made of the
   metal magnetic material 8160.       In other words, as shown in
   Figure 61,   the flange portion 8150j      contacts to this magnet
   member 8159 by the magnetic force.         By this, the axis L2
   maintains the state of inclining toward the downstream with
20 respect to the mounting direction       (X4) of the cartridge
   relative to the axis Li      (Figure 62   (al)).  Similarly to
   Embodiment   1  (Figure 31),   an inclining direction regulation
   rib 8157h is preferably provided in the bearing member 8157.
   The inclining direction of the coupling 8150        is more assuredly
25 determined by provision of the rib 8157h.         And, the flange
   portion 8150j    of magnetic material and the magnet member 8159
   can contact to each other more assuredly.         Referring to Figure
   60,   the description will be made about the assembly method of
   the coupling 8150.
30  [0430]     As shown in Figure 60,     the pin 155 enters a
   standing-by space 8150g of the coupling 8150,        and a part of
   coupling 8150    is inserted into a space portion 8157b of the
   drum bearing member 8157.       At this time, preferably, a
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

                                      - 119
   distance D12 between an inner surface end of a retention rib
   8157e of the bearing member 8157         and the magnet member 8159 is
   larger than the maximum outer diameter of a driven portion
   8150a    TD10.   In addition, the distance D12 is          smaller than
 5 the maximum outer diameter of a driving portion 8150b               oD11.
   By this, the bearing member 8157         can be assembled straight.
   Therefore, the assembling property improves.              However, the
   present embodiment is not limited to this relation.
   [0431]      Referring to Figure 62,       the engaging operation       (a
10 part of mounting operation of the cartridge) for engaging the
   coupling 8150 with the drive shaft 180 will be described.
   Figure 62(al)    and  (bi)  illustrates the state immediately
   before the engagement, and Figure 62          (a2) and    (b2) illustrate
   the state of the engagement completion.
15 [0432]      As  shown in Figure 62      (al) and   (bi),   the axis L2 of
   the coupling 8150     inclines toward the downstream with respect
   to the mounting direction X4 relative to the axis Li
   beforehand by the force of the magnet member             (maintaining
   member) 8159    (pre-engagement angular position).
20 [0433]      Thereafter, the free end surface 180b or the pin 182
   free end contacts to the driving shaft receiving surface 8150f
   of the coupling 8150 by the cartridge B moving to the mounting
   direction X4.     And, the axis L2 approaches        so that it may
   become substantially co-axial with the axis Li             by the contact
25 force   (mounting force of the cartridge) thereof.            At this
   time, the flange portion 8150j        separates from the magnet
   member 8159,    and is in the non-contact state.           And, finally,
   the axis Li    and the axis L2 become substantially co-axial.
   And, the coupling 8150      is in the rotation latency state
30  (Figure 62   (a2),  Figure   (b2))  (rotational force transmitting
   angular position).
   11849383 1                                                       902028D4

                                  - 120
   [0434]      The motion shown in Figure 62 may include whirling
   motion.
   [0435]      As has been described hereinbefore, in this
   embodiment, the inclined state of the axis L2 is maintained by
 5 the magnetic force of the magnet member 8159      (maintaining
   member) pasted on the bearing member 8157.      By this,   the
   coupling can be more assuredly engaged with the drive shaft.
   [Embodiment    8]
10 [0436]      Referring to Figure 63 -   Figure 68,  the eighth
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0437]      In this embodiment, another means to maintain the
   state where the axis L2 is    inclined relative to the axis Li
   will be described.
15 [0438]      Figure 63 is  a perspective view which illustrates a
   driving side of a cartridge.     Figure 64 is  an exploded
   perspective view which illustrates a state before assembling a
   drum bearing member.     Figure 65  is a schematic longitudinal
   sectional view of a drum shaft, a coupling, and a drum bearing
20 member.    Figure 66 is a perspective view which illustrates a
   driving side of an apparatus main assembly guide.       Figure 67
   is  a longitudinal sectional view which illustrates
   disengagement of a lock member.      Figure 68 is a longitudinal
   sectional view which illustrates     the engaging operation of the
25 coupling to the drive shaft.
   [0439]      As  shown in Figure 63,  the coupling 6150 is   inclined
   toward the downstream with respect to the mounting direction
    (X4) by the locking member 6159 and the spring member 6158.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                    - 121
   [0440]      First, referring to Figure 64,     the description will
   be made about a drum bearing member 6157, a locking member
   6159, and a spring member 6158.        The bearing member 6157   is
   provided with an opening 6157v.        And, the opening 6157v and
 5 the locking portion      (locking member) 6159a engage with each
   other.    By this, a free end 6159al     of the locking portion
   6159a projects into a space portion 6157b of the bearing
   member 6157.     As will be described hereinafter,    the state of
   inclining the coupling 6150 by this locking portion 6159a is
10 maintained.     The  locking member 6159 is mounted to the space
   6157p of the bearing member 6157.        The spring member 6158   is
   mounted by the boss     6157m of the hole 6159b and the bearing
   member 6157.     The  spring member 6158   in the present embodiment
   employs a compression coil      spring which has  a spring force
15  (elastic force) of about 50g -     300g.   However, if it is a
   spring which produces the predetermined spring force, any may
   be used.    In addition, the locking member 6159 is the movable
   in the mounting direction X4 by the engagement with the slot
   6159d and the rib 6157k.
20 [0441]      When the cartridge B is     outside the apparatus main
   assembly A    (state where the cartridge B is not mounted to the
   apparatus main assembly A),      the coupling 6150 is  in the state
   of inclining.      In this state, a locking portion free end
   6159al of the locking member 6159 is       in the movable range T2
25  (hatching) of the flange portion 6150j.       Figure 64  (a) shows
   an orientation of the coupling 6150.        By this, the inclination
   orientation of the coupling can be maintained.        Furthermore,
   the locking member 6159 is abutted to an outer surface 6157q
    (Figure 64   (b))  of the bearing member 6157 by the spring force
30 of the spring member 6158.       By this, the coupling 6150 can
   maintain the stabilized orientation.        In order to engage the
   coupling 6150 with the drive shaft 180,       this lock is  released
   to permit the inclination of the axis L2.        In other words, as
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                     -  122
   shown in Figure 65     (b),  the locking portion free end 6159al
   moves in the direction of X12 to retract from the movable
   range T2 of the flange portion 6150j.
   [0442]      The description will further be made about the
 5 releasing of the locking member 6159.
   [0443]      As  shown in Figure 66,      the main assembly guide
   6130R1   is provided with the lock releasing member 6131.              At
   the time of mounting the cartridge B to the apparatus main
   assembly A,    the releasing member 6131        and the locking member
10 6159 engage with each other.         By this, the position of the
   locking member 6159 in the cartridge B changes.              Therefore,
   the coupling 6150 becomes pivotable.
   [0444]      Referring to Figure 67,       the releasing of the locking
   member 6159 will be described.         When the free end position
15 6150A1 of the coupling 6150       comes to the neighborhood of the
   shaft free-end 180b3       by the movement, in the mounting
   direction X4,    of the cartridge B,      the releasing member 6131
   and the locking member 6159 engage with each other.               At this
   time, a rib 6131a of the releasing member 6131             (contact
20 portion) and a hook portion 6159c of the locking member 6159
    (force receiving portion) contact to each other.             By this, the
   position of the locking member 6159 in the inside of the
   apparatus main assembly A is        fixed   (b).   Thereafter, the
   locking portion free end 6159al        is located in the space
25 portion 6157b by the cartridge moving through 1 -             3mm in the
   mounting direction.      Therefore, the drive shaft 180 and the
   coupling 6150    are engageable with each other, and the coupling
   6150 is   in the swingable     (pivotable) state      (c).
   11849383 1                                                       902028D4

                                    - 123
   [0445]      Referring to Figure 68,    the engaging operation of
   the coupling relative to the drive shaft and the position of
   the locking member will be described.
   [0446]      In the state of Figure 68     (a) and     (b), the axis L2
 5 of the coupling 6150 inclines toward the mounting direction X4
   relative to the axis Li beforehand       (pre-engagement angular
   position).    At this time, with respect to the direction of the
   axis Li,   the free end position 6150A1      is closer to the
   photosensitive drum 107      than the shaft free-end 180b3 and, the
10 free end position 6150A2      is closer to the pin 182 than the
   shaft free-end 180b3.      In the state of     (a),  the locking member
    (force receiving portion) 6159 is engaged in the state for
   receiving the force from the lock releasing member            (contact
   portion) 6131.    And, in the state of      (b),   the locking portion
15 free end 6159al   retracts from the space portion 6157b.            By
   this, the coupling 6150      is released from the orientation
   maintenance   state.   More particularly, the coupling 6150
   becomes swingable    (pivotable).
   [0447]      Thereafter, as shown in    (c),   by the movement of the
20 cartridge toward the mounting direction X4,          driving shaft
   receiving surface 6150f of the coupling 6150           (the cartridge
   side contact portion) or projection       6150d contacts to the free
   end portion 180b or the pin 182.       And, in response to the
   movement of the cartridge, the axis L2 approaches so that it
25 may become substantially co-axial with the axis Li.              And,
   finally, as shown in     (d),  the axis Li   and the axis L2 become
   substantially co-axial.       By this, the coupling 6150       is in the
   rotation latency state      (rotational force transmitting angular
   position).
30 [0448]      The timing at which the locking member 6159 retracts
   is  as follows.   More particularly, after the free end position
   11849383 1                                                      902028D4

                                   -  124
   6150A1 passes by the shaft     free-end 180b3,    and before the
   receiving surface 6150f or the projection        6150d contacts to
   the free end portion 180b or the pin 182,        the locking member
   6159 retracts.     By doing so,   the coupling 6150 does not
 5 receive an excessive load, and the assured mounting operation
   is  accomplished.    The receiving surface 6150f has a tapered
   shape.
   [0449]      In addition, in the dismounting process from the
   apparatus main assembly A of the cartridge B,        the step
10 opposite from the step to mount       is followed.   More
   particularly, by moving the cartridge B in the dismounting
   direction, the free end portion 180b of the drive shaft            (the
   main assembly side engaging portion) 180 pushes         the receiving
   surface 6150f    (the cartridge side contact portion).         By this,
15 the axis L2 begins     (Figure 68   (c)) to incline relative to the
   axis Li.    And, the coupling 6150 passes by the shaft free-end
   180b3 completely    (Figure 68   (b)).   The hook portion 6159c
   spaces   from the rib   6131a immediately after that.       And, the
   locking portion free end 6159al contacts to the lower surface
20 6150j2 of the flange portion.        Therefore, the inclined state
   of the coupling 6150 is maintained        (Figure 68  (a)).    More
   particularly, the coupling 6150       is pivoted to the disengaging
   angular position from the rotational        force transmitting
   angular position    (swinging).
25 [0450]      The motion shown in Figures 67 and 68 may include
   whirling motion.
   [0451]      As has been described hereinbefore, the inclination
   angle position of the coupling 6150 is maintained by the
   locking member 6159.      By this, the inclined state of the
30 coupling is maintained.      Therefore, the coupling 6150       is more
   assuredly mounted relative to the drive shaft        180.
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

                                     -  125
   Furthermore, at the time of the rotation, the locking member
   6159 does not contact to the coupling 6150.          Therefore, the
   coupling 6150     can effect more stabilized rotation.
   [0452]      In the embodiment described above, the locking
 5 member is provided in the upstream with respect to the
   mounting direction.        However, the position of the locking
   member may be any if the inclination in the predetermined
   direction of the axis of the coupling is maintained.
   [0453]      In addition, the present embodiment may be
10 implemented with Embodiments 4-7.         In this case, mounting and
   dismounting operations       of the coupling can be ensured.
   [Embodiment    9]
   [0454]      Referring to Figure 69 -      Figure 73,  the ninth
15 embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0455]      In this embodiment, another means for inclining the
   axis L2 relative to the axis Li        will be described.
   [0456]      Figure 69 is     an enlarged side view of a driving side
   of a cartridge.      Figure 70   is a perspective view which
20 illustrates a driving side of an apparatus main assembly
   guide.    Figure 71    is a side view which illustrates a relation
   between the cartridge and the main assembly guide.           Figure 72
   is  a side view and a perspective view which illustrate a
   relation between the main assembly guide and the coupling.
25 Figure 73 is     a side view which illustrates    a mounting process.
   [0457]      Figure 69     (al) and Figure 69  (bl) are a side views
   of the cartridge      (as seen from the drive shaft    side),   and
   Figure 69    (a2) and Figure 69     (b2) are a side views of the
   11849383 1                                                    902028D4

   drive shaft    (as seen from the opposite side) of the cartridge.
   As  shown in Figure 69,    in the pivotable state toward the
   downstream with respect to the mounting direction         (X4),  the
   coupling 7150 is mounted to the drum bearing member 7157.             In
 5 addition, as for the inclining direction, as has been
   described with respect to Embodiment 1, it is pivotable only
   to the downstream with respect to the mounting direction X4 by
   the retention rib     (regulating means)   7157e.   In addition, in
   Figure 69    (bl), the axis L2 of the coupling 7150 inclines with
10 the angle a    60 relative to the horizontal line.      The reason
   why the coupling 7150 inclines with the angle a        60 is as
   follows.    In the flange portion 7150j     of the coupling 7150,      a
   regulating portion 7157h 1 or 7157h2 as the regulating means
   regulate.     Therefore, the downstream side     (mounting direction)
15 of the coupling 7150 is pivotable toward the direction
   upwardly inclined by the angle a       60.
    [0458]     Referring to Figure 70,     the description will be made
   about the main assembly guide 7130R.        The main assembly guide
   7130R1   includes a guide rib 7130R1a for guiding the cartridge
20 B through the coupling 7150,      and cartridge positioning
   portions 7130R1e, 7130R1f.      The rib 7130R1a is on the mounting
   locus of the cartridge B.      And, the rib 7130R1a is extended to
   just before the drive shaft 180 with respect to the cartridge
   mounting direction.      And, the rib 7130R1b adjacent to the
25 drive shaft    180 has the height to avoid interference          When
   the coupling 7150 engages with the drive shaft        180.    The main
   assembly guide 7130R2 mainly includes a guide portion 7130R2a
   and the cartridge positioning portion 7130R2c for determining
   the orientation at the time of the mounting of the cartridge
30 by guiding a part cartridge frames Bl.
   11849383 1                                                   902028D4

                                  -  127
   [0459]     The relation between the main assembly guide 713CR
   and the cartridge at the time of mounting the cartridge will
   be described.
   [0460]     As  shown in Figure 71    (a),  in the driving side,
 5 while a connecting portion    (force receiving portion) 7150c of
   the coupling 7150 contacts to the guide rib       (contact portion)
   713CR1a, a cartridge B moves.      At this time, the cartridge
   guide 7157a of the bearing member 7157 is       separated from the
   guide surface 7130Rlc by n59.      Therefore, the weight of the
10 cartridge B   is applied to the coupling 7150.      In addition, on
   the other hand, as has been described hereinbefore, the
   coupling 7150 is   set, so that it is pivotable toward the
   direction to which the downstream side with respect to the
   mounting direction upwardly inclines by the angle a60 relative
15 to the mounting direction    (X4).    Therefore, the driven portion
   7150a of the coupling 7150 inclines toward the downstream
    (direction inclined by the angle a      60 from the mounting
   direction) with respect to the mounting direction X4        (Figure
   72).
20 [0461]     The reason for the inclination of the coupling 7150
   is  as follows.   The connecting portion 7150c receives the
   reaction force corresponding to the weight of the cartridge B
   from the guide rib 7130R1a.      And, the reaction force applies
   to the regulating portion 7157h 1 or 7157h2 for regulating the
25 inclining direction.    By this, the coupling is     inclined to the
   predetermined direction.
   [0462]     Here, when the connecting portion 7150c moves on the
   guide rib 7130R1a, a frictional     force is between the
   connecting portion 7150c and the guide rib 7130R1a.
30 Therefore, the coupling 7150 receives a force in the direction
   opposite from the mounting direction X4 by this frictional
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                 -  128
   force.    However, the frictional  force produced by the
   coefficient of friction between the connecting portion 7150c
   and the guide rib 7130R1a is    smaller than the force    for
   pivoting the coupling 7150 to the downstream with respect to
 5 the mounting direction X4 by the reaction force.       Therefore,
   the coupling 7150 overcomes the frictional force is pivoted to
   the downstream with respect to the mounting direction X4.
   [0463]      The regulating portion 7157p   (Figure 69)  of the
   bearing member 7157 may be used as the regulating means for
10 regulating the inclination.     By this, the regulation of the
   inclining direction of the coupling is    carried out at the
   different positions with respect to the direction of the axis
   L2 by the regulating portions 7157h 1, 7157h2      (Figure 69)   and
   the regulating portion 7157p.     By this, the direction which
15 the coupling 7150 inclines can be regulated more assuredly.
   In addition, it can always be inclined toward the angle of
   approximately a   60.  However, the regulation of the inclining
   direction of the coupling 7150 may be made by another means.
   [0464]      In addition, the guide rib 7130R1a is    in the space
20 7150s constituted by the driven portion 7150a, the driving
   portion 7150b, and the connecting portion 7150c.       Therefore,
   in the mounting process, the longitudinal position       (the
   direction of the axis L2)   in the inside of the apparatus main
   assembly A of the coupling 7150 is regulated      (Figure 71).     By
25 the longitudinal position of the coupling 7150 being
   regulated, the coupling 7150 can be more assuredly engaged
   relative to the drive shaft 180.
   [0465]      The engaging operation for engaging the coupling
   7150 with the drive shaft   180 will be described.     The engaging
30 operation is   the same as that of Embodiment 1 substantially
    (Figure 22).   Here, referring to Figure 73,   the description
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                  -  129
   will be made about the relation among the main assembly guide
   main assembly guide 7130R2,    the bearing member 7157,       and the
   coupling 7150 to the process which the coupling engages with
   the drive shaft   180.  As long as the connecting portion 7150c
 5 contacts to the rib 7130R1a, the cartridge guide 7157a is
   separate from the guide surface 7130R1c.        By this, the
   coupling 7150 is   inclined  (Figure 73    (a), Figure 73   (d))   (pre
   engagement angular position).       At the time of the free end
   7150A1 of the inclined coupling 7150 passing by the shaft
10 free-end 180b3,   the connecting portion 7150c is departed from
   the guide rib 7130R1a    (Figure 73   (b),  Figure 73  (e)).    At this
   time, the cartridge guide 7157a passes the guide surface
   7130R1c, and begins to contact to the positioning surface
   7130R1e through the inclined surface 7130R1d          (Figure 73     (b),
15 Figure 73   (e)).  After that, the receiving surface 7150f or
   the projection 7150d contacts to the free end portion 180b or
   the pin 182.    And, in response to the cartridge mounting
   operation, the axis L2 becomes substantially co-axial with the
   axis Li,   and the center of the drum shaft and the center of
20 the coupling align with each other.        And, finally, as shown in
   Figure 73   (c) and Figure 73   (f),  the axis Li  and the axis L2
   are co-axial relative to each other.        And, the coupling 7150
   is  in the rotation latency state     (rotational force
   transmitting angular position).
25 [0466]      In addition, the step substantially opposite from
   the engaging operation is followed in the process which takes
   out the cartridge B from the apparatus main assembly A.            In
   other words,   the cartridge B moves in the dismounting
   direction.    By this, the free end portion 180b pushes the
30 receiving surface 7150f.     By this, the axis L2 begins to
   incline relative to the axis Li.       The upstream free end
   portion 7150A1 with respect to the dismounting direction moves
   on the shaft free-end 180b by dismounting operation of the
   11849383 1                                                   902028D4

                                 - 130
   cartridge, and, the axis L2 inclines until the upper free end
   portion Al reaches the drive shaft free-end 180b3.     And, the
   coupling 7150 passes by the shaft free-end 180b3 completely in
   this state   (Figure 73 (b)).  After that, the connecting
 5 portion 7150c contacts the coupling 7150 to the rib 7130Rla.
   By this, the coupling 7150 is taken out in the state inclined
   toward the downstream with respect to the mounting direction.
   In other words, the coupling 5150 is pivoted to the
   disengaging angular position from the rotational force
10 transmitting angular position    (swinging).
   [0467]     As has been described hereinbefore, the coupling
   swings by the user mounting the cartridge to the main
   assembly, and it engages with the main assembly driving shaft.
   In addition, a special means for maintaining the orientation
15 of the coupling is unnecessary.     However, the orientation
   maintenance   structure as in the embodiment 4-embodiment 8 may
   be used with the present embodiment.
   [0468]     In this embodiment, the coupling is inclined toward
   the mounting direction by applying the weight to the guide
20 rib.   However, not only the weight, the spring force and so on
   may be utilized further.
   [0469]     In this embodiment, the coupling is inclined by the
   connecting portion of the coupling receiving the force.
   However, the present embodiment is not limited to this
25 example.   For example,  if the coupling is  inclined by
   receiving the force from a contact portion of the main
   assembly, the portion other than the connecting portion may be
   contacted to the contact portion.
   [0470]     In addition, the present embodiment may be
30 implemented with any of the embodiment 4-embodiment 8.        In
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                  - 131
   this case, the engagement and disengagement relative to the
   drive shaft of the coupling can be ensured.
   [Embodiment   10]
 5 [0471]      Referring to Figure 74   -  Figure 81, the tenth
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0472]      In this embodiment, another means for inclining the
   axis L2 relative to the axis Li    will be described.
   [0473]      Figure 74 is  a perspective view which illustrates a
10 driving side of an apparatus main assembly.
   [0474]      Referring to Figure 74,    a main assembly guide and a
   coupling urging means will be described.
   [0475]      The present embodiment is effectively applied, in
   the case that the frictional force described in Embodiment 9
15 would be larger than the force of pivoting the coupling 7150
   toward the downstream    (mounting direction X4) by the reaction
   force,.    More particularly, for example, even if the
   frictional force   increases by rubbing action to the connecting
   portion or the main assembly guide, the coupling can be
20 assuredly pivoted to the pre-engagement angular position,
   according to this embodiment,.     The main assembly guide 1130R1
   includes.    A guide surface 1130R1b for guiding the cartridge B
   through the cartridge guide 140R1      (Figure 2), A guide rib
   1130Rlc which guides the coupling 150,      and cartridge
25 positioning portion 1130R1a.     The guide rib 1130Rlc is on the
   mounting locus of the cartridge B.       And, the guide rib 1130R1c
   is extended to just before the drive shaft 180 with respect to
   the cartridge mounting direction.       In addition, a rib 1130R1d

   provided adjacent to the drive shaft    180 has a height not
   causing interference when the coupling 150 engages.
   [0476]     A part of a rib  1130R1c is cut away.      And, the main
   assembly guide slider 1131   is mounted to the rib 1130Rlc
 5 slidably in the direction of an arrow W.      The slider 1131     is
   pressed by an elastic force of an urging spring 1132.         And,
   the position is determined by the slider 1131 abutting to the
   abutment surface 1130R1e of the main assembly guide 1130R1.
   In this state, the slider 1131 projects from the guide rib
10 1130R1c.
   [0477]     The main assembly guide 1130R2 has a guide portion
   1130R2b for determining the orientation at the time of the
   mounting of the cartridge B by guiding a part of cartridge
   frames B1,  and a cartridge positioning portion 1130R2a.
15 [0478]     Referring to Figure 75   - Figure 77,   the among
   relation of the main assembly guide 1130R1, 1130R2, the slider
   1131,  and the cartridge B,  at the time of mounting the
   cartridge B,  will be described.    Figure 75  is a side view, as
   seen from the main assembly driving shaft     180   (Figures 1 and
20 2)  side, and Figure 76 is a perspective view thereof.        Figure
   77  is a sectional view taken along Z-Z of Figure 75.
   [0479]     As shown in Figure 75,   in the driving side, while
   the cartridge guide 140R1   of the cartridge contacts to the
   guide surface 1130R1b, the cartridge moves.       At this time, as
25 shown in Figure 77,  the connecting portion 150c is separated
   from the guide rib 1130Rlc by n1.     Therefore, the force is not
   applied to the coupling 150.    In addition, as shown in Figure
   75,  the coupling 150 is regulated by the regulating portion
   140R1a at the upper surface and the left side.        Therefore, the
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                 - 133
   coupling 150 is freely pivotable only in the mounting
   direction   (X4).
   [0480]     Referring to Figure 78 - Figure 81, the operation of
   moving the slider 1131 to the retreating position from the
 5 energizing position while the coupling 150 contacts to the
   slider 1131, will be described.     In Figure 78 - Figure 79, the
   coupling 150 contacts in the apex 1131b of the slider 1131,
   more particularly, the slider 1131 is in the retreating
   position.    The connecting portion 150c and the inclined
10 surface of the projection of the slider 1131 1131a contact
   with each other by the entrance of the coupling 150 pivotable
   only in the mounting direction    (X4).  By this, the slider 1131
   is depressed and it moves to the retreating position.
   [0481]     Referring to Figure 80 - Figure 81, the operation
15 after the coupling 150 rides over an apex 1131b of the slider
   1131 will be described.    Figure 80 - Figure 81 illustrate the
   state after the coupling 150 ride over the apex 1131b of the
   slider 131.
   [0482]     When the coupling 150 rides over the apex 1131b, the
20 slider 1131 tends to return from the retreating position to
   the energizing position by the elastic force of the urging
   spring 132.    In that case, a part of connecting portion 150c
   of the coupling 150 receives the force F from the inclined
   surface 1131c of the slider 1131.     More particularly, the
25 inclined surface 1131c functions as the force applying portion
   and it functions as the force receiving portion for a part of
   connecting portion 150c to receive this force.     As shown in
   Figure 80, the force receiving portion is provided in the
   upstream of the connecting portion 150c with respect to the
30 cartridge mounting direction.    Therefore, the coupling 150 can
   be inclined smoothly.    As shown in Figure 81, in addition, the
   11849383 1                                              902028D4

                                -  134
   force F is divided into a component force Fl     and a component
   force F2.   At this time, the upper surface of the coupling 150
   is  regulated by the regulating portion 140R1a.     Therefore, the
   coupling 150  is inclined toward the mounting direction      (X4) by
 5 the component force F2.   More particularly, the coupling 150
   is  inclined toward the pre-engagement angular position.       By
   this, the coupling 150 becomes engageable with the drive shaft
   180.
   [0483]     In the embodiment described above, the connecting
10 portion receives the force and the coupling is     inclined.
   However, the present embodiment is not limited to this
   example.   For example, if the coupling is pivotable by
   receiving the force from the contact portion of the main
   assembly, the portion other than the connecting portion may
15 contact with the contact portion.
   [0484]     In addition, the present embodiment may be
   implemented with any of the embodiment 4-embodiment 9.        In
   this case, the engagement and disengagement of the coupling
   relative to the drive shaft can be ensured.
20 [Embodiment  11]
   [0485]     Referring to Figure 82   - Figure 84,  the eleventh
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0486]     In the present embodiment, the configuration of the
25 coupling will be described.    Figure 82 -  Figure 84   (a) are
   perspective views of couplings, Figure 82    - Figure 84   (b) are
   sectional views of the couplings.
   [0487]     In the previous embodiments, the driving shaft
   receiving surface and the drum bearing surface of the coupling
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                - 135
   have conical shapes, respectively.     However, in this
   embodiment, the different configuration will be described.
   [0488]     A coupling 12150 shown in Figure 82 mainly comprises
   three portions similarly to the coupling shown in Figure 8.
 5 More particularly, as shown in Figure 82     (b), the coupling
   12150 comprises an a driven portion 12150a for receiving the
   drive from the drive shaft, a driving portion 12150b for
   transmitting the drive to a drum shaft, and a connecting
   portion 12150c which connects the driven portion 12150a and
10 the driving portion 12150b with each other.
   [0489]     As shown in Figure 82  (b),   the driven portion 12150a
   has a drive shaft insertion opening portion 12150m as an
   expanded part which expands toward the drive shaft 180
   relative to the axis L2 the driving portion 12150b has a drum
15 shaft insertion opening portion 12150v as an expanded part
   which expands toward the drum shaft 153.      An opening 12150m
   and an opening 12150v are constituted by the driving shaft
   receiving surface 12150f of a divergent shape, and the drum
   bearing surface 12150i of a divergent shape, respectively.
20 The receiving surface 12150f and the receiving surface 12150i
   have the recesses 12150x, 12150z as shown in the Figure.        At
   the time of the rotational force transmission, the recess
   12150z opposes to the free end of the drive shaft 180.       More
   particularly, the recess 12150z covers the free end of the
25 drive shaft 180.
   [0490]     Referring to Figure 83,  a coupling 12250 will be
   described.   As shown in Figure 83   (b),  a driven portion 12250a
   has a drive shaft insertion opening portion 12250m as an
   expanded part which expands toward the drive shaft 180
30 relative to the axis L2 a driving portion 12250b has a drum
   shaft insertion opening portion 12250v as the expanded part
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                 - 136
   which expands toward the drum shaft 153 relative to the axis
   L2.
   [0491]     An opening 12250m and an opening 12250v are
   constituted by the driving shaft receiving surface 12250f of a
 5 bell-like shape, and the drum bearing surface 12250i of a
   bell-like shape, respectively.    A receiving surface 12250f and
   a receiving surface 12250i constitute the recesses 12250x,
   12250z as shown in the Figure.    At the time of the rotational
   force transmission, the recess 12250z engages with the free
10 end portion of the drive shaft 180.    Referring to Figure 84, a
   coupling 12350 will be described.    As shown in Figure 84   (a),
   a driven portion 12350a includes drive receiving projections
   12350d 1 or 12350d 2 or 12350d3 and 12350d4 which are directly
   extended from a connecting portion 12350c and which expand
15 radially toward the drive shaft 180 relative to the axis L2.
   In addition, the portion between the adjacent projections
   12350d1-121350d4 constitutes the standing-by portion.
   Furthermore, the rotational force receiving surfaces
    (rotational force receiving portion) 12350e  (12350el-e4) are
20 provided in the upstream with respect to the rotational
   direction X7.   At the time of the rotation, a rotational force
   is transmitted to the rotational force receiving surfaces
   12350el-e4 from the pin   (rotational force applying portion)
   182.   At the time of the rotational force transmission, the
25 recess 12250z opposes to the free end portion of the drive
   shaft which is the projection of the apparatus main assembly.
   More particularly, the recess 12250z covers the free end of
   the drive shaft 180.
   [0492]     In addition, if the effect similar to Embodiment 1
30 is provided, the configuration of the opening 12350v may be
   any.
   11849383 1                                             902028D4

                                 - 137
   [0493]      In addition, the mounting method to the cartridge of
   the coupling is the same as that of Embodiment 1, and
   therefore, the description is omitted.     In addition, the
   operation of mounting the cartridge to the apparatus main
 5 assembly, and the operation of extracting from the apparatus
   main assembly are the same as those of Embodiment 1     (Figures
   22  and 25),  and therefore, the description is omitted.
   [0494]      As has been described hereinbefore, the drum bearing
   surface of the coupling has   the expanding configuration, and
10 the coupling can be mounted relative to the axis of the drum
   shaft for inclination.    In addition, the driving shaft
   receiving surface of the coupling has    the expanding
   configuration and can incline the coupling, without
   interfering with the drive shaft in response to the mounting
15 operation or the dismounting operation of the cartridge B.        By
   this, also in this embodiment, the effects similar to the
   first embodiment or the second embodiment can be provided.
   [0495]      In addition, as for the configurations of the
   opening 12150m, 12250m and the opening 12150v, 12250v, they
20 may be a combination of the divergent, bell-like shapes.
   [Embodiment   12]
   [0496]      Referring to Figure 85,  the twelfth embodiment of
   the present invention will be described.
25 [0497]      The present embodiment is different from Embodiment
   1 in the configuration of the coupling Figure 85     (a) is a
   perspective view of a coupling which has a substantially
   cylindrical shape, and Figure 85    (b) is a sectional view when
   the coupling mounted to the cartridge engages with a drive
30 shaft.
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                   - 138
   [0498]      A drive side edge of the coupling 9150 is provided
   with a plurality of driven projections 9150d.       In addition, a
   drive receiving stand-by portion 9150k is provided between the
   drive receiving projections 9150d.       The projection 9150d is
 5 provided with a rotational force receiving surface       (rotational
   force receiving portion) 9150e.       A rotational force
   transmitting pin    (rotational force applying portion) 9182 of
   the drive shaft 9180 as will be described hereinafter contacts
   to the rotational force receiving surface 9150e.       By this, a
10 rotational force is transmitted to the coupling 9150.
   [0499]      In order to stabilize the running torque transmitted
   to the coupling, a plurality of rotational force receiving
   surfaces 150e are desirably disposed on the same circumference
    (on the phantom circle Cl of Figure 8 (d)).      By the
15 disposition in this manner, the rotational force transmission
   radius is constant and the torque transmitted is stabilized.
   In addition, from the viewpoint of the stabilization of the
   drive transmission, the receiving surfaces 9150e are desirably
   provided on the opposed positions      (180 degrees) diametrically.
20 In addition, the number of the receiving surfaces 9150e may be
   any if the pin 9182 of the drive shaft 9180 can be received by
   the standing-by portion 9150k.      In the present embodiment, the
   number is two.    The rotational force receiving surfaces 9150e
   may not be on the same circumference, or they may not be
25 disposed diametrically opposed positions.
   [0500]      In addition, the cylinder surface of the coupling
   9150 is provided with the standby opening 9150g.       In addition,
   the opening 9150g is provided with the rotational force
   transmission surface    (rotational force transmitting portion)
30 9150h.    The drive transmission pin    (rotational force receiving
   member) 9155   (Figure 85  (b))  of the drum shaft as will be
   described hereinafter contacts to this rotational force
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                 - 139
   transmission surface 9150h.    By this, the rotational force is
   transmitted to the photosensitive drum 107.
   [0501]      Similarly to the projection 9150d, the rotational
   force transmission surface 9150h is desirably disposed
 5 diametrically opposed on the same circumference.
   [0502]      The structures of the drum shaft 9153 and the drive
   shaft 9180 will be described.    In Embodiment 1, the
   cylindrical end is a spherical surface.     In this embodiment,
   however, a diameter of a spherical free end portion 9153b of
10 the drum shaft 9153 is larger than a diameter of a main part
   9153a.    With this structure, even if the coupling 9150 has the
   cylindrical shape as illustrated, it is pivotable relative to
   the axis Li.    In other words, a gap g as illustrated is
   provided between the drum shaft 9153 and the coupling 9150 by
15 this, the coupling 9150 is pivotable    (swingable) relative to
   the drum shaft 9153.    The configuration of the drive shaft
   9180 is the same as that of the drum shaft 9150 substantially.
   In other words, the configuration of the free end portion
   9180b is the spherical surface, and the diameter thereof is
20 larger than the diameter of the main part 9180a of the
   cylindrical shape portion.    In addition, the pin 9182 which
   pierces through the substantial center of the free end portion
   9180b which is the spherical surface is provided the pin 9182
   transmits the rotational force to the rotational force
25 receiving surface 9150e of the coupling 9150.
   [0503]      The drum shaft 9150 and the spherical surface of the
   drive shaft 9180 are in engagement with the inner surface
   9150p of the coupling 9150.    By this, the relative position
   between the drum shaft 9150 and the coupling 9150 of the drive
30 shaft 9180 is determined.    The operation with respect to the
   mounting and demounting of the coupling 9150 is the same as
   11849383 1                                              902028D4

                                  -  140
   Embodiment   1, and therefore, the description thereof is
   omitted.
   [0504]     As has been described hereinbefore, the coupling has
   the cylindrical shape,   and therefore,     the position with
 5 respect to the direction perpendicular to the direction of the
   axis L2 of the coupling 9150     can be determined relative to the
   drum shaft or the drive shaft.      A modified example of the
   coupling will be described further.       In the configuration of
   the coupling 9250   shown in Figure 85     (c), a cylindrical shape
10 and a conical shape are put together.        Figure 85  (d) is a
   sectional view of the coupling of this modified example.           A
   driven portion 9250a of the coupling 9250 has a cylindrical
   shape, and an inner surface 9250p thereof engages with the
   spherical surface of the drive shaft.        Furthermore, it has     the
15 abutment surface 9250q and can effect the positioning with
   respect to the axial direction between the coupling 9250 and
   the drive shaft   180.  The driving portion 9250b has a conical
   shape, and, similarly to Embodiment      1, the position relative
   to the drum shaft 153   is determined by the drum bearing
20 surface 9250i.
   [05051     The configuration of the coupling 9350      shown in
   Figure 85   (e) is a combination of a cylindrical shape and a
   conical shape.    Figure 85  (f) is   a sectional view of this
   modified example the driven portion 9350a of the coupling 9350
25 has  a cylindrical shape, and the inner surface 9350p thereof
   engages with the spherical surface of the drive shaft 180.
   The positioning in the axial direction is effected by abutting
   the spherical surface of the drive shaft to the edge portion
   9350q formed between the cylindrical portions having different
30 diameters.
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

                                 - 141
   [05061     The configuration of the coupling 9450    shown in
   Figure 85   (g) is a combination of a spherical surface, a
   cylindrical shape, and a conical shape.     Figure 85   (h) is  a
   sectional view of this modified example a driven portion 9450a
 5 of the coupling 9450 has a cylindrical shape, and the inner
   surface 9450p thereof engages with the spherical surface of
   the drive shaft   180.  A spherical surface of the drive shaft
   180  is contacted to a spherical surface 9450q which is a part
   of the spherical surface.    By this, the position can be
10 determined with respect to the direction of the axis L2.
   [0507]     In addition, in this embodiment, the coupling has
   the substantially cylindrical shape and the free end portions
   of the drum shaft or the drive shaft have the spherical
   configurations in addition, it has been described that the
15 diameter thereof is larger than the diameter of the main part
   of the drum shaft or the drive shaft.     However, the present
   embodiment is not   limited to such an example.    The coupling
   has  a cylindrical shape and the drum shaft or the drive shaft
   has  a cylindrical shape and, a diameter of the drum shaft or
20 the drive shaft is   small relative to an inner diameter of an
   inner surface of the coupling within limits in which the pin
   does not disengage from the coupling.     By this,  the coupling
   is pivotable relative to the axis Li    the coupling can be
   inclined without interfering with the drive shaft in response
25 to the mounting operation or the dismounting operation of the
   cartridge B.    In view of this, also in this embodiment, the
   effects similar to Embodiment 1 or Embodiment 2 can be
   provided.
   [05081     In addition, in this embodiment, although an example
30 of the combination of the cylindrical shape and conical shape
   has been described as the configuration of the coupling, it
   may be opposite to the example.     In other words, the drive
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                  -  142
   shaft side may be formed into a conical shape, and the drum
   shaft side may be formed into a cylindrical shape.
   [Embodiment   13]
 5 [05091      Referring to Figure 86    -  Figure 88, the thirteenth
   embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0510]      The present embodiment is different from Embodiment
   1 in the mounting operation relative to the drive shaft of the
   coupling, and the structure with respect to it.        Figure 86 is
10 a perspective view which illustrates a configuration of a
   coupling 10150    of the present embodiment.     The configuration
   of the coupling 10150    is a combination of the cylindrical
   shape and conical shape which have been described in
   Embodiment   10.   In addition, a tapered surface 10150r is
15 provided on the free end side of a coupling 10150.        In
   addition, the surface of an opposite side of the drive
   receiving projection    10150d with respect to the direction of
   the axis Li   is provided with an urging force receiving surface
   10150s.
20 [0511]      Referring to Figure 87,     the structure of the
   coupling will be described.
   [0512]      An inner surface 10150p and a spherical surface
   10153b of a drum shaft 10153 of the coupling 10150 are in
   engagement with each other.      An urging member 10634 is
25 interposed between a receiving surface 10150s       described in the
   foregoing and a bottom surface 10151b of a drum flange 10151.
   By this, the coupling 10150 is urged toward the drive shaft
   180.    In addition, similarly to the foregoing embodiments, a
   retention rib 10157e is provided in the drive shaft       180 side
30 of the flange portion 10150j with respect to the direction of
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                    - 143
   the axis Li.     By this,  the disengagement of the coupling 10150
   from the cartridge is prevented the inner surface 10150p of
   the coupling 10150     is cylindrical.     Therefore, it is   the
   movable in the direction of the axis L2.
 5 [0513]       Figure 88 is  for illustrating the orientation of the
   coupling in the case that the coupling engages with the drive
   shaft.    Figure 88   (a) is a sectional view of the coupling 150
   of Embodiment 1, and Figure 88       (c) is  a sectional view of a
   coupling 10150    of the present embodiment.      And, Figure 88     (b)
10 is  a sectional view before reaching the state of Figure 88           (c)
   the mounting direction is shown by X4        and the chain line L5 is
   a line drawn in parallel with the mounting direction from the
   free end of the drive shaft 180.
   [0514]       In order for the coupling to engage with the drive
15 shaft   180,  the downstream free end position 10150Al      with
   respect to the mounting direction needs to pass the free end
   portion 180b3 of the drive shaft 180.         In the case of
   Embodiment 1, the axis L2 inclines by more than angle al04.
   By this, the coupling moves to the position where the free end
20 position 150Al    does not interfere with the free end portion
   180b3   (Figure 88   (a)).
   [0515]       On the other hand, in the coupling 10150 of the
   present embodiment, it in the state where        it does not be in
   engagement with the drive shaft       180,  the coupling 10150 takes
25 the position nearest to the drive shaft 180 by the restoring
   force of the urging member 10634.        In this state, when it
   moves in the mounting direction X4,        a part of drive shafts 180
   contact the cartridge B at the tapered surface 10150r of the
   coupling 10150     (Figure 88  (b)).   At this time, the force     is
30 applied to the tapered surface 10150r in the direction
   opposite the X4 direction therefore, the coupling 10150           is
   11849383 1                                                   902028D4

                                    -  144
   retracted in the longitudinal direction Xl            by a component
   force thereof.     And, the free end portion 10153b of the drum
   shaft   10153 abuts   to an abutting portion 10150t of the
   coupling 10150    in addition, the coupling 10150 rotates
 5 clockwisely about the center P1 of the free end portion 10153b
    (pre-engagement angular position).         By this, the free end
   position 10150Al     of the coupling passes by the free end 180b
   of the drive shaft 180      (Figure 88    (c)).   When the drive shaft
   180  and the drum shaft 10153 becomes substantially co-axial, a
10 driving shaft receiving surface 10150f          of the coupling 10150
   contacts to the free end portion 180b by the restoring force
   of the urging spring 10634.        By this,    the coupling becomes in
   the rotation latency state      (Figure 87).      (rotational force
   transmitting angular position).         With such a structure, the
15 movement in the direction of the axis L2 and the pivoting
   motion   (swinging operation) are combined, and the coupling is
   swung from the pre-engagement angular position to the
   rotational force transmitting angular position.
   [0516]      By this structure, even if the angle a         106
20  (inclination amount of the axis L2)        is  small, the cartridge
   can be mounted to the apparatus main assembly A.            Therefore,
   the space required by the pivoting motion of the coupling
   10150  is  small.    Therefore, latitude in the design of the
   apparatus main assembly A is       improved.
25 [0517]      The rotation according to the drive shaft          180 of the
   coupling 10150    is  the same as Embodiment       1, and therefore, the
   description thereof is     omitted.     At the time of taking out the
   cartridge B   from the apparatus main assembly A,         the free end
   portion 180b is forced on the conical shape driving shaft
30 receiving surface 10150f      of the coupling 10150 by removing
   force.    The coupling 10150 is pivoted by this force, while
   retracting toward the direction of the axis L2 by this, the
   11849383 1                                                     902028D4

                                - 145
   coupling is demounted from the drive shaft 180.    In other
   words, the moving operation in the direction of the axis L2
   and the pivoting motion are combined   (whirling motion may be
   includes),  the coupling can be pivoted to the disengaging
 5 angular position from the rotational  force transmitting
   angular position.
   [Embodiment  14]
   [0518]     Referring to Figure 89-Figure  90, the 14th
10 embodiment of the present invention will be described.
   [0519]     The point in which the present embodiment is
   different from Embodiment  1 is in the engaging operation and
   the structure with respect to it relative to the drive shaft
   of the coupling.
15 [0520]     Figure 89 is a perspective view which illustrates
   only the coupling 21150 and the drum shaft 153 Figure 90     is a
   longitudinal sectional view, as seen from the lower of the
   apparatus main assembly As  shown in Figure 89,  the magnet
   member 21100  is mounted to the end of the driving portion
20 21150a of the coupling 21150 The drive shaft 180   shown in
   Figure 90 comprises magnetic material Therefore, in this
   embodiment, the magnet member 21100 is   inclined in the
   coupling 21150 by the magnetic force between the drive shaft
   180  of it and magnetic material.
25 [0521]     First, as shown in Figure 90  (a), the coupling 21150
   is not particularly inclined relative to the drum shaft     153 at
   this time, the magnet member 21100 is positioned in the
   driving portion 21150a in the upstream with respect to the
   mounting direction X4.
   11849383 1                                             902028D4

                                   - 146
   [0522]       When it is inserted to the position shown in Figure
   90  (b),   the magnet member 21100   is attracted toward the drive
   shaft   180.    And, as illustrated, the coupling 21150 begins the
   swinging motion by the magnetic force thereof.
 5 [0523]       Thereafter, the leading end position 21150A1      of the
   coupling 21150 with respect to the mounting direction         (X4)
   passes by the drive shaft free-end 180b3 which has the
   spherical surface And, the driving shaft receiving surface
   21150f of a conical shape or the driven projection 21150d          (the
10 cartridge side contact portion) which constitutes the recess
   21150z of the coupling 21150 contacts the free end portion
   180b or 182 after the passage      (Figure 90   (c)).
   [0524]       And, it inclines so that the axis L2 becomes
   substantially co-axial with the axis Li       in response to the
15 mounting operation of the cartridge B      (Figure 90   (d)).
   [0525]       Finally, the axis Li   and the axis L2 become
   substantially co-axial with each other In this        state, the
   recess 21150z covers the free end portion 180b The axis L2
   pivots the coupling 21150 to the rotational force transmitting
20 angular position from the pre-engagement angular position so
   that it is substantially co-axial with the axis Li        The
   coupling 21150 and the drive shaft 180      are engaged with each
   other    (Figure 90  (e)).
   [0526]       Motion of the coupling shown in Figure 90 may also
25 include the revolution.
   [0527]       It  is necessary to position the magnet member 21100
   in the upstream of the driving portion 21150a with respect to
   the mounting direction X4.
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

                                  - 147
   [0528]     Therefore, at the time of mounting the cartridge B
   to the apparatus main assembly A,    it is necessary to align the
   phase of the coupling 21150 The method described with respect
   to Embodiment 2 is usable for the method of doubling the phase
 5 of the coupling.
   [0529]     The state of receiving rotation driving force and
   rotating after the mounting completion is the same as
   Embodiment   1 and therefore,  the description is omitted.
   [Embodiment   15]
10
   [05301     Referring to Figure 91,   the 15th embodiment of the
   present invention will be described.
   [0531]     The point in which the present embodiment is
   different from Embodiment    1 is the manner of support of the
15 coupling.    In embodiment 1,  the axis L2 of the coupling
   thereof is pivotable, while being interposed between the free
   end portion of the drum shaft and the retention rib.       On the
   other hand, in the present embodiment, the axis L2 of the
   coupling is pivotable only by the drum bearing member this
20 will be described in more detail.
   [0532]     Figure 91   (a) is a perspective view which
   illustrates the state    in the course of mounting the coupling.
   Figure 91   (b) is a longitudinal sectional view thereof.
   Figure 91   (c) is a perspective view which illustrates the
25 state where the axis L2 inclines relative to the axis Li.
   Figure 91   (d) is a longitudinal sectional view thereof.
   Figure 91   (e) is a perspective view which illustrates the
   state where the coupling rotates.     Figure 91  (f) is a
   longitudinal sectional view thereof.
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                 - 148
   [05331     In this embodiment, the drum shaft 153    is place (d)
   in a space defend by an inner surface of a space portion
   11157b of a drum bearing member 11157 in addition, the rib
   11157e and the rib 11157p are provided on the inner surface
 5 opposite from the drum shaft 153    (at the different positions
   with respect to the direction of the axis Li).
   [0534]     With this structure, a flange portion 11150j       and a
   drum bearing surface 11150i   are regulated by an inner end
   surface 11157pl and circular column portion 11153a of the rib
10 in the state in which the axis L2 is    inclined  (Figure 91     (d)).
   Here, the end surface 11157pl is provided in the bearing
   member 11157.    In addition, the circular column portion 11153a
   is  a part of drum shaft 11153.   And, when the axis L2 becomes
   substantially co-axial with the axis Li     (Figure 91   (f)),  the
15 flange portion 11150j   and the taper outer surface 11150q are
   regulated by the outer end 11157p2 of the rib     11157e and the
   rib of the bearing member 11157.
   [05351     Therefore, the coupling 11150 is    retained in the
   bearing member 11157 by selecting the configuration of the
20 bearing member 11157   to the appropriate in addition, the
   coupling 11150   can be pivotably mounted relative to the axis
   Li.
   [05361     In addition, the drum shaft 11153 has    only the drive
   transmitting portion in the free end thereof and, the
25 spherical surface portion for regulating the movement of the
   coupling 11150   and so on is unnecessary therefore, the
   processing of the drum shaft 11153 is easy.
   [0537]     In addition, the rib  11157e and the rib 11157p are
   disposed offset.    By this, as shown in Figure 91    (a) and
30 Figure 91   (b), the coupling 11150 is assembled into the
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

   bearing member 11157  in a slightly oblique direction     (in the
   Figure X12) more particularly, the special method of
   assemblying is unnecessary thereafter, the bearing member
   11157  to which the coupling 11150 was mounted temporarily is
 5 assembled into the drum shaft 11153     (in the Figure the X13
   direction).
   [Embodiment  16]
   [05381     Referring to Figure 92,   the 16th embodiment of the
10 present invention will be described.
   [05391     The point of difference of the present embodiment
   from Embodiment  1 is in the mounting method of the coupling.
   In Embodiment 1, the coupling is    interposed between the free
   end portion and the retention rib of the drum shaft.       On the
15 contrary, in this embodiment, the retention of the coupling is
   effected by a rotational force transmitting pin      (rotational
   force receiving member) 13155 of a drum shaft     13153.   More
   particularly, in this embodiment, a coupling 13150 is held by
   a pin 13155.
20 [0540]     This will be described in more detail.
   [0541]     Figure 92 illustrates the coupling held at the end
   of the photosensitive drum 107    (cylindrical drum 107a) a part
   of driving side of the photosensitive drum 107     is shown, and
   the others are omitted for simplicity.
25 [0542]     In Figure 92  (a), the axis L2 is   substantially co
   axial relative to the axis Li   in this state, a coupling 13150
   receives a rotational   force from a drive shaft   180 at a driven
   portion 13150a.   And, the coupling 13150 transmits the
   rotational force to the photosensitive drum 107.
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                   - 150
   [0543]       And, as shown in Figure 92   (b),  the coupling 13150
   is mounted to a drum shaft     13153 so that it is pivotable in
   any direction relative to the axis Li.        The configuration of
   the driven portion 13150a may be the same as the configuration
 5 of the driven portion described with respect to Figure 82
   Figure 85 and, this photosensitive drum unit U13        is assembled
   into the second frame     in the manner described with respect to
   Embodiment    1.   And, at the time of mounting and demounting the
   cartridge B relative to the apparatus main assembly A,         the
10 coupling is engageable and detachable relative to the drive
   shaft.
   [0544]       The mounting method according to the present
   embodiment will be described.      The free end    (unshown) of the
   drum shaft    13153 is covered by the coupling 13150 thereafter,
15 the pin    (rotational force receiving member) 13155 is      inserted
   into a hole     (unshown) of the drum shaft 13153 in the direction
   perpendicular to the axis Li.      In addition, the opposite ends
   of the pin 13155 outwardly project beyond an internal surface
   of a flange portion 13150j.      The pin 13155 is prevented from
20 separating from the standby opening 13150g by these settings.
   By this, it is not necessary to add a part for preventing the
   disengagement of the coupling 13150.
   [0545]       As mentioned above, according to the embodiment
   described above, the drum unit U13 is      constituted by the
25 cylindrical drum 107a, the coupling 13150,       the photosensitive
   drum 107,    the drum flange 13151,   the drum shaft 13153,    the
   drive transmission pin 13155,     and so on.    However, the
   structure of the drum unit U13 is not      limited to this example.
   [0546]       As means for inclining the axis L2 to the pre
30 engagement angular position, immediately before the coupling
   11849383 1                                                  902028D4

                                    - 151
   engages with the drive shaft, the embodiment 3-embodiment 10
   described until now can be employed.
   [0547]      In addition, with respect to engagement and
   disengagement between the coupling and the drive shaft
 5 operated interrelatedly with the mounting and the dismounting
   of the cartridge,     it is  the same as that of Embodiment 1,    and
   therefore, the description is omitted.
   [0548]      In addition, as has been described with respect to
   Embodiment   1   (Figure 31),  the inclining direction of the
10 coupling is regulated by the bearing member.        By this, the
   coupling can be more assuredly engaged with the drive shaft.
   [0549]      With the above-described structures, the coupling
   13150  is  a part of the photosensitive drum unit integral with
   the photosensitive drum.       Therefore, at the time of the
15 assembling, handling is easy, and therefore, the assembling
   property can be improved.
   [Embodiment    17]
   [0550]      Referring to Figure 93,     the 17th embodiment of the
20 present invention will be described.
   [0551]      The point that the present embodiment is different
   from Embodiment     1 is in the mounting method of the coupling.
   With respect to Embodiment 1, the coupling is mounted to the
   free end side of the drum shaft,       so that, the axis L2 is
25 slantable in any direction relative to         axis Li.  On the
   contrary, in this embodiment, the coupling 15150 is directly
   mounted to the end of the cylindrical drum 107a of the
   photosensitive drum 107,      so that it is  slantable in any
   direction.
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                    -  152
   [0552]      This will be described in more detail.
   [05531      Figure 93 shows an electrophotographic
   photosensitive member drum unit        ("drum unit")  U.   A coupling
   15150  is mounted to an end part of the photosensitive drum 107
 5  (cylindrical drum 107a) in this Figure.        As for the
   photosensitive drum 107,    a part of driving side is shown and
   the others are omitted for the simplification.
   [0554]      The axis L2  is substantially co-axial relative to
   the axis Li   in Figure 93   (a).    In this state, the coupling
10 15150  receives a rotational     force from the drive shaft 180         at
   a driven portion 15150a.      And, the coupling 15150 transmits
   the received rotational force to the photosensitive drum 107.
   [05551      And, an example is     shown in Figure 93    (b),   wherein
   the coupling 15150   is mounted to the end part of the
15 cylindrical drum 107a of the photosensitive drum 107,            so that
   it is slantable in any direction.         In this embodiment, one end
   of the coupling is mounted not to the drum shaft          (projection)
   but into the recess    (rotational force receiving member)
   provided at the end part of the cylinder        107a.    And, the
20 coupling 15150   is pivotable also in any direction relative to
   the axis Li.    As for the driven portion 15150a,        the
   configuration described with respect to Embodiment           1 is shown,
   but it may be a configuration of the driven portion of the
   coupling described in Embodiment 10 or Embodiment 11.             And, as
25 has been described with respect to Embodiment         1, this drum
   unit U   is assembled into the second frame      118   (drum frame),
   and it is constituted as the detachably mountable cartridge to
   the apparatus main assembly.
   11849383 1                                                     902028D4

                                - 153
   [05561     Thus, the drum unit U is constituted by the coupling
   15150, the photosensitive drum 107   (cylindrical drum 107a),
   the drum flange 15151, and so on.
   [0557]     As for a structure for inclining the axis L2 toward
 5 the pre-engagement angular position, immediately before the
   coupling 15150 engages with the drive shaft 180,   any of
   embodiment 3-embodiment 9 is usable.
   [05581     In addition, the engagement and disengagement
   between the coupling and the drive shaft which are operated
10 interrelatedly with the mounting and the dismounting of the
   cartridge are the same as those of Embodiment 1.    Therefore,
   the description is omitted.
   [05591     In addition, as has been described with respect to
   Embodiment 1 (Figure 31),  the drum bearing member is provided
15 with regulating means for regulating inclining direction of
   the coupling relative to axis Li.   By this, the coupling can
   be more assuredly engaged with the drive shaft.
   [05601     With this structure, the coupling can be slantably
   mounted without the drum shaft which was described heretofore
20 in any direction relative to the photosensitive drum.
   Therefore, the cost reduction can be accomplished.
   [0561]     In addition, according to the above structure, the
   coupling 15150 is a part of the drum units comprising the
   photosensitive drum as a unit.   Therefore, in the cartridge,
25 handling is easy at the time of the assembling, and the
   assembling property is improved.
   [05621     Referring to Figure 94 - Figure 105, the present
   embodiment will further be described.
   11849383 1                                             902028D4

   [05631      Figure 94 is   a perspective view of the process
   cartridge B-2 which uses the coupling 15150 of the present
   embodiment.    The outer periphery 15157a of an outside end of a
   drum bearing member 15157 provided at the driving side
 5 functions as a cartridge guide 140R1.
   [0564]      In addition, in the one longitudinal end     (driving
   side) of the second frame unit 120,     a cartridge guide 140R2
   which outwardly projects is provided substantially above a
   cartridge guide 140R1 which outwardly projects.
10 [05651      The process cartridge   is supported detachably in the
   apparatus main assembly by these cartridge guides 140R1,        1402
   and a cartridge guide     (unshown) provided at the non-driving
   side.    More particularly, the cartridge B    is moved to the
   apparatus main assembly A in the direction substantially
15 perpendicular to the direction of the axis L3 of the drive
   shaft   180, when it is mounted to the apparatus main assembly
   A2  or is demounted from it.
   [05661      Figure 95  (a) is a perspective view of the coupling,
   as seen from the driving side, Figure 95      (b) is a perspective
20 view of the coupling, as seen from the photosensitive drum
   side, and Figure 95    (c) shows a view of the coupling, as seen
   from the direction perpendicular to the axis L2.       Figure 95
    (d) is a side view of the coupling, as seen from the driving
   side, Figure 95    (e) shows a view, as seen from the
25 photosensitive drum side, and Figure 95      (f) is a sectional
   view taken along S21-S21 of Figure 95     (d).
   [0567]      The coupling 15150 is engaged with the drive shaft
   180  in the state where the cartridge B is mounted to the set
   portion 130a provided in the apparatus main assembly A.         And,
30 by removing the cartridge B from the set portion 103a, it is
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                   - 155
   disengaged from the drive shaft 180.        And, in the state where
   it engaged with the drive shaft 180, the coupling 15150
   receives the rotational force from the motor 186, and
   transmits a rotational force to the photosensitive drum 107.
 5 [05681      The coupling 15150 mainly comprises three portions
    (Figure 95   (c)).   A first portion is a driven portion    (a
   portion to be driven) 15150a which has a rotational force
   reception surface     (rotational force receiving portion) 15150e
    (15150el-15150e4) for engaging with a drive shaft 180 and
10 receiving a rotational force from a pin 182.        A second portion
   is a driving portion 15150b which engages with a drum flange
   15151   (pin 15155   (rotational force receiving member)),    and
   transmits a rotational force.      A third portion is a connecting
   portion 15150c which connects the driven portion 15150a and
15 the driving portion 15150b.      The materials of these portions
   are resin materials, such as polyacetal, the polycarbonate,
   and PPS.    However, in order to enhance rigidity of the member,
   the glass fiber, the carbon fiber, and so on may be mixed in
   the resin material depending on the required load torque.           In
20 addition, the rigidity may further be enhance(d) by inserting
   metal in the above described resin material, and the whole
   coupling may be made with the metal and so on.        The driven
   portion 15150a is provided with a drive shaft insertion
   opening portion 15150m in the form of an expanded part which
25 expands into a conical shape relative to the axis L2         as shown
   in Figure 95    (f).   The opening 15150m constitutes a recess
   15150z as shown in the Figure.
   [05691      The driving portion 15150b has a spherical driving
   shaft receiving surface 15150i.       The coupling 15150 can pivot
30 between the rotational force transmitting angular position and
   the pre-engagement angular position       (disengaging angular
   position) relative to the axis Li by the receiving surface
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                  - 156
   15150i.    By this, the coupling 15150 is engaged with the drive
   shaft 180 without being prevented by the free end portion 180b
   of the drive shaft 180 irrespective of the rotation phase of
   the photosensitive drum 107.      The driving portion 15150b has
 5 the convex configuration as shown in the Figure.
   [0570]      And, a plurality of drive receiving projections
   15150d1-d4 are provided on a circumference (phantom circle in
   Figure 8 (d) Cl)   of an end surface of the driven portion
   15150a.    In addition, the spaces between the adjacent
10 projections 15150d 1 or 15150d 2 or 15150d3 and 15150d4
   function as drive receiving stand-by portions 15150k1,
   15150k2, 15150k3, 15150k4.     Each interval between the adjacent
   projections 15150d1-d4 are larger than the outer diameter of
   the pin 182,   so that the pin   (rotational force applying
15 portion) 182 is received these intervals are standing-by
   portions 15150kl-k4.    In addition, in Figure 95    (d),  in the
   clockwise downstream of the projection 15150d, the rotational
   force receiving surfaces    (rotational force receiving portion)
   15150el-15150e4 facing faced in the direction crossing with
20 the direction of the rotational movement of the coupling 15150
   is provided.    When the drive shaft 180 rotates, the pin 182
   abuts or contacts to one of the drive force receiving surfaces
   15150el-15150e4.    And, the drive force receiving facing 15150
   is pushed by the side surface of the pin 182, and rotates the
25 coupling 15150 about the axis L2.
   [0571]      In addition, the driving portion 15150b has a
   spherical surface.    The coupling 15150 can be pivoted between
   the rotational force transmitting angular position and the
   pre-engagement angular position      (or disengaging angular
30 position) by the provision of the spherical surface
   irrespective of the rotation phase of the photosensitive drum
   107 in the cartridge B (swinging).       In the illustrated
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                    - 157
   example, spherical surface is a spherical drum bearing surface
   15150i   which has  its axis aligned with the axis L2.         And, a
   hole 15150g   for penetration anchoring for the pin        (rotational
   force transmitting portion) 15155 is        formed through the center
 5 thereof.
   [0572]      Referring to Figure 96,     the description will be made
   as to an example of a drum flange 15151 which mounts           the
   coupling 15150.     Figure 96   (a) shows a view as seen from the
   drive shaft   side, and Figure 96     (b) is   a sectional view taken
10 along S22-S22   of Figure 96    (a).
   [0573]      The openings 15151g    1,  15151g2 shown in Figure 96
    (a) are in the form of grooves extended in the circumferential
   direction of the flange 15151.        An opening 15151g3 is provided
   between the opening 15151gl      and the opening 15151g2.       At the
15 time of mounting the coupling 15150 to the flange 15151,            the
   pin 15155 is   accommodated in these openings 15151g        1, 15151g2.
   In addition, the drum bearing surface 15150i         is  accommodated
   in the opening 15151g3.
   [0574]      With the above-described structures,        irrespective of
20 the rotation phase of the photosensitive drum 107
    (irrespective of the stop position of the pin 15155)          in the
   cartridge B-2,   the coupling 15150 is pivotable        (swingable)
   between the rotational     force transmitting angular position and
   the pre-engagement angular positions        (or disengaging angular
25 position).
   [0575]      In addition, in Figure 96      (a),  the rotational force
   transmission surfaces     (rotational force receiving members)
   15151h   1, 15151h2  are provided in the clockwise upstream of
   the openings 15151g    1 or 15151g2.     And, the side surfaces of
30 the rotational force transmitting pin         (rotational force
   11849383  1                                                   902028D4

                                  - 158
   transmitting portion) 15155 of the coupling 15150 contact to
   the rotational force transmission surfaces 15151h 1, 15151h2.
   By this, a rotational force is transmitted from the coupling
   15150 to the photosensitive drum 107.     Here, the transmitting
 5 surfaces 15151h 1 - 15151h2 are faced in the circumferential
   direction of the rotational movement of the flange 15151.        By
   this, the transmitting surfaces 15151h 1 -    15151h2 are pushed
   to the side surfaces of the pin 15155.     And, in the state of
   the axis Li and the axis L2 being substantially co-axial, the
10 coupling 15150 rotates about the axis L2.
   [0576]      Here, the flange 15151 has a transmission receiving
   portion 15151h 1, 15151h2, and therefore, it functions as a
   rotational force receiving member.
   [0577]      The retaining portion 15151i shown in Figure 96    (b)
15 has the function of retaining the coupling 15150 to the flange
   15151,   so that the coupling can pivot between the rotational
   force transmitting angular position and the pre-engagement
   angular positions    (or disengaging angular position) in
   addition, it has the function of regulating the movement of
20 the coupling 15150 in the direction of the axis L2.
   Therefore, the opening 15151j has diameter @D15 smaller than
   the diameter of the bearing surface 15150i.    Thus, the motion
   of the coupling is limited by the flange 15151.     Because of
   this, the coupling 15150 des not disengage from the
25 photosensitive drum (cartridge).
   [0578]      As has been shown in Figure 96, the driving portion
   15150b of the coupling 15150 is in engagement with the recess
   provided in the flange 15151.
   11849383 1                                              902028D4

   [0579]      Figure 96  (c) is a sectional view which illustrates
   the process in which the coupling 15150 is assembled to the
   flange 15151.
   [05801      The driven portion 15150a and the connecting portion
 5 15150c are inserted in the direction X33 into the flange
   15151.    In addition, the positioning member 15150p   (driving
   portion 15150b) which has the bearing surface 15150i is put in
   the direction of an arrow X32.     The pin 15155 penetrates a
   fixing hole 15150g of the positioning member 15150p,      and the
10 fixing hole 15150r of the connecting portion 15150c.       By this,
   the positioning member 15150p is fixed to the connecting
   portion 15150c.
   [0581]      Figure 96  (d) shows a sectional view which
   illustrates the process in which the coupling 15150 is fixed
15 to the flange 15151.
   [0582]      The coupling 15150 is moved in the X32 direction, so
   that the bearing surface 15150i    is brought into contact or
   proximity with the retaining portion 15151i.     The retaining
   portion material 15156 is inserted in the direction of the
20 arrow X32, and it is fixed to the flange 15151.     The coupling
   15150 is mounted to the flange 15151 with a play (gap) to the
   positioning member 15150p in this mounting method.      By this,
   the coupling 15150 can change the direction thereof.
   [0583]      Similarly to the projection 15150d,  the rotational
25 force transmission surfaces 15150h 1, 15150h2 are desirably
   disposed diametrically opposed (180 degrees) on the same
   circumference.
   [0584]      Referring to Figure 97 and Figure 98,  the structure
   of a photosensitive drum unit U3 will be described.       Figure 97
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

   driving side, and Figure 97    (b) is a perspective view, as seen
   from the non-driving side.    In addition, Figure 98 is     a
   sectional view taken along S23-S23 of Figure 97      (a).
 5 [05851      A drum flange 15151   mounted to the coupling 15150
   is  fixed to one end side of the photosensitive drum 107
    (cylindrical drum 107a),  so that a transmission part 15150a is
   exposed.    In addition, the drum flange 152   of the non-driving
   side is   fixed to the other end side of the photosensitive drum
10 107  (cylindrical drum 107a).    This fixing method is crimping,
   bonding, welding, or the like.
   [05861      And, in the state where the driving side is
   supported by the bearing member 15157 and the non-driving side
   is  supported by the drum supporting pin    (unshown), the drum
15 unit U3   is rotatably supported by the second frame    118.    And,
   it is unified into the process cartridge by mounting the first
   frame unit 119 to the second frame unit 120     (Figure 94).
   [0587]      Designated by 15151c is  a gear, and has a function
   of transmitting a rotational force received by the coupling
20 15150  from the drive shaft  180 to the developing roller 110.
   The gear 15151c is   integrally molded with the flange 15151.
   [05881      The drum unit U3 described in this embodiment
   comprises the coupling 15150,    the photosensitive drum 107
    (cylindrical drum 107a),  and the drum flange 15151.      The
25 peripheral surface of the cylindrical drum 107a is coated with
   a photosensitive layer 107b.     In addition, the drum unit
   comprises the photosensitive drum coated with the
   photosensitive layer 107b, and the coupling mounted to one end
   thereof.    The structure of the coupling is not   limited to the
30 structure described in this embodiment.      For example, it may
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

   have the structure described hereinbefore as the embodiments
   of the coupling.        In addition, it may be another structure if
   it has the structure in which the effects of the present
   invention are provided.
 5 [05891      Here, as shown in Figure 100,          the coupling 15150 is
   mounted so that it can incline in any direction relative to
   the axis Li   of the axis L2 thereof.          Figures 100(al)-   (a5) are
   views as seen from the drive shaft 180,            and Figures 100(b1)
    (b5) are perspective views thereof.           Figures    100(b1)-   (b5)
10 is partly broken views of substantially the entirety of the
   coupling 15150, wherein a part of a flange 15151 is cut away
   for better illustration.
   [05901      In Figures 100       (al) (b1),  the axis L2 is co-axially
   positioned relative to the axis Li.            When the coupling 15150
15 is  inclined upward from this state$         It is   in the state shown
   in Figures 100      (a2)   (b2).   As shown in this Figure, when the
   coupling 15150     inclines toward an opening 15151g          A pin 15155
   is moved along the opening 15151g.           As  a result, the coupling
   15150  is  inclined about the axis AX perpendicular to the
20 opening 15151g.
   [0591]      The coupling 15150 is        inclined rightward in Figure
   100  (a3)  (b3).     As  shown in this Figure, when the coupling
   15150  inclines in the orthogonal direction of the opening
   15151g, it rotates in the opening 15151g.             The pin 15155
25 rotates about the axis line AY of the pin 15155.
   [0592]      The state where the coupling 15150 is          inclined
   leftward and the state where it is inclined downward are shown
   in Figs. 100     (a4)   (b4)  and 100   (a5)  (b5).   Since the
   description of the rotation axis AX, AY has been made in the
30 foregoing, the description therefor is           omitted for simplicity.

   [05931      The rotation in the direction different from these
   inclining directions, for example, 45-degree rotation shown in
   Figure 100    (al), is provided by a combination of the rotations
   around the rotation axes AX, AY.      In this manner, the axis L2
 5 can be inclined in any directions relative to the axis Li.
   [0594]      The opening 15151g   is extended in the direction
   crossing with the projection direction of the pin 15155.
   [05951      In addition, between the flange    (rotational force
   receiving member) 15151    and the coupling 15150,   a gap is
10 provided as shown in the Figure.      With this structure, as has
   been described hereinbefore, the coupling 15150 is pivotable
   in all the directions.
   [05961      More particularly, the transmitting surfaces
    (rotational force transmitting portions)    15151h  (15151hl,
15 15151h2)   are in the operative positions relative to the pins
   15155   (the rotational  force transmitting portion).    The pin
   15155 is movable relative to the transmitting surface 15151h.
   The transmitting surface 15151h and the pin 15155 are engaged
   or abutted to each other.     To accomplish this motion, a gap is
20 provided between the pin 15155 and the transmitting surface
   15155h.    By this,  the coupling 15150 is pivotable relative to
   the axis Li    in all directions.   In this manner, the coupling
   15150  is mounted to the end of the photosensitive drum 107.
   [0597]      The axis L2 has been mentioned as being pivotable in
25 any direction relative to the axis Li.      However, the coupling
   15150  does not necessarily need to be linearly pivotable to
   the predetermined angle over the 360-degree range.       This   is
   applied to all the couplings described as the embodiments in
   the foregoing.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                  - 163
   [05981      In this embodiment, the opening 15151g is formed
   slightly overwidely in the circumferential direction.         With
   this structure, when the axis L2 inclines relative to the axis
   Li, even if it is the case where it cannot incline to the
 5 predetermined angle linearly, the coupling 15150 can incline
   to the predetermined angle by rotating to a slight degree
   about the axis L2 in other words, the play of the opening
   15151g   in the rotational direction is selected properly in
   view of this, if necessary,.
10 [05991      In this manner, the coupling 15150 is pivotable in
   all the directions substantially.      Therefore, the coupling
   15150 is revolvable    (pivotable) over the full-circumference
   substantially relative to the flange 15151.
   [06001      As has been described hereinbefore,     (Figure 98),    the
15 spherical surface 15150i of the coupling 15150 contacts to the
   retaining portion   (a part of recess) 15151i.     Therefore, the
   center P2 of the spherical surface 15150i aligns with the
   rotation axis, and the coupling 15150 is mounted.        More
   particularly, the axis L2 of the coupling 15150 is pivotable
20 irrespective of the phase of the flange 15151.
   [06011      In addition, in order for the coupling 15150 to
   engage with the drive shaft 180,     the axis L2 is inclined
   toward the downstream with respect to the mounting direction
   of the cartridge B-2 relative to the axis Li just before the
25 engagement.    More particularly, as shown in Figure 101, the
   axis L2 is inclined relative to the axis Li,      so that the
   driven portion 15150a is the downstream with respect to the
   mounting direction X4.     In Figures 101   (a) - (c),  the position
   of the driven portion 15150a is downstream with respect to the
30 mounting direction X4,    in any case.
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                  - 164
   [0602]      Figure 94 illustrates the state where the axis L2 is
   inclined relative to the axis Li.      In addition, Figure 98 is a
   sectional view taken along S24-S24 of Figure 94.       As  shown in
   Figure 99, by the structure described heretofore, from the
 5 state of the axis L2 being inclined, it can change to the
   state of being substantially parallel to the axis Li.        In
   addition, the maximum possible inclination angle a4       (Figure
   99) between the axis Li    and the axis L2 is  the angle at the
   time of inclining until the driven portion 15150a or the
10 connecting portion 15150c contacts with the flange 15151 or
   the bearing member 15157.     This inclination angle is    the value
   required for engagement and disengagement relative to the
   drive shaft of the coupling at the time of mounting and
   demounting the cartridge relative to the apparatus main
15 assembly.
   [06031      Immediately before or simultaneously with the
   cartridge B being set at the predetermined position of the
   apparatus main assembly A,    the coupling 15150 and the drive
   shaft   180 engage with each other.    Referring to Figure 102     and
20 Figure 103, the description will be made with respect to the
   engaging operation of this coupling 15150.      Figure 102 is    a
   perspective view which illustrates the major parts of the
   drive shaft and driving side of the cartridge.       Figure 103    is
   a longitudinal sectional view, as seen from the lower part of
25 the apparatus main assembly.
   [0604]      In the mounting process of the cartridge B,     as shown
   in Figure 102,    the cartridge B is mounted into the apparatus
   main assembly A in the direction     (the direction of the arrow
   X4)  substantially perpendicular to the axis L3.      The  axis L2
30 of the coupling 15150    inclines to the downstream with respect
   to the mounting direction X4 relative to the axis Li
   beforehand    (pre-engagement angular position)   (Figure 102   (a),
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                  - 165
   Figure 103    (a)). By this inclination of the coupling 15150,
   with respect to the direction of the axis Li,       the free end
   position 1515OAl is closer to the photosensitive drum 107 than
   the shaft free-end 180b3 with respect to the direction of the
 5 axis Li.    In addition, the free end position 15150A2 is closer
   to the pin 182 than the shaft free-end 180b3 with respect to
   the direction of the axis Li     (Figure 103  (a)).
   [06051      First, the free end position 1515OAl passes by the
   drive shaft free-end 180b3.     Thereafter, the driving shaft
10 receiving surface 150f of conical shape or the driven
   projection 150d contacts to the free end portion 180b of the
   drive shaft 180, or the rotational force drive transmission
   pin 182.    Here, the receiving surface 150f and/or the
   projection 150d are the contact portions of the cartridge
15 side.    In addition, the free end portion 180b and/or the pin
   182 are the engaging portions of the main assembly side.          And,
   in response to the movement of the cartridge B, the coupling
   15150 is inclined so that the axis L2 becomes substantially
   co-axial with the axis Li    (Figure 103  (c)).    And, when the
20 position of the cartridge B is finally determined relative to
   the apparatus main assembly A, the drive shaft 180 and the
   photosensitive drum 107 are substantially co-axial.         More
   particularly, in the state of the contact portion of the
   cartridge side contacting with the engaging portion of the
25 main assembly side, in response to the insertion toward the
   back side of the apparatus main assembly A of the cartridge B,
   the coupling 15150 is pivoted to the rotational force
   transmitting angular position from the pre-engagement angular
   position, so that the axis L2 becomes substantially co-axial
30 with the axis Li.    And, the coupling 15150 and the drive shaft
   180 are engaged with each other     (Figure 102   (b), Figure
   103(d)).
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                   - 166
   [06061      As has been described hereinbefore, the coupling
   15150 is mounted for inclining motion relative to the axis Li.
   And, it can be engaged with the drive shaft 180 by the
   pivoting of the coupling 15150 corresponding to the mounting
 5 operation of the cartridge B.
   [0607]      In addition, similarly to Embodiment 1, the engaging
   operation of the coupling 15150 described above can be carried
   out regardless of the phase of the drive shaft 180 and the
   coupling 15150.
10 [06081      In this manner, according to the present embodiment,
   the coupling 15150 is mounted for revolving or whirling motion
    (swinging) around the axis Li substantially.     The motion
   illustrated in Figure 103 may include the whirling motion.
   [06091      Referring to Figure 104,   the description will be
15 made about the rotational force transmitting operation at the
   time of rotating the photosensitive drum 107.      The drive shaft
   180 rotates with the drum driving gear 181 in the direction of
   X8 in the Figure by the rotational force received from the
   motor 186.    The gear 181 is a helical gear and the diameter
20 thereof is the approx. 80mm.      And, the pin 182 integral with
   the drive shaft 180 contacts to any two of receiving surfaces
   150e   (four places)  (rotational force receiving portions) of
   the coupling 15150.     And, the coupling 15150 rotates by the
   pin 182 pushing the receiving surface 150e.      In addition, in
25 the coupling 15150, the rotational force transmitting pin
   15155   (coupling side engaging portion, rotational force
   transmitting portion) contacts to the rotational force
   transmission surface     (rotational force receiving member)
   15151h 1, 15151h2.     By this, the coupling 15150 is coupled,
30 for transmission of driving force, with the photosensitive
   drum 107.    Therefore, the photosensitive drum 107 rotates
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                    - 167
   through the flange 15151 by the rotation of the coupling
   15150.
   [0610]      In addition, when the axis Li    and the axis L2 are
   deviated to a slight degree, the coupling 15150 inclines a
 5 little.    By this,    the coupling 15150 can rotate without
   applying large load to the photosensitive drum 107 and the
   drive shaft    180.    Therefore, at the time of assembling the
   drive shaft    180 and the photosensitive drum 107,    no precise
   adjustment is necessary.       Therefore, the manufacturing can be
10 reduced.
   [0611]      Referring to Figure 105,    the description will be
   made as to the dismounting operation of the coupling 15150 at
   the time of taking out the process cartridge B-2       from the
   apparatus main assembly A.       Figure 105 is a longitudinal
15 sectional view, as seen from the lower part of the apparatus
   main assembly.      When the cartridge B  is demounted from the
   apparatus main assembly A as shown in Figure 105,       it is moved
   in the direction      (the direction of the arrow X6)  substantially
   perpendicular to the axis L3.       First, similarly to embodiment
20 1,  at the time of demounting the cartridge B-2,      the drive
   transmission pin 182 of the drive shaft 180      is positioned in
   any two of standing-by portions 15150k1-15150k4       (Figure).
   [0612]      After the drive of the photosensitive drum 107
   stops, the coupling 15150      takes the rotational force
25 transmitting angular position, wherein the axis L2 is
   substantially co-axial with the axis Li.       And, when the
   cartridge B moves toward the front side of the apparatus main
   assembly A    (the dismounting direction X6),   the photosensitive
   drum 107   is moved toward the front side.     In response to this
30 movement, shaft receiving surface 15150f      or the projection
   15150d   in the upstream with respect to the dismounting
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                 - 168
   direction of the coupling 15150 contacts at least to the free
   end portion 180b of the drive shaft 180       (Figure 105a).    And,
   the axis L2 begins   (Figure 105  (b))  to incline upstream with
   respect to the dismounting direction X6.       This inclining
 5 direction is the same as the inclination of the coupling 15150
   at the time of the mounting of the cartridge B.       By the
   dismounting operation of this cartridge B, the cartridge B is
   moved while the upstream free end portion 15150 A3 with
   respect to the dismounting direction X6 contacts to the free
10 end portion 180b.   And, the coupling 15150 is inclined until
   the upstream free end portion 15150 A3 reaches to the drive
   shaft free-end 180b3   (Figure 105   (c)).  The angular position
   of the coupling 15150 in this case is the disengaging angular
   position.   And, in this state, the coupling 15150 is passed by
15 the drive shaft free-end 180b3, contacting with the drive
   shaft free-end 180b3   (Figure 105   (d)).  Thereafter, the
   cartridge B-2 is taken out of the apparatus main assembly A.
   [0613]     As has been described hereinbefore, the coupling
   15150 is mounted for pivoting motion relative to the axis Li.
20 And, the coupling 15150 can be disengaged from the drive shaft
   180 by the coupling 15150 pivoting correspondingly to the
   dismounting operation of the cartridge B-2.
   [0614]     The motion illustrated in Figure 105 may include the
   whirling motion.
25 [0615]     With the structure as described above, the coupling
   15150 is integral part of the photosensitive drum as the
   photosensitive drum unit.    Therefore, at the time of the
   assembling, handling is easy and the assembling property is
   improved.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                  - 169
   [0616]      In order to incline the axis L2 to the pre
   engagement angular position immediately before the coupling
   15150 engages with the drive shaft 180,    any one of structures
   of the embodiment 3-embodiment 9 is usable.
 5 [0617]      In addition, in this embodiment, it has been
   described that the drum flange of the driving side is a
   separate member from the photosensitive drum.     However, the
   present invention is not limited to such an example.      In other
   words, the rotational force receiving portion may be directly
10 provided on the cylindrical drum, not on the drum flange.
   [Embodiment 18]
   [0618]      Referring to Figure 106, Figure 107, and Figure 108,
   the 18th embodiment of the present invention will be
15 described.
   [0619]      The present embodiment is a modified example of the
   coupling described in Embodiment 17.     The configurations of
   the drum flange and retaining member of the driving side
   differ in Embodiment 17.     In any case, the coupling is
20 pivotable in the given direction irrespective of the phase of
   the photosensitive drum.     In addition, the structure for
   mounting of the photosensitive drum unit to the second frame
   as will be described below is the same as that of the
   foregoing embodiment, and therefore, the description is
25 omitted.
   [0620]      Figure 106  (a) and (b) illustrate a first modified
   example of the photosensitive drum unit.     In Figure 106   (a)
   and (b),   since the photosensitive drum and the non-driving
   side drum flange are the same as those of Embodiment 16, these
30 are not illustrated.
   11849383 1                                              902028D4

                                 -  170
   [0621]      More particularly, the coupling 16150 is provided
   with a supporting portion 16150p of a ring shape which is
   pierced by the pin 155.    The edge lines 16150pl,    16150p2 of
   the peripheral part of the supporting portion 16150p are
 5 equidistant from the axis of the pin 155.
   [0622]      And, an inner periphery of the drum flange
    (rotational force receiving member) 16151 constitutes a
   spherical surface portion 16151i     (recess).  A center of the
   spherical surface portion 16151i is disposed on the axis of
10 the pin 155.    In addition, a slot 16151u is provided and this
   is  the hole which extends in the direction of the axis Li.        By
   the provision of this hole, the pin 155 is not      interfered when
   the axis L2   inclines.
   [0623]      In addition, a retaining member 16156 is provided
15 between the driven portion 16150a and the supporting portion
   16150p.    And, the portion opposed to the supporting portion
   16150p   is provided with the spherical surface portion 16156a.
   Here, the spherical surface portion 16156a is concentric with
   the spherical surface portion 16151i.      In addition, a slot
20 16156u is disposed so that   it is   continuous with the slot
   16151u in the direction of the axis Li.      Therefore, when the
   axis Li pivots, the pin 155   can move the inside of the slots
   16151u,   16156u.
   [0624]      And, the drum flange, the coupling, and the
25 retaining member for these driving side structures are mounted
   to the photosensitive drum.     By this,  the photosensitive drum
   unit is   constituted.
   [0625]      With the structure as described above, when the axis
   L2 is inclined, the edge lines    16150pl,  16150p2  of the
30 supporting portion 16150p move along the spherical surface
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                   -  171
   portion 16151i and the spherical surface portion 16156a.          By
   this, similarly to the foregoing embodiment, the coupling
   16150  can be inclined assuredly.
   [0626]      In this manner, the supporting portion 16150p is
 5 pivotable relative to the spherical surface portion 16151i
   that is,   the suitable gap is provided between the flange 16151
   and the coupling 16150,     so that the coupling 16150 is
   swingable.
   [0627]      Therefore, the effects similar to the effects
10 described in Embodiment 17 are provided.
   [0628]      Figure 107  (a) and   (b) illustrate a second modified
   example of the photosensitive drum unit.       In Figure 107   (a)
   and  (b),  since the photosensitive drum and the non-driving
   side drum flange are the same as those of Embodiment 17,        the
15 illustration is omitted.
   [0629]      More particularly, similarly to Embodiment 17,      a
   coupling 17150   is provided with a spherical supporting portion
   17150p which has an intersection between axis of the pin 155,
   and axis L2 as the center substantially.
20 [0630]      A drum flange 17151 is provided with a conical
   portion 17151i contacted on the surface of the supporting
   portion 17150p    (recess).
   [0631]      In addition, a retaining member 17156 is provided
   between the driven portion 17150a and the supporting portion
25 17150p.    In addition, an edge line portion 17156a contacts
   with the surface of the supporting portion 17150p.
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                    -  172
   [0632]      And, the structure     (the drum flange, coupling, and
   retaining member) of this driving side is mounted to the
   photosensitive drum.      By this, the photosensitive drum unit is
   constituted.
 5 [06331      With the structure as described above, when the axis
   L2 inclines, the supporting portion 17150p becomes movable
   along the conical portion 17151i and the edge line       17156a of
   retaining member.     By this,   the coupling 17150 can be inclined
   assuredly.
10 [0634]      As described above, the supporting portion 17150p is
   pivotable    (swingable) relative to the conical portion 17151i.
   Between the flange 17151     and the coupling 17150,   a gap is
   provided in order to permit the pivoting of the coupling
   17150.    Therefore, the effects similar to the effects
15 described in Embodiment 17 are provided.
   [06351      Figure 108   (a) and   (b) illustrate a third modified
   example of the photosensitive drum unit U7.        The
   photosensitive drum and the non-driving side drum flange are
   the same as that of Embodiment       17 in the modified example of
20 Figure 108    (a) and (b),  and therefore, the illustration is
   omitted.
   [06361      More particularly, they are disposed co-axially with
   the rotation axis of a pin 20155.        In addition, a coupling
   20150 has a flat surface portion 20150r perpendicular to the
25 axis L2.    In addition, it is provided with a semi-spherical
   supporting portion 20150p which has an intersection between
   axis of a pin 20155 and the axis L2 as the center
   substantially.
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                  -  173
   [0637]      The flange 20151 is provided with the conical
   portion 20151i which has an apex 20151g on the axis thereof.
   The apex 20151g is   contacted with the flat surface portion
   20150r of the coupling.
 5 [06381      In addition, a retaining member 20156 is provided
   between the driven portion 20150a and the supporting portion
   20150p.    In addition, an edge line portion 20156a contacts
   with a surface of the supporting portion 20150p.
   [06391      And, the structure   (the drum flange, coupling, and
10 retaining member) of this driving side is mounted to the
   photosensitive drum.    By this, the photosensitive drum unit is
   constituted.
   [0640]      With the structure as described above, even if the
   axis L2 inclines, the coupling 20150 and the flange 20151       are
15 always in contact to each other substantially at the one
   point.    Therefore, the coupling 20150   can be inclined
   assuredly.
   [0641]      As described above, the flat surface portion 20150r
   of the coupling is   swingable relative to the conical portion
20 20151i.    Between the flange 20151 and the coupling 20150,     in
   order to permit the swinging of the coupling 17150,     a gap is
   provided.
   [0642]      The effects described above can be provided by
   constituting the photosensitive drum unit in this manner.
25 [0643]      As means for inclining the coupling to the pre
   engagement angular position, any one of the structures of
   Embodiment 3 to the embodiment 9 is used.
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

   [Embodiment   19]
   [0644]      Referring to Figure 109,   Figure 110, and Figure 111,
   the 19th embodiment of the present invention will be
 5 described.
   [0645]      The point in which the present embodiment is
   different from Embodiment     1 is the mounting structure of the
   photosensitive drum, and rotational force transmission
   structure from the coupling to the photosensitive drum.
10 [0646]      Figure 109 is  a perspective view which illustrates a
   drum shaft and a coupling.      Figure 111 is a perspective view
   of a second frame unit, as seen from the driving side.       Figure
   110  is a sectional view taken along S20-S20    of Figure 111.
   [0647]      In this embodiment, the photosensitive drum 107     is
15 supported by a drum shaft     18153 extended from a driving side
   of a second frame 18118    to a non-driving side thereof.    By
   this, a position of the photosensitive drum 107     can further
   accurately be determined.      This will be described more in the
   detail.
20 [0648]      The drum shaft   (rotational force receiving member)
   18153 supports a positioning hole 18151g, 18152g of flanges
   18151  and 18152  at the opposite ends of the photosensitive
   drum 107.    In addition, the drum shaft 18153 rotates
   integrally with the photosensitive drum 107 by a drive
25 transmitting portion 18153c.      In addition, the drum shaft
   18153 is   rotatably supported by the second frame 18118 through
   bearing members 18158 and 18159 in the neighborhood of the
   opposite ends   thereof.
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                  - 175
   [0649]     A  free end portion 18153b of the drum shaft 18153
   has  the same as configuration as the configuration described
   with respect to Embodiment 1.     More particularly, the free end
   portion 18153b has   a spherical surface and its drum bearing
 5 surface 150f   of the coupling 150   is slidable along the
   spherical surface.    By doing so,   the axis L2 is pivotable in
   any direction relative to the axis Li.      In addition, the
   disengagement of the coupling 150     is prevented by the drum
   bearing member 18157.    And, they are unified as the process
10 cartridge by connecting a first    frame unit   (unshown) with the
   second frame 18118.
   [06501     And, the rotational force is    transmitted from the
   coupling 150   through a pin  (rotational force receiving member)
   18155 to the photosensitive drum 107.      The pin 18155 is
15 through the center of the free end portion      (spherical surface)
   18153 of the drum shaft.
   [0651]     In addition, the coupling 150 is prevented by the
   drum bearing member 18157    from disengagement.
   [0652]     The engagement and disengagement between the
20 coupling and the apparatus main assembly in interrelation with
   the mounting and dismounting operations of the cartridge are
   the same as that of Embodiment    1, and therefore, the
   description is omitted.
   [06531     As  for the structure for inclining the axis L2
25 toward the pre-engagement angular position, any one of the
   structures of the embodiment 3-embodiment 10 is usable.
   [0654]     In addition, the structure described with respect to
   Embodiment   1 as to the configuration at the free end of the
   drum shaft can be used.
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                   - 176
   [06551      In addition, as has been described with respect to
   Embodiment   1  (Figure 31),  the inclining direction of the
   coupling relative to the cartridge is     regulated by the drum
   bearing member.     By this, the coupling can be more assuredly
 5 engaged with the drive shaft.
   [06561      The structure will not be limited, if the rotational
   force receiving portion is provided to the end part of the
   photosensitive drum, and it rotates integrally with the
   photosensitive drum.     For example, it may be provided on the
10 drum shaft provided at the end part of the photosensitive drum
    (cylindrical drum) as has been described with respect to
   Embodiment   1.   Or, as has been described in this embodiment,
   it may be provided at the end part of the drum penetrating
   shaft which is through the photosensitive drum      (cylindrical
15 drum).    Further alternatively, as has been described with
   respect to Embodiment 17,     it may be provided on the drum
   flange provided at the end part of the photosensitive drum
    (cylindrical drum).
   [0657]      The engagement   (coupling) between the drive shaft
20 and the coupling means the state where the coupling is abutted
   to or contacted to the drive shaft and/or the rotational       force
   applying portion in addition, in addition, it means that when
   the drive shaft in addition, starts the rotation to the
   meaning, the coupling abuts     to or contacts to the rotational
25 force applying portion and the rotational     force can be
   received from the drive shaft.
   [06581      In the embodiments described above, as for
   alphabetical suffixes of the referential signs     in the
   coupling, the same alphabetical suffixes are assigned to the
30 members which have the corresponding functions.
   11849383 1                                               902028D4

                                 -  177
   [06591     Figure 112 is  a perspective view of a photosensitive
   drum unit U according to an embodiment of the present
   invention.
   [06601     In the Figure, the photosensitive drum 107      is
 5 provided with a helical gear 107c at the end which has the
   coupling 150.   The helical gear 107c transmits the rotational
   force which the coupling 150    receives from the apparatus main
   assembly A to the developing roller     (process means)   110.   This
   structure is  applied to the drum unit U3 shown in Figure 97.
10 [06611     In addition, the photosensitive drum 107 is provided
   with a gear 107d at the end opposite from the end which has
   the helical gear 107c.    In this embodiment, this gear 107d is
   a helical gear.   The gear 107d transmits the rotational force
   which the coupling 150   receives from the apparatus main
15 assembly A to the transfer roller 104     (Figure 4) provided in
   the apparatus main assembly A.
   [06621     In addition, the charging roller     (process means) 108
   contacts over the longitudinal range to the photosensitive
   drum 107.   By this, the charging roller 108     rotates with the
20 photosensitive drum 107.    The transfer roller 104 may be
   contacted to the photosensitive drum 107 over the longitudinal
   range thereof.   By this, the transfer roller 104 may be
   rotated by the photosensitive drum 107.      In this case, the
   gear for the rotation of the transfer roller 104       is
25 unnecessary.
   [06631     In addition, as shown in Figure 98,     the
   photosensitive drum 107   is provided with a helical gear 15151c
   at the end which has the coupling 15150.      The gear 15151c
   transmits the rotational force received by the coupling 15150
30 from the apparatus main assembly A to the developing roller
   11849383 1                                                902028D4

                                      - 178
   110   and, with respect to the direction of the axis Li            of the
   photosensitive drum 107,        the position in which the gear 15151c
   is provided, and the position in which the rotational force
   transmitting pin      (rotational force transmitting portion)
 5 15150hl,   h2   is provided overlap relative to each other           (the
   overlapping position is        shown by 3 in Figure 98).
   [0664]      In this manner, the gear 15151c and the rotational
   force transmitting portion overlap relative to each other with
   respect to the direction of the axis Li.           By this, the force
10 tending to deform the cartridge         frame Bi  is  reduced.     In
   addition, the length of the photosensitive drum 107 can be
   reduced.
   [06651      The couplings of the embodiments described above can
   apply to this drum unit.
15 [06661      Each coupling described above has         the following
   structure.
   [0667]      The coupling     (for example, the couplings      150,    1550,
   1750,   and 1850,   3150.4150,    5150,  6150,  7150,   8150, 1350,    1450,
   11150,   12150   12250  12350,   13150,  14150,  15150,   16150,   17150,
20 20150,   21150,   and so on) engages with the rotational          force
   applying portion      (for example, the pins 182,       1280, 1355,    1382,
   9182 and so on) provided in the apparatus main assembly A.
   And, the coupling receives the rotational          force for rotating
   the photosensitive drum 107.         In addition, this each coupling
25 is pivotable between the rotational force transmitting angular
   position for transmitting the rotational force            for rotating
   the photosensitive drum 107 by engaging with the rotational
   force applying portion to the photosensitive drum 107,              and the
   disengaging angular position inclined in the direction away
30 from the axis Li     of the photosensitive drum 107        from the
   11849383 1                                                       902028D4

                                   - 179
   rotational force transmitting angular position.        In addition,
   at the time of demounting the cartridge B       from the apparatus
   main assembly A in the direction substantially perpendicular
   to the axis Li,   the coupling is pivoted from the rotational
 5 force transmitting angular position to the disengaging angular
   position.
   [06681      As described in the foregoing, the rotational force
   transmitting angular position and the disengaging angular
   portion may be the same or equivalent to each other.
10 [06691      In addition, at the time of mounting the cartridge B
   to the apparatus main assembly A,      the operation is as follows.
   The coupling is pivoted from the pre-engagement angular
   position to the rotational     force transmitting angular position
   in response to moving the cartridge B in the direction
15 substantially perpendicular to the axis Li,       so as to permit
   the part of the coupling     (for example, the portion at the
   downstream free end position Al)      positioned in the downstream
   with respect to the direction in which the cartridge B is
   mounted to the apparatus main assembly A to circumvent the
20 drive shaft.    And, the coupling is positioned at the
   rotational force transmitting angular position.
   [0670]      The substantial perpendicularity has been explained
   hereinbefore.
   [06711      The coupling member has    a recess  (for example   150z,
25 12150z,   12250z, 14150z 15150z, 21150z)    in which a rotational
   axis L2 the coupling member extends through a center of the
   shape defining the recess.      The recess is over a free end of
   the driving shaft    (for example,  180,  1180,  1280 1380,  9180)  in
   the state in which the coupling member is positioned at the
30 rotational force transmitting angular position.        The  rotating
   11849383 1                                                 902028D4

                                     - 180
   force receiving portion      (for example rotating force receiving
   surface 150e,    9150e,  12350e, 14150e,     15150e)  is projected from
   a portion adjacent the driving shaft         in the direction
   perpendicular to the axis L3 and is engageable or abuttable to
 5 the rotating force applying portion in the rotational
   direction of the coupling.        By doing so, the coupling receives
   the rotating force from the driving shaft thereby to rotate.
   When the process cartridge       is dismounted from the main
   assembly of the electrophotographic image         forming apparatus
10 the coupling member pivots       from the rotational     force
   transmitting angular position to the disengaging angular
   position so that part      (upstream end portion 150A3,       1750A3,
   14150A3,   15150A3 with respect to the dismounting direction) of
   the coupling member circumvents the driving shaft in response
15 to movement of the process cartridge         in the direction
   substantially perpendicular to the axis of the
   electrophotographic photosensitive drum.          By doing so,     the
   coupling is disengaged from the driving shaft.
   [0672]      A plurality of such rotational force receiving
20 portions are provided on a phantom circle Cl           (Figure 8,    (d)
   Figure 95    (d) ) having a center 0      (Figures 8,   (d) ,  Figure 95
    (d) ) on the rotational axis of the coupling member at
   positions substantially diametrically opposite to each other.
   [0673]      The recess of the coupling has an expanding portion
25  (for example, Figures 8, 29,      33,  34,  36, 47,  51,  54,   60,  63,
   69,  72,  82,  83, 90,  91,  92,  93,  106,  107 108).    A plurality of
   the rotational force receiving portions are provided at
   regular intervals along a rotational direction of the coupling
   member.    The  rotating force applying portion        (for example,
30 182a,   182b) is projected at each of two positions and is
   extended in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the
   driving shaft.     One of the rotating force receiving portions
   11849383 1                                                      902028D4

                                  - 181
   is engaged to one of the two rotating force applying portions.
   The other one of the rotating force receiving portions which
   is  opposed to the one of the rotating force receiving portion
   is engaged to the other one of the two rotating force applying
 5 portions.    By doing so,  the coupling receives the rotating
   force from the driving shaft thereby to rotate.     With such a
   structure, the rotating force can be transmitted to the
   photosensitive drum by the coupling.
   [0674]      The expanding portion has a conical shape.    The
10 conical shape has   an apex on the rotational axis of the
   coupling member, and in the state in which coupling member is
   positioned at the rotational force transmitting angular
   position, the apex is opposed to the free end of the driving
   shaft.    The coupling member is over the free end of the
15 driving shaft when the rotational force is    transmitted to the
   coupling member.    With such a structure, the coupling can
   engage   (connect) with the driving shaft projected in the main
   assembly of the apparatus with overlapping with respect to the
   direction of axis L2.     Therefore, the coupling can engage with
20 the driving shaft with stability.
   [0675]      The free end portion of the coupling covers the free
   end of the driving shaft.     Therefore, the coupling may be
   easily disengaged from the driving shaft.     The coupling can
   receive the rotating force with high accuracy from the driving
25 shaft.
   [0676]      The coupling having the expanding portion and
   therefore the driving shaft can be cylindrical.     Because of
   this, the machining of the driving shaft is easy.
   [0677]      The coupling has the expanding portion of a conical
30 shape,   so that above-described effects can be enhanced.
   11849383 1                                              902028D4

                                  - 182
   [0678]       When the coupling is in the rotational force
   transmitting angular position, the axis L2 and the axis Li         are
   substantially coaxial.     In the state  in which coupling member
   is positioned at the disengaging angular position, the
 5 rotational axis of the coupling member is     inclined relative to
   the axis of the electrophotographic photosensitive drum so as
   to permit an upstream portion of the coupling member passes by
   the free end of the driving shaft in a removing direction in
   which the process cartridge is dismounted from the main
10 assembly of the electrophotographic image     forming apparatus.
   The coupling member includes a rotating force transmitting
   portion    (for example, 150h, 1550h, 9150h, 14150h, 15150h) for
   transmitting the rotating force to the electrophotographic
   photosensitive drum, and a connecting portion      (for example,
15 7150c between the rotating force receiving portion and the
   rotating force transmitting portion, wherein the rotating
   force receiving portion, the connecting portion ,      the rotating
   force transmitting portion are arranged along the rotational
   axis direction.     When the process cartridge is moved in the
20 direction substantially perpendicular to the driving shaft,
