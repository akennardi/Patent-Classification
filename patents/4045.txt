15
   [0002]        This invention relates to product dispensers, and in particular, relates to
   systems and methods for facilitating consumer-dispenser interactions.
                          BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
20
   [0003]        Conventional beverage dispensers can pour a beverage by combining a
   syrup, sweetener, and/or water. To create a finite variety of beverage selections
   different kinds of syrup can be offered. This typically results in being able to offer a
   finite number of branded and non-branded beverage selections. As an example, a single
25 prior art dispenser using several different kinds of syrup might be able to offer limited
                               TM                         TM           TM
   choices of COCA-COL.A          , DIET COCA-COLA           , SPRITE     , and a few other
   branded or non-branded beverage selections.
   [0004]        One problem with these types of conventional beverage dispensers is that
30 only a limited number of drinks can be offered. As such, conventional beverage
   dispensers may be limited in being able to offer the consumer what they want. In this
   regard, consumers want a wider menu of beverage selections and the ability to
   customize their beverage. Research suggests that they want more beverage variations
   even for a traditional branded beverage. For example, offering COCA-COLATM,
35 COCA-COLATM with lime, CHERRY COCA-COLAT M, VANILLA COCA-COLAT M
   and numerous other types of COCA-COLArm beverage variations. Offering all the
   variations possible for a single drink brand such as COCACOLATM is impractical in
   conventional beverage

                                                  2
   dispensers in part because conventional beverage dispensers have limited capacity and
   selection capability. They may not offer the consumer what the consumer wants, that is,
   a complete variety of choices for all types of branded and non-branded beverages.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
    t00251      As used herein, the terms "beverage forming dispenser", "product dispenser",
    "beverage dispenser". "dispenser apparatus", and "dispenser" refer to a device which
    dispenses a product such as a beverage, can, bottle, or container.
25  [00261      As used herein, the terms "product" and "beverage", and their pluralized
    forms, are used synonymously, and embodiments of the invention should not be limited
    in scope by the use of either term.

                                                 5
   10027]      Turning now to the drawings in greater detail, an example system 100 for a
   product dispenser according to an embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 1.
   The example system, such as 100, can operate with a networked computer environment
   which includes at least one network in communication with a product dispenser. For
 5 example in Figure 1, a product dispenser, such as 102A is shown in communications
   with a communications network, such as 104. In this embodiment, at least one of the
   product dispensers, such as 102A, can interface with a consumer, customer, or other
   user. Other example environments or systems for a product dispenser according to an
   embodiment of the invention may include non-network configurations.
10 [0028]      The example product dispenser, such as 102A, shown in Figure 1, can be a
   client-type device. Each product dispenser, such as 102A-102N, can be a computer or
   processor-based device capable of communicating with the communications network,
   such as 104, via a signal, such as a wireless frequency signal or a direct wired
   communication signal.
15 [0029]      Each product dispenser, such as 102A, can include a processor or controller
   106, an identification reader / scanner device 106A, an ingredient matrix 108, a
   computer-readable medium, such as a random access memory (RAM) 110, coupled to
   the processor or controller 106, and an input/output device, such as display device 112.
   The processor or controller, such as 106, can execute computer-executable program
20 instructions stored in memory, such as 110. Computer executable program instructions
   stored in memory, such as 110, can include any number of module application programs,
   such as a consumer interaction engine or module, such as 114. The consumer interaction
   engine or module, such as 114, can be adapted to implement various methods for
   consumer-dispenser interactions. In addition, a consumer interaction engine or module,
25 such as 114, can be adapted to receive one or more signals from one or more consumers,
   remote and/or local servers or data processing resources, and client-type devices or
   wireless communication devices. Other examples of functionality and aspects of
   embodiments of a consumer interaction engine or module, such as 114, are described
   below.
30 [0030]      The identification reader / scanner device 106A shown in Figure 1 can be in
   communication with the controller 106, and can receive or otherwise obtain

                                                  6
   identification information from any number of devices or means associated with a
   consumer. For example, an identification reader / scanner device, such as 106A, can
   include a machine readable code technology such as bar code, or may include any
   wireless communication technology such as RFID, reflected light frequency, optical, etc.
 5 100311       As shown in Figure 1, the processor or controller, such as 106, can be in
   communication with an ingredient matrix, such as 108, to control, monitor, and track the
   addition, flow, and removal of some or all of the ingredients to or from the matrix, such
   as 108. An ingredient matrix can be, for example, a series of receptacles or mountings
   capable of receiving or mounting to a respective product ingredient package or other
10 product ingredient supply. For example, a product ingredient package, such as II 6A,
   can be manufactured as a pouch of liquid secured in a plastic ridged container to allow
   insertion into an ingredient matrix, such as 108. When inserted into the ingredient
   matrix, such as 108, the package, such as 11 6A, or pouch can be pierced by at least one
   associated fitting which allows the liquid in the package, such as 1 I6A, or pouch to be
15 pumped or otherwise metered by the controller, such as 106, or the matrix, such as 108,
   and associated equipment in precise ratios to form the desired product, such as a
   beverage. In one embodiment, one or more product ingredient packages, such as I16A
    I 16Q, can be inserted into an ingredient matrix, such as 108. The ingredient matrix,
   such as 108, in this embodiment can secure some or all of the product ingredient
20 packages, such as I 16A-1 16Q. In one embodiment, one or more product packages, such
   as 1160, 116P, I 16Q may be direct supplies rather than packages. For example, a
   product package, such as 1160, can be a continuous supply of carbonated water provided
   from a carbonated water source; a product package, such as 1I6P, can be a sweetener
   provided from a sweetener source such as a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) or high
25  fructose corn syrup (HFCS); and a product package, such as 116Q, can be a continuous
    supply of water from a tap, purified, or distilled water source. In any embodiment,
    ingredients, components, or product additives may be in the form of a pouch, or may be
    in another configuration suitable for access by the ingredient matrix, such as 108.
    [00321      In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, a product dispenser, such as 102A,
30 with an ingredient matrix, such as 108. can include one or more machine readable code
   readers, such as 11 8A- I 18Q, utilizing a machine readable code technology such as bar

                                                 7
   code, RFID, reflected light frequency, optical, etc. In one embodiment, at least one
   machine readable code reader, such as 11 8A- I 18Q, can be associated with a location
   associated with an ingredient matrix, such as 108, wherein some or all of the product
   ingredient packages, such as I 16A- 116Q, can be scanned, read, or otherwise identified
 5 prior to insertion into or connection with the ingredient matrix, such as 108. In this
   regard, the processor or controller, such as 106, can receive or obtain information related
   to some or all of the product ingredient packages, such as 16A-1 16Q, and use such
   information to identify within the ingredient matrix, such as 108, an optimum or other
   desired location within the ingredient matrix, such as 108, for placement of the product
10 ingredient package, such as 1 I6A. For example, data from a product ingredient package,
   such as I 16A, can be read, scan, or identified from a serial number or identification code
   associated with the product ingredient package, such as l I6A. Such data can be utilized
   alone or correlated with previously stored information in at least one database, such as
    128A-128C, described below, or with data otherwise accessible or stored by a data
15 processing resource or server, described below, such as 126, which may identify one or
   more ingredients associated with the product ingredient package, such as I 16A. In
   another example, data from a product ingredient package, such as I 16A, can be a
   ingredient code or identifier, and can be utilized alone or correlated with previously
   stored information in a database, such as 128A-128C, or with data otherwise accessible
20 or stored by a data processing resource or server, such as 126, which may identif' one or
   more ingredients associated with the product ingredient package, such as 116A.
   [0033]      In the embodiment shown in Figure 1. a product dispenser, such as 102A,
   with an ingredient matrix, such as 108, can include one or more pumps and/or valves,
   such as 120 and 122, respectively, and a nozzle, such as 124. In this example, each of
25 the pumps, such as 120, and valves, such as 122, can be controlled by the product
   dispenser, such as 102A. For instance, the processor or controller, such as 106, can be in
   communication with some or all of the pumps, such as 120, and valves, such as 122. In
   this regard, some or all of the pumps, such as 120, and/or valves, such as 122, can be
   selectively operated by the processor or controller, such as 106, to pump, meter, or
30 otherwise obtain respective product products or ingredients from certain of the product
   ingredient packages, such as 116A-1 16Q, to dispense a custom product or beverage,

                                                 8
   [0034]      In one embodiment, an ingredient matrix, such as 108, can have multiple
   product ingredient packages, such as 116A-1 16Q, inserted into it, wherein each package
   may contain a different or unique ingredient. By way of one or more commands or
   instructions from a processor or controller, such as 106, to one or more pumps, such as
 5 120, and/or valves, such as 122, associated with the ingredient matrix, such as 108,
   varying ratios of ingredients from some or all of the product ingredient packages, such as
   1 16A-l 16Q, can be selectively combined to form various types of products, such as
   beverages. Example ingredients can include, but are not limited to, a flavoring, a
   concentrate, a syrup, a sweetener, water, carbonated water, a lime flavoring, vanilla
10 flavoring, cherry flavoring, and any ingredient part of a branded or non-branded drink,
   such as CHERRY COCA-COLATM, VANILLA COCA-COLATM, COCA-COLATM.
   DIET COCA-COLATM, and FANTATM.
   [0035]      In one embodiment, one or more of the product ingredient packages, such as
    116A-1 16Q, may contain ingredients referred to as "pungent", which may limit their
15 placement within an ingredient matrix, such as 108. Pungent-type ingredients can be
   relatively strong such that once a pungent ingredient is pumped or otherwise drawn
   through a particular portion of a product dispenser, such as 102A, any associated path
   through the dispenser, such as 102A, such as tubing in the product dispenser, such as
    102A, may be permanently flavored arid any subsequent ingredient or fluid that is
20 pumped or drawn through the path or tubing may be tainted with the taste of the
   pungent-type ingredient. As such, once a pungent-type ingredient is used in an
   ingredient matrix, such as 108, an associated processor or controller, such as 106, can
   track or otherwise store information that controls or limits the replacement and/or
   addition of other pungent ingredients to certain locations of the ingredient matrix, such
25 as 108, to avoid mixing pungent-type ingredients or tainting non-pungent ingredients in
   order to maintain product or beverage quality.
   10036]      In another embodiment, one or more product ingredient packages, such as
    116A-1 16Q, may require agitation to keep the associated ingredient sufficiently mixed.
   In such instances, the location of such ingredients in an ingredient matrix, such as 108,
30 can be limited to locations within the ingredient matrix, such as 108, that can be agitated
   as may be required and/or desired in a particular embodiment.

                                                  9
   100371       In another embodiment, ingredients from one or more of product ingredient
   packages, such as I 16A-1 16Q, may be dispensed through antimicrobial-type tubing
   and/or dispenser parts. Such ingredients can include, but are not limited to, milk, dairy,
   soy, and/or other types and kinds of product ingredient packages. In these instances, the
 5 location of such ingredients in an ingredient matrix, such as 108, can be limited to
   locations within the ingredient matrix, such as 108, that utilize suitable antimicrobial
   type tubing and/or dispenser parts as may be required and/or desired in a particular
   embodiment.
    [00381      In yet another embodiment, a one-to-one relationship can be established
10 between a particular product ingredient package, such as 116A, and at least one pump
   and/or valve, such as 120 and/or 122, respectively. In some instances, utilizing more
   than one pump and/or valve for a single product ingredient package, such as I 16A, can
   draw a relatively higher volume of an ingredient from the package, such as I I6A, in a
   relatively shorter period of time. For example, a product ingredient package containing a
15 sweetener, such as sweetener, such as II 6P, may utilize more than one pump and/or
   valve to draw a relatively higher volume of an ingredient from the package I 16P in a
   relatively shorter period of time.
    [0039]      Returning to Figure 1, any number of other product dispensers, such as 102A
    102N, can also be in communication with the network, such as 104. In one embodiment,
20 the communications network, such as 104, shown in Figure 1 can be a local area network
   (LAN). In another embodiment, a communications network can be a wireless
   communications network capable of transmitting both voice and data signals, including
    image data signals or multimedia signals. Other networks can include, but are not
    limited to, Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a LON
25  WORKS network, a wired network, a wireless network, or any combination thereof
    [0040]      The network, such as 104 of Figure 1. is also shown in communication with
   at least one data processing resource, such as a server 126, and at least one database,
    such as 128A. In this embodiment, a server such as 126 can be a processor-based device
   capable of communicating with some or all of the product dispensers, such as 102A
30  102N, via the communications network, such as 104, by way of a signal, such as a
   wireless frequency signal or a direct wired communication signal. In addition, a data

                                                10
   processing resource or server, such as 126, can be used to aid or facilitate recipes,
   formulations, methods of making products or beverages, provide operational data
   processing, perform data processing related to consumer interaction, and/or perform
   other data processing as may be required and or desired in a particular embodiment.
 5 Such operational data processing can include, for example and not as a limitation,
   equipment status, maintenance, service alerts, predictive restock, and/or other types and
   kinds or operational data processing as may be required and/or desired in a particular
   embodiment. Such consumer interaction support can include, for example and not as a
   limitation, consumer preferences, consumer product or beverage preferences, loyalty,
10 gaming, prizes, media content, customizations, and/or other types and kinds of consumer
   interaction and/or data processing support as may be required and/or desired by a
   particular embodiment.
   [00411      The server, such as 126 in Figure 1, can include a processor, such as 130, and
   a computer-readable medium, such as a random access memory (RAM.) 132, coupled to
15 the processor 130. The processor, such as 130, can execute computer-executable
   program instructions stored in memory, such as 132. Computer executable program
   instructions stored in memory, such as 132, can include any number of module
   application programs, such as a consumer interaction engine or module similar to 114,
   The consumer interaction engine or module similar to 114 can be adapted to implement
20 various methods for consumer-interaction. In addition, a consumer interaction engine or
   module similar to 114 can be adapted to interact with one or more consumers, and one or
   more servers or data processing resources. Other examples of functionality and aspects
   of embodiments of a consumer interaction engine or module similar to 114 are described
   below.
25 100421      Through the network, such as 104 in Figure 1, some or all of the product
   dispensers, such as 102A-102N, can retrieve, receive, or otherwise access information
   stored in some or all of the databases, such as a recipes, formulations, and methods of
   making products or beverages database, such as 128A, operational database, such as
   128B, and consumer database, such as 128C. In any instance, one or more of the
30 databases can include product or beverage formation information such as one or more
   product or beverage recipes, formulations, and methods of making products or

                                                 II
   beverages. Such product or beverage recipes, formulations, and methods of making
   products or beverages can include an ingredient list, the ratio of each ingredient, a listing
   of how a product or beverage can be customized by a consumer, and/or other types and
   kinds of product or beverage recipes, formulations, and methods of making a product or
 5 beverage as may be required and/or desired by a particular embodiment.
   100431      The example environment or system, such as 100 shown in Figure 1, can
   facilitate customer, consumer, and user interaction with a product dispenser and network.
   For example and not as a limitation, a user such as a consumer can make a product or
   beverage type selection at a product dispenser, such as 102A, by way of an input/output
10 device, such as display device 112. An associated processor or controller, such as 106,
   can facilitate a user's selection via display device, such as 112, of a particular recipe to
   form a selected product, such as a beverage. The processor or controller, such as 106,
   can display one or more products or beverages for selection via the display device, such
   as 112. The user may select at least one of the products or beverages using the display
15 device, such as 112, for instance, pressing a button provided by or associated with the
   display device, such as 112. The processor or controller, such as 106, may obtain from a
   local memory, such as 110, or may communicate via a network, such as 104, with at
   least one database, or may communicate with at least one data processing resource, such
   as server 126, to obtain corresponding ingredients and/or ratio of ingredients for forming
20 the selected product or beverage. The processor or controller, such as 106, can utilize
   the information to operate one or more pumps, such as 120 and/or valves, such as 122, to
   form and dispense a product or beverage by way of a nozzle, such as 124, into a cup or
   other container, such as 136.
   [0044]       In another example, a user such as a customer or package installation
25 personnel can facilitate scanning or reading one or more product ingredient packages,
   such as 16A-1 16Q, when the packages I 16A-1 16Q are inserted within an ingredient
   matrix, such as 108, associated with a product dispenser, such as 102A. A processor or
   controller, such as 106, associated with the product dispenser, such as I 02A, can identify
   an optimum or selected location within the ingredient matrix, such as 108. The user,
30 customer, or package installation personnel can be informed where a particular product
   ingredient package, such as I 16A, is to be located in the ingredient matrix, such as 108,

                                                 12
   by way of an input/output device, such as display device, such as 112. An example of a
   display device can include, but is not limited to, a light emitting diode (LED) display
   indicator, LCD screen, input/output (I/O) interface, audio interface or other types and
   kinds of displays or indicators as may be required and/or desired in a particular
 5 embodiment.
   [0045]       In one embodiment, insertion of a particular product ingredient package, such
   as 116A. within an ingredient matrix, such as 108, can be checked or otherwise verified
   by scanning a machine readable code on the respective package, such as I 16A,. and
   scanning a machine readable code located on the ingredient matrix, such as 108, at the
10 point of insertion (illustrated as 118A). In this regard, an associated processor or
   controller, such as 106, can check or verify that the product ingredient package, such as
   116A, is correctly located within the ingredient matrix, such as 108.
   [0046]       In another embodiment, a cup, such as 136, or other container can include
   identification information, such as a RFID or other machine readable tag, such as 138,
15 mounted to the cup as shown in Figure 1. In some embodiments, identification
   information can be associated with a consumer by way of, for instance, RFID or other
   machine readable tag, similar to 138, embodied in or otherwise mounted to an icon or
   other object. A reader, such as a RFID or other machine readable code reader, such as
   140, associated with a product dispenser, such as 102A, can receive or otherwise obtain
20 the identification information from the RFID or other machine readable tag, similar to
   138. As shown in Figure 1, a processor or controller, such as 106, associated with the
   product dispenser, such as 102A, can be in communication with the RFID or other
   machine readable code reader, such as 140, and some or all identification information
   obtained from the RFID or other machine readable tag, such as 138, can be stored or
25 otherwise processed by the processor or controller, such as 106. In this embodiment, the
   identification information can be embodied in a machine readable code, a bar code,
   RFID, radio frequency, infrared, or other wireless communication methods or devices, or
   other types and kinds of coding and/or storage technologies as may be required and/or
   desired in a particular embodiment. The RFID reader or machine readable code reader,
30 such as 140, can be a corresponding device to read or receive the identification
   information from the RFID or other machine readable tag, such as 138, and can include a

                                                 13
   RFID read/write device, an infrared device, a magnetic card reader, a bar code reader, or
   other suitable reader or receiver technologies as may be required and/or desired in a
   particular embodiment.
   [00471       In yet another embodiment, a server or transaction processing resource, such
 5 as 126, can facilitate a payment or payment processing when a consumer selects and
   attempts to pay for a product, such as a beverage, at a product dispenser, such as 102A.
   An associated processor or controller, such as 106, can receive the consumer's payment
   or related information by way of, for instance, a display device, such as 112, data
   transmission, or other input, before, during, or after the selection of the particular product
10 or beverage. In any instance, the processor or controller, such as 106, can transmit the
   payment or related information to the server or transaction processing resource, such as
    126, via a network, such as 104. The server or transaction processing resource, such as
    126, may access least one database, such as 128A-128C, or may communicate with at
   least one other data processing resource to authorize or otherwise validate a payment or
15 related information prior to accepting a payment from the consumer or otherwise
   dispensing the selected product or beverage to the consumer.
   [0048]       Referring to Figure 2, an example consumer refreshment environment or
   system 200 is illustrated. In one embodiment, one or more networked product
   dispensers, such as 210, can be installed in a plurality of respective locations, such as
20 location 202, and can be in communication via a network 204, such as the Internet or a
   global network, with one or more servers or data processing resources, such as 206, and
   one or more data storage devices, such as database 208. By way of example, a product
   dispenser 210 can be similar to a beverage dispenser or dispenser apparatus, described as
    102A in Figure 1. In one example, a product dispenser, such as 210, can include some or
25 all of the following components as described with respect to Figure 1: an ingredient
   matrix, such as 108, with locations operable to receive one or more product ingredient
   packages, such as    I16A-1 16Q, a controller, such as 106, one or more package insertion
   detection devices or RFID reader/writer, such as I 18A-I 18Q pumps, such as        120,
   valves, such as 122, and a nozzle, such as 124. By way of further example, servers or
30 data processing resources 206 can be similar to server or data processing resource
   described as 126 in Figure 1.

                                                 14
   100491      In one embodiment, one or more consumers, such as 212, can access a
   network, such as 104, or a consumer refreshment network, such as 204. Through the
   network 204, a consumer, such as 212, can sign up, configure consumer preferences,
   access respective accounts, receive promotions, manage loyalty accounts, and/or sign up
 5 for other types and kinds of opportunities and services as may be required and or desired
   in a particular embodiment. In at least one embodiment, a consumer, such as 212, can
   choose to access a network 104, or a consumer refreshment network system, such as 200,
   and/or the product dispenser, such as 210, by way of any number of client-type devices,
   including, but not limited to, a personal computer (PC), such as 214A, a data processing
10 device, such as 21413, a wireless communication device, such as 214C, and/or by way of
   other types and kinds of data processing, processor-based, or client-type devices. An
   example of a wireless communication device can include, but is not limited to, a wireless
   data processing device, a wireless phone, a mobile phone, an tPHONETM, an IPODTM,
   personal data assistant, and/or POCKET PCTM.
15 100501       Referring to Figure 3, an example of an enhanced view graphical user
   interface 300 is illustrated. In one embodiment shown, a product dispenser, such as 210
   in Figure 2, can include at least one user interface such as an enhanced view graphical
   user interface, such as 300, or a consumer interface. The user interface, such as 300, and
   can be used, for instance, by a consumer, such as 212, to select any number of different
20 product or beverage types, kinds, and formulations. In use, a product dispenser, such as
   210, with an enhanced view graphical user interface, such as 300, can provide a
   consumer with selectable product or beverage options in a series of dynamically
   generated menus, wherein the consumer can locate and select a specific brand, kind,
   type, and/or formulation of a desired corresponding product or beverage. Once a
25 particular product or beverage option is selected, the consumer can cause a
   corresponding product or beverage to be formulated and dispensed by the product
   dispenser.
   100511       Referring to Figure 4, another example of a user interface is shown. In one
   embodiment, a product dispenser, such as 210 in Figure 2, can include a classic view
30 graphical user interface, such as 400. The user interface, such as 400, can be used by a
   consumer, such as 212, to select from a limited number of different product or beverage

                                                  15
   types, kinds, and/or formulations. In use, a consumer, such as 212, can more easily
   select a product or beverage from a. limited number of product or beverage choices.
   Once a particular product or beverage option is selected, the consumer can cause a
   corresponding product or beverage to be formulated and dispensed by the product
 5 dispenser. In some embodiments, a classic type graphical user interface can also be
   referred to as a traditional view as it generally resembles a traditional fountain dispensing
   valve design. As such, a classic type graphical user interface can be referred to as a
   traditional view graphical user interface.
    [0052]      In one embodiment, a consumer may desire fewer product or beverage
10 choices than displayed by a product dispenser that allows the selection of, for instance, a
   plurality of different kinds of products or beverages. In such instances, a classic view
   graphical user interface with relatively fewer, more traditional product or beverage
   choices, and including one or more traditional-type product or beverage choices, can be
   displayed to facilitate, sometimes quicker, consumer interaction with the product
15 dispenser.
    [0053]      In another embodiment, a consumer may elect to create consumer preferences
   that tailor the types and/or kinds of brands and/or product or beverage formulations
   displayed in a user interface, such as a classic view graphical user interface, essentially
   creating a consumer customized classic view graphical user interface. In this particular
20 embodiment, a consumer can create a consumer customized classic view graphical user
   interface. For example, when a consumer identifies himself or herself to a product
   dispenser, such as 210, one or more consumer preferences can be retrieved by the
   dispenser 210. Based at least in part on one or more consumer preferences, the product
   dispenser 210 can display a default user interface to the consumer, which may be an
25 enhanced view graphical user interface, a classic view graphical user interface, or a
   consumer customized classic view graphical user interface.
   100541       Figures 5 - 14 are example flowcharts for various methods in accordance
   with embodiments of the invention. Some or all of the illustrated methods can be
   implemented by a system. network, product dispenser, or any combination of associated
30 components as shown in Figures 1 - 4.

                                                 16
   [0055]      Referring to Figures 5 - 6, example methods 500, 600 of consumer
   dispenser interactions are illustrated. In the embodiment shown in Figure 5, a product
   dispenser can allow a consumer to select product formulation and portion size, and the
   dispenser can effectuate a promotional offer. The method 500 begins at block 502. In
 5 block 502, an input is received from the consumer to select a product formulation at a
   product dispenser. In the embodiment shown in Figure 5, a consumer can enter data via
   a user interface, such as 112 in Figure 1, such as selection of an indicator corresponding
   to a product formulation, such as DIET CHERRY COKEIM. In other embodiments,
   other products or product formulations can be selected by a consumer, or other data
10 associated with one or more product selections or formulations can be entered by a
   consumer. For example, a consumer can enter data corresponding to one or product
   ingredients, such as a sweetener, vitamins, or other components of a product formulation.
   In one embodiment, a product selection can be effectuated by way of a graphical user
   interface associated with a product dispenser.
15 [00561       Block 502 is followed by block 504, in which an input is received from the
   consumer to select a portion size. In the embodiment shown, a consumer can enter data
   via a user interface, such as 112 in Figure 1, such as selection of an indicator
   corresponding to a portion size, such as 10 fluid ounces. A portion size selection can
   include, but is not limited to, any number of fluid ounces, by product size description
20 such as child, small, medium, large, super size, and/or by other methods, as may be
   required and/or desired in a particular embodiment. In other embodiments, other portion
   sizes can be selected by a consumer, or other data associated with one or more portion
   sizes can be entered by a consumer.
   10057]       Block 504 is followed by block 506, in which an input is received from the
25 consumer for payment for the selected product. In the embodiment shown, a processor
   or controller, such as 106, in Figure 1, associated with the product dispenser, such as
   102A. can prompt the consumer to pay for the selected product. For example, the
   processor or controller, such as 106, can prompt the consumer to pay via any monetary
   or financial transaction device or method, such as receiving a credit or debit card or
30 account number. A payment for a selected product can be by way of cashless or
   currency based transaction. In one embodiment, an option can be provided to a

                                                    17
      consumer to pay for the product via a client-type device or a wireless communication
      device, such as 214A-214C in Figure 2. In this particular embodiment, the consumer can
      pay for the selected product by authorizing payment via the client-type device or a
      wireless communication device, such as 214A-214C, and the payment can be received
   5  via an associated network, such as 104. In any instance, the consumer is allowed to pay
      for the selected product.
      [00581      Block 506 is followed by block 508, in which the product is dispensed. In the
      embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated with
     the product dispenser, such as 102A, can allow the consumer to dispense a desired
 10   product.
      [0059]      The method 500 ends after block 508.
      10060]      In one embodiment, a consumer can select a product formulation and portion
     size, and a promotional offer can be effectuated. For example, a consumer can select a
     product formulation and a portion size, wherein the portion size is the volume (typically
 15  small, medium, or large) the consumer desires. The consumer can then be allowed to
     pay for the product.
     [0061]       In another embodiment, in addition to allowing the consumer to select
     product formulation and portion size, a promotional offer can be offered to the consumer
     based in part on their selections. In this regard, the consumer may be offered an option to
20   increase the size of the product they desire, or change the formulation selected to a new
     formulation.
     10062]       Figure 6 illustrates another method 600 for consumer - dispenser interaction.
     The method 600 begins at block 602. In block 602, an input is received from a consumer
     to select a product formulation at a product dispenser. In the embodiment shown in
25   Figure 6, a consumer can enter data via a user interface, such as 112 in Figure 1, such as
     selection of an indicator corresponding to a product formulation, such as DIET
     CHERRY COKETM. In other embodiments, other products or product formulations can
     be selected by a consumer, or other data associated with one or more product selections
     or formulations can be entered by a consumer. For example, a consumer can enter data
30   corresponding to one or product ingredients, such as a sweetener, vitamins, or other

                                                 18
   components of a product formulation. In one embodiment, a product selection can be
   effectuated by way of a graphical user interface associated with a product dispenser.
   [0063]      Block 602 is followed by block 604, in which an input is received from the
   consumer to select the portion size. In the embodiment shown, a consumer can enter
 5 data via a user interface, such as 112 in Figure 1, such as selection of an indicator
   corresponding to a portion size, such as 10 fluid ounces. A portion size selection can
   include, but is not limited to, any number of fluid ounces, by product size description
   such as child, small, medium, large, super size, and/or by other methods, as may be
   required and/or desired in a particular embodiment. In other embodiments, other portion
10 sizes can be selected by a consumer, or other data associated with one or more portion
   sizes can be entered by a consumer.
   [0064]      Block 604 is followed by block 606, in which the consumer is prompted with
   a promotional offer based at least in part on the product selected and/or the portion size
   selected. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1,
15 associated with the product dispenser, such as 102A, can generate or otherwise transmit a
   communication to the consumer that prompts the consumer with a promotional offer
   based in part on the product selected and/or the portion size selected. For example, a
   processor or controller, such as 106, can provide the message and associated prompt to
   the consumer via an output device, such as a user interface, for instance, such as 112. In
20 another embodiment, a local and/or remote server or data processing resource, such as
    126, can generate a communication or other output, such as a message, and transmit the
   message to the product dispenser, such as 102A, for communication to the consumer.
   The processor or controller, such as 106, associated with the product dispenser, such as
    102A, can receive the message for communication to the consumer. In any instance, the

    product packaging, in a print ad, or associated with other objects which may be carried
    by or otherwise obtained by a consumer. In this regard, a suitable machine readable item
    or icon can be a barcode or other machine readable code. In addition, a suitable machine
30  readable item or icon can be a RFID tag or other device capable of wirelessly data

                                                   22
    communicating with the product dispenser. in operation, the consumer can scan a
    machine readable item or icon at a product dispenser. The product dispenser can then
    automatically configure itself to dispense a particular product associated with or
    otherwise referred to by the machine readable item or icon.
  5 10080]       In one embodiment, a consumer can scan a print ad, containing a machine
    readable item or icon from a magazine, at a product dispenser. The machine readable
    item or icon can instruct the product dispenser to dispense a certain product formulation
    to the consumer. Such machine readable items or icons can be used in promotions, such
    as trying an ad campaign touting a new product formulation which can be obtained for
 10 free or at a discounted price. In addition, a machine readable item or icon can be used to
    accelerate or otherwise facilitate a consumer selection at a product dispenser. In this
    regard, a consumer need only scan the machine readable item or icon to facilitate the
    preparation and dispensing of a particular product at the product dispenser.
    10081]       Referring to Figure 8, one example method 800 of consumer - dispenser
15  interaction is illustrated. The method 800 begins in block 802. In block 802, an input is
    received from a consumer for at least one product. In this embodiment, a consumer can
    place an order for at least one product at an order station. An order station can be located
    at a register at a quick serve restaurant, a convenience store check out aisle, and/or at
    other types and/or kinds of order stations as may be required and or desired in a
20  particular embodiment. For example, an order station can be configured with at least one
    client-type device or wireless communication device, such as 214A-214C in Figure 2, to
    receive an order for at least one product. A consumer or personnel associated with an
    order station can input data corresponding to the order for the at least one product via the
    client-type device or wireless communication device, such as 214A-214C.
25  [00821       Block 802 is followed by block 804, in which a machine readable icon or
    item is provided to the consumer. During or after the order is submitted, at least one
    machine readable icon or item can be provided or otherwise obtained by the consumer.
    A machine readable icon or item can include, but is not limited to, a receipt with a
    barcode or other machine readable code, a RFID tagged item, an item associated with a
30  RFID tag, an item with a wireless communication device, and/or other types of items
    with associated wireless communications devices. A machine readable icon or item can

                                                  23
     include any number of wireless technologies including, but not limited to, RFID, radio
     frequency, infrared, or other wireless communication methods as may be required and/or
     desired in a particular embodiment.
     [0083]      Block 804 is followed by block 806, in which the consumer scans the
  5  machine readable icon or item at a product dispenser. In this embodiment, a consumer
    can scan a machine readable icon or item in proximity to a product dispenser, such as
     102A, which can be configured to detect the presence of or otherwise receive
     information associated with the presence of the machine readable icon or item. For
    example, a product dispenser can be configured to include a RFID read/write device,
 10 such as the identification reader / scanner device 106A, capable of detect the presence of
    or otherwise receive information associated with the presence of a machine readable icon
    or item associated with a RFID tag. In any instance, the machine readable icon or item
    can include data which can be received by the product dispenser when the machine
    readable icon or item is scanned or read at the product dispenser.
 15 100841       Block 806 is followed by block 808, in which the product dispenser obtains
    the consumer's order. In this embodiment, a processor or controller, such as 106 in
    Figure 1, associated with a product dispenser, such as 102A, can communicate with a
    local and/or remote processor, controller, server, or data processing resource, such as
     126, memory., or data storage device, such as I10, to obtain information regarding the
20  consumer order based at least in part on the data obtained from scanning the machine
    readable icon or item. Data obtaining from scanning the machine readable icon or item
    can include, but is not limited to, product type information, product identification
    information, and other information associated with the product and/or item. For
    example, when a product dispenser, such as 102A, receives data obtained from scanning
25  the machine readable icon or item, an associated processor or controller, such as 106, can
    access an associated memory or data storage device, such as 106, to obtain information
    associated with the consumer's order. In another example, a local and/or remote
    processor, controller, server, or data processing resource, such as 126, can access an
    associated memory or data storage device, such as 110, to obtain information associated
30  with the consumer's order.

                                                 24
   [0085]       Block 808 is followed by decision block 810, in which a determination is
   made as to whether the consumer is entitled to a product. If the determination is in the
   affirmative, that is, the consumer is entitled to a product, then the method 800 continues
   at block 812. If the determination is in the negative that is the consumer is not entitled to
 5 a product, then the method 800 ends. In the embodiment shown, a processor or
   controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, can determine whether the consumer is entitled to a
   product. For example, the controller, such as 106, can determine whether the consumer
   is entitled to a product by obtaining information associated with the consumer order, and
   determining whether predefined criteria are met, such as whether the consumer order is
10 valid or fully paid for. In one embodiment, a processor or controller, such as 106, can
   communicate with a local and/or remote server or data processing resource, such as 126,
   which can determine whether the consumer is entitled to a product. In any instance, a
   determination is made as to whether the consumer is entitled to a product.
   [0086]       In block 812, the product dispenser is configured to allow the consumer to
15 select and dispense a product. In this embodiment, a processor or controller associated
   with a product dispenser, such as controller 106 in Figure 1, can configure one or more
   dispenser parameters to permit the consumer to select and dispense a product.
   Dispenser parameters can include, but are not limited to, product type, kind, product
   formulation, portion size, and price. For example, a consumer can be allowed to select
20 the product formulation, and optionally the portion size via a user interface associated
   with the product dispenser, such as user interface, such as 112. In some instances, the
   product dispenser can permit the consumer to set a price, or the price may be dependent
   on any of the consumer selected dispenser parameters such as product type, kind, product
   formulation, or portion size.
25 [00871       Block 812 is followed by block 814, in which the product is dispensed. In the
   embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated with
   the product dispenser, such as 102A, can allow the consumer to dispense the product.
   [00881       In block 816, the product dispenser updates consumer's order indicating
   dispensed product status. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as
30 106 in Figure 1, associated with the product dispenser, such as 102A, can update a
   consumer's order indicating dispensed product status. For example, a consumer order

                                                 25
   can be updated such that the status of the order can reflect changes or new data
   associated with a dispensed product including, but not limited to, type or kind of product,
   portion size, and price. In one embodiment, a local and/or remote server or data
   processing resource, such as 126, can update a consumer's order indicating dispensed
 5 product status. In one embodiment, a product dispenser can update the consumer's order
   indicating that a product has been dispensed. Additionally, any status, configuration,
   product formulation, portion size, price, and/or other types and/or kinds of information
   and other data can be communicated and updated, as may be required and/or desired in a
   particular embodiment. In any instance, the product dispenser data can communicate to
10 update a consumer's order indicating dispensed product status.
    100891       The method 800 ends after block 816.
    [00901]      In one embodiment, a consumer can place an order that includes a product at
   a counter or other place. The consumer can be presented with a receipt or other item that
   indicates in a printed or electronic manner that the consumer is entitled to a product. The
15 consumer can then scan the receipt or other item at a product dispenser. Information
   regarding the consumer's order can then be obtained and if the consumer is entitled to a
   product, the consumer can then select and dispense a product.
    [0091]       Figure 9 illustrates an example method 900 for limiting a number of product
   refills is illustrated. The method 900 begins at block 902. In block 902, a machine
20 readable icon or item is read and/or scanned at a product dispenser. In this embodiment,
   a consumer can scan a machine readable icon or item in proximity to a product
   dispenser, such as 102A, which can be configured to detect the presence of or otherwise
   receive information associated with the presence of the machine readable icon or item.
   For example, a product dispenser, such as 102A, can be configured to include a RFID
25 read/write device, such an identification reader / scanner device 106A, capable of detect
   the presence of or otherwise receive information associated with the presence of a
   machine readable icon or item associated with a RFID tag. In any instance, the machine
   readable icon or item can include data which can be received by the product dispenser
   when the machine readable icon or item is scanned.

                                                   26
    100921      In one embodiment, a machine readable icon or item can be obtained from an
    order station. An order station can be located at a register at a quick serve restaurant, a
    convenience store check out aisle, and/or at other types and/or kinds of order stations as
    may be required and or desired in a particular embodiment. For example, an order
  5 station can be configured with at least one client-type device or wireless communication
    device, such as 214A-214C in Figure 2, to receive an order for at least one product. A
    consumer or personnel associated with an order station can input data corresponding to
    the order for the at least one product via the client-type device or wireless
    communication device, such as 214A-214C. A machine readable icon or item can

    embodiment.
    [0093]      Block 902 is followed by block 904, in which the product dispenser obtains a
    consumer order. In this embodiment, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1,
    associated with a product dispenser, such as 102A, can communicate with a local and/or
20  remote processor, controller, server, or data processing resource, such as 126, memory,
    or data storage device, such as 110, to obtain information regarding the consumer order
    based at least in part on the data obtained from scanning the machine readable icon or
    item. Data obtaining from scanning the machine readable icon or item can include, but is
    not limited to, product type information, product identification information, and other
25  information associated with the product and/or item. For example, when a product
    dispenser, such as 102A, receives data obtained from scanning the machine readable icon
    or item, an associated processor or controller, such as 106, can access an associated
    memory or data storage device, such as 1 10, to obtain information associated with the
    consumer's order. In another example, a local and/or remote processor, controller,
30  server, or data processing resource, such as 126, can access an associated memory or
    data storage device, such as 110, to obtain information associated with the consumer's
    order.

                                                 27
   [0094]       Block 904 is followed by decision block 906, in which a determination is
   made as to whether the consumer is entitled to a refill. If the determination is in the
   affirmative, that is, the consumer is entitled to a refill, then the method 900 continues at
   block 908. If the determination is in the negative, that is, the consumer is not entitled to
 5 a refill, then the method 900 continues at block 912. In the embodiment shown, a
   processor or controller, such as 106, can determine whether the consumer is entitled to a
   product refill. For example. the controller, such as 106, can determine whether the
   consumer is entitled to a product refill by obtaining information associated with the
   consumer order, and determining whether predefined criteria are met, such as whether
10 the consumer order includes a product refill or whether the order has been paid in full.
   In one embodiment, a processor or controller, such as 106, can communicate with a local
   and/or remote server or data processing resource, such as 126, which can determine
   whether the consumer is entitled to a product refill. In any instance, a determination is
   made as to whether the consumer is entitled to a product refill.
15 [0095]        In one embodiment, an order station, such as a quick serve restaurant, may
   have a policy that there are no product refills, As such, when the consumer's order is
   checked after the product has been initially filled, the determination can be that the
   consumer is not entitled to a refill.
   [0096]        In another embodiment, an order station, such as a quick serve restaurant,
20 may offer product refills at half price or other discounted price. As such, when the
   consumer's order is checked after the product has been initially filled, the determination
   can be to allow the consumer to pay for a product refill.
   [0097]        In another embodiment, an order station, such as a quick serve restaurant,
   may allow a predefined number of product refills, such as one. As such, when the
25 consumer's order is checked after the product has been initially filled, the determination
   can be to allow the consumer to dispense a predefined number of product refills, such as
   one. After the predefined number of product refills has been reached, the determination
   can be that the consumer is not entitled to additional product refills.

                                                    28
     [0098]       In block 908, a product refill is dispensed. In the embodiment shown, a
     processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated with the product dispenser,
     such as 102A, can allow the consumer to dispense a product, such a product refill.
     [00991       Block 908 is followed by block 910, in which the product dispenser updates

     processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated with the product dispenser,
     such as 102A, can update a consumer's order indicating dispensed product refill status.
     For example, a consumer order can be updated such that the status of the order can
     reflect changes or new data associated with a dispensed product refill including, but not
 10  limited to, type or kind of product, portion size, and price. In one embodiment a local
     and/or remote server or data processing resource, such as 126 in Figure 1, can update a
     consumer's order indicating dispensed product refill status. In one embodiment, a
     product dispenser can update the consumer's order indicating that a product refill has
     been dispensed. Additionally, any status, configuration, product formulation, portion
 15  size, price, and/or other types and/or kinds of information and other data can be data
    communicated and updated, as may be required and/or desired in a particular
    embodiment. In any instance, the product dispenser data can communicate to update a
    consumer's order indicating dispensed product refill status.

20   [00101]      Referring to block 912, a consumer is informed that her or she is not entitled
    to a refill. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1,
    associated with the product dispenser, such as 102A. can inform the consumer that he or
    she is not entitled to a product refill. For example, after the consumer requests a product
    refill or the consumer attempts to refill a product, and the consumer is not entitled to a
25  refill, the controller, such as 106, can provide a communication, such as a message via a
    user interface associated with the product dispenser, such as user interface, such as 112,
    that the consumer is not entitled to a refill.
    [0102]        The method 900 ends after block 912.
    100103]       In an example embodiment, a consumer can place an order that includes at
30  least a product at a product station, The consumer can be given a machine readable icon

                                                  29
    or item. Such a machine readable icon or item can be a receipt with a barcode, a RFID
    tagged item, a wireless device, and/or other types and/or kinds of machine readable icons
    or items as may be required and/or desired in a particular embodiment. The consumer
    can then scan the icon or item at a product dispense to obtain the ordered product. The
  5 fulfillment of the order can be tracked and as such, when the consumer desires to refill
    the product a determination can be made at to whether or not the consumer is entitled to
    a refill.
     [001041     In one embodiment, updating a consumer's order can be utilized to prevent or
    otherwise limit the ability of the consumer from dispensing excessive product refills. In
 10 this regard, once a consumer scans a machine readable icon, item or code, dispenses a
    product, and the consumer's order updated, the consumer can be prevented or otherwise
    limited from further dispensing a product refill. For example, should the consumer
    desire a product refill, a product dispenser can prompt the consumer to pay for a refill at,
    perhaps, a reduced price versus the price for an initial or first time purchase of the
 15 product at an order station.
    [00105]     Referring to Figure 10, an example method 1000 of coupling a promotional
    offer for a phone card and/or a wireless phone with a product transaction is illustrated.
    The method 1000 begins in block 1002. In block 1002, an input is received from a
    consumer to select a product. In the embodiment shown in Figure 10, a consumer can
20  enter data via a user interface, such as 112 in Figure 1, such as selection of an indicator
    corresponding to a product, such as DIET CHERRY COKETM. In other embodiments,
    other products can be selected by a consumer, or other data associated with one or more
    product selections can be entered by a consumer. In one embodiment, a product
    selection can be effectuated by way of a graphical user interface associated with a
25  product dispenser, such as user interface, such as 112.
    1001061     Block 1002 is followed by block 1004, in which the product dispenser data
    communicates locally and/or remotely to determine a promotional phone card and/or
    wireless phone promotional offer. In this embodiment, a processor or controller, such as
    106 in Figure 1, associated with a product dispenser, such as 102A, can communicate
30  with a local and/or remote processor, controller, server, or data processing resource, such
    as 126, memory, or data storage device, such as I10, to obtain information regarding a

                                                 30
   promotional phone card and/or wireless phone promotional offer. For example, when a
   product dispenser, such as 102A, receives data obtained from scanning the machine
   readable icon or item, an associated processor or controller, such as 106, can access an
   associated memory or data storage device, such as 110, to obtain information associated
 5 with a promotional phone card and/or wireless phone promotional offer. In another
   example, a local and/or remote processor, controller, server, or data processing resource,
   such as 126, can access an associated memory or data storage device, such as 110, to
   obtain information associated with a promotional phone card and/or wireless phone
   promotional offer.
10 [00107       Block 1004 is followed by block 1006, in which the consumer is provided
   with a promotional offer. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as
   106 in Figure 1 associated with the product dispenser, such as 102A, can generate or
   otherwise transmit a communication to the consumer that prompts the consumer with a
   promotional offer. For example, the a processor or controller, such as 106, can provide
15 the message and associated prompt to the consumer via an output device, such as a user
   interface, for instance, such as 12. In another embodiment, a local and/or remote server
   or data processing resource, such as 126 in Figure 1, can generate a communication or
   other output, such as a message, and transmit the message to the product dispenser, such
   as 102A, for communication to the consumer. The processor or controller, such as 106,
20 associated with the product dispenser, such as 102A, can receive the message for
   communication to the consumer. In any instance, the consumer is prompted with a
   promotional offer, for instance, a promotional offer for a phone card and/or wireless
   phone.
   [001081     Block 1006 is followed by decision block 1008, in which a determination is
25 made as to whether the consumer accepts the promotional offer. If the determination is
   in the affirmative, that is, the consumer accepts the promotional offer, then the method
   1000 continues at block 1012. If the determination is in the negative, that is, the
   consumer does not accept the promotional offer, then the method 1000 continues at
   block 1010. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller. such as 106 in Figure
30 1, associated with the product dispenser, such as 102A, can determine whether the
   consumer accepts the promotional offer. For example, the processor or controller, such

                                                  31
   as 106, can receive a consumer input or selection via a user interface, such as 112, and
   determine whether the input or selection corresponds to whether the consumer accepts
   the promotional offer.
   100109]      In block 1010, a suitable input from the consumer is optionally received to
 5 pay for the product, and if necessary, for the promotional offer. In the embodiment
   shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated with the product
   dispenser, such as 102A, can prompt the consumer to pay for the product, and if
   necessary, for the promotional offer. For example, the processor or controller, such as
   106, can prompt the consumer to pay via any monetary or financial transaction device or
10 method, such as receiving a credit or debit card or account number. A payment for a
   product and/or promotional offer can be by way of cashless or currency based
   transaction. In one embodiment, an option can be provided to a consumer to purchase
   the product arid/or promotional offer via a client-type device or a wireless
   communication device, such as 214A-214C in Figure 2. In this particular embodiment,
15 the consumer can pay for the product and/or promotional offer by authorizing payment
   via the client-type device or a wireless communication device, such as 214A-214C. and
   the payment can be received via an associated network, such as 104. In any instance, the
   consumer is allowed to purchase the product and/or promotional offer.
   100110]      The method 1000 ends after block 1010.
20 [00111J      Referring to block 1012, suitable input is received from the consumer to
   fulfill the promotional offer. In the embodiment shown, a consumer can enter data via a
   user interface associated with a product dispenser, such as user interface 112 in Figure 1,
   including the input of any data necessary to fulfill a promotional offer. For example,
   data can be input corresponding to a phone card or wireless phone. In one embodiment,
25 a consumer can provide an e-mail address, a wireless phone number, and/or other types
   and kinds of information, as may be required and/or desired in a particular embodiment
   in order to fulfill any requirements of a promotional offer.
   [001121      Block 1012 is followed by block 1014, in which payment is received from the
   consumer to pay for and/or otherwise add the promotional offer to the transaction
30 amount. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1,

                                                 32
   associated with the product dispenser, such as 102A, can prompt the consumer to pay for
   and/or otherwise add the promotional offer to the transaction amount. For example, the
   processor or controller, such as 106, can prompt the consumer to pay via any monetary
   or financial transaction device or method, such as receiving a credit or debit card or
 5 account number, A payment for a selected product and/or promotional offer can be by
   way of cashless or currency based transaction. In one embodiment, an option can be
   provided to a consumer to pay for the product and/or promotional offer via a client-type
   device or a wireless communication device, such as 214A-214C in Figure 2. In this
   particular embodiment, the consumer can pay for the selected product and/or
10 promotional offer by authorizing payment via the client-type device or a wireless
   communication device, such as 214A-214C, and the payment can be received via an
   associated network, such as 104. In another embodiment, a particular promotional offer
   may require detailed consumer information, fees, and/or other information, and the
   consumer can be allowed to pay for some or all of the these fees, or otherwise add the
15 amount to the current transaction and pay after fulfillment of the order. In any instance,
   the consumer is allowed to pay for the selected product and/or add the promotional offer
   to the transaction amount.
   [00113]      Block 1014 is followed by block 1016, in which fulfillment of the
   promotional offer is facilitated as necessary. Depending on the type of promotional
20 offer, some or all of any remaining requirements to fulfill the promotional offer can be
   facilitated. For example, if a promotional phone card or wireless phone is to be
   dispensed to the consumer, the processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1,
   associated with the product dispenser, such as 102A, can facilitate transmission of
   corresponding instructions to a local and/or remote server or data processing resource,
25 such as 126 in Figure 1, to facilitate dispensing, routing, or other means necessary to
   fulfill the promotional offer.
   [00114]      Block 1016 is followed by block 1010, in which is described in detail above.
   1001151      In one embodiment, a consumer using a product dispenser can be prompted
   with a promotional offer for a phone card and/or wireless phone offer. For example, the
30 consumer may accept a promotion for free or discounted minutes on a wireless phone
   plan.

                                                  33
   100116]     Referring to Figure 11, an example method 1100 of combining a promotional
   offer associated with a product with a product from a product dispenser is illustrated.
   The method 1100 begins at block 1102. In block 1102, a machine readable code or item
   associated with a product is scanned or read. In this embodiment, a consumer can scan a
 5 product in the proximity to a product dispenser, such as 102A in Figure 1, which can be
   configured to detect the presence of or otherwise receive information associated with the
   presence of the product. A product can include any number of wireless technologies
   including, but not limited to, RFID, radio frequency, infrared, or other wireless
   communication methods as may be required and/or desired in a particular embodiment.
10 A product can be, for example, a cup, a box, a tray, a container, or any product
   packaging as may be required and or desired in a particular embodiment.
   [00117]     Block 1102 is followed by block 1104, in which the product dispenser
   determines if the product scanned is part of a promotional offer. In one embodiment, a
   processor or controller, such as 106, can communicate via a network, such as 104, with a
15 local and/or remote server or data processing resource, such as 126, which can determine
   whether the scanned product is part of a promotional offer.
   1001181     Block 1104 is followed by decision block 1106, in which a determination is
   made as to whether the scanned product is part of a promotional offer. If the
   determination is in the affirmative, that is, the scanned product is part of a promotional
20 offer, then the method 1100 continues at block 1108. If the determination is in the
   negative, that is, the scanned product is not part of a promotional offer, then the method
    1100 ends. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106, can
   determine whether the scanned product is part of a promotional offer. For example, the
   controller, such as 106, can determine whether the scanned product is part of a
25 promotional offer by obtaining information associated with the scanned product, and
   determining whether predefined criteria are met, such as whether the promotional offer
   covers or otherwise involves the scanned product. In one embodiment, a processor or
   controller, such as 106, can communicate with a local and/or remote server or data
   processing resource, such as 126, which can determine whether the scanned product is
30 part of a promotional offer. In any instance, a determination is made as to whether the
   scanned product is part of a promotional offer.

                                                34
   [001191     In block 1108, the consumer is informed that the product is part of a
   promotional offer, In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in
   Figure 1, associated with the product dispenser, such as 102A, can inform the consumer
   that the product is part of a promotional offer. For example, after the consumer scans a
 5 product in proximity to a product dispenser, such as 102A., the controller, such as 106,
   can provide a communication, such as a message, via a user interface associated with the
   product dispenser, such as user interface, such as 112, that the product is part of a
   promotional offer.
   [00120]      Block 1108 is followed by block I I10, in which the consumer is provided
10 with promotional offer information. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller,
   such as 106 in Figure 1, associated with the product dispenser. such as 102A, can
   provide promotional offer information or details to the consumer. For example, after the
   consumer is informed that the product is part of a promotional offer, the controller, such
   as 106, can provide additional information, such as a message, via a user interface
15 associated with the product dispenser, such as user interface, such as 112.
   [00121]     Block I I10 is followed by decision block 1112, in which a determination is
   made as to whether the consumer accepts the promotional offer. If the determination is
   in the affirmative, that is, the consumer accepts the promotional offer, then the method
   continues to decision block 1114. If the determination is in the negative, that is, the
20 consumer does not accept the promotional offer, then the method 1100 ends. In the
   embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated with
   the product dispenser, such as 102A, can determine whether the consumer accepts the
   promotional offer. For example, the processor or controller, such as 106, can receive a
   consumer input or selection via a user interface, such as 112, and determine whether the
25 input or selection corresponds to whether the consumer accepts the promotional offer.
   [00122]     In decision block 1114, a determination is made as to whether the
   promotional offer is for a free product. If the determination is in the affirmative, that is,
   the promotional offer is for a free or discounted product, then the method    I 100 continues
   at block 1116. If the determination is in the negative, that is, the promotional offer is not
30 for a free or discounted product, then the method 1100 continues at block 1118. in the
   embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106, can determine whether the

                                                   35
   promotional offer is for a free or discounted product. For example, the controller, such
   as 106 in Figure 1, can determine whether the promotional offer includes an offer for a
   free or discounted product by obtaining information associated with the promotional
   offer. The controller, such as 106, can determine whether predefined criteria are met,
 5 such as whether the promotional offer covers or otherwise involves a free or discounted
   product. In one embodiment, a processor or controller, such as 106, can communicate
   with a local and/or remote server or data processing resource, such as 126, which can
   determine whether the promotional offer includes an offer for a free or discounted
   product. In any instance, a determination is made as to whether the promotional offer is
10 for a free or discounted product.
   [00123]      In block 1116, a free or discounted product is dispensed to the consumer. In
   the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated
   with the product dispenser, such as 102A. can allow the consumer to dispense a free or
   discounted product.
15 [001241      After block 1116, the method 1100 ends.
   [00125]      Referring to block 1118, the consumer is prompted for suitable information to
   facilitate fulfillment of the promotional offer. In the embodiment shown, a processor or
   controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, can prompt a consumer to input or otherwise provide
   suitable details to facilitate fulfillment of the promotional offer. A consumer can utilize
20 a user interface associated with a product dispenser, such as user interface, such as 112,
   to provide details, such as consumer preferences or information, to effectuate or
   otherwise facilitate the promotional offer fulfillment. The user can input one or more
   selections via the user interface, such as 112, and the processor or controller, such as
    106, can facilitate the promotional offer fulfillment based at least in part on consumer
25 preferences or information provided by the consumer. For example, a consumer can be
   allowed to pay for and/or otherwise add the promotional offer to the transaction amount.
   As such, the promotional offer may require or otherwise need detailed consumer
   information, fees, and/or other data to allow the consumer to pay, add the amount to the
   current transaction, or to pay after fulfillment of the order.
30  [00126]     The method I 100 ends after block 11 18.

                                                36
   [00127]      In one embodiment, a promotional offer between a product and a beverage
   can be effectuated. In this regard, the product can be scanned at a product dispenser.
   The offer details can be obtained and the product dispenser can be configure as
   necessary.
 5 1001281      In one embodiment, a promotional offer for a buy a candy bar and obtain a
   product for free or discounted price can be effectuated. A consumer can first purchase
   the candy bar. The candy bar wrapper can be scanned at a product dispenser. The
   product dispenser can obtain information related to the particular offer and determine
   that a free or discounted product should be dispensed. The consumer can be allowed to
10 dispense a product, such as a beverage.
   100129]      In another embodiment, one or more promotions can be effectuated to offer a
   free or discounted product, specific types and/or kinds of products, and/or for other
   offers, as may be required and/or desired in a particular embodiment.
   100130]      Referring to Figure 12, an example method 1200 of dispensing free or
15 discounted products to a consumer while the consumer is paying for Internet or network
   access is illustrated. The method 1200 begins in block 1202. In block 1202, an input is
   received from a consumer to open a transaction and pay for network or Internet access by
   way of a product dispenser. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as
   106 in Figure 1, associated with the product dispenser, such as 102A, can permit a
20 consumer to initiate a transaction and pay for network or Internet access or service. For
   example, the processor or controller, such as 106, can prompt the consumer to pay via
   any monetary or financial transaction device or method, such as receiving a credit or
   debit card or account number. A payment for network or Internet access or service can
   be by way of cashless or currency based transaction. In one embodiment, an option can
25 be provided to a consumer to pay for network or Internet access or service via a client

   access by way of a product dispenser.

                                                  37
   1001311     Block 1202 is followed by decision block 1204, in which a determination is
   made as to whether the consumer wants to dispense a product. If the determination is in
   the affirmative, that is, the consumer wants to dispense a product, then the method 1200
   continues to block 1206. If the determination is in the negative, that is, the consumer
 5 does not want to dispense a product, then the method continues at decision block 1208.
   In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated
   with the product dispenser, such as 102A, can allow the consumer to select a product to
   be dispensed. For example, after the consumer has initiated a transaction and paid for
   network or Internet access or service, the consumer may decide or otherwise opt to select
10 a product. The consumer may select the product via a user interface associated with the
   product dispenser, such as user interface 112.
    [00132J    In block 1206, a product is dispensed to the consumer. In the embodiment
   shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated with the product
   dispenser, such as 102A, can allow the consumer to dispense the selected product. For
15 example, as long as the consumer is paying for network or Internet access or service, the
   consumer is allowed to dispense a product from the product dispenser, such as 102A.
    [00133]    Block 1206 is followed by decision block 1208, in which a determination is
   made as to whether the consumer is still using the Internet. If the determination is in the
   affirmative, that is, the consumer is still using or accessing the network or Internet, then
20 the method 1200 continues at block 1210. If the determination is in the negative, that is,
   the consumer is not using or accessing the network or Internet, then the method 1200
   continues at block 1212. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as
    106 in Figure 1, can determine whether the consumer is still using or accessing the
   network or Internet. For example, the controller, such as 106, can determine whether
25 consumer is still using or accessing the network or Internet by obtaining information
   associated with the consumer's use of the network or Internet. The controller, such as
    106, can determine whether predefined criteria are met, such as whether the consumer is
    logged in to the network or Internet. In one embodiment, a processor or controller, such
   as 106, can communicate with a local and/or remote server or data processing resource,
30 such as 126, which can determine whether he consumer is still using or accessing the

   network or Internet. In any instance, a determination is made as to whether the consumer
   is still using the Internet or a network.
   [00134]       In block 1210, billing of the consumer for the network or Internet access is
   continued. In the embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106, can
 5 continue billing the consumer if the consumer is still using or accessing the network or
   Internet.
   [00135]      Block 1210 is followed by decision block 1204, which is described above.
   [00136]      Referring to block 1212, the transaction ends. In the embodiment shown, a
   processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated with the product dispenser,
10 such as 102A, can end the transaction if the consumer is not using or accessing the
   network or Internet. For example, billing of the consumer for network or Internet access
   can be terminated, and the consumer can no longer dispense a free or discounted product
   from the product dispenser, such as 102A.
   [00137]      The method 1200 ends after block 1212.
15 [00138]       In one embodiment, in an Internet caf6 location, a consumer can subscribe to
   Internet access. For a fee, the consumer can be allowed to use the Internet or other
   network at the location to check e-mail, surf the web, and/or for other purposes. During
   this time period, the consumer can be paying for Internet or other network access, the
   consumer can be allowed to dispense free or discounted products from the product
20 dispenser.
   [00139]      Referring to Figure 13, an example method 1300 of a using a product
   dispenser to pay for a product, such as a beverage. In the embodiment shown in Figure
    13, a commercial partner may elect to set up an account with a product or beverage
   provider, such that the commercial partner's employees, students, group members, or
25 other members associated with the commercial partner can use a product dispenser and
   costs of any dispensed products or beverages can charged to the account associated with
   the commercial partner. For example, a commercial partner, such as United Parcel
   Service (UPS)TMTM, may elect to set up or establish a commercial partner account with a
   product provider, such that UPS employees can use particular product dispensers

                                                 39
   associated with the product provider, and the cost of any dispensed products can be
   charged to the commercial partner account associated with UPS. In this instance, UPS
   employees can obtain dispensed products from particular product dispensers associated
   with the product provider without having to pay for the products at the time of
 5 dispensing at the location of the product dispenser or otherwise on site associated with
   the product dispenser.
   100140]     In another example, a particular product dispenser could be located in one or
   more McDonald'sTM restaurants. UPS employees could utilize an identification
   technology, such as RFID, identification tokens and/or other similar devices to activate
10 the product dispenser. In this instance, UPS employees could enter any McDonald'sTM
   restaurants, identify him or herself to the product dispenser, and dispense a product
   without having to pay for the product at the time of the dispensing or otherwise on site at
   the location of dispensing. Payment for the dispensed product could then be charged to
   an account associated with UPS, such as a commercial partner account.
15 [00141]     The method 1300 begins in block 1302. In block 1302, an identification
   device associated with a consumer or consumer's product cup is scanned or otherwise
   detected at or adjacent to a product dispenser. In this embodiment, identification
   information can be associated with a consumer, and the consumer can provide such
   information to a product dispenser. For example, a consumer can swipe a magnetic card
20 or other device with identification information in a reader or other input/output device
   associated with a product dispenser, such as 102A in Figure 1. In another embodiment, a
   cup or other container, such as 136, can include identification information, such as a
   RFID or other machine readable tag, such as 138, and a reader, such as a RFID or other
   machine readable code reader, such as 140, associated with a product dispenser, such as
25  102A, can receive the identification information.
   [001421     Block 1302 is followed by decision block 1304, in which a determination is
   made as to whether a commercial partner account has been identified. If the
   determination is in the affirmative, that is, a commercial partner account has been
   identified then the method 1300 moves to block 1308. If the determination is in the
30 negative, that is, a commercial partner account has not been identified then the method
   1300 moves to decision block 1306. In the embodiment shown in Figure 13, an

                                                 40
   identification scanner / reader device, such as 106A in Figure 1, can be associated with a
   product dispenser, wherein the identification reader device is operable to receive or
   otherwise obtain identification information associated with a consumer or consumer's
   product cup. The identification scanner / reader device, 106A, can be in communication
 5 via a network, such as 104 or 204, with a server or data processing resource, such as 126
   or 206, which can make a determination, based at least in part on the identification
   information, whether the consumer and/or consumer's product cup is associated with a
   commercial partner account. The server or data processing resource, such as 126 or 206,
   may communicate with one or more data storage devices, such as 128A-128C, to identify
10 at least one commercial partner account.
   1001431      In one embodiment, a consumer with a product cup having a RFID, or other
   identification device associated with the product cup, can manipulate the product cup in
   proximity to an identification reader device, such as 11 8A-1 18Q, associated with a
   product dispenser. Alternatively, a consumer can scan other identification devices, such
15 as a RFID tag, token, card, PIN, and/or other ID form, as may be required and/or desired
   in a particular embodiment. Through the product dispenser, the identification reader
   device can data communicate locally or remotely with at least one server or data
   processing resource, such as 126 or 206, to determine if there is a commercial partner
   account associated with the consumer. Based at least in part on the determination,
20 processing can move to either decision block 1306 or decision block 1308.
    [001441     In decision block 1306, a notification is transmitted that a commercial partner
   account was not identified or otherwise determined. In the embodiment shown in Figure
   7, if a server or data processing resource, such as 126 or 206, determines that a
   commercial partner account associated with the consumer has not been established, or
25 does not exist, then a corresponding instruction will be transmitted to the product
   dispenser preventing or otherwise limiting the consumer from dispensing a product
   unless a payment for the product is received, For example, in one embodiment, a
   notification can be transmitted to a client-type device associated with the product
   dispenser, the notification can inform the consumer and/or service personnel that a
30 commercial partner account has not been established, or does not exist, and a payment is
   to be received from the consumer. After block 1306, the method 1300 ends.

                                                  41
   [00145]     In decision block 1308, a determination is made as to whether the account
   status is 'OK'. If the determination is in the affirmative, that is, the status of the account
   is 'OK', then the method 1300 continues to block 1310. If determination is in the
   negative, that is, the status of the account is not 'OK', then the method 1300 returns to
 5 block 1306. In the embodiment shown in Figure 13, if a server or data processing
   resource, such as 126 or 206, determines that a commercial partner account associated
   with the consumer has not been suitably funded, or the account is not otherwise suitable
   for product reimbursement, then a corresponding instruction will be transmitted to the
   product dispenser preventing or otherwise limiting the consumer from dispensing a
10 product unless a payment for the product is received.
   [00146]     Referring to block 1310, if a determination is made that the status of the
   account is 'OK', then a corresponding instruction will be transmitted to the product
   dispenser to permit the consumer to dispense a product.
   [00147]     Block 1310 is followed by block 1312, in which a balance associated with the
15 account is adjusted or otherwise charged for the dispensed product. In the embodiment
   shown in Figure 13, a server or data processing resource, such as 126 or 206, can
   monitor and adjust an account, such as a commercial partner account, for each product
   dispensed. In this manner, the account can be debited for each product dispensed.
   [001481     The method 1300 ends after block 1312,
20 [001491     Referring to Figure 14, an example method of using portion control for child
   size and sample size cup is illustrated. The method 1400 begins in block 1402. In block
   1402, a consumer is allowed to place a cup in proximity to the product dispenser nozzle
   area. In this embodiment, a consumer can manipulate or otherwise place a cup in
   proximity to a nozzle associated with a product dispenser, such as nozzle 124 in FIG. 1.
25 1001501     Block 1402 is followed by block 1404, in which the cup is scanned. In this
   embodiment, a product dispenser, such as 102A in Figure 1, can be configured to detect
   the presence of or otherwise receive information associated with the presence of the
   product or beverage cup. A product or beverage cup can include any number of wireless
   technologies including, but not limited to, a machine readable code, a bar code, RFID.

                                                 42
   radio frequency, infrared, or other wireless communication methods or devices as may
   be required and/or desired in a particular embodiment.
   100151]     Block 1404 is followed by decision block 1406, in which a determination is
   made as to whether a child size cup has been scanned. If the determination is in the
 5 affirmative, that is, a child size cup has been scanned, then the method 1400 continues at
   block 1408. If the determination is in the negative, that is, the cup scanned is not a child
   size cup, then the method 1400 continues at decision block 1410. In the embodiment
   shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, can determine whether a child
   size cup has been scanned. For example, the controller, such as 106, can determine
10 whether a child size cup has been scanned by obtaining information associated with the
   product cup, and determining whether predefined criteria are met, such as whether the
   product cup is a predefined size cup, such as a child size.
   [00152]     In block 1408, the product dispenser is set for child size portion control. In
   this embodiment, a processor or controller associated with a product dispenser, such as
15 controller 106 in Figure 1, can configure the dispenser for child size portion control. In
   one embodiment, the controller, such as 106, can limit the volume of the dispensed
   product to the amount suitable to fill a child size cup.
   [00153]     Block 1408 is followed by block 1414, which is described in greater detail
   below.
20 [00154]     Referring to decision block 1410, a determination is made as to whether a
   sample size cup has been scanned. If the determination is in the affirmative, that is, a
   sample size cup has been scanned, then the method 1400 continues at block 1412, If the
   determination is in the negative, that is, the cup scanned is not a sample size cup, then
   the method 1400 continues at block 1414. In the embodiment shown, a processor or
25 controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, can determine whether a sample size cup has been
   scanned. For example, the controller, such as 106, can determine whether a sample size
   cup has been scanned by obtaining information associated with the product or beverage
   cup, and determining whether predefined criteria are met, such as whether the product or
   beverage cup is a predefined size cup, such as a sample size.

                                                   43
    [00155]    In block 1412, the product dispenser is set for sample size portion control. In
   this embodiment, a processor or controller associated with a product dispenser, such as
   controller 106 in Figure 1, can configure the dispenser for sample size portion control.
   In one embodiment, the controller, such as 106, can limit the volume of dispensed
 5 product to the amount suitable to fill a sample size cup.
    100156]    Block 1412 is followed by block 1414, in which the consumer is allowed to
   select a product. In the embodiment shown, a consumer can enter data via a user
   interface, such as 112 in Figure 1, such as selection of an indicator corresponding to a
   product, such as DIET CHERRY COKETM. In other embodiments, other products can
10 be selected by a consumer, or other data associated with one or more product selections
   can be entered by a consumer. In one embodiment, a product selection can be
   effectuated by way of a graphical user interface associated with a product dispenser, such
   as user interface 112.
    100157]    Block 1414 is followed by block 1416, in which the consumer is allowed to
15 dispense a product with portion control set for child size and sample size cups. In the
   embodiment shown, a processor or controller, such as 106 in Figure 1, associated with
   the product dispenser, such as 102A, can allow the consumer to dispense a desired
   product with portion control set for a predefined size, such as a child size and/or sample
   size cups. In one embodiment, all other size cups, such as those for which portion
20 control limits are not set, may receive other product amounts.
   100158]     The method 1400 ends after block 1416.
   [00159]     In one embodiment, to avoid product spillage when child size and sample size
   cups are used, a product dispenser can utilize portion control. In this regard, when a
   child size or sample size cup is detected, the product dispenser can limit the portion
25 volume of product dispensed. As such, a smaller volume of product can be dispensed
   minimizing the chances that the child size or sample size cup (being smaller in size) may
   overflow creating wastage of the beverage product. In one example, child size cups can
   be relatively small cups typically utilized by children. Sample size cups can be relatively
   small cups that are typically used by consumers to sample a small portion of a product,
30 such as to see if they like it, prior to dispensing a relatively full cup of the product.
