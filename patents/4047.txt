         SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR RECOVERING AND CONTROLLING
               POST-RECOVERY MOTION OF UNMANNED AIRCRAFT
[0001]       This application is a divisional      of Australian Patent Application No.
2015275315, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]       The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for recovering
unmanned aircraft and controlling post-recovery motion of the aircraft.
BACKGROUND
[0003]       Unmanned aircraft or air vehicles (UAVs) provide enhanced and economical
access to areas where manned flight operations are unacceptably costly and/or dangerous.
For example, unmanned aircraft outfitted with remotely operated movable cameras can
perform a wide variety of surveillance missions, including spotting schools of fish for the
fisheries industry, monitoring weather conditions, providing border patrols for national
governments, and providing military surveillance before, during, and/or after military
operations.
[0004]     Many unmanned aircraft systems (which can include the aircraft itself along
with launch devices and recovery devices), however, can be difficult to install and operate
in cramped quarters, such as the deck of a small fishing boat, land vehicle, or other craft.
Accordingly, operating such aircraft systems often includes retrieving or capturing the
aircraft with a flexible recovery line when space is insufficient for a normal landing run.
While this technique has proven successful in many instances, there is a continual need to
improve the effectiveness of systems with which aircraft are recovered.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005]       According to the present invention there is provided An aircraft recovery
system, comprising:

                                             -2
         a base assembly;
         an elongated aircraft capture member having a first end portion pivotably coupled
to the base assembly and a second, free end portion opposite the first end portion,
         wherein the first end portion and second end portion of the aircraft capture member
are generally aligned with each other and both extend along a longitudinal axis of the
aircraft capture member,
         wherein the second end portion of the aircraft capture member is generally flexible
and positioned to intercept an unmanned aircraft in flight; and
an energy capture and dissipation assembly operably coupled to the aircraft capture
member and positioned to receive at least a portion of the landing forces from the aircraft.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0013]      The present disclosure      describes   systems and methods for recovering
unmanned aircraft and controlling post-recovery motion of the aircraft.         Many specific
details of certain embodiments of the disclosure are set forth in the following description
and in Figures 1-5C to provide a thorough understanding of these embodiments.            Well
known structures, systems, and methods often associated with such systems have not been
shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the various
embodiments of the disclosure. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the relevant art will
understand that additional embodiments may be practiced without several of the details
described below.
        A. Embodiments of Systems and Methods for Recovering and Controlling Post
Recovery Motion of Unmanned Aircraft
[0014]      Figure 1 is a partially schematic illustration of an aircraft recovery system 100
configured to intercept and recover an unmanned aircraft (not shown) in flight and control
post-recovery motion of the aircraft in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
The aircraft recovery system 100 can include, for example, a base portion 102 (shown
schematically) and an elongated flexible rod or aircraft capture member 104 attached to the
base portion 102.    In the illustrated embodiment, the flexible rod 104 has a first end
movably coupled to the base portion 102 via an attachment member or joint 106, and a
second free end positioned to intercept the aircraft. The joint 106 is configured to allow
the flexible rod 104 to pivot (as shown in broken lines) relative to the base portion 102
before, during, and after intercepting the unmanned aircraft in flight.       The system 100
further includes an energy capture and dissipation assembly 108 (shown schematically)
operably coupled to the flexible rod 104. When an aircraft impacts the aircraft recovery
system 100, the flexible rod 104 releasably captures the aircraft and the system 100 is
configured to absorb and dissipate the aircraft's landing forces and recover the aircraft.

                                              -4
Once captured, the aircraft can be suspended from the flexible rod 104 by one of its wings
or another suitable component of the aircraft, or by a capture line carried by the aircraft.
Further details regarding the aircraft recovery system 100 and use of the system 100 to
recover and control post-recovery motion of aircraft are described below with reference to
Figures 2A-5C.
[0015]       The base portion 102 can include a wide variety of different structures (e.g.,
generally rigid, semi-rigid, and/or inflatable) configured to support the flexible rod 104
during capture and recovery operations. In general, the base portion 102 is configured to
(a) hold the flexible rod 104 at a desired position before capture operations (e.g., canted or
angled relative to the ground and toward the aircraft), and (b) support the flexible rod 104
during capture and recovery to help prevent the aircraft and its components from hitting
the ground or surrounding structures with excessive force.         The base portion 102 is
configured to rest on the ground or a suitable support platform (e.g., a truck or other
suitable land vehicle, a boat or other water vessel, a building, or other suitable vehicles
and/or structures).    In other embodiments, the base portion 102 can have a different
arrangement and/or can be composed of different materials. Moreover, the base portion
 102 may not be included in some embodiments. In such instances, the flexible rod 104
may be supported using other suitable support assemblies and/or may be a self-supporting
component.
[0016]       The flexible rod 104 can include a first portion 110 and a second portion 112 at
a distal end of the first portion 110. The first and second portions 110 and 112 are aligned
with each other (at least initially before capture and recovery operations) and extend along
a longitudinal axis of the flexible rod 104. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and
second portions 110 and 112 are integral with each other. In other embodiments, however,
the first and second portions 110 and 112 may be separate components that are fixedly or
releasably attached or mated together. In one embodiment, for example, the individual
portions of the flexible rod 104 may be coupled together via a resilient line or cable (e.g.,
an elastic cord). Moreover, the individual portions of the flexible rod 104 may have a
telescoping or articulating arrangement relative to each other. In still other embodiments,

                                              -5
the flexible rod 104 may not include separate portions, or the flexible rod 104 may include
three or more discrete portions.
[00171       The first portion 110 and the second portion 112 can have a variety of different
dimensions and configurations depending upon the desired operational requirements. In
the illustrated embodiment, for example, the first portion 110 has a first cross-sectional
dimension D1 and a first length LI, and the second portion 112 has a second cross
sectional dimension D2 and a second length L2 less than the first cross-sectional
dimension D1 and the first length LI, respectively. In other embodiments, however, the
first and second portions 110 and 112 may have a different arrangement relative to each
other. For example, the first and second portions 110 and 112 may have the same cross
sectional dimension and/or the second portion 112 may have a different length relative to
the first portion 110.
 [0018]      In another aspect of this embodiment, a distal portion of the flexible rod 104
can be positioned at an elevation E above the local surface (e.g., the ground shown in
Figure 1). The elevation E can vary based upon the configuration of the flexible rod 104,
the configuration of the aircraft (not shown), and the local environment. One feature of the
system 100 is that the elevation E only needs to be as high as the anticipated capture
elevation. Thus, the overall length of the flexible rod 104 can be significantly less than
many existing aircraft capture devices that require much greater deployment elevations.
An advantage of this feature is that the flexible rod 104 may be easier to store and/or
transport than larger, existing aircraft capture systems.     Moreover, the aircraft may be
easier to retrieve after capture because of the reduced capture elevation.
 [0019]      The flexible rod 104 can be composed of a carbon fiber material, a carbon
graphite    material,  fiberglass,  other composite    materials   (e.g.,  carbon/graphite or
graphite/boron composites), bamboo, or another suitable material having the desired
material characteristics. The selected material, for example, should have the strength and
flexibility to intercept and capture an aircraft when it flies into the flexible rod 104 and,
once captured, to suspend the aircraft by one of its wings or another suitable capture
mechanism carried by the aircraft. In one particular aspect of this embodiment, the first

                                              -6
portion 110 has a first stiffness and the second portion 112 has a second stiffness less than
the first stiffness. The second portion 112 is accordingly more flexible than the first
portion 110 and is configured to bend or flex more than the first portion 110 during
operation. Further details regarding this feature are described below with reference to
Figures 2A-2F. In other embodiments, however, the first and second portions 110 and 112
may have the same or approximately the same stiffness. In still other embodiments, the
first and/or second portions 110 and 112 may be composed of one or more materials
having different qualities and/or characteristics than those discussed above.
[0020]       In several embodiments, at least part of the second portion 112 of the flexible
rod 104 may be covered or coated with a relatively soft, rope-like material 113 or other
suitable material configured to provide enhanced grip for the hook portion carried by the
aircraft. The material, for example, can be relatively soft, flexible sheath over a desired
part of the second portion 112 or an external coating or layer applied directly onto the
second portion 112 of the flexible rod 104. The sheath or external coating is expected to
reduce and/or inhibit slipping of the hook portion of the aircraft during capture, and is also
expected to strengthen the second portion 112 and make the flexible rod 104 more resilient
in tension along a longitudinal axis of the flexible rod 104. In other embodiments, one or
more additional parts of the flexible rod 104 (e.g., at least part of the first portion 110) may
include the sheath or coating. In still other embodiments, the first and/or second portions
 110 and 112 may include one or more ridges or protrusions positioned to prevent or inhibit
the hook      from the     aircraft  from slipping     off the     flexible rod      104.    The
sheath/coating/ridges, however, are optional features that may not be included in some
embodiments.
 [0021]      The energy capture and dissipation assembly 108 can include a hydraulic
damper, a pneumatic damper, plastically deforming material(s), a passive takeup reel, a
brake, or other suitable damping devices configured to dissipate the aircraft's kinetic
energy.   One feature of the energy capture and dissipation assembly 108 is that the
assembly is expected to provide precise control of the forces associated with capture and
recovery of the aircraft. Accordingly, recovery and energy management can be closely

                                             -7
controlled throughout the capture and recovery process. This feature is expected to help
inhibit and/or prevent damage to the aircraft during capture operations.            In other
embodiments, the energy capture and dissipation assembly can have a different
configuration and/or include different features. In still other embodiments, the system 100
does not include the energy capture and dissipation assembly 108.
[0022]       In operation, the system 100 can be deployed to a desired location and
configured as the primary device for capture and recovery operations. The system 100, for
example, may be a modular system and an operator can transport the system components
in a generally disassembled or partially assembled state to a landing zone and assemble the
components on-site. In another embodiment, however, the system 100 may be transported
to the desired landing zone in a generally assembled configuration.
[0023]       The aircraft recovery system 100 is a scalable system that can be used as a
primary aircraft recovery system for a variety of different aircraft configurations and/or
arrangements. For example, as mentioned above, the flexible rod 104 can have an overall
length and cross-sectional dimension based, at least in part, on the particular dimensions of
the aircraft to be recovered, the operational conditions of the aircraft, and/or the
operational considerations of the system 100 (e.g., the location of the system 100, the
desired transportability of the system 100, etc.).
[0024]       Figures 2A-2F are partially schematic illustrations of the system 100
recovering an unmanned aircraft 200 in flight and controlling post-recovery motion of the
aircraft 200 in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. Figures 2A and 2B, for
example, are a top view and a side view, respectively, of the aircraft 200 approaching the
system 100 before capture. The aircraft 200 can include a fuselage 201, a pair of wings or
lifting surfaces 202 extending outwardly from the fuselage 201, and a propeller 204
positioned at the aft end of the fuselage 201 to propel the aircraft 200 during flight. The
individual wings 202 include a leading edge 210, a trailing edge 212, and an outboard edge
214. Each wing 202 can also include an upwardly extending winglet 203 at the outboard
edge 214 for lateral stability and control. The aircraft 200 further includes an engagement
or capture device 216 at the outboard edge 214 of each wing 202. In other embodiments,

                                               -8
the engagement device 216 may have a different configuration and/or may be positioned at
another suitable location on the aircraft 200. In addition, the aircraft 200 may include a
different number of engagement devices 216.
[0025]       In this embodiment, the flexible rod 104 is angled or canted toward the aircraft
200. One advantage of this arrangement is that it can provide a larger range of movement
for the flexible rod 104 after capture of the aircraft 200. In other embodiments, however,
the flexible rod 104 may have a generally vertical arrangement or another arrangement
relative to the aircraft's local flight path and the local surface (e.g., the ground shown in
Figure 2B).
[0026]       Referring next to Figure 2C, the aircraft 200 intercepts the free end of the
flexible rod 104 and the second portion 112 of the flexible rod 104 and the leading edge
210 of one of the wings 202 slide relative to each other toward the corresponding
engagement device 216. Referring now to Figure 2D, the engagement device 216 at the
outboard edge 214 of the wing 202 receives and retains part of the second portion 112 of
the flexible rod 104, thus causing the aircraft 200 to begin to yaw or rotate toward the
flexible rod 104. The force of impact with the aircraft 200 also causes the flexible rod 104
to pivot or move relative to the base portion 102. In Figure 2D, for example, the flexible
rod 104 has moved from its initial angled or canted arrangement to a generally vertical
position. Moreover, the second portion 112 of the flexible rod 104 has begun to flex or
bend in response to the aircraft's momentum.        It will also be appreciated that the first
portion 110 of the flexible rod 104 may also flex or bend during capture operations.
Moreover, in some embodiments the base 102 may also be configured to move or
articulate in a predetermined manner to help absorb the energy of impact.
[00271       Referring now to Figure 2E, the recovery process continues with the flexible
rod 104 continuing to pivot or move relative to the base portion 102 in response to the
aircraft's momentum. In Figure 2E, for example, the flexible rod 104 has moved past the
generally vertical arrangement and is now angled or canted away from the aircraft's
incoming flight path. The second portion 112 continues to flex or bend in response to the
landing forces from the aircraft 200. As the aircraft 200 rapidly decelerates, the forces are

                                               -9
transferred from the aircraft 200 to the flexible rod 104 and, in turn, to the energy capture
and dissipation assembly 108. In this way, the system 100 can absorb a significant amount
of the aircraft's landing forces. Moreover, because the stresses on the aircraft 200 during
capture operations are primarily exerted on the wing structures during impact, the delicate
components (e.g., turret, pitot tubes, etc.) at a nose portion of the aircraft 200 and the other
fragile portions of the aircraft 200 experience few or no stresses during capture and
recovery operations.
[0028]       Referring to Figure 2F, the aircraft 200 has come to a complete or
approximately complete stop and remains secured to the flexible rod 104. As mentioned
previously, the assembly 108 is configured to provide precise control of the forces
associated with capture and recovery of the aircraft 200, and help inhibit, reduce, and/or
eliminate damage to the aircraft 200 during capture operations.               In the illustrated
embodiment, for example, the aircraft 200 is suspended above the ground and away from
other external structures after capture, and can be quickly and easily retrieved from the
flexible rod 104 by ground personnel (not shown).
[0029]       One feature of embodiments of the system 100 and methods described above
with reference to Figures 1-2F is that the system 100 can be quickly deployed and
configured for landing operations in a variety of different environments and operational
conditions.    Many conventional recovery systems, for example, require elaborate and
complex components that are relatively immobile and require a significant amount time
and expense to deploy. In contrast with such conventional systems, the system 100 is a
modular system that can be easily transported in a partially assembled or disassembled
state to a wide variety of different operational environments, and quickly assembled and
deployed for landing operations with minimal manpower. In addition, because the system
 100 has a much smaller footprint than many conventional systems, the system 100 can be
used in a wide variety of different operational environments and conditions where use of
many conventional systems may be impracticable.            Moreover, the aircraft 200 can be
quickly recovered from the system 100 after landing operations and prepared for storage
and/or another mission.

                                             - 10
[00301       Another feature of embodiments of the system 100 described above is that they
can be used to recover aircraft having a variety of different configurations in addition to
the aircraft 200 described above with reference to Figures 2A-2F. One advantage of this
feature is that the system 100 can be used with existing fleets of unmanned aircraft without
requiring expensive and/or time-consuming modifications to such aircraft. Furthermore,
because the system 100 can be used with a variety of different aircraft, a single system 100
may be deployed and used for landing operations in a particular area or region for an entire
fleet of different unmanned aircraft.
[0031]       Figures 3A-3G are partially schematic illustrations of the system 100
recovering an unmanned aircraft 300 in flight and controlling post-recovery motion of the
aircraft 300 in accordance with another embodiment of the disclosure. Figures 3A and 3B,
for example, are a top view and a side view, respectively, of the aircraft 300 approaching
the system 100 before capture. The methods described below with reference to Figures
3A-3G differ from the techniques described above in that the aircraft 300 has a different
configuration than the aircraft 200. More specifically, rather than intercepting the flexible
rod 104 with a wing of the aircraft as described above with reference to Figures 2A-2D, the
aircraft 300 includes a capture assembly 320 configured to engage or hook onto a portion
of the flexible rod 104 and capture the aircraft 300.
[0032]       The capture assembly 320 can include, for example, one or more deployable
flexible support lines 322 (e.g., ropes or cables) attached to each wing 202 and positioned
to engage the free end of the flexible rod 104. In the illustrated embodiment, the support
line 322 is attached to a top portion of each wing 202 at least proximate to a lateral axis
through a center of gravity (CG) of the aircraft 300. As discussed in greater detail below,
attaching the support line 322 along the lateral axis through the CG of the aircraft 300 can
cause the aircraft 300 to pitch up during recovery and can help provide additional
deceleration during such operations.      The capture assembly 320 can also include an
engagement feature 324 (e.g., a hook, etc.) carried by the flexible rod 104 and positioned
to releasably engage the support line 322. In other embodiments, the engagement feature
324 can include different features and/or have a different arrangement. In at least some

                                             - 11
embodiments, the support line 322 may also include weights or other aerodynamic features
(not shown) to help the support line 322 maintain proper shape and position in flight
relative to the aircraft 300 and the engagement feature 324.
[0033]       One feature of the capture assembly 320 is that the support line 322 is attached
to each wing 202 at natural strong points of the wings 202.          Such points are already
designed to withstand significant loads and, accordingly, additional wing and/or fuselage
support structures are not expected to be necessary to withstand the forces associated with
capture and recovery of the aircraft 300. Moreover, the aircraft's control surfaces and other
fragile portions of the aircraft 300 experience few or no stresses during capture operations.
[0034]       Referring next to Figure 3C, the support line 322 intercepts and engages the
second portion 112 of the flexible rod 104.       The engagement feature 324 receives and
retains part of the support line 322, thus securing the aircraft 300 to the flexible rod 104.
Referring now to Figure 3D, the aircraft 300 begins to pitch up and decelerate after
capture, thereby moving the flexible rod 104 from its initial angled or canted arrangement
to a generally vertical position. As mentioned above, the support line 322 is anchored at
least proximate to a lateral axis through a CG of the aircraft 300.        Accordingly, after
capture of the support line 322 by the flexible rod 104, the momentum of the aircraft 300
causes the aircraft 300 to pitch up to a generally nose-high attitude and hold in a deep stall.
One advantage of this feature is that it allows the support line 322 to quickly induce
aerodynamic decelerations forces on the aircraft 300, while initially producing upward
momentum of the aircraft 300.        This feature is expected to help quickly decelerate the
aircraft 300 and reduce or minimize the possibility of the aircraft 300 contacting the
ground or other external structure during capture operations.
[0035]       Referring now to Figure 3E, the recovery process continues with the flexible
rod 104 continuing to pivot or move relative to the base portion 102 in response to the
aircraft's momentum. The flexible rod 104, for example, is now angled or canted away
from the aircraft's incoming flight path. The second portion 112 continues to flex or bend
in response to the landing forces from the aircraft 300.         As the aircraft 300 rapidly
decelerates, the forces from the aircraft 300 are transferred to the flexible rod 104 and the

                                              - 12
energy capture and dissipation assembly 108. Referring to Figure 3F, the aircraft 300 has
come to a complete or approximately complete stop and remains secured to the flexible rod
 104 via the support line 322. The length of the support line 322 can be selected such that
the aircraft 300 remains suspended above and out of contact with the ground or other
external structure after capture.
[0036]       Figures 4A-4D are partially schematic illustrations of a system 400 configured
to recover an unmanned aircraft (e.g., the aircraft 200 or aircraft 300 discussed above) in
flight and control post-recovery motion of the aircraft in accordance with still another
embodiment of the disclosure.         The aircraft recovery system 400 can include several
features generally similar to the system 100 described above with reference to Figure 1.
The system 400 can include, for example, a base portion 402 and an elongated flexible rod
or aircraft capture member 404 attached to the base portion 402. The flexible rod 404 can
include a first portion 410 and a second portion 412 at a distal end of the first portion 410.
In the illustrated embodiment, the second portion 412 is an elongated wire attached to an
end of the first portion 410. In other embodiments, however, the first portion 410 and/or
second portion 412 may be composed of different material(s) and/or have a different
arrangement.     For example, in some embodiments the flexible rod 404 may not include
separate portions, or the flexible rod 404 may include three or more discrete portions.
 [00371      At least one of the first and second portions 410 and 412 is operably coupled to
a tension line or takeup line 414 (shown and described below with reference to Figure 4B).
In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the tension line 414 is attached to the second
portion 412 of the flexible rod 404. The system 400 also includes a tension reel 408
operably coupled to the tension line 414 and configured to wind/unwind the tension line
414 during operation. In the illustrated embodiment, the tension reel 408 is carried by the
base portion 402 and positioned to wind/unwind the tension line 414.                 In other
embodiments, however, the tension reel 408 can have a different arrangement relative to
the other components in the system 400 and/or may include different features.              For
example, the tension reel 408 may be positioned at a variety of different locations relative
to the base portion 402 and/or the flexible rod 404.

                                             - 13
[00381       Referring next to Figure 4B, the aircraft 200 intercepts the flexible rod 404,
and the second portion 412 of the flexible rod 404 and the leading edge 210 of one of the
wings 202 slide relative to each other toward the corresponding engagement device 216.
After the engagement device 216 at the outboard edge 214 of the wing 202 receives and
retains part of the second portion 412, the aircraft 200 begins to yaw or rotate about the
flexible rod 404. The force of impact with the aircraft 200 also causes the entire flexible
rod 404 (both the first and second portions 410 and 412) to bend or bow. As the flexible
rod 404 bends, any slack in the tension line 414 is taken up by the tension reel 408.
Keeping the tension line 414 relatively taut can help keep the flexible rod 404 in a flexed
or bent configuration, and help transfer the momentum and capture forces from the aircraft
200 to the system 400.      In other embodiments, the second portion 412 may be at least
partially extendable in response to the momentum of the aircraft 200. In one embodiment,
for example, the second portion 412 can extend or spool out relative to the first portion 410
a selected distance after impact of the aircraft 200.
[0039]       Referring now to Figure 4C, the flexible rod 404 has moved from its initial,
generally vertical arrangement to an angled or canted arrangement as the aircraft 200
continues to yaw or pivot about the flexible rod 404.       Moreover, the flexible rod 404
continues to flex or bend in response to the forces from the aircraft 200. Referring to
Figure 4D, the aircraft 200 has come to a complete or approximately complete stop and
remains secured to the flexible rod 404.       The tension line 414 remains generally taut,
which can help keep the aircraft 200 suspended above the ground and away from other
external structures after capture. In this arrangement, the aircraft 200 can be quickly and
easily retrieved from the flexible rod 404 by ground personnel (not shown).
[0040]       In other embodiments, the systems and methods described above with
reference to Figures 1-4D can be used in conjunction with aircraft having configurations
different than those of the aircraft 200/300 described above.         For example, in one
embodiment an aircraft can include generally unswept wings. In another embodiment, an
aircraft can include delta wings. Further, the aircraft can have propulsion systems that are
different than and/or arranged differently than those described above with reference to

                                             - 14
Figures 1-4D.     In any of these further embodiments, the aircraft can remain compatible
with some or all of the systems and methods above for capturing and controlling post
capture motion of the aircraft.
[0041]       Figures 5A-5C illustrate elongated aircraft capture members and aircraft
recovery systems configured in accordance with other embodiments the disclosure.           The
aircraft capture members and systems of Figures 5A-5C can be used with the aircraft,
systems, and methods described above with reference to Figures 1-4D.           In addition, the
aircraft capture members and recovery systems described below can include many of the
same features and advantages of the systems and methods described above.
[0042]       Figure 5A, for example, is a partially schematic illustration of a distal portion
of an elongated flexible rod or aircraft capture member 502 configured in accordance with
another embodiment of the disclosure. The aircraft capture member 502 includes an inner
inflatable portion 504 and an outer engagement portion or sheath 506 at least partially
covering the inner inflatable portion 504. The inflatable portion 504 can include one or
more bladders filled to a desired pressure with a gas (e.g., air) using a gas source 508. The
pressurized aircraft capture member 502 can accordingly extend in a generally vertical or
angled/canted configuration (e.g., similar to the elongated flexible rods or aircraft capture
members described above).       The outer sheath 506 can be composed of a relatively soft,
rope-like material or other suitable material configured to provide better grip for a hook
portion carried by the aircraft. The outer sheath 506 is configured to directly engage the
aircraft (not shown) during capture operations, as well as protect the inner inflatable
portion 504 from damage and/or puncture.
 [0043]      In operation, the aircraft capture member 502 has an initially deflated, non
rigid arrangement (e.g., a deflated balloon).      After energizing the gas source 508 and
inflating the inner inflatable portion 504 to a desired pressure, the aircraft capture member
502 has a configuration generally similar to the arrangement of the flexible rod 104 of
Figure 1, and can be positioned at a desired orientation (e.g., generally vertical or canted
relative to the ground and the aircraft to be captured. In several embodiments, one or more
flexible lines, capture devices, and/or engagement members can be carried by or coupled to

                                              - 15
the aircraft capture member 502 and positioned to releasably engage the aircraft during
capture and recovery operations.
[0044]       Figure 5B is a partially schematic illustration of still another embodiment of an
aircraft capture member 520 configured in accordance with an embodiment of the
disclosure. In this embodiment, the aircraft capture member 520 includes an inner tubing
or bladder 522 operably coupled to a gas source 530, and an outer engagement portion or
sheath 524 at least partially covering the inner tubing 522. The aircraft capture member
520 further includes a thruster 526 coupled to the inner tubing 522 and outer sheath 524.
The inner tubing 522 and outer sheath 524 are arranged relative to each other in a
telescoping arrangement. In operation, the thruster 526 can be activated (e.g., using the
gas source 530) and can pull up or extend the outer sheath 524 to a desired elevation above
the local surface (e.g., ground) as the thruster 526 is launched away from its initial
position. In this way, the aircraft capture member 520 can have an elongated, generally
vertical arrangement (e.g., similar to the flexible rod 104 of Figure 1) positioned to
intercept an aircraft in flight for capture and recovery operations.
 [0045]      Figure 5C is a partially schematic illustration of an aircraft recovery system
540 configured in accordance with still yet another embodiment of the disclosure.         The
system 540 includes an elongated flexible rod or aircraft capture member 542 having a first
portion 544 and one or more second portions 546 (two are shown in broken lines as 546a
and 546b) positioned to intercept an unmanned aircraft in flight. It will be appreciated that
the system 540 may include only a single second portion 546, or may include more than
two second portions 546 extending from the first portion 542. The second portions 546
can have material characteristics and features generally similar to the second portions
 112/412 described above. The system 540 differs from the systems described above in that
rather than having an elongated rod or aircraft recovery member with an initial, generally
linear and generally vertical arrangement, the second portions 546a and 546b of the system
540 are initially curved or non-linear. Moreover, each of the second portions 546a and
546b has a first end attached to the first portion 544 of the aircraft capture member 542 and
a second end attached to the local surface (e.g., the ground) or another suitable structure.

                                           - 16
In several embodiments, the second ends of the individual second portions 546 may be
configured to break free or become detached when the tension in the respective line
exceeds a threshold value. In still other embodiments, the second ends of the individual
second portions 546 may remain free rather than being attached to the local surface or
another structure. After capture and recovery operations, the second portions 546 can
reach a final state or arrangement (as shown by line 547) and the aircraft 200 can be
retrieved from the line.
[00461       From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the
disclosure have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various
modifications can be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.
For example, the flexible rods described above can have a telescoping arrangement with
the second portions (and any additional portions) of the individual rods at least partially
received within the first portions in a stowed configuration before or after operation.
Further, any of the flexible rods described above can include one or more engagement
members (e.g., hooks, loops, multiple loops, etc.) at or near the top portion of the flexible
rod and positioned to engage the aircraft directly and/or engage a capture assembly carried
by the aircraft. Moreover, although the aircraft capture members described above have a
generally upward, vertical orientation, the flexible rods may also be suspended from a
suitable support structure in a generally downward orientation for capture and recovery
operations.
 [00471      Specific elements of any of the foregoing embodiments can be combined or
substituted for elements in other embodiments. Furthermore, while advantages associated
with certain embodiments of the disclosure have been described in the context of these
embodiments, other embodiments may also exhibit such advantages, and not all
embodiments need necessarily exhibit such advantages to fall within the scope of the
disclosure. Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosure are not limited except as by the
appended claims.
