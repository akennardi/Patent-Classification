actuator device identical to the first actuator device is electrically operated to axially
rotate a drive rod connected to a drive link. The drive link is connected to and
displaces the pantograph linkage set between the stowed and extended positions. A
swing lever rotatably connected to the support rod is rotated during operation of the
second actuator device to extend the pantograph linkage set. The swing lever in a
fully rotated position displaces the support rod creating a furniture member tilt
position.

                  MECHANISM AND CHAIR FOR POWER COMBINED
              AND INDEPENDENT SEAT BACK AND LEG REST MOTION
                                          FIELD
 5         [0001]    The   present   disclosure  relates   to    a   furniture  member
   mechanism providing for power combined or independent seat back and leg rest
   motions.
                                     BACKGROUND
10         [0002]    This section provides background information related to the
   present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art. It is intended to facilitate an
   understanding of the present invention only. The discussion is not an
   acknowledgement or admission that any of the material referred to is or was part
   of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of the application.
15         [0003]    Furniture members such as chairs, sofas, loveseats, sectionals,
   and the like commonly include a mechanism that permits the occupant of the
   furniture member to manually move a leg rest member from a stowed to an
   extended position to support the legs of the occupant.           Occupant supplied
   weight/force is commonly required in these furniture members to rotate a seat
20 back member between an upright and a fully reclined position, independent of
   the mechanism operation moving the leg rest member. Power actuators are also
   known which provide for powered or automatic operation of a leg rest member
   followed sequentially by powered operation of a seat back member.               These
   designs commonly require the leg rest member to extend first followed by
25 rotation of the seat back member. To reverse the furniture member position, the
   power actuator is operated to rotate the seat back member forward followed
   sequentially by retraction of the leg rest member. Independent operation of the
   leg rest member and seat back member are typically not provided in these
   designs.

                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
            [0037]       Example embodiments will now be described more fully with
   reference to the accompanying drawings.
            [0038]       Referring to Figure 1, a furniture member 10 includes a
25 furniture frame assembly 12 which is rotatably supported with respect to a base
   member 14. A seat back member 16 is rotatably connected to furniture frame
   assembly 12 and can rotate from a fully upright position in a seat back recline
   direction "A" or return from a fully reclined position in a seat back return direction
   "B" toward the fully upright position, or be positioned at any position
30 therebetween.     Seat back member 16 is rotatably connected to furniture frame
   assembly 12 using oppositely positioned rotational connectors 18 (only one of
   which is clearly visible in this view). Furniture frame assembly 12 includes a first

   side member 20 positioned with respect to an occupant's right hand side for an
   occupant seated on furniture member 10, and a second side member 22
   positioned on the occupant's left hand side. A leg rest member 24 is extensible
   from a fully stowed position shown in a leg rest extension direction "C" and
 5 returnable in a leg rest retraction direction "D" using a mechanism 26 which is
   connected to each of the furniture frame assembly 12 and base member 14.
   Movement of the seat back member 16 is also controlled at least in the seat
   back recline direction "A" by operation of mechanism 26.
           [0039]          Mechanism 26 includes each of a first actuator device 28
10 which is used to control rotation of the seat back member 16, and a second
   actuator device 30 which is used to extend or retract leg rest member 24 as well
   as to permit a tilting motion of furniture frame assembly 12 with respect to base
   member 14. The tilting motion of furniture frame assembly 12 is with respect to
   a rear rotation direction "E" and a forward rotation direction "F".     Operation of
15 second actuator device 30 simultaneously controls displacement of leg rest
   member 24 as well as tilt rotation of furniture frame assembly 12. For example,
   as leg rest member 24 is extended in the leg rest extension direction "C",
   furniture frame assembly 12 is tilted by rotation in the rear rotation direction "E".
   Opposite rotation of leg rest member 24 also causes an opposite rotation of
20 furniture frame assembly 12 in the forward rotation direction "F".
           [0040]          First and second actuator devices 28, 30 are identical to
   each other, and each is rotatably connected to a rigid tube 32. Rigid tube 32 is
   fixedly connected to each of the first and second side members 20, 22 to prevent
   axial rotation of rigid tube 32. This provides a fixed reference point for operation
25 of either of the first or second actuator devices 28, 30. First actuator device 28 is
   connected to and operates a seat back operating portion 34 of mechanism 26.
   Seat back operating portion 34 includes each of a first seat back actuation link
   35 positioned proximate to first side member 20 and a second seat back
   actuation link 36 positioned proximate to second side member 22. A lateral drive
30 member 38, which according to several embodiments is a length of wood
   material, but can be any suitable material such as metal or plastic, is movably
   connected with respect to second side member 22 and connected by a seat
                                              Ar%

   back linkage set 40 to seat back member 16.           Displacement of lateral drive
   member 38 in a drive member powered motion direction "G" by operation of first
   actuator device 28 causes a reclining rotation of seat back member 16 in the
   seat back recline direction "A". To provide for rotation of seat back member 16,
 5 a rotational fastener 42 is used to rotatably connect seat back linkage set 40 to
   seat back member 16.       To structurally stiffen furniture frame assembly 12, a
   forward frame member 44 is oriented substantially perpendicular to and is fixedly
   connected to each of the first and second side members 20, 22. A frame brace
   46, which is positioned in an orientation substantially parallel with respect to rigid
10 tube 32 can also be provided, which is also fixedly connected to each of the first
   and second side members 20, 22.
           [0041]        Referring to Figure 2, each of the first and second actuator
   devices 28, 30 include an actuator motor 48, 48' which is connected to and
   provides energy of operation for an actuator drive member 50, 50'. According to
15 several embodiments, actuator motor 48, 48' for each of the first and second
   actuator devices 28, 30 is operated using a 24-volt DC current. According to
   several embodiments, a rotary motion of actuator motor 48, 48' is converted to a
   linear motion by actuator drive member 50, 50', for example using a gear such
   as a worm gear (not shown). An actuator displacement member 52 is connected
20 to and linearly displaced by actuator drive member 50 and provides for opposing
   linear motions. Similar to seat back operating portion 34 which is connected to
   first actuator device 28, second actuator device 30 has a leg rest and tilt
   operating portion 54 which converts the fore and aft sliding displacement of the
   actuator displacement member 52 into an axial rotation of a drive rod 56 which is
25 supported by both first and second side members 20, 22 as well as further
   components, which will be described in greater detail herein.          Included with
   these further support components are drive rod stiffening braces 58, 58' which
   are connected to drive rod 56, permitting axial rotation of drive rod 56 while
   providing lateral support by connection of the drive rod stiffening braces 58, 58'
30 to forward frame member 44. Drive rod stiffening braces 58, 58' therefore permit
   axial rotation of drive rod 56 while limiting or preventing longitudinal bending of
   drive rod 56.    Axial rotation of drive rod 56 displaces both first and second
                                             A A4

   pantograph linkage sets 60, 62 in the leg rest extension direction "C" which is
   fixedly connected to leg rest member 24.
           [0042]         To provide additional occupant weight support for the weight
   of the occupant's legs on leg rest member 24, mechanism 26 further includes a
 5 support rod 64 which is oriented substantially parallel to drive rod 56 and is
   positioned forward of drive rod 56 to provide additional support for first and
   second pantograph linkage sets 60, 62 in their extended positions. Support rod
   64 does not axially rotate but is supported at opposite ends by first and second
   side members 20, 22. According to several embodiments, a drive rod free end
10 66 of drive rod 56 can extend partially outward with respect to first side member
   20. Drive rod free end 66 can be provided for attachment of a lever (not shown)
   used for manual rotation of drive rod 56 when electrical power is not available for
   operation of the second actuator device 30.
           [0043]         Referring  to Figure 3, furniture member        10  can   be
15 positioned having the seat back member 16 in the fully reclined position
   simultaneously with the leg rest member 24 being moved to the fully extended
   position by simultaneous operation of both the first and second actuator devices
   28, 30. As previously noted, as the leg rest member 24 extends in the leg rest
   extension direction "C", furniture frame assembly 12 is tilted rearwardly with
20 respect to the rear rotation direction "E".      In a furniture member frame tilt
   position, a frame assembly front corner 68 is elevated with respect to a frame
   assembly rear corner 70 of furniture frame assembly 12 when the leg rest
   member 24 is in any extended position with respect to forward frame member
   44. Mechanism 26 of furniture member 10 can also be operated by energizing
25 only one of the first or second actuator devices 28, 30 independently of the
   other, to either rotate seat back member 16 or extend leg rest member 24.
           [0044]         Furniture member 10 further provides the option for the
   operator to return the seat back member 16 to the fully upright position by
   independent powered operation of first actuator device 28, causing seat back
30 member 16 to rotate in the seat back return direction "B" while the leg rest
   member 24 is still in any extended position. Conversely, the operator can also
   return the leg rest member 24 from any extended position to the fully stowed or

   retracted position by movement in the leg rest retraction direction "D" by
   independent operation of second actuator device 30, while the seat back
   member 16 is retained in the upright or any reclined position.           This optional
   operation of either the seat back member 16 or the leg rest member 24 is
 5 permitted by the independent connection and operation of the first and second
   actuator devices 28, 30.
           [0045]         Referring to Figure 4, features relating to the drive rod 56,
   support rod 64, and each of the first and second pantograph linkage sets 60, 62
   are shown in greater detail, having the first and second pantograph linkage sets
10 60, 62 in their fully extended positions.          To extend the first and second
   pantograph linkage sets 60, 62, drive rod 56 is rotated in a first drive rod rotation
   direction   "H" which is counterclockwise as viewed              in Figure 4.     This
   counterclockwise rotation of drive rod 56 is caused by a counterclockwise
   rotation of first and second leg rest drive links 74, 74'. It is noted that each of the
15 components connected to and operating the first and second pantograph linkage
   sets 60, 62 are substantially opposite and mirror image configurations of each
   other; therefore, the following discussion of the connections and operation of first
   pantograph linkage set 60 applies equally to second pantograph linkage set 62.
   The first leg rest drive link 74 is substantially triangular shaped and includes a
20 drive link flange 76 which is fixedly connected to drive rod 56. Axial rotation of
   drive rod 56 therefore co-rotates the first leg rest drive link 74. Rotation of first
   leg rest drive link 74 in the first drive rod rotation direction "H" also co-rotates a
   swing link 78 which is rotatably connected to first pantograph linkage set 60. It
   should be evident that an opposite axial rotation of drive rod 56 in a clockwise
25 rotation direction will cause retraction of the first and second pantograph linkage
   sets 60, 62.
           [0046]         A contact flange 80 of first leg rest drive link 74, which is
   oriented substantially perpendicular to a triangular shaped body of first leg rest
   drive link 74, directly contacts swing link 78 to cause rotation of swing link 78
30 thereby matching the first drive rod rotation direction "H". Swing link 78 is not
   directly connected to first leg rest drive link 74, but is induced to rotate when
   pushed by contact flange 80. Contact between swing link 78 and first leg rest

   drive link 74 is normally maintained by a biasing force created by a biasing
   member 82 which is connected to both first leg rest drive link 74 and swing link
   78.    Swing link 78 is rotatably connected to drive rod 56, and is therefore
   permitted to freely rotate with respect to drive rod 56.
 5         [0047]        A pantograph connecting link 84 is rotatably connected to
   first pantograph linkage set 60 and rotatably connected to support rod 64. The
   weight of the occupant's legs carried by the leg rest member (not shown in this
   view) is therefore distributed through both swing link 78 and pantograph
   connecting link 84.     This distributes the occupant's leg weight to each of the
10 drive rod 56 and the support rod 64.        First pantograph linkage set 60 further
   includes a leg rest rotational fitting 86 acting as a bearing to permit reduced
   friction rotation of pantograph connecting link 84 with respect to support rod 64.
   A leg rest connecting flange 88 is provided at a free end of first pantograph
   linkage set 60 which is used as a mounting surface for leg rest member 24
15 shown and described in reference to Figure 1.
           [0048]         Referring to Figure 5, the first and second actuator devices
   28, 30 are individually rotatably connected to rigid tube 32 using either a first
   actuator mount bracket 90 or a second actuator mount bracket 92.             A first
   actuator mount pin 94 permits first actuator device 28 to rotate with respect to
20 first actuator mount bracket 90.       Similarly, a second actuator mount pin 96
   permits second actuator device 30 to rotate with respect to second actuator
   mount bracket 92. According to several embodiments, a drive rod support brace
   98 is connected to first actuator mount bracket 90 and also to drive rod 56 to
   provide additional support for drive rod 56.
25         [0049]         Further components of seat back operating portion 34
   include a swing connection tube 100 which is substantially U-shaped and is
   freely rotatably supported on drive rod 56. Swing connection tube 100 is rotated
   by extension or retraction of a first actuator extension shaft 102, which is
   extendable or retractable from actuator displacement member 52' during
30 operation of first actuator device 28. Swing connection tube 100 includes a first
   tube arm 104 oriented substantially parallel with respect to a second tube arm
    106. First tube arm 104 is rotatably connected to drive rod 56 using a first arm

   bracket 108. Similarly, second tube arm 106 is rotatably connected to drive rod
   56 using a second arm bracket 110. First seat back actuation link 35 is rotatably
   connected to first tube arm 104 using a first spin fitting 112. Similarly, a second
   spin fitting 114 is used to rotatably connect second seat back actuation link 36 to
 5 second tube arm 106. Rotation of swing connection tube 100 with respect to
   drive rod axis of rotation 72 therefore displaces first and second seat back
   actuation links 35, 36 which are individually connected to and displace each of a
   first mount plate 116 and a second mount plate 118.          First mount plate 116
   includes an elongated slot 120 which slidably receives support rod 64. Similarly,
10 second mount plate 118 includes an elongated slot 122 to also slidably receive
   support rod 64. Support rod 64 can therefore be substantially fixed in position
   with respect to drive rod 56 even as the first and second mount plates 116, 118
   are displaced in either a forward or a rearward direction by rotation of swing
   connection tube 100.
15          [0050]       With continuing reference to Figures 5 and 1, the lateral
   drive member 38 is fixed to a plate flange 124 extending from first mount plate
    116. The displacement of second mount plate 118 in a forward or rearward
   direction by rotation of swing connection tube 100 therefore longitudinally
   displaces lateral drive member 38, which thereby rotates the seat back member
20  16 via seat back linkage set 40.      Support rod 64, which is fixed in position,
   extends through the individual elongated slots 120, 122. A length of each of the
   elongated slots 120, 122 is therefore predetermined to accommodate the total
   forward or rearward displacement of the first or second mount plates 116, 118.
            [0051]       The second actuator device 30 further includes a second
25 actuator extension shaft 126 which extends in a forward or rearward general
   direction by operation of second actuator device 30. Second actuator extension
   shaft 126 is connected to a drive toggle connector 128. Drive toggle connector
    128 is connected to a drive toggle connector extension rod 130 such that drive
   toggle connector extension rod 130 is co-linearly displaced during displacement
30 of drive toggle connector 128. A drive toggle 132 is connected to drive rod 56
   and rotatably connected to drive toggle connector 128. Extension of drive toggle
   connector 128 during extension or retraction of second actuator extension shaft

    126 rotates drive toggle 132, thereby axially rotating drive rod 56. Because drive
   rod 56 is substantially square or rectangular in cross-sectional shape, the
   geometry of the connectors used between drive toggle 132 and drive rod 56 are
   also square or rectangular in shape, matching the geometry of drive rod 56.
 5         [0052]        A swing lever 134 is rotatably connected to support rod 64
   at a swing lever rotation end 136 such that swing lever 134 is freely rotatable
   with respect to support rod 64. During powered operation of second actuator
   device 30, drive toggle connector 128 contacts swing lever 134 and thereby
   rotates swing lever 134 with respect to support rod 64. A tilt swing lever 137 is
10 connected to base member 14 using a tilt swing mount bracket 138 and a tilt
   swing rotation pin 140. Tilt swing lever 137 is rotatably connected to swing lever
    134. Rotation of swing lever 134 causes an oppositely directed rotation of tilt
   swing lever 137. A force exerted by drive toggle connector 128 to swing lever
    134 and tilt swing lever 137 causes furniture frame assembly 12 to rotate (tilt)
15 during extension of the leg rest assembly (only partially shown with respect to
   second pantograph linkage set 62).        Because support rod 64 is substantially
   fixed in position with respect to furniture frame assembly 12, as the combination
   of swing lever 134 and tilt swing lever 137 rotate by displacement of drive toggle
   connector 128, the tilt swing lever 137 and the swing lever 134 will rotate into a
20 substantially co-linear orientation as will be described in greater detail in
   reference to Figures 16 and 17.       This linear alignment creates a lifting force
   pushing upwardly and forwardly on support rod 64, causing rear rotation or tilt of
   furniture frame assembly 12.
           [0053]        Operation of first actuator device 28 causes rotation of
25 swing connection tube 100 to displace the first and second mount plates 116,
    118 but causes no axial rotation of drive rod 56. Rotation of drive rod 56 only
   occurs during operation of second actuator device 30 to both extend the first and
   second pantograph linkage sets 60, 62 and to produce the rearward tilt of
   furniture frame assembly 12.      The support rod 64 is not axially rotatable with
30 respect to a support rod longitudinal axis 142 however support rod 64 is
   displaceable by the rotation of swing lever 134 and tilt swing lever 137 to
   produce the rearward tilt of furniture frame assembly 12.

            [0054]         Referring to Figure 6, the distinct operational portions of
   mechanism 26 for controlling seat back rotation or leg rest and tilt movement are
   more clearly visible by removal of the furniture frame assembly 12. First actuator
   device 28 operates to rotate swing connection tube 100 which forwardly
 5 displaces each of the first and second seat back actuation links 35, 36. Forward
   displacement of the first and second seat back actuation links 35, 36, in turn,
   forwardly and upwardly displace the first and second mount plates 116, 118.
   Reversing the operation of first actuator device 28 reverses the rotation of swing
   connection tube 100, thereby retracting the first and second seat back actuation
10 links 35, 36 and first and second mount plates 116, 118. As previously noted,
   the forward or rearward displacements of first or second mount plates 116, 118
   occur independently of support rod 64 such that support rod 64 remains in
   position with respect to support rod longitudinal axis 142 during the displacement
   of first or second mount plates 116, 118.
15          [0055]         With continuing reference to Figures 6 and 1-3, independent
   operation of second actuator device 30 displaces the actuator displacement
   member 52 thereby rotating drive toggle connector 128 and drive toggle 132.
   Rotation of drive toggle 132 axially rotates drive rod 56, thereby co-rotating both
   first leg rest drive link 74 and swing link 78. First pantograph linkage set 60 is
20 not shown for clarity, however it is noted that rotation of both leg rest drive links
   74, 74' and swing links 78, 78' act to extend first and second pantograph linkage
   sets 60, 62 to thereby extend the leg rest member.             Because either first or
   second actuator device 28, 30 can be operated at any one time, or because both
   first and second actuator devices 28, 30 can be simultaneously operated, the
25 occupant can choose either independent operation of the leg rest member or the
   seat back member, or simultaneous operation of both the leg rest member and
   seat back member. Any position of either the leg rest member 24 or the seat
   back member 16 can therefore be selected by the occupant independent of the
   other.
30          [0056]         The tilt swing lever 137 is rotatably connected to the swing
   lever 134 using a tilt swing lever pin 144.        Tilt swing lever pin 144 therefore
   displaces both the swing lever 134 and support rod 64 when tilt swing lever 137
                                                -7

   is rotated. In the free position shown for tilt swing lever 137, tilt swing lever 137
   is freely disposed on drive toggle connector extension rod 130 when the first and
   second pantograph linkage sets 60, 62 are substantially in their retracted
   positions. Limited extension of the first and second pantograph linkage sets 60,
 5 62 can occur before drive toggle connector 128 contacts tilt swing lever 137.
   Continued contact between drive toggle connector 128 and tilt swing lever 137
   will thereafter rotate tilt swing lever 137 and swing lever 134, and cause
   displacement of support rod 64, thereby creating the tilt position of mechanism
   26. This will be shown and described in greater detail in reference to Figures 14
10 17.
           [0057]         Rotational bearings 146 are provided for each of the first
   and second arm brackets 108, 110 (only second arm bracket 110 is clearly
   visible in this view). The rotational bearings 146 permit the axial rotation of drive
   rod 56 with respect to drive rod axis of rotation 72 independent of the rotation of
15 swing connection tube 100. This allows the rotational axis of swing connection
   tube 100 to also be maintained coaxial with respect to drive rod axis of rotation
   72 without requiring co-rotation of swing connection tube 100 as drive rod 56
   rotates.
           [0058]         Referring to Figure 7, in addition to the capability of
20 mechanism 26 to provide for leg rest extension and retraction and seat back
   rotation, mechanism 26 further provides for a rocking motion of furniture frame
   assembly 12 with respect to base member 14 by manual force/weight distribution
   of the occupant of furniture member 10, as commonly known. This rotation or
   rocking motion of furniture frame assembly 12 can be controlled using an
25 opposed set of rocker spring assemblies 148, 148' (only second rocker spring
   assembly 148' is clearly visible in this view). The rocker spring assemblies 148,
   148' are connected to the first and second side members 20, 22 and to the base
   member 14.        The axis of rotation for the rocking motion of furniture frame
   assembly 12 with respect to base member 14 is therefore determined by the
30 position of the rocker spring assemblies 148, 148'.         The rocking motion of
   furniture frame assembly 12 occurs with respect to a rearward rocking direction
   "J" and an opposite forward rocking direction "K".         These rocking direction

   motions are independent of rear and forward rotation directions "E", "F" because
   the rear and forward rotation directions "E", "F" are oriented with respect to drive
   rod axis of rotation 72.
           [0059]          As further shown in Figure 7, to return the seat back
 5 member 16 from the fully reclined to the upright position, first actuator device 28
   is operated to retract first actuator extension shaft 102 with respect to actuator
   displacement member 52'.            Because first actuator extension shaft 102 is
   rotatably connected to a first actuator connecting bracket 150, which is also
   connected to swing connection tube 100, this retraction of first actuator
10 extension shaft 102 rotates swing connection tube 100 in a swing rotation
   direction "L" with respect to drive rod axis of rotation 72. Again and as previously
   noted, rotation of swing connection tube 100 in the swing rotation direction "L"
   does not result in an axial rotation of drive rod 56.        Once the first actuator
   extension shaft 102 is fully retracted with respect to actuator displacement
15 member 52', the weight of the occupant seated on furniture frame assembly 12
   also assists in retracting lateral drive member 38 in a direction opposite to drive
   member powered motion direction "G", thereby permitting the rotation of seat
   back member 16 away from the fully retracted and back to the fully forward
   position. The weight of the occupant of furniture member 10, as well as any
20 force provided by the occupant, therefore assists in the return of seat back
   member 16 to the upright position instead of this rotation being an entirely
   powered operation.
           [0060]          With the first and second pantograph linkage sets 60, 62
   positioned in the fully retracted positions (only second pantograph linkage set 62
25 is clearly visible in this view), the first and second pantograph linkage sets 60, 62
   are each received in an individual one of a first pantograph clearance aperture
    152 or a second pantograph clearance aperture 154.            The first and second
   pantograph clearance apertures 152, 154 are each created in the forward frame
   member 44. When leg rest member 24 is positioned in the stowed position, leg
30 rest member 24 contacts forward frame member 44.               The first and second
   pantograph clearance apertures 152, 154 permit a continuous connection

   between first and second pantograph linkage sets 60, 62 and leg rest member
   24 through forward frame member 44 in any position of leg rest member 24.
           [0061]         Referring to Figure 8, the first leg rest drive link 74 is shown
   in the position corresponding to a fully retracted position of the first and second
 5 pantograph linkage sets 60, 62 (only first pantograph linkage set 60 is shown in
   this view). As drive rod 56 is axially rotated in the first drive rod rotation direction
   "H", first leg rest drive link 74 is also co-rotated in the first drive rod rotation
   direction "H". The contact flange 80 of first leg rest drive link 74 provides direct
   contact between first leg rest drive link 74 and swing link 78 at an edge face 156
10 of swing link 78. This direct contact causes simultaneous rotation of swing link
   78 as first leg rest drive link 74 rotates in the first drive rod rotation direction "H".
   As previously noted, swing link 78 is freely rotationally positioned with respect to
   drive rod 56 and therefore does not directly rotate in response to rotation of drive
   rod 56. As swing link 78 is directed to rotate by contact flange 80, a rotational
15 fastener 158 connecting swing link 78 to a link connecting end 160 of first
   pantograph linkage set 60 transfers the rotational motion of swing link 78 to a
   forward translation of link connecting end 160 and therefore to first pantograph
   linkage set 60.
           [0062]         Referring to Figure 9 and again to Figure 8, first leg rest
20 drive link 74 is shown following rotation of drive rod 56 in the first drive rod
   rotation direction "H", causing full extension of both first and second pantograph
   linkage sets 60, 62. At this time, first leg rest drive link 74 is rotated greater than
   90 degrees and approximately 110 degrees with respect to its orientation in the
   leg rest fully retracted position shown and described in Figure 8. As previously
25 noted, in addition to the support provided for the occupant's leg weight by swing
   links 78, 78', pantograph connecting links 84, 84' also distribute a portion of the
   occupant's leg weight to support rod 64.           The first and second pantograph
   clearance apertures 152, 154, provided in forward frame member 44, provide
   clearance for maximum extension of first and second pantograph linkage sets
30 60, 62. Rotation of drive rod 56 in the first drive rod rotation direction "H" results
   from axial displacement in a substantially forward direction of second actuator
   extension shaft 126 which is displaced by operation of second actuator device

   30. This displacement of second actuator extension shaft 126 causes rotation of
   drive toggle connector 128 and drive toggle 132, which is directly connected to
   drive rod 56. As previously noted, extension or retraction of first and second
   pantograph linkage sets 60, 62 occurs independently of any motion imparted by
 5 operation of first actuator device 28.
           [0063]        Referring to Figure 10, a rotational pin 162 is provided to
   rotatably connect swing lever 134 to tilt swing lever 137. As previously noted,
   swing lever 134 is rotatably connected to support rod 64. The position shown for
   swing lever 134, with respect to drive toggle connector extension rod 130,
10 permits free rotational displacement of swing lever 134 with respect to drive
   toggle connector extension rod 130. In this position, drive toggle connector 128
   is spaced from swing lever 134, allowing free rotation of both swing lever 134
   and tilt swing lever 137 without contact from and therefore in a non-powered
   manner with respect to drive toggle connector 128. The free rotation positions of
15 swing lever 134 and tilt swing lever 137 also permit rocking motion of furniture
   member 10.
           [0064]         Referring to Figure 11 and again to Figure 10, swing lever
   134 includes a pin aperture 164 which receives the rotational pin 162. Swing
   lever 134 also includes a bulbous end 166 having a curved end face 168.
20 Curved end face 168 is generally convex in shape and is positioned during
   operation predominantly below drive toggle connector extension rod 130. In the
   free position of swing lever 134 wherein drive toggle connector 128 is not in
   contact with curved end face 168, the bulbous end 166 of swing lever 134 is free
   to displace in either of a first swing lever sliding direction "N" or an opposite
25 second swing lever sliding direction "P" as swing lever 134 rotates with respect
   to support rod 64. This sliding motion in either of the first or second swing lever
   sliding directions "N", "P" permits rocking motion of furniture member 10 while
   maintaining drive toggle connector extension rod 130 sliding contact with swing
   lever 134 in all rotated positions of swing lever 134.      Drive toggle connector
30 extension rod 130 acts as a guide to maintain swing lever 134 in a position for
   curved end face 168 to be contacted by drive toggle connector 128, shown and
                                             el

   described in better detail in reference to Figures 16 and 17, for powered rotation
   of swing lever 134.
            [0065]        Referring to Figure 12 and again to Figures 10-11, swing
   lever 134 includes a rod clearance aperture 170 to allow the free sliding motion
 5 of drive toggle connector extension rod 130 with respect to swing lever 134 as
   swing lever 134 rotates. A longitudinal cavity 171 is also provided in tilt swing
   lever 137, which receives bulbous end 166 of swing lever 134, to provide further
   support and sliding guidance for relative displacement between bulbous end 166
   and tilt swing lever 137. This maintains alignment between swing lever 134 and
10 tilt swing lever 137 during rotation.
            [0066]        Referring to Figure 13 and again to Figure 12, according to
   several embodiments tilt swing lever 137 has a substantially U-shape and
   includes opposed first and second lever arms 172, 174. Longitudinal cavity 171
   is created between first and second lever arms 172, 174. The first and second
15 lever arms 172, 174 are both fixedly connected to a lever connecting member
    176. The tilt swing rotation pin 140 is slidably received through lever connecting
   member 176. In addition to lever connecting member 176, tilt swing lever 137
   further includes a lever post 178 which spans opposite ends of first and second
   lever arms 172, 174 with respect to the location of lever connecting member 176.
20 Lever post 178 creates a positive point of contact when contacting a swing lever
   face 180 of swing lever 134 to establish a maximum rotated position of tilt swing
   lever 137 and swing lever 134.
            [0067]        Referring to Figure 14, mechanism 26 is shown at the fully
   extended position of first and second pantograph linkage sets 60, 62 and also at
25 the point of contact between drive toggle connector 128 and swing lever 134. To
   reach this position, second actuator device 30 is operated, thereby axially
   extending second actuator extension shaft 126 in an extension shaft direction of
   extension "Q". Up until the point of contact is reached between drive toggle
   connector 128 and swing lever 134, the furniture frame assembly 12 is free to
30 rock in either of the rearward or forward rocking directions "J", "K" with respect to
   base member 14.        Immediately upon contact between drive toggle connector

    128 and swing lever 134, further free rocking motion of furniture frame assembly
    12 is precluded.
           [0068]          Referring to Figure 15 and again to Figure 14, second
   actuator extension shaft 126 is rotatably connected to drive toggle connector 128
 5 using a pinned connection through a clevis 182. Drive toggle connector 128 is
   fixedly connected to drive toggle connector extension rod 130, therefore
   extension of second actuator extension shaft 126 co-extensively displaces each
   of drive toggle connector 128 and drive toggle connector extension rod 130. As
   this displacement occurs, the curved end face 168 of drive toggle connector 128
10 is brought into direct contact with swing lever 134.             Further subsequent
   extension of second actuator extension shaft 126 in extension shaft direction of
   extension "Q" causes a combined and oppositely directed rotation of swing lever
    134 which rotates with respect to support rod 64, and tilt swing lever 137 which
   rotates with respect to tilt swing rotation pin 140. The axis of common rotation
15 between swing lever 134 and tilt swing lever 137 is with respect to rotational pin
    162.
           [0069]          Referring to Figure 16 and again to Figure 15, during
   extension of second actuator extension shaft 126 in the extension shaft direction
   of extension "Q" curved end face 168 of bulbous end 166 contacts a second
20 curved end face 184 of drive toggle connector 128. Because tilt swing lever 137
   is rotatably connected using tilt swing rotation pin 140 to tilt swing mount bracket
    138, and tilt swing mount bracket 138 is fixedly connected to base member 14, a
   clockwise      rotation  of    tilt swing  lever  137   causes      a  corresponding
   counterclockwise rotation of swing lever 134 as viewed in Figure 16 with respect
25 to the axis of rotational pin 162. As tilt swing lever 137 rotates in the clockwise
   rotation direction, the tilt swing lever 137 approaches but does not reach co-axial
   alignment with a longitudinal axis of swing lever 134.          This results in a net
   displacement in a tilt direction "Z" of support rod 64 because of the connection
   between swing lever rotation end 136 and support rod 64. Displacement in tilt
30 direction "Z" of support rod 64 therefore provides a forward and upward motion
   of the front corner 68 of furniture frame assembly 12 and a rearward rotational
   lowering of the frame assembly rear corner 70 as shown and described in

   reference to Figure 3.        The weight of the occupant is therefore partially
   supported in the tilt position by swing lever 134, tilt swing lever 137, and
   rotational pin162. Because the leg rest assembly can be in its fully extended
   position during this tilt motion, the leg rest member 24 is further elevated with
 5 respect to a floor or planar surface upon which base member 14 is supported.
           [0070]         Referring to Figure 17 and again to Figure 16, to reduce
   friction between curved end face 168 and second curved end face 184 during
   rotation, these two curved surfaces share a substantially corresponding
   geometry. At the tilt position of mechanism 26, a tilt swing lever longitudinal axis
10  186 is closely but not co-axially aligned with respect to a swing lever longitudinal
   axis 188 to prevent reaching a locking or over-center position of swing lever
   longitudinal axis 188.
           [0071]         Referring to Figure 18, mechanism 26 is also provided with
   a release capability such that if an object 190 is encountered by either the leg
15 rest member 24 or either of the first or second pantograph linkage sets 60, 62
   when the leg rest member 24 is returned in the leg rest retraction direction "D",
   swing link 78 will release from its contact position with first leg rest drive link 74.
   Drive rod 56 will continue its axial rotation with respect to a second drive rod
   rotation direction "R" together with first leg rest drive link 74 while swing link 78
20 rotatably separates with respect to contact flange 80 of first leg rest drive link 74.
   This permits the leg rest member 24 and each of the first and second
   pantograph linkage sets 60, 62 to remain substantially in the extended or
   partially extended position and in contact with the object 190 as the powered
   operation or rotation of drive rod 56 continues. After swing link 78 releases from
25 first leg rest drive link 74, only the biasing force of biasing member 82 acts to
   retract leg rest member 24.        This permits the subsequent lifting of leg rest
   member 24 by manual displacement in the leg rest extension direction "C" to
   remove object 190 although the first leg rest drive link 74 may have continued its
   further rotation due to rotation of drive rod 56.
30         [0072]         Referring to Figure 19, to provide for the release capability
   of leg rest member 24 with respect to first leg rest drive link 74, biasing member
   82 is provided with a biasing member first hook end 192 which is received in an
                                              el A

   elongated slot 194 created in swing link 78.         An opposite biasing member
   second hook end 196 is engaged in a link slot 198 created in first leg rest drive
   link 74. A biasing force of biasing member 82 acts in a biasing force direction
   "S".   With continuing reference to Figures 18 and 19, as the object 190 is
 5 encountered by leg rest member 24 or either of the first or second pantograph
   linkage sets 60, 62, a gap "T" is created between contact flange 80 and edge
   face 156 of swing link 78. The distance of gap "T" can vary with the amount of
   continued rotation of first leg rest drive link 74 in the second drive rod rotation
   direction "R".
10         [0073]        With continuing reference to Figure 18 and Figure 1,
   because axial rotation of drive rod 56 is controlled by the occupant of furniture
   member 10 using second actuator device 30, axial rotation of drive rod 56 can
   be stopped as soon as the occupant becomes aware of contact with the object
    190. Once the object 190 has been cleared, the first and second pantograph
15 linkage sets 60, 62 will return by gravity until the edge face 156 of swing link 78
   once again contacts contact flange 80 of first leg rest drive link 74. This contact
   will occur at the rotated position reached for first leg rest drive link 74. The leg
   rest member 24 can therefore return to its fully retracted or stowed position or be
   retained in a partially extended position depending on where the rotation of first
20 leg rest drive link 74 was stopped. According to several embodiments, biasing
   member 82 can be a compression spring made from spring steel having the
   biasing force predetermined to ensure the full return of leg rest member 24 to the
   fully stowed position should first leg rest drive link 74 be fully rotated to the
   position shown and described with reference to Figure 8.
25         [0074]        With continued reference to Figures 1-19, furniture member
   mechanism 26 for power combined and independent seat back and leg rest
   motion includes first actuator device 28 electrically operated to displace first and
   second seat back actuation links 35, 36 which are connected to and operate to
   rotate seat back member 16 between an upright position (Figure 2) and a fully
30 reclined position (Figure 3). Pantograph linkage set 60, 62 is connected to leg
   rest member 24.        The pantograph linkage set 60, 62 is at least partially
   supported in an extended position by rotational contact with support rod 64.

   Second actuator device 30 is identical to the first actuator device 28 and is
   electrically operated to axially rotate drive rod 56 connected to at least one leg
   rest drive link 74, 74'.      The leg rest drive link 74, 74' is connected to and
   displaces the pantograph linkage set 60, 62 between stowed (Figure 1) and
 5 extended (Figure 2) positions. The swing lever 134 is rotatably connected to the
   support rod 64 and rotated during operation of the second actuator device 30 to
   extend the pantograph linkage set 60, 62. The swing lever 134 in a fully rotated
   position displaces the support rod 64 thereby creating a furniture member tilt
   position (Figure 3).
10          [0075]          Mechanisms 26 of the present disclosure offer several
   advantages. By separating the action of rotating seat back member 16 from the
   action of extending leg rest member 24 through the use of independently
   operated first and second actuator devices 28, 30, seat back member 16 can be
   moved independently with respect to leg rest member 24. By further including a
15 tilt control for furniture member 10 with the second actuator device 30, automatic
   tilt is provided when leg rest member 24 is extended. The provision of first and
   second actuator devices 28, 30 with the added capability of furniture member 10
   to rock provides full rocking, seat back rotation, and independent leg rest
   extension operations in a single mechanism.
20          [0076]          Example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure
   will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope to those who are skilled in the
   art.    Numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific
   components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of
   embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those skilled in the
25 art that specific details need not be employed, that example embodiments may
   be embodied in many different forms and that neither should be construed to
   limit the scope of the disclosure.      In some example embodiments, well-known
   processes, well-known device structures, and well-known technologies are not
   described in detail.
30          [0077]          The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing
   particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used
   herein, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" may be intended to include the

   plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms
   "comprises," "comprising," "including," and "having," are inclusive and therefore
   specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements,
   and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more
 5 other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups
   thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not
   to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order
   discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance.
   It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed.
10          [0078]    When an element or layer is referred to as being "on," "engaged
   to," "connected to," or "coupled to" another element or layer, it may be directly
   on, engaged, connected or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening
   elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to
   as being "directly on," "directly engaged to," "directly connected to," or "directly
15 coupled to" another element or layer, there may be no intervening elements or
   layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements
   should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., "between" versus "directly between,"
   "adjacent" versus "directly adjacent," etc.). As used herein, the term "and/or"
   includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.
20          [0079]    Although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein
   to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections,
   these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be
   limited by these terms.      These terms may be only used to distinguish one
   element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or
25 section. Terms such as "first," "second," and other numerical terms when used
   herein do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context.
   Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could
   be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without
   departing from the teachings of the example embodiments.
30          [0080]    Spatially relative terms, such as "inner," "outer," "beneath,"
   "below," "lower," "above," "upper," and the like, may be used herein for ease of
   description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another
                                              -7

   element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Spatially relative terms may
   be intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation
   in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in
   the figures is turned over, elements described as "below" or "beneath" other
 5 elements or features would then be oriented "above" the other elements or
   features. Thus, the example term "below" can encompass both an orientation of
   above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or
   at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein
   interpreted accordingly.

   provided for purposes of illustration and description.      It is not intended to be
   exhaustive or to limit the disclosure.       Individual elements or features of a
   particular embodiment are generally not limited to that particular embodiment,
   but, where applicable, are interchangeable and can be used in a selected
15 embodiment, even if not specifically shown or described. The same may also be
   varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from
   the disclosure, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the
