This invention relates to antibodies or fragments thereof which interact with HER family
of receptors, e.g., HER3 receptor. In particular, it relates to antibodies or fragments thereof
that recognize a conformational epitope of HER3 receptor comprising residues from both
domains 2 and 4 resulting in inhibition of both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent
signal transduction; and allow ligand binding (e.g., neuregulin), whilst preventing ligand
induced activation of signal transduction. These antibodies or fragments can be used to
treat a number of diseases or disorders characterized by increased levels of HER3
expression (e.g., esophageal cancer). These antibodies or fragments can be used to treat a
number of diseases or disorders characterized by the antibodys or fragments ability to
decrease tissue weight (e.g., prostate or uterine weights) or to induce atrophy of tissue
(e.g., atrophy of male breast). Alternatively, these antibodies or fragments can be used to
treat a disorder characterized by increased levels of HER3 expression in an esophageal
tract, gastric cancer or head and neck cancer.

   Field of the Invention
                     This invention relates generally to antibodies or fragments thereof which interact with
   HER family of receptors, e.g., HER3 receptor. In particular, it relates to antibodies or
   fragments thereof that recognize a conformational epitope of HER3 receptor comprising
10 residues from both domains 2 and 4resulting in inhibition of both ligand-dependent and ligand
   independent signal transduction; and allow ligand binding (e.g., neuregulin), whilst preventing
   ligand-induced activation of signal transduction. These antibodies or fragments can be used to
   treat a number of diseases or disorders characterized by increased levels of HER3 expression
   (e.g., esophageal cancer). These antibodies or fragments can be used to treat a number of
15 diseases or disorders characterized by the antibodys or fragments ability to decrease tissue
   weight (e.g., prostate or uterine weights) or to induce atrophy of tissue (e.g., atrophy of male
   breast).
   Background of the Invention
                     The human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (ErbB3, also known as HER3) is a
20 receptor protein tyrosine kinase and belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
   subfamily of receptor protein tyrosine kinases, which also includes EGFR (HERI, ErbB 1),
   HER2 (ErbB2, Neu), and HER4 (ErbB4) (Plowman et al., (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.
   87:4905-4909; Kraus et al., (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:9193-9197; and Kraus et
   al., (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:2900-2904). Like the prototypical epidermal
25 growth factor receptor, the transmembrane receptor HER3 consists of an extracellular ligand
   binding domain (ECD), a dimerization domain within the ECD, a transmembrane domain, an
   intracellular protein tyrosine kinase-like domain (TKD) and a C-terminal phosphorylation
   domain. Unlike the other HER family members, the kinase domain of HER3 displays very low
   intrinsic kinase activity.
30                   The ligands neuregulin 1 (NRG) or neuregulin 2bind to the extracellular domain of
   HER3 and activate receptor-mediated signaling pathway by promoting dimerization with other
   dimerization partners such as HER2. Heterodimerization results in activation and
   transphosphorylation of HER3's intracellular domain and is a means not only for signal

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    2
   diversification but also signal amplification. In addition, HER3 heterodimerization can also
   occur in the absence of activating ligands and this is commonly termed ligand-independent
   HER3 activation. For example, when HER2 is expressed at high levels as a result of gene
   amplification (e.g. in breast, lung, ovarian or gastric cancer) spontaneous HER2/HER3 dimers
 5 can be formed. In this situation the HER2/HER3 is considered the most active ErbB signaling
   dimer and is therefore highly transforming.
   Increased HER3 has been found in several types of cancer such as breast, lung,
   gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers. Interestingly, a correlation between the expression of
 0 HER2/HER3 and the progression from a non-invasive to an invasive stage has been shown
   (Alimandi et al., (1995) Oncogene 10:1813-1821; DeFazio et al., (2000) Cancer 87:487-498;
   Naidu et al., (1988) Br. J. Cancer 78:1385-1390). Accordingly, agents that interfere with
   HER3 mediated signaling are needed.
   Summary of the Invention
 5 The invention is based on the discovery of antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies or
   fragments thereof) that bind to a conformational epitope of HER3 receptor comprising amino
   acid residues within domain 2 and domain 4 of HER3. This binding of the antibodies or
   fragments thereof with domain 2 and domain 4 stabilizes the HER3 receptor in an inactive or
   closed conformation such that HER3 activation is inhibited. Surprisingly, binding of the
 o antibodies or fragments thereof with this conformational epitope blocks both ligand
   dependent (e.g. neuregulin) and ligand-independent HER3 signaling pathways. Furthermore,
   antibody mediated inhibition of ligand induced signaling occurs without blocking ligand
   binding (i.e. both ligand and antibody can bind HER3) presumably because HER3 cannot
   undergo the conformational rearrangements required for activation. Also disclosed are
25 methods for using the antibodies or fragments thereof to treat a number of diseases or
   disorders characterized by increased expression of HER3; and disease or disorders
   characterized by the antibodies or fragments ability to decrease tissue weight (e.g., prostate or
   uterine weights) or to induce atrophy of tissue (e.g., atrophy of male breast).

   Definitions
   In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, certain terms are first
   defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed description.
25 The phrase "signal transduction" or "signaling activity" as used herein refers to a biochemical
   causal relationship generally initiated by a protein-protein interaction such as binding of a
   growth factor to a receptor, resulting in transmission of a signal from one portion of a cell to
   another portion of a cell. For HER3, the transmission involves specific phosphorylation of one

   or more tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues on one or more proteins in the series of
   reactions causing signal transduction. Penultimate processes typically include nuclear events,
   resulting in a change in gene expression.
   A "HER receptor" is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the HER receptor
 5 family and includes EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 receptors and other members of this
   family to be identified in the future. The HER receptor will generally comprise an
   extracellular domain, which may bind an HER ligand; a lipophilic transmembrane domain; a
   conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; and a carboxyl-terminal signaling domain
   harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. Preferably the HER receptor
 o is native sequence human HER receptor.
   The terms "HER1 ," "ErbB 1," "epidermal growth factor receptor" and "EGFR" are used
   interchangeably herein and refer to EGFR as disclosed, for example, in Carpenter et al. Ann.
   Rev. Biochem. 56:881-914 (1987), including naturally occurring mutant forms thereof (e.g. a
   deletion mutant EGFR as in Humphrey et al., (1990) PNAS (USA) 87:4207-4211). erbB1
 5 refers to the gene encoding the EGFR protein product.
   The terms "HER2" and "ErbB2" and are used interchangeably herein and refer to human
   HER2 protein described, for example, in Semba et al., (1985) PNAS (USA) 82:6497-6501
   and Yamamoto et al.(1986) Nature 319:230-234 (Genebank accession number X03363). The
 o term "erbB2" refers to the gene encoding human ErbB2 and "neu"refers to the-gene encoding
   rat p185neu
   The terms "HER4" and "ErbB4" herein refer to the receptor polypeptide as disclosed, for
   example, in EP Pat Appln No 599,274; Plowman et al., (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
   90:1746-1750; and Plowman et al., (1993) Nature, 366:473-475, including isoforms thereof,
25 e.g., as disclosed in W099/19488, published Apr. 22, 1999.
   The term "HER3" or "HER3 receptor" also known as "ErbB3" as used herein refers to
   mammalian HER3 protein and "her3" or "erbB3" refers to mammalian her3 gene. The
   preferred HER3 protein is human HER3 protein present in the cell membrane of a cell. The
   human her3 gene is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,480,968 and Plowman et al., (1990) Proc.
30 Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:4905-4909.

 5 these receptors is exposed to a HER ligand e.g., NRG, or when a HER receptor is active or
   overexpressed.
   The "HER2-HER3 protein complex" is a noncovalently associated oligomer containing HER2
   receptor and the HER3 receptor. This complex can form when a cell expressing both of these
   receptors is exposed to a HER3 ligand e.g., NRG or when HER2 is active/overexpressed
20 The phrase "HER3 activity" or "HER3 activation" as used herein refers to an increase in
   oligomerization (e.g. an increase in HER3 containing complexes), HER3 phosphorylation,
   conformational rearrangements (for example those induced by ligands), and HER3 mediated
   downstream signaling.
   The term "stabilization" or "stabilized" used in the context of HER3 refers to an antibody or
25 fragment thereof that directly maintains (locks, tethers, holds, preferentially binds, favors) the
   inactive state or conformation of HER3 without blocking ligand binding to HER3, such that
   ligand binding is no longer able to activate HER3. Assays described in the Examples can be
   used to measure ligand binding to a stabilized HER3 receptor, e.g., Biacore assay.
   The term "ligand-dependent signaling" as used herein refers to the activation of HER (e.g.,
30 HER3) via ligand. HER3 activation is evidenced by increased oligomerization (e.g.

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    10
   heterodimerization) and/ or HER3 phosphorylation such that downstream signaling pathways
   (e.g. P13K) are activated. The antibody or fragment thereof can statistically significantly
   reduce the amount of phosphorylated HER3 in a stimulated cell exposed to the antigen
   binding protein (e.g., an antibody) relative to an untreated (control) cell, as measured using
 5 the assays described in the Examples. The cell which expresses HER3 can be a naturally
   occurring cell line (e.g. MCF7) or can be recombinantly produced by introducing nucleic
   acids encoding HER3 protein into a host cell. Cell stimulation can occur either via the
   exogenous addition of an activating HER3 ligand or by the endogenous expression of an
   activating ligand.
 o The antibody or fragment thereof which "reduces neregulin-induced HER3 activation in a
   cell" is one which statistically significantly reduces HER3 tyrosine phosphorylation relative to
   an untreated (control) cell, as measured using the assays described in the Examples. This can
   be determined based on HER3 phosphotyrosine levels following exposure of HER3 to NRG
   and the antibody of interest. The cell which expresses HER3 protein can be a naturally
 5 occurring cell or cell line (e.g. MCF7) or can be recombinantly produced.
   The term "ligand-independent signaling" as used herein refers to cellular HER3 activity (e.g
   phosphorylation) in the absence of a requirement for ligand binding. For example, ligand
   independent HER3 activation can be a result of HER2 overexpression or activating mutations
   in HER3 heterodimer partners such as EGFR and HER2. The antibody or fragment thereof
 0 can statistically significantly reduce the amount of phosphorylated HER3 in a cell exposed to
   the antigen binding protein (e.g., an antibody) relative to an untreated (control) cell. The cell
   which expresses HER3 can be a naturally occurring cell line (e.g. SK-Br-3) or can be
   recombinantly produced by introducing nucleic acids encoding HER3 protein into a host cell.
   The term "blocks" as used herein refers to stopping or preventing an interaction or a process,
25 e.g., stopping ligand-dependent or ligand-independent signaling.
   The term "recognize" as used herein refers to an antibody or fragment thereof that finds and
   interacts (e.g., binds) with its conformational epitope.
   The phrase "concurrently binds" as used herein refers to a HER ligand that can bind to a
   ligand binding site on the HER receptor along with the HER antibody. This means that both
30 the antibody and antibody can bind to the HER receptor together. For the sake of illustration
   only, the HER3 ligand NRG, can bind to the HER3 receptor along with the HER3 antibody.

       WO 2013/084147                                                            PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   11
   Assay to measure concurrent binding of the ligand and antibody are described in the
   Examples section (e.g., Biacore).
   The term "fails" as used herein refers to an antibody or fragment thereof that does not do a
   particular event. For example, an antibody or fragment thereof that "fails to activate signal
 5 transduction" is one that does not trigger signal transduction; an antibody or fragment thereof
   that "fails to induce a conformational change" is one that does not cause a structural alteration
   in the HER receptor; an antibody or fragment thereof that stabilizes the HER receptor in an
   inactive state such that the HER receptor "fails to dimerize" is one that does not form protein
   protein complexes.
 o The term "antibody" as used herein refers to whole antibodies that interact with (e.g., by
   binding, steric hindrance, stabilizing/destabilizing, spatial distribution) an HER3 epitope and
   inhibit signal transduction. A naturally occurring "antibody" is a glycoprotein comprising at
   least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each
   heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a
 5 heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains,
   CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region
   (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region
   is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into
   regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed
 o with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is
   composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in
   the following order: FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the
   heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant
   regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or
25 factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first
   component (Clq) of the classical complement system. The term "antibody" includes for
   example, monoclonal antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, camelised
   antibodies, chimeric antibodies, single-chain Fvs (scFv), disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), Fab
   fragments, F (ab') fragments, and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id
30 antibodies to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above.
   The antibodies can be of any isotype (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g.,
   IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2) or subclass.

       WO 2013/084147                                                              PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                     12
   Both the light and heavy chains are divided into regions of structural and functional
   homology. The terms "constant" and "variable" are used functionally. In this regard, it will be
   appreciated that the variable domains of both the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chain portions
   determine antigen recognition and specificity. Conversely, the constant domains of the light
 5 chain (CL) and the heavy chain (CHI, CH2 or CH3) confer important biological properties
   such as secretion, transplacental mobility, Fc receptor binding, complement binding, and the
   like. By convention the numbering of the constant region domains increases as they become
   more distal from the antigen binding site or amino-terminus of the antibody. The N-terminus
   is a variable region and at the C-terminus is a constant region; the CH3 and CL domains
 o actually comprise the carboxy-terminus of the heavy and light chain, respectively.
   The phrase "antibody fragment", as used herein, refers to one or more portions of an antibody
   that retain the ability to specifically interact with (e.g., by binding, steric hindrance,
   stabilizing/destabilizing, spatial distribution) an HER3 epitope and inhibit signal transduction.
   Examples of binding fragments include, but are not limited to, a Fab fragment, a monovalent
 5 fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHI domains; a F(ab) 2 fragment, a bivalent
   fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd
   fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains; a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH
   domains of a single arm of an antibody; a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544
   546), which consists of a VH domain; and an isolated complementarity determining region
 o (CDR).
   Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by
   separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that
   enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to
   form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al., (1988)
25 Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al., (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:5879-5883). Such
   single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term "antibody
   fragment". These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to
   those of skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are
   intact antibodies.
30 Antibody fragments can also be incorporated into single domain antibodies, maxibodies,
   minibodies, intrabodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, v-NAR and bis-scFv (see, e.g.,
   Hollinger and Hudson, (2005) Nature Biotechnology 23:1126-1136). Antibody fragments can

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    13
   be grafted into scaffolds based on polypeptides such as Fibronectin type III (Fn3) (see U.S.
   Pat. No. 6,703,199, which describes fibronectin polypeptide monobodies).
   Antibody fragments can be incorporated into single chain molecules comprising a pair of
   tandem Fv segments (VH-CH1-VH-CH1) which, together with complementary light chain
 5 polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions (Zapata et al., (1995) Protein Eng.
   8:1057-1062; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870).
   The term "epitope" includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an
   immunoglobulin or otherwise interacting with a molecule. Epitopic determinants generally
   consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or
 o carbohydrate or sugar side chains and can have specific three-dimensional structural
   characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An epitope may be "linear" or
   "conformational."
   The term "linear epitope" refers to an epitope with all of the points of interaction between the
   protein and the interacting molecule (such as an antibody) occur linearally along the primary
 5 amino acid sequence of the protein (continuous). Once a desired epitope on an antigen is
   determined, it is possible to generate antibodies to that epitope, e.g., using the techniques
   described in the present invention. Alternatively, during the discovery process, the generation
   and characterization of antibodies may elucidate information about desirable epitopes. From
   this information, it is then possible to competitively screen antibodies for binding to the same
 o epitope. An approach to achieve this is to conduct cross-competition studies to find antibodies
   that competitively bind with one another, e.g., the antibodies compete for binding to the
   antigen. A high throughput process for "binning" antibodies based upon their cross
   competition is described in International Patent Application No. WO 2003/48731. As will be
   appreciated by one of skill in the art, practically anything to which an antibody can
25 specifically bind could be an epitope. An epitope can comprises those residues to which the
   antibody binds.
   The term "conformational epitope" refers to an epitope in which discontinuous amino acids
   that come together in three dimensional conformation. In a conformational epitope, the points
   of interaction occur across amino acid residues on the protein that are separated from one
30 another. In one embodiment, the epitope is that described in Examples of this specification.
   In one embodiment, the conformational epitope is defined by (i) HER3 amino acid residues
   265-277 and 315 (of domain 2) and (ii) HER3 amino acid residues 571, 582-584, 596-597,

        WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    14
   600-602, 609-615 (of domain 4) of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a subset thereof. As will be appreciated
   by one of skill in the art, the space that is occupied by a residue or side chain that creates the
   shape of a molecule helps to determine what an epitope is.
   Generally, antibodies specific for a particular target antigen will preferentially recognize an
 5 epitope on the target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules.
   Regions of a given polypeptide that include an epitope can be identified using any number of
   epitope mapping techniques, well known in the art. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols in
   Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66 (Glenn E.Morris, Ed., 1996) Humana Press, Totowa,
   New Jersey. For example, linear epitopes may be determined by e.g., concurrently
 0 synthesizing large numbers of peptides on solid supports, the peptides corresponding to
   portions of the protein molecule, and reacting the peptides with antibodies while the peptides
   are still attached to the supports. Such techniques are known in the art and described in, e.g.,
   U.S. Patent No. 4,708,871 ; Geysen et al., (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 8:3998-4002;
   Geysen et al., (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:78-182; Geysen et al., (1986) Mol.
 5 Immunol. 23:709-715. Similarly, conformational epitopes are readily identified by
   determining spatial conformation of amino acids such as by, e.g., hydrogen/deuterium
   exchange, x-ray crystallography and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. See, e.g.,
   Epitope Mapping Protocols, supra. Antigenic regions of proteins can also be identified using
   standard antigenicity and hydropathy plots, such as those calculated using, e.g., the Omiga
 o version 1.0 software program available from the Oxford Molecular Group. This computer
   program employs the Hopp/Woods method, Hopp et al., (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA
   78:3824-3828; for determining antigenicity profiles, and the Kyte-Doolittle technique, Kyte et
   al., (1982) J.MoI. Biol. 157:105-132; for hydropathy plots.
   The term "paratope" as used herein refers to the general structure of a binding region that
25 determines binding to an epitope. This structure influences whether or not and in what manner
   the binding region might bind to an epitope. Paratope can refer to an antigenic site of an
   antibody that is responsible for an antibody or fragment thereof, to bind to an antigenic
   determinant. Paratope also refers to the idiotope of the antibody, and the complementary
   determining region (CDR) region that binds to the epitope. In one embodiment, the paratope
30 is the region of the antibody that binds to the conformational epitope comprising (i) HER3
   amino acid residues 265-277 and 315 (of domain 2), and (ii) HER3 amino acid residues 571,
   582-584, 596-597, 600-602, 609-615 (of domain 4) of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a subset thereof. In

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                  15
   one embodiment, the paratope is the region of the antibody that comprises the CDR
   sequences. In one embodiment, the paratope comprises the sequences listed in Table 1. In one
   embodiment, the paratope comprises at least one amino acid residue that binds with HER3
   residues: Asn266, Lys267, Leu268, Thr269, Gln271, Glu273, Pro274, Asn275, Pro276,
 5 His277, Asn315, Asp571, Pro583, His584, Ala596, Lys597. In one embodiment, the paratope
   comprises at least one amino acid residue that binds with HER3 residues: Tyr265, Lys267,
   Leu268, Phe270, Gly582, Pro583, Lys597, Ile600, Lys602, Glu609, Arg6l 1, Pro612, Cys613,
   His614, Glu615. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the paratope of any
   antibody, or variant thereof, can be determined in the manner set forth by the present
 o application.
   The phrases "monoclonal antibody" or "monoclonal antibody composition" as used herein
   refers to polypeptides, including antibodies, antibody fragments, bispecific antibodies, etc.
   that have substantially identical to amino acid sequence or are derived from the same genetic
   source. This term also includes preparations of antibody molecules of single molecular
 5 composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and
   affinity for a particular epitope.
   The phrase "human antibody", as used herein, includes antibodies having variable regions in
   which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from sequences of human origin.
   Furthermore, if the antibody contains a constant region, the constant region also is derived
 o from such human sequences, e.g., human germline sequences, or mutated versions of human
   germline sequences or antibody containing consensus framework sequences derived from
   human framework sequences analysis, for example, as described in Knappik et al., (2000) J
   Mol Biol 296:57-86). The structures and locations of immunoglobulin variable domains, e.g.,
   CDRs, may be defined using well known numbering schemes, e.g., the Kabat numbering
25 scheme, the Chothia numbering scheme, or a combination of Kabat and Chothia (see, e.g.,
   Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Health and Human

   The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by
   human sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro
   or by somatic mutation in vivo, or a conservative substitution to promote stability or
   manufacturing).
 5 The phrase "human monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to antibodies displaying a
   single binding specificity which have variable regions in which both the framework and CDR
   regions are derived from human sequences. In one embodiment, the human monoclonal
   antibodies are produced by a hybridoma which includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic
   nonhuman animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy
 o chain transgene and a light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell.
   The phrase "recombinant human antibody", as used herein, includes all human antibodies that
   are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies isolated
   from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic or transchromosomal for human
   immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma prepared therefrom, antibodies isolated from a host
 5 cell transformed to express the human antibody, e.g., from a transfectoma, antibodies isolated
   from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library, and antibodies prepared,
   expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of all or a portion of a
   human immunoglobulin gene, sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human
   antibodies have variable regions in which the framework and CDR regions are derived from
 o human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such
   recombinant human antibodies can be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal
   transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino
   acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that,
   while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally
25 exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.

   The phrase "specifically (or selectively) binds" to an antibody (e.g., a HER3 binding
   antibody) refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of a cognate
   antigen (e.g., a human HER3) in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics.

   herein, refers to the association rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, whereas the
 o term "Kdis" or "Kd," as used herein, refers to the dissociation rate of a particular antibody
   antigen interaction. The term "KD", as used herein, refers to the dissociation constant, which
   is obtained from the ratio of Kd to Ka (i.e. Kd/Ka) and is expressed as a molar concentration
   (M). KD values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. A
   method for determining the KD of an antibody is by using surface plasmon resonance, or using
25 a biosensor system such as a Biacore* system.
   The term "affinity" as used herein refers to the strength of interaction between antibody and
   antigen at single antigenic sites. Within each antigenic site, the variable region of the antibody
   "arm" interacts through weak non-covalent forces with antigen at numerous sites; the more
   interactions, the stronger the affinity.
30 The term "avidity" as used herein refers to an informative measure of the overall stability or
   strength of the antibody-antigen complex. It is controlled by three major factors: antibody
   epitope affinity; the valence of both the antigen and antibody; and the structural arrangement

        WO 2013/084147                                                            PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    18
   of the interacting parts. Ultimately these factors define the specificity of the antibody, that is,
   the likelihood that the particular antibody is binding to a precise antigen epitope.
   The term "valency" as used herein refers to the number of potential target binding sites in a
   polypeptide. Each target binding site specifically binds one target molecule or specific site
 5 (i.e, epitope) on a target molecule. When a polypeptide comprises more than one target
   binding site, each target binding site may specifically bind the same or different molecules
   (e.g., may bind to different molecules, e.g., different antigens, or different epitopes on the
   same molecule).
   The phrase "antagonist antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody that binds with HER3
 o and neutralizes the biological activity of HER3 signaling, e.g., reduces, decreases and/or
   inhibits HER3 induced signaling activity, e.g., in a phospho-HER3 or phospho-Akt assay.
   Examples of assays are described in more details in the examples below. Accordingly, an
   antibody that "inhibits" one or more of these HER3 functional properties (e.g., biochemical,
   immunochemical, cellular, physiological or other biological activities, or the like) as
 5 determined according to methodologies known to the art and described herein, will be
   understood to relate to a statistically significant decrease in the particular activity relative to
   that seen in the absence of the antibody (e.g., or when a control antibody of irrelevant
   specificity is present). An antibody that inhibits HER3 activity effects such a statistically
   significant decrease by at least 10% of the measured parameter, by at least 50%, 80% or 90%,
 o and in certain embodiments an antibody of the invention may inhibit greater than 95%, 98%
   or 99% of HER3 functional activity as evidenced by a reduction in the level of cellular HER3
   phosphorylation.
   The phrase "isolated antibody" refers to an antibody that is substantially free of other
   antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically
25 binds HER3 is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than
   HER3). An isolated antibody that specifically binds HER3 may, however, have cross
   reactivity to other antigens. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other
   cellular material and/or chemicals.
   The phrase "conservatively modified variant" applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid
30 sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified
   variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino
   acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   19
   essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large
   number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the
   codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every
   position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the
 5 corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid
   variations are "silent variations," which are one species of conservatively modified variations.
   Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible
   silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic
   acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is
 o ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical
   molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide is
   implicit in each described sequence.
   For polypeptide sequences, "conservatively modified variants" include individual
   substitutions, deletions or additions to a polypeptide sequence which result in the substitution
 5 of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables
   providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively
   modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies
   homologs, and alleles of the invention. The following eight groups contain amino acids that
   are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G); 2) Aspartic acid
 o (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5)
   Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y),
   Tryptophan (W); 7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and 8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) (see,
   e.g., Creighton, Proteins (1984)). In some embodiments, the term "conservative sequence
   modifications" are used to refer to amino acid modifications that do not significantly affect or
25 alter the binding characteristics of the antibody containing the amino acid sequence.
   The terms "cross-compete" and "cross-competing" are used interchangeably herein to mean
   the ability of an antibody or other binding agent to interfere with the binding of other
   antibodies or binding agents to HER3 in a standard competitive binding assay.
   The ability or extent to which an antibody or other binding agent is able to interfere with the
30 binding of another antibody or binding molecule to HER3 , and therefore whether it can be
   said to cross-compete according to the invention, can be determined using standard
   competition binding assays. One suitable assay involves the use of the Biacore technology
   (e.g. by using the BlAcore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden)), which can measure

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   20
   the extent of interactions using surface plasmon resonance technology. Another assay for
   measuring cross-competing uses an ELISA-based approach.
   The term "optimized" as used herein refers to a nucleotide sequence has been altered to
   encode an amino acid sequence using codons that are preferred in the production cell or
 5 organism, generally a eukaryotic cell, for example, a cell of Pichia,a cell of Trichoderma, a
   Chinese Hamster Ovary cell (CHO) or a human cell. The optimized nucleotide sequence is
   engineered to retain completely or as much as possible the amino acid sequence originally
   encoded by the starting nucleotide sequence, which is also known as the "parental" sequence.
   Standard assays to evaluate the binding ability of the antibodies toward HER3 of various
 o species are known in the art, including for example, ELISAs, western blots and RIAs. Suitable
   assays are described in detail in the Examples. The binding kinetics (e.g., binding affinity) of
   the antibodies also can be assessed by standard assays known in the art, such as by Biacore
   analysis, or FACS relative affinity (Scatchard). Assays to evaluate the effects of the antibodies
   on functional properties of HER3 (e.g., receptor binding assays, modulating the Her pathway)
 5 are described in further detail in the Examples.
   The phrases "percent identical" or "percent identity," in the context of two or more nucleic
   acids or polypeptide sequences, refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the
   same. Two sequences are "substantially identical" if two sequences have a specified
   percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (i.e., 60% identity,
 o optionally 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% identity over a specified region, or,
   when not specified, over the entire sequence), when compared and aligned for maximum
   correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of
   the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection.
   Optionally, the identity exists over a region that is at least about 50 nucleotides (or 10 amino
25 acids) in length, or more preferably over a region that is 100 to 500 or 1000 or more
   nucleotides (or 20, 50, 200 or more amino acids) in length.
   For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test
   sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference
   sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary,
30 and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can
   be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    21
   then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference
   sequence, based on the program parameters.
   A "comparison window", as used herein, includes reference to a segment of any one of the
   number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600, usually
 5 about 50 to about 200, more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be
   compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two
   sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well
   known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by
   the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, (1970) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482c, by
 0 the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443,
   by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, (1988) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci.
   USA 85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT,
   FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer
   Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see,
 5 e.g., Brent et al., (2003) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology).
   Two examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and
   sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in
   Altschul et al., (1977) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402; and Altschul et al., (1990) J. Mol. Biol.
   215:403-410, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available
 o through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first
   identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the
   query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when
   aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the
   neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word
25 hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits
   are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment
   score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the
   parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always > 0) and N (penalty score
   for mismatching residues; always < 0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to
30 calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when:
   the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value;
   the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative
   scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   22
   parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN
   program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation
   (E) or 10, M=5, N=-4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the
   BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the
 5 BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff, (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
   89:10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=-4, and a comparison of both
   strands.
   The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two
   sequences (see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul, (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787).
 o One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability
   (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two
   nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is
   considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of
   the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less
 5 than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.
   The percent identity between two amino acid sequences can also be determined using the
   algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller, (1988) Comput. Appl. Biosci. 4:11-17) which has been
   incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM 120 weight residue table, a
   gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percent identity between two
 o amino acid sequences can be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol.
   Biol. 48:444-453) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG
   software package (available at www.gcg.com), using either a Blossom 62 matrix or a
   PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3,
   4, 5, or 6.
25 Other than percentage of sequence identity noted above, another indication that two nucleic
   acid sequences or polypeptides are substantially identical is that the polypeptide encoded by
   the first nucleic acid is immunologically cross reactive with the antibodies raised against the
   polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic acid, as described below. Thus, a polypeptide is
   typically substantially identical to a second polypeptide, for example, where the two peptides
30 differ only by conservative substitutions. Another indication that two nucleic acid sequences
   are substantially identical is that the two molecules or their complements hybridize to each
   other under stringent conditions, as described below. Yet another indication that two nucleic

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   23
   acid sequences are substantially identical is that the same primers can be used to amplify the
   sequence.
   The phrase "nucleic acid" is used herein interchangeably with the term "polynucleotide" and
   refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or
 5 double-stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide
   analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring,
   and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic
   acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples
   of such analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl
 o phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-0-methyl ribonucleotides, peptide-nucleic acids
   (PNAs).
   Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses
   conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and
   complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, as
 5 detailed below, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in
   which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base
   and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., (1991) Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081; Ohtsuka et al.,
   (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608; and Rossolini et al., (1994) Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98).
   The phrase "operably linked" refers to a functional relationship between two or more
 o polynucleotide (e.g., DNA) segments. Typically, it refers to the functional relationship of a
   transcriptional regulatory sequence to a transcribed sequence. For example, a promoter or
   enhancer sequence is operably linked to a coding sequence if it stimulates or modulates the
   transcription of the coding sequence in an appropriate host cell or other expression system.
   Generally, promoter transcriptional regulatory sequences that are operably linked to a
25 transcribed sequence are physically contiguous to the transcribed sequence, i.e., they are cis
   acting. However, some transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as enhancers, need not be
   physically contiguous or located in close proximity to the coding sequences whose
   transcription they enhance.
   The terms "polypeptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer
30 of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino
   acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino
   acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   24
   acid polymer. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular polypeptide sequence also implicitly
   encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof.
   The term "subject" includes human and non-human animals. Non-human animals include all
   vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non-mammals, such as non-human primates, sheep, dog, cow,
 5 chickens, amphibians, and reptiles. Except when noted, the terms "patient" or "subject" are
   used herein interchangeably.
   The term "anti-cancer agent" means any agent that can be used to treat a cell proliferative
   disorder such as cancer, including cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic agents, radiotherapy
   and radiotherapeutic agents, targeted anti-cancer agents, and immunotherapeutic agents.
 0 "Tumor" refers to neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and
   all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues.
   The term "anti-tumor activity" means a reduction in the rate of tumor cell proliferation,
   viability, or metastatic activity. A possible way of showing anti-tumor activity is show a
   decline in growth rate of abnormal cells that arises during therapy or tumor size stability or
 5 reduction. Such activity can be assessed using accepted in vitro or in vivo tumor models,
   including but not limited to xenograft models, allograft models, MMTV models, and other
   known models known in the art to investigate anti-tumor activity.
   The term "malignancy" refers to a non-benign tumor or a cancer. As used herein, the term
   "cancer" includes a malignancy characterized by deregulated or uncontrolled cell growth.
20 Exemplary cancers include: carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, and lymphomas. The term
   "cancer" includes primary malignant tumors (e.g., those whose cells have not migrated to sites
   in the subject's body other than the site of the original tumor) and secondary malignant tumors
   (e.g., those arising from metastasis, the migration of tumor cells to secondary sites that are
   different from the site of the original tumor).
25 Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following sections and
   subsections.
   Structure and Mechanism of Activation of the HER Receptors
   All four HER receptors have an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single trans-membrane
   domain and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase-containing domain. The intracellular tyrosine
30 kinase domain of HER receptors is highly conserved, although the kinase domain of HER3
   contains substitutions of critical amino acids and therefore lacks kinase activity (Guy et al.,

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   25
   (1994): PNAS 91, 8132-8136). Ligand-induced dimerisation of the HER receptors induces
   activation of the kinase, receptor transphosphorylation on tyrosine residues in the C-terminal
   tail, followed by recruitment and activation of intracellular signalling effectors (Yarden and
   Sliwkowski, (2001) Nature Rev 2, 127-137; Jorissen et al., (2003) Exp Cell Res 284, 31-53.
 5
   The crystal structures of the extracellular domains of HERs have provided some insight into
   the process of ligand-induced receptor activation (Schlessinger, (2002) Cell 110, 669-672).
   The extracellular domain of each HER receptor consists of four subdomains: Subdomain I and
   III cooperate in forming the ligand-binding site, whereas subdomain II (and perhaps also
 o subdomain IV) participates in receptor dimerisation via direct receptor-receptor interactions.
   In the structures of ligand-bound HERI, a 0 hairpin (termed the dimerisation loop) in
   subdomain II interacts with the dimerisation loop of the partner receptor, mediating receptor
   dimerisation (Garrett et al, (2002) Cell 110, 763-773; Ogiso et al., (2002) Cell 110, 775-787).
   In contrast, in the structures of the inactive HER1, HER3 and HER4, the dimerisation loop is
 5 engaged in intramolecular interactions with subdomain IV, which prevents receptor
   dimerisation in the absence of ligand (Cho and Leahy, (2002) Science 297, 1330-1333;
   Ferguson et al., (2003) Mol Cell 12, 541-552; Bouyan et al., (2005) PNAS102, 15024-15029).
   The structure of HER2 is unique among the HERs. In the absence of a ligand, HER2 has a
   conformation that resembles the ligand-activated state of HERI with a protruding
 0 dimerisation loop, available to interact with other HER receptors (Cho et al., (2003) Nature
   421, 756-760; Garrett et al., (2003) Mol Cell 11, 495-505). This may explain the enhanced
   heterodimerisation capacity of HER2.
   Although the HER receptor crystal structures provide a model for HER receptor homo- and
25 heterodimerisation, the background for the prevalence of some HER homo- and heterodimers
   over others (Franklin et al., (2004) Cancer Cell 5, 317-328) as well as the conformational role
   of each of the domain in receptor dimerisation and autoinhibition (Burgess et al., (2003) Mol
   Cell 12, 541-552; Mattoon et al., (2004) PNAS101, 923-928) remains somewhat unclear. As
   described below, the HER3 X-ray crystal structure provides more insights.
30 HER3 Structure and Conformational Epitopes
   A conformational epitope to which antigen binding proteins, e.g., anti-HER3 antibodies bind
   is provided herein. For the first time, the three dimensional structure of a truncated form
   (residues 20-640) of the extracellular domain of HER3 complexed with an antibody have been
   shown. The HER3-MOR09823 Fab complex and the HER3-MOR09825 have been

       WO 2013/084147                                                             PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    26
   determined at 3.2A and 3.4 A resolution, respectively, and shown in Figure 5A. The
   disclosure herein also shows for the first time an antibody or fragment thereof that binds to an
   inactive state of HER3 and stabilizes the receptor in the inactive state. The antibodies of the
   invention also permit concurrent binding of a HER3 ligand, such as neuregulin with the HER3
 5 receptor.
   Although not bound to provide a theory, one possible model for the mechanism of action is
   that HER3 typically exists in an inactive (closed, tethered) or active (open) state. Ligand
   binding induces a conformational change such that HER3 exists in the active (open) state
   which is capable of binding heterodimer partners resulting in activation in downstream
 o signaling. Antibodies such as MOR09823 bind the inactive (tethered) state of HER3 but do
   not block the ligand binding site. Antibodies such as MOR09823 inhibit HER3 by preventing
   the ligand induced structural rearrangements required for HER3 to transition to the active
   conformation, thereby preventing signal transduction. In one embodiment, the antibodies of
   the invention or fragments thereof bind the inactive (tethered) state of HER3 but do not block
 5 the ligand binding site. In another embodiment, the antibodies or fragments thereof inhibit
   HER3 by preventing the ligand-induced structural rearrangements required for HER3 to
   transition to the active conformation, thereby preventing signal transduction. In another
   embodiment, the antibody or fragment thereof stabilizes (directly maintains, locks, tethers,
   holds, preferentially binds, or favors) HER3 receptor in the inactive state or conformation. In
 o one embodiment, the inactive HER3 receptor may be susceptible to preferential
   internalization or degradation such that it leads to loss of cell surface HER3 receptors. The
   biological data presented in the Examples section supports these embodiments.
   The crystals of HER3 may be prepared by expressing a nucleotide sequence encoding HER3
   or a variant thereof in a suitable host cell, and then crystallising the purified protein(s) in the
25 presence of the relevant HER3 targeted Fab. Preferably the HER3 polypeptide contains the
   extracellular domain (amino acids 20 to 640 of the human polypeptide or a truncated version
   thereof, preferably comprising amino acids 20-640) but lacks the transmembrane and
   intracellular domains.
   HER3 polypeptides may also be produced as fusion proteins, for example to aid in extraction
30 and purification. Examples of fusion protein partners include glutathione-S-transferase (GST),
   histidine (HIS), hexahistidine (6HIS), GAL4 (DNA binding and/or transcriptional activation
   domains) and beta-galactosidase. It may also be convenient to include a proteolytic cleavage
   site between the fusion protein partner and the protein sequence of interest to allow removal

        WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   27
   of fusion protein sequences.
   After expression, the proteins may be purified and/or concentrated, for example by
   immobilised metal affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and/or gel
 5 filtration.
   The protein(s) may be crystallised using techniques described herein. Commonly, in a
   crystallisation process, a drop containing the protein solution is mixed with the crystallisation
   buffer and allowed to equilibrate in a sealed container. Equilibration may be achieved by
 o known techniques such as the "hanging drop" or the "sitting drop" method. In these methods,
   the drop is hung above or sitting beside a much larger reservoir of crystallization buffer and
   equilibration is reached through vapor diffusion. Alternatively, equilibration may occur by
   other methods, for example under oil, through a semi-permeable membrane, or by free
   interface diffusion (See e.g., Chayen et al., (2008) Nature Methods 5, 147 - 153.
 5
   Once the crystals have been obtained, the structure may be solved by known X-ray diffraction
   techniques. Many techniques use chemically modified crystals, such as those modified by
   heavy atom derivatization to approximate phases. In practice, a crystal is soaked in a solution
   containing heavy metal atom salts, or organometallic compounds, e.g., lead chloride, gold
 o thiomalate, thimerosal or uranyl acetate, which can diffuse through the crystal and bind to the
   surface of the protein. The location(s) of the bound heavy metal atom(s) can then be
   determined by X-ray diffraction analysis of the soaked crystal. The patterns obtained on
   diffraction of a monochromatic beam of X-rays by the atoms (scattering centres) of the crystal
   can be solved by mathematical equations to give mathematical coordinates. The diffraction
25 data are used to calculate an electron density map of the repeating unit of the crystal. Another
   method of obtaining phase information is using a technique known as molecular replacement.
   In this method, rotational and translational alogrithms are applied to a search model derived
   from a related structure, resulting in an approximate orientation for the protein of interest (See
   Rossmann, (1990) Acta Crystals A 46, 73-82). The electron density maps are used to establish
30 the positions of the individual atoms within the unit cell of the crystal (Blundel et al., (1976)
   Protein Crystallography, Academic Press).
   The present disclosure describes for the first time, the three-dimensional structure of HER3
   and a Fab of an anti-HER3 antibody. The approximate domain boundaries of extracellular

        WO 2013/084147                                                         PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    28
   domain of HER3 are as follows; domain 1: amino acids 20-207; domain 2: amino acids 208
   328; domain 3: amino acids 329-498; and domain 4: amino acids 499-642. The three
   dimensional structure of HER3 and the antibody also allows the identification of target
   binding sites for potential HER3 modulators. Preferred target binding sites are those involved
 5 in the activation of HER3. In one embodiment, the target binding site is located within
   domain 2 and domain 4 of HER3. Thus an antibody or fragment thereof which binds to either
   domain 2 or domain 4, and preferably to both domains can modulate HER3 activation by
   either preventing the domains from dissociation from each other or by modifying the relative
   positions of the domains. Thus binding an antibody or fragment thereof to amino acid residues
 o within domain 2 or domain 4 may cause the protein to adopt a conformation that prevents
   activation. The disclosure herein also shows for the first time an antibody or fragment thereof
   that can concurrently bind with a HER3 ligand, such as neuregulin.
   In some embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof recognize a specific conformational
   state of HER3 such that the antibody or fragment thereof prevents HER3 from interacting
 5 with a co-receptor (including, but not limited to, HER1, HER2 and HER4). In some
   embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof prevents HER3 from interacting with a co
   receptor by stabilizing the HER3 receptor in an inactive or closed state. In one embodiment,
   the antibody or fragment thereof stabilizes the HER3 receptor by binding to amino acid
   residues within domain 2 and domain 4 of HER3. In this inactive state, the dimerization loop
 o located within domain 2 is not exposed and therefore unavailable for dimerization with other
   co-receptors (including, but not limited to, HERI, HER2 and HER4). In some embodiments,
   the antibody or fragment thereof binds to human HER3 protein having a conformational
   epitope comprising (i) HER3 amino acid residues 265-277 and 315 (of domain 2) and (ii)
   HER3 amino acid residues 571, 582-584, 596-597, 600-602, 609-615 (of domain 4) of SEQ
25 ID NO: 1, or a subset thereof. In some embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof binds
   to amino acids within or overlapping amino acid residues 265-277 and 315 (of domain 2) and
   (ii) HER3 amino acid residues 571, 582-584, 596-597, 600-602, 609-615 (of domain 4) of
   SEQ ID NO: 1. In some embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof binds to amino acids
   within (and/or amino acid sequences consisting of) amino acids 265-277 and 315 (of domain
30 2) and (ii) HER3 amino acid residues 571, 582-584, 596-597, 600-602, 609-615 (of domain 4)
   of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a subset thereof. In some embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof
   binds to the conformational epitope such that it restricts the mobility of domain 2 and domain
   4, stabilizing it in an inactive or closed conformation. The failure to form the active
   conformation results in failure to activate signal transduction. In some embodiments, the

       WO 2013/084147                                                            PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   29
   antibody or fragment thereof binds to the conformational epitope such that it occludes the
   dimerization loop within domain 2, thereby rendering it unavailable for receptor-receptor
   interaction. The failure to form homo- or heterodimers results in failure to activate signal
   transduction.
 5 In another aspect, the antibody or fragment thereof binds a conformational epitope of HER
   receptor, such as a HER3 receptor. In one embodiment, the antibody or fragment thereof
   stabilizes the HER3 receptor in the inactive state. In another embodiment, the antibody or
   fragment thereof binds to the active state of the HER3 receptor and drives it into the inactive
   state as the inactive state. Thus, the antibody or fragment thereof can bind to either the active
 o or inactive state of HER3, but favors the formation of the inactive state and drives the active
   state of HER3 into the inactive state, resulting in a failure to activate signal transduction.
   In another aspect, the antibody or fragment thereof binds a conformational epitope of HER
   receptor, such as a HER3 receptor where binding of the antibody or fragment thereof
   stabilizes the HER3 receptor in an inactive state such that the HER3 receptor fails to dimerize
 5 with a co-receptor to form a receptor-receptor complex. The failure to form a receptor
   receptor complex prevents activation of both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent signal
   transduction.
   In another aspect, the antibody or fragment thereof binds a conformational epitope of HER
   receptor such as a HER3 receptor, where binding of the antibody or fragment thereof to the
 o HER3 receptor allows dimerization with a co-receptor to form an inactive receptor-receptor
   complex. The formation of the inactive receptor-receptor complex prevents activation of
   ligand-independent signal transduction. For example, in ligand-independent signal
   transduction, HER3 may exists in an inactive state, however the overexpression of HER2
   causes HER2-HER3 complex formation, however these resulting complexes are inactive and
25 prevent activation of ligand-independent signal transduction.
   The depicted structure also allows one to identify specific core HER3 amino acid residues for
   the interaction interface of an antibody or fragment thereof (e.g., MOR09823) with HER3.
   This was defined as residues that are within 5A of the MOR09823 protein VH chain. The core
   residues are as follows: Asn266, Lys267, Leu268, Thr269, Gln271, Glu273, Pro274, Asn275,
30 Pro276, His277, Asn315, Asp571, Pro583, His584, Ala596, Lys597.
   The structures can also used to identify boundary HER3 amino acid residues for the

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   30
   interaction interface with an antibody or fragment thereof (e.g., MOR09823). These residues
   can be HER3 residues that were 5-8A from the MOR09823 protein VH chain. The boundary
   residues are as follows: Pro262, Val264, Tyr265, Phe270, Leu272, Thr278, Lys314, Gly316,
   Glu321, Asn566, Ser568, Gly569, Ser570, Thr572, Arg580, Asp581, Gly582, Gly595,
 5 Gly598, Ile600.
   The depicted structure also allows one to identify specific core HER3 amino acid residues for
   the interaction interface of an antibody or fragment thereof (e.g., MOR09823) with HER3.
   This was defined as residues that are within 5A of the MOR09823 protein VL chain. The core
   residues are as follows: Tyr265, Lys267, Leu268, Phe270, Gly582, Pro583, Lys597, Ile600,
 o Lys602, Glu609, Arg6l1, Pro612, Cys613, His614, Glu615.
   The structures were also used to identify boundary HER3 amino acid residues for the
   interaction interface with an antibody or fragment thereof (e.g., MOR09823). These residues
   were HER3 residues that were 5-8A from the MOR09823 protein VL chain. The boundary
 5 residues are as follows: Asn266, Thr269, Asp571, Arg580, Asp581, His584, Pro590, Ala596,
   Pro599, Tyr60l, Tyr603, Asp605, Gln607, Cys610, Asn616, Cys617, Cys621, Gly623,
   Pro624.
   As can be seen in Tables 11 and 12 (MOR09823) and Tables 13 and 14 (MOR09825),
 o respectively, the heavy chain is mainly involved in the antigen binding protein's binding to
   amino acid residues within domain 2 of the epitope with fewer interactions with amino acid
   residues of domain 4, while the light chain is mainly involved with binding to amino acid
   residues within domain 4 of the epitope with fewer interactions with amino acid residues
   within domain 2.
25 As such, one of skill in the art, given the present teachings, can predict which residues and
   areas of the antigen binding proteins can be varied without unduly interfering with the antigen
   binding protein's ability to bind to HER3.
   Core interaction interface amino acids were determined as being all amino acid residues with
30 at least one atom less than or equal to 5A from the HER3 partner protein. 5A was chosen as
   the core region cutoff distance to allow for atoms within a van der Waals radius plus a
   possible water-mediated hydrogen bond. Boundary interaction interface amino acids were
   determined as all amino acid residues with at least one atom less than or equal to 8A from the

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949

   HER3 partner protein but not included in the core interaction list.
   In some embodiments, any antigen binding protein that binds to, covers, or prevents
   MOR09823 from interacting with any of the above residues can be employed to bind to or
 5 neutralize HER3. In some embodiments, the antibodies or fragments thereof binds to or
   interacts with at least one of the following HER3 residues (SEQ ID NO: 1): Asn266, Lys267,
   Leu268, Thr269, Gln271, Glu273, Pro274, Asn275, Pro276, His277, Asn315, Asp571,
   Pro583, His584, Ala596, Lys597. In some embodiments, the antibodies and fragments
   thereof binds to or interacts with at least one of the following HER3 residues (SEQ ID NO:
 0 1): Tyr265, Lys267, Leu268, Phe270, Gly582, Pro583, Lys597, Ile600, Lys602, Glu609,
   Arg6l 1, Pro612, Cys613, His614, Glu615. In some embodiments, the antibodies or fragments
   thereof binds to or interacts with at least one of the following HER3 residues (SEQ ID NO:
   1): Asn266, Lys267, Leu268, Thr269, Gln271, Glu273, Pro274, Asn275, Pro276, His277,

   In some embodiments, the antibodies or fragments thereof binds to or interacts with a
   combination of the following HER3 residues (SEQ ID NO: 1): Asn266, Lys267, Leu268,
   Thr269, Gln271, Glu273, Pro274, Asn275, Pro276, His277, Asn315, Asp571, Pro583,

 o Lys602, Glu609, Arg6l 1, Pro612, Cys613, His614, Glu615. In some embodiments, the
   antibodies or fragments thereof binds to or interacts with all of the following HER3 residues
   (SEQ ID NO: 1): Asn266, Lys267, Leu268, Thr269, Gln271, Glu273, Pro274, Asn275,

25 His614, Glu615. In some embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof is within 5
   angstroms of one or more of the above residues. In some embodiments, the antibody or
   fragment thereof is 5 to 8 angstroms from one or more of the above residues. In some
   embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof interacts, blocks, or is within 8 angstroms of
   1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,            15,20,25,30,35,40,45,or50ofthe above
30 residues.
   The availability of 3D structures for the HER3 and the complex of HER3:MOR09823, for
   example, provides the framework to explore other HER3 antibodies in more detail. The 3D
   structure of HER3 allows the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies to be mapped and their
   mode of action inferred, since some inhibit, some stimulate and others have no effect on cell

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   32
   growth. The conformational epitope for MOR09823 has been located to the domains 2 and 4
   of HER3. The availability of the 3D structures of this receptor will facilitate the determination
   of the precise mechanism of action of these inhibitory agents and the design of new
   approaches to interfering with HER3 receptor function. In one embodiment, the antibodies of
 5 the invention bind to the same conformational epitope as MOR09823.
   In some embodiments, the conformational epitope bound by any of the antibodies listed in
   Table 1 is especially useful. In certain embodiments, a HER3 conformational epitope can be
   utilized to isolate antibodies of fragments thereof that bind to HER3. In certain embodiments,
   a HER3 conformational epitope can be utilized to generate antibodies or fragments thereof
 o which bind to HER3. In certain embodiments, a HER3 conformational epitope can be utilized
   as an immunogen to generate antibodies of fragments thereof that bind to the HER3
   conformational epitope. In certain embodiments, a HER3 conformational epitope can be
   administered to an animal, and antibodies that bind to HER3 can subsequently be obtained
   from the animal.
 5 In some embodiments, the domain(s)/region(s) containing residues that are in contact with or
   are buried by an antibody can be identified by mutating specific residues in HER3 (e.g., a
   wild-type antigen) and determining whether antibody or fragment thereof can bind the
   mutated or variant HER3 protein or measure changes of affinity from wild-type. By making a
   number of individual mutations, residues that play a direct role in binding or that are in
 o sufficiently close proximity to the antibody such that a mutation can affect binding between
   the antibody and antigen can be identified. From a knowledge of these amino acids, the
   domain(s) or region(s) of the antigen (HER3) that contain residues in contact with the
   antibody or covered by the antibody can be elucidated. Mutagenesis using known techniques
   such as alanine-scanning can help define functionally relevant epitopes. Mutagenesis utilizing
25 an arginine/glutamic acid scanning protocol can also be employed (see, e.g., Nanevicz et al.,
   (1995), J. Biol. Chem. 270(37):21619-21625 and Zupnick et al., (2006), J. Biol. Chem.
   281(29):20464-20473). In general, arginine and glutamic acids are substituted (typically
   individually) for an amino acid in the wild-type polypeptide because these amino acids are
   charged and bulky and thus have the potential to disrupt binding between an antigen binding
30 protein and an antigen in the region of the antigen where the mutation is introduced. Arginines
   that exist in the wild-type antigen are replaced with glutamic acid. A variety of such
   individual mutants can be obtained and the collected binding results analyzed to determine
   what residues affect binding. A series of mutant HER3 antigens can be created, with each

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   33
   mutant antigen having a single mutation. Binding of each mutant HER3 antigen with various
   HER3 antibodies or fragments thereof can be measured and compared to the ability of the
   selected an antibody or fragments thereof to bind wild-type HER3 (SEQ ID NO: 1).
 5 An alteration (for example a reduction or increase) in binding between an antibody or
   fragment thereof and a mutant or variant HER3 as used herein means that there is a change in
   binding affinity (e.g., as measured by known methods such as Biacore testing or the bead
   based assay described below in the examples), EC50 , and/or a change (for example a
   reduction) in the total binding capacity of the antigen binding protein (for example, as
 o evidenced by a decrease in Bmax in a plot of antigen binding protein concentration versus
   antigen concentration). A significant alteration in binding indicates that the mutated residue is
   involved in binding to the antibody or fragment thereof.
   In some embodiments, a significant reduction in binding means that the binding affinity, EC50 ,
 5 and/or capacity between an antibody or fragments thereof and a mutant HER3 antigen is
   reduced by greater than 10%, greater than 20%, greater than 40%, greater than 50%, greater
   than 55%, greater than 60%, greater than 65%, greater than 70%, greater than 75%, greater
   than 80%, greater than 85%, greater than 90% or greater than 95% relative to binding between
   the an antibody or fragment thereof and a wild type HER3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1).
 o In some embodiments, binding of an antibody or fragments thereof is significantly reduced or
   increased for a mutant HER3 protein having one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or
   more) mutations as compared to a wild-type HER3 protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1).
   Although the variant forms are referenced with respect to the wild-type sequence shown in
25 SEQ ID NO: 1, it will be appreciated that in an allelic or splice variants of HER3 the amino
   acids could differ. Antibodies or fragments thereof showing significantly altered binding (e.g.,
   lower or higher binding) for such allelic forms of HER3 are also contemplated.
   In addition to the general structural aspects of antibodies, the more specific interaction
   between the paratope and the epitope may be examined through structural approaches. In one
30 embodiment, the structure of the CDRs contribute to a paratope, through which an antibody is
   able to bind to an epitope. The shape of such a paratope may be determined in a number of
   ways. Traditional structural examination approaches can be used, such as NMR or x-ray
   crystallography. These approaches can examine the shape of the paratope alone, or while it is

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    34
   bound to the epitope. Alternatively, molecular models may be generated in silico. A structure
   can be generated through homology modeling, aided with a commercial package, such as
   InsightIl modeling package from Accelrys (San Diego, Calif.). Briefly, one can use the
   sequence of the antibody to be examined to search against a database of proteins of known
 5 structures, such as the Protein Data Bank. After one identifies homologous proteins with
   known structures, these homologous proteins are used as modeling templates. Each of the
   possible templates can be aligned, thus producing structure based sequence alignments among
   the templates. The sequence of the antibody with the unknown structure can then be aligned
   with these templates to generate a molecular model for the antibody with the unknown
 o structure. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, there are many alternative methods
   for generating such structures in silico, any of which may be used. For instance, a process
   similar to the one described in Hardman et al., issued U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,708 employing
   QUANTA (Polygen Corp., Waltham, Mass.) and CHARM (Brooks et al., (1983), J. Comp.
   Chem. 4:187) may be used (hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference).
 5
   Not only is the shape of the paratope important in determining whether and how well a
   possible paratope will bind to an epitope, but the interaction itself, between the epitope and
   the paratope is a source of great information in the design of variant antibodies. As
   appreciated by one of skill in the art, there are a variety of ways in which this interaction can
 o be studied. One way is to use the structural model generated, perhaps as described above, and
   then to use a program such as InsightIl (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.), which has a docking
   module, which, among other things, is capable of performing a Monte Carlo search on the
   conformational and orientational spaces between the paratope and its epitope. The result is
   that one is able to estimate where and how the epitope interacts with the paratope. In one
25 embodiment, only a fragment, or variant, of the epitope is used to assist in determining the
   relevant interactions. In one embodiment, the entire epitope is used in the modeling of the
   interaction between the paratope and the epitope.
   Through the use of these modelled structures, one is able to predict which residues are the
   most important in the interaction between the epitope and the paratope. Thus, in one
30 embodiment, one is able to readily select which residues to change in order to alter the
   binding characteristics of the antibody. For instance, it may be apparent from the docking
   models that the side chains of certain residues in the paratope may sterically hinder the
   binding of the epitope, thus altering these residues to residues with smaller side chains may be
   beneficial. One can determine this in many ways. For example, one may simply look at the

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    35
   two models and estimate interactions based on functional groups and proximity. Alternatively,
   one may perform repeated pairings of epitope and paratope, as described above, in order to
   obtain more favorable energy interactions. One can also determine these interactions for a
   variety of variants of the antibody to determine alternative ways in which the antibody may
 5 bind to the epitope. One can also combine the various models to determine how one should
   alter the structure of the antibodies in order to obtain an antibody with the particular
   characteristics that are desired.
   The models determined above can be tested through various techniques. For example, the
 o interaction energy can determined with the programs discussed above in order to determine
   which of the variants to further examine. Also, coulumbic and van der Waals interactions are
   used to determine the interaction energies of the epitope and the variant paratopes. Also site
   directed mutagenesis is used to see if predicted changes in antibody structure actually result in
   the desired changes in binding characteristics. Alternatively, changes may be made to the
 5 epitope to verify that the models are correct or to determine general binding themes that may
   be occurring between the paratope and the epitope.
   As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, while these models will provide the guidance
   necessary to make the antibodies and variants thereof of the present embodiments, it may still
 o be desirable to perform routine testing of the in silico models, perhaps through in vitro
   studies. In addition, as will be apparent to one of skill in the art, any modification may also
   have additional side effects on the activity of the antibody. For instance, while any alteration
   predicted to result in greater binding, may induce greater binding, it may also cause other
   structural changes which might reduce or alter the activity of the antibody. The determination
25 of whether or not this is the case is routine in the art and can be achieved in many ways. For
   example, the activity can be tested through an ELISA test. Alternatively, the samples can be
   tested through the use of a surface plasmon resonance device.
   HER3 Antibodies
   The present invention provides antibodies that recognize a conformational epitope of HER3.
30 The invention is based on the surprising finding that a class of antibodies against HER3, block
   both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent HER3 signal transduction pathways. A class
   of antibodies that bind to the particular conformation epitope of HER3 is disclosed in Table 1.
   In one embodiment, the antibodies inhibit both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent
   HER3 signalling. In another embodiment, the antibodies bind to HER3 and do not block

 o also provides antibodies that specifically bind to a HER3 protein (e.g., human and/or
   cynomologus HER3), said antibodies comprising a VH CDR having an amino acid sequence
   of any one of the VH CDRs listed in Table 1, infra. In particular, the invention provides
   antibodies that specifically bind to a HER3 protein (e.g., human and/or cynomologus HER3),
   said antibodies comprising (or alternatively, consisting of) one, two, three, four, five or more
 5 VH CDRs having an amino acid sequence of any of the VH CDRs listed in Table 1, infra.
   Other antibodies of the invention include amino acids that have been mutated, yet have at
   least 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, or 98 percent identity in the CDR regions with the CDR regions
   depicted in the sequences described in Table 1. In some embodiments, it includes mutant
   amino acid sequences wherein no more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acids have been mutated in
 o the CDR regions when compared with the CDR regions depicted in the sequence described
   Table 1, while still maintaining their specificity for the original antibody's epitope
   Other antibodies of the invention include amino acids that have been mutated, yet have at

   Other antibodies of the invention include those where the amino acids or nucleic acids
   encoding the amino acids have been mutated, yet have at least 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98,
   and 99 percent identity to the sequences described in Table 1. In some embodiments, it
 5 include mutant amino acid sequences wherein no more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acids have
   been mutated in the variable regions when compared with the variable regions depicted in the
   sequence described in Table 1, while retaining substantially the same therapeutic activity.
   Since each of these antibodies or fragments thereof can bind to HER3, the VH, VL, full length
   light chain, and full length heavy chain sequences (amino acid sequences and the nucleotide
10 sequences encoding the amino acid sequences) can be "mixed and matched" to create other

   HER3-binding antibodies of the invention. Such "mixed and matched" HER3-binding
   antibodies can be tested using the binding assays known in the art (e.g., ELISAs, and other
   assays described in the Example section). When these chains are mixed and matched, a VH
   sequence from a particular VH/VL pairing should be replaced with a structurally similar VH
 5 sequence. Likewise a full length heavy chain sequence from a particular full length heavy
   chain / full length light chain pairing should be replaced with a structurally similar full length
   heavy chain sequence. Likewise, a VL sequence from a particular VH/VL pairing should be
   replaced with a structurally similar VL sequence. Likewise a full length light chain sequence
   from a particular full length heavy chain / full length light chain pairing should be replaced
 0 with a structurally similar full length light chain sequence. Accordingly, in one aspect, the
   invention provides an isolated monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof having: a heavy chain
   variable region comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ
   ID NO: 15, 33, 51, 69, 87, 105, 123, 141, 159, 177, 195, 213, 231, 249, 267, 285, 303, 321,
   339, 357, and 375; and a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence
 5 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 14, 32, 50, 68, 86, 104, 122, 140, 158,

                                                  59
   As used herein, a human antibody comprises heavy or light chain variable regions or full
   length heavy or light chains that are "the product of' or "derived from" a particular germline
   sequence if the variable regions or full length chains of the antibody are obtained from a
   system that uses human germline immunoglobulin genes. Such systems include immunizing
 5 a transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin genes with the antigen of interest or
   screening a human immunoglobulin gene library displayed on phage with the antigen of
   interest. A human antibody that is "the product of' or "derived from" a human germline
   immunoglobulin sequence can be identified as such by comparing the amino acid sequence of
   the human antibody to the amino acid sequences of human germline immunoglobulins and
 0 selecting the human germline immunoglobulin sequence that is closest in sequence (i.e.,
   greatest % identity) to the sequence of the human antibody. A human antibody that is "the
   product of' or "derived from" a particular human germline immunoglobulin sequence may
   contain amino acid differences as compared to the germline sequence, due to, for example,
   naturally occurring somatic mutations or intentional introduction of site-directed mutations.
 5 However, in the VH or VL framework regions, a selected human antibody typically is at least
   90% identical in amino acids sequence to an amino acid sequence encoded by a human
   germline immunoglobulin gene and contains amino acid residues that identify the human
   antibody as being human when compared to the germline immunoglobulin amino acid
   sequences of other species (e.g., murine germline sequences). In certain cases, a human
 o antibody may be at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or at least 95%, or even at least 96%, 97%,
   98%, or 99% identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the
   germline immunoglobulin gene. Typically, a recombinant human antibody will display no
   more than 10 amino acid differences from the amino acid sequence encoded by the human
   germline immunoglobulin gene in the VH or VL framework regions. In certain cases, the
25 human antibody may display no more than 5, or even no more than 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid
   difference from the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene.
   Different germlined versions using the VH and VL germline sequences for a representative
   number of HER3 antibodies is shown in Table 2, using Kabat. The CDR positions are
   highlighted in boldface. The notation used in the Tables with germlined sequences is as
30 follows: MOR10701-VH_3-07 means MOR10701 CDR loops in framework regions of VH
   germline sequence 3-07 (nomenclature is according to Vbase), MOR10703-VK_Li means
   CDR from MOR10703 in germline framework regions from VK_Li, where VK is the kappa
   light chain.

   The antibodies disclosed herein can be derivatives of single chain antibodies, diabodies,
   domain antibodies, nanobodies, and unibodies. A "single-chain antibody" (scFv) consists of a
 5 single polypeptide chain comprising a VL domain linked to a VH domain, wherein VL
   domain and VH domain are paired to form a monovalent molecule. Single chain antibody can
   be prepared according to method known in the art (see, for example, Bird et al., (1988)
   Science 242:423-426 and Huston et al., (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). A
   "disbud" consists of two chains, each chain comprising a heavy chain variable region
 o connected to a light chain variable region on the same polypeptide chain connected by a short
   peptide linker, wherein the two regions on the same chain do not pair with each other but with
   complementary domains on the other chain to form a bispecific molecule. Methods of
   preparing diabodies are known in the art (See, e.g., Holliger et al., (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad.
   Sci. USA 90:6444-6448, and Poljak et al., (1994) Structure 2:1121-1123). Domain antibodies
 5 (dAbs) are small functional binding units of antibodies, corresponding to the variable regions
   of either the heavy or light chains of antibodies. Domain antibodies are well expressed in
   bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cell systems. Further details of domain antibodies and
   methods of production thereof are known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos.
   6,291,158; 6,582,915; 6,593,081; 6,172,197; 6,696,245; European Patents 0368684 &
 0 0616640; W005/035572, W004/101790, W004/081026, W004/058821, W004/003019 and
   W003/002609. Nanobodies are derived from the heavy chains of an antibody. A nanobody
   typically comprises a single variable domain and two constant domains (CH2 and CH3) and
   retains antigen-binding capacity of the original antibody. Nanobodies can be prepared by
   methods known in the art (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,765,087, U.S. Pat. No. 6,838,254, WO
25 06/079372). Unibodies consist of one light chain and one heavy chain of a IgG4 antibody.
   Unibodies may be made by the removal of the hinge region of IgG4 antibodies. Further details
   of unibodies and methods of preparing them may be found in W02007/059782.
   Homologous antibodies
   In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides an antibody or fragment thereof
30 comprising amino acid sequences that are homologous to the sequences described in Table 1,
   and said antibody binds to a HER3 protein (e.g., human and/or cynomologus HER3), and
   retains the desired functional properties of those antibodies described in Table 1.

 o binds to HER3 (e.g., human and/or cynomologus HER3) and neutralizes the signaling activity
   of HER3, which can be measured in a phosphorylation assay or other measure of HER
   signaling (e.g., phospo-HER3 assays, phospho-Akt assays, cell proliferation, and ligand
   blocking assays as described in the Examples). Also includes within the scope of the
   invention are variable heavy and light chain parental nucleotide sequences; and full length
 5 heavy and light chain sequences optimized for expression in a mammalian cell. Other
   antibodies of the invention include amino acids or nucleic acids that have been mutated, yet
   have at least 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, or 98% percent identity to the sequences described above. In
   some embodiments, it include mutant amino acid sequences wherein no more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or
   5 amino acids have been mutated by amino acid deletion, insertion or substitution in the
 o variable regions when compared with the variable regions depicted in the sequence described
   above.
   In other embodiments, the VH and/or VL amino acid sequences may be 50%, 60%, 70%,
   80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the sequences set forth in Table 1. In
   other embodiments, the VH and/or VL amino acid sequences may be identical except an
25 amino acid substitution in no more than 1,2,3,4 or 5 amino acid position. An antibody having
   VH and VL regions having high (i. e., 80% or greater) identity to the VH and VL regions of
   the antibodies described in Table 1 can be obtained by mutagenesis (e.g., site-directed or
   PCR-mediated mutagenesis), followed by testing of the encoded altered antibody for retained
   function using the functional assays described herein.
30 In other embodiments, the variable regions of heavy chain and/or light chain nucleotide
   sequences may be 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the
   sequences set forth above.

       WO 2013/084147                                                         PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                  67
   As used herein, "percent identity" between the two sequences is a function of the number of
   identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity equals number of identical
   positions/total number of positions x 100), taking into account the number of gaps, and the
   length of each gap, which needs to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.
 5 The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences
   can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm, as described in the non-limiting
   examples below.
   Additionally or alternatively, the protein sequences of the present invention can further be
   used as a "query sequence" to perform a search against public databases to, for example,
 o identifies related sequences. For example, such searches can be performed using the BLAST
   program (version 2.0) of Altschul et al., (1990) J.Mol. Biol. 215:403-10.

   conservative modifications thereof; the antibody or fragment thereof specifically binds to
   HER3, and neutralizes HER3 activity by inhibiting a HER signaling pathway, which can be
 5 measured in a phosphorylation assay or other measure of HER signaling (e.g., phospo-HER3
   assays, phospho-Akt assays, cell proliferation, and ligand blocking assays as described in the
   Examples).
   Antibodies That Bind to the Same Epitope
   The present invention provides antibodies that interacts with (e.g., by binding, steric
 o hindrance, stabilizing/destabilizing, spatial distribution) the same epitope as do the HER3
   binding antibodies described in Table 1 and Fig. 7. Additional antibodies can therefore be
   identified based on their ability to cross-compete (e.g., to competitively inhibit the binding of,
   in a statistically significant manner) with other antibodies of the invention in HER3 binding
   assays. The ability of a test antibody to inhibit the binding of antibodies of the present
25 invention to a HER3 protein (e.g., human and/or cynomologus HER3) demonstrates that the
   test antibody can compete with that antibody for binding to HER3; such an antibody may,
   according to non-limiting theory, bind to the same or a related (e.g., a structurally similar or
   spatially proximal) epitope on the HER3 protein as the antibody with which it competes. In a
   certain embodiment, the antibody that binds to the same epitope on HER3 as the antibodies of
30 the present invention is a human monoclonal antibody. Such human monoclonal antibodies
   can be prepared and isolated as described herein.
   In one embodiment, the antibody or fragments thereof binds to both domain 2 and domain 4
   of HER3 to hold the HER3 in an inactive conformation which prevents exposure of an

   dimerization loop present within domain 2. This prevents heterodimerizaton with other
   family members, such as HERI, HER2, and HER4. The antibodies of fragments thereof
   inhibit both ligand dependent and ligand-independent HER3 signal transduction.
   In another embodiment, the antibody or fragment thereof binds to both domain 2 and domain
 5 4 of HER3 and without blocking the concurrent binding of a HER3 ligand such as neuregulin.
   While not required to provide a theory, it is feasible that the antibody or fragment thereof
   binding to both domain 2 and domain 4 of HER3, holds HER3 in an inactive conformation
   without blocking the ligand binding site on HER3. Thus a HER3 ligand (e.g., neuregulin) is
   able to bind to HER3 at the same time as the antibody or fragment thereof.
 o The antibodies of the invention or fragments thereof inhibit both ligand dependent and
   independent activation of HER3 without preventing ligand binding. This is considered
   advantageous for the following reasons:
    (i) The therapeutic antibody would have clinical utility in a broad spectrum of tumors than an
   antibody which targeted a single mechanism of HER3 activation (i.e. ligand dependent or
 5 ligand independent) since distinct tumor types are driven by each mechanism.
   (ii) The therapeutic antibody would be efficacious in tumor types where both mechanisms of
   HER3 activation are simultaneously involved. An antibody targeting a single mechanism of
   HER3 activation (i.e. ligand dependent or ligand independent) would display little or no
   efficacy in these tumor types
 0 (iii) The efficacy of an antibody which inhibits ligand dependent activation of HER3 without
   preventing ligand binding would be less likely to be adversely affected by increasing
   concentrations of ligand. This would translate to either increased efficacy in a tumor type
   driven by very high concentrations of HER3 ligand or a reduced drug resistance liability
   where resistance is mediated by up-regulation of HER3 ligands.
25 (iv) An antibody which inhibits HER3 activation by stabilizing the inactive form would be
   less prone to drug resistance driven by alternative mechanisms of HER3 activation.
   Consequently, the antibodies of the invention may be used to treat conditions where existing
   therapeutic antibodies are clinically ineffective.

   Engineered and Modified Antibodies
   An antibody of the invention further can be prepared using an antibody having one or more of
   the VH and/or VL sequences shown herein as starting material to engineer a modified
   antibody, which modified antibody may have altered properties from the starting antibody.
 5 An antibody can be engineered by modifying one or more residues within one or both variable
   regions (i. e., VH and/or VL), for example within one or more CDR regions and/or within one
   or more framework regions. Additionally or alternatively, an antibody can be engineered by
   modifying residues within the constant region(s), for example to alter the effector function(s)
   of the antibody.
 o One type of variable region engineering that can be performed is CDR grafting. Antibodies
   interact with target antigens predominantly through amino acid residues that are located in the
   six heavy and light chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs). For this reason, the
   amino acid sequences within CDRs are more diverse between individual antibodies than
   sequences outside of CDRs. Because CDR sequences are responsible for most antibody
 5 antigen interactions, it is possible to express recombinant antibodies that mimic the properties
   of specific naturally occurring antibodies by constructing expression vectors that include CDR
   sequences from the specific naturally occurring antibody grafted onto framework sequences
   from a different antibody with different properties (see, e.g., Riechmann et al., (1998) Nature

   sequences of monoclonal antibodies, yet may contain different framework sequences from
   these antibodies.Such framework sequences can be obtained from public DNA databases or

 5 DNA sequences for human heavy and light chain variable region genes can be found in the
   "Vase" human germline sequence database (available on the Internet at www.mrc
   cpe.cam.ac.uk/vbase), as well as in Kabat et al., (1991) Sequences of Proteins of

   An example of framework sequences for use in the antibodies of the invention are those that
   are structurally similar to the framework sequences used by selected antibodies of the
25 invention, e.g., consensus sequences and/or framework sequences used by monoclonal
   antibodies of the invention. The VH CDR1, 2 and 3 sequences, and the VL CDR1, 2 and 3
   sequences, can be grafted onto framework regions that have the identical sequence as that
   found in the germline immunoglobulin gene from which the framework sequence derive, or
   the CDR sequences can be grafted onto framework regions that contain one or more mutations
30 as compared to the germline sequences. For example, it has been found that in certain
   instances it is beneficial to mutate residues within the framework regions to maintain or
   enhance the antigen binding ability of the antibody (see e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,530,101;
   5,585,089; 5,693,762 and 6,180,370 to Queen et al).

                                                    72
   Another type of variable region modification is to mutate amino acid residues within the VH
   and/or VL CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 regions to thereby improve one or more binding
   properties (e.g., affinity) of the antibody of interest, known as "affinity maturation." Site
   directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis can be performed to introduce the
 5 mutation(s) and the effect on antibody binding, or other functional property of interest, can be
   evaluated in in vitro or in vivo assays as described herein and provided in the Examples.
   Conservative modifications (as discussed above) can be introduced. The mutations may be
   amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions. Moreover, typically no more than one, two,
   three, four or five residues within a CDR region are altered.

 o Grafting Antibody Fragments Into Alternative Frameworks or Scaffolds
   A wide variety of antibody/ immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds can be employed so
   long as the resulting polypeptide includes at least one binding region which specifically binds
   to HER3. Such frameworks or scaffolds include the 5 main idiotypes of human
   immunoglobulins, or fragments thereof, and include immunoglobulins of other animal
25 species, preferably having humanized aspects. Novel frameworks, scaffolds and fragments
   continue to be discovered and developed by those skilled in the art.
   In one aspect, the invention pertains to generating non-immunoglobulin based antibodies
   using non- immunoglobulin scaffolds onto which CDRs of the invention can be grafted.
   Known or future non-immunoglobulin frameworks and scaffolds may be employed, as long as
30 they comprise a binding region specific for the target HER3 protein (e.g., human and/or
   cynomologus HER3). Known non-immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds include, but are
   not limited to, fibronectin (Compound Therapeutics, Inc., Waltham, MA), ankyrin
   (Molecular Partners AG, Zurich, Switzerland), domain antibodies (Domantis, Ltd.,

 5  The fibronectin scaffolds are based on fibronectin type III domain (e.g., the tenth module of
   the fibronectin type III (10 Fn3 domain)). The fibronectin type III domain has 7 or 8 beta
   strands which are distributed between two beta sheets, which themselves pack against each
   other to form the core of the protein, and further containing loops (analogous to CDRs) which
   connect the beta strands to each other and are solvent exposed. There are at least three such
 o loops at each edge of the beta sheet sandwich, where the edge is the boundary of the protein
   perpendicular to the direction of the beta strands (see US 6,818,418). These fibronectin-based
   scaffolds are not an immunoglobulin, although the overall fold is closely related to that of the
   smallest functional antibody fragment, the variable region of the heavy chain, which
   comprises the entire antigen recognition unit in camel and llama IgG. Because of this
 5 structure, the non-immunoglobulin antibody mimics antigen binding properties that are
   similar in nature and affinity to those of antibodies. These scaffolds can be used in a loop
   randomization and shuffling strategy in vitro that is similar to the process of affinity
   maturation of antibodies in vivo. These fibronectin-based molecules can be used as scaffolds
   where the loop regions of the molecule can be replaced with CDRs of the invention using
 o standard cloning techniques.
    The ankyrin technology is based on using proteins with ankyrin derived repeat modules as
   scaffolds for bearing variable regions which can be used for binding to different targets. The
   ankyrin repeat module is a 33 amino acid polypeptide consisting of two anti-parallel a-helices
   and a P-turn. Binding of the variable regions is mostly optimized by using ribosome display.
25  Avimers are derived from natural A-domain containing protein such as HER3.          These
   domains are used by nature for protein-protein interactions and in human over 250 proteins
   are structurally based on A-domains. Avimers consist of a number of different "A-domain"
   monomers (2-10) linked via amino acid linkers. Avimers can be created that can bind to the
   target antigen using the methodology described in, for example, U.S. Patent Application
30 Publication Nos. 20040175756; 20050053973; 20050048512; and 20060008844.
    Affibody affinity ligands are small, simple proteins composed of a three-helix bundle based
   on the scaffold of one of the IgG-binding domains of Protein A. Protein A is a surface protein

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    75
   from the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. This scaffold domain consists of 58 amino acids,
   13 of which are randomized to generate affibody libraries with a large number of ligand
   variants (See e.g., US 5,831,012). Affibody molecules mimic antibodies, they have a
   molecular weight of 6 kDa, compared to the molecular weight of antibodies, which is 150
 5 kDa. In spite of its small size, the binding site of affibody molecules is similar to that of an
   antibody.
    Anticalins are products developed by the company Pieris ProteoLab AG. They are derived
   from lipocalins, a widespread group of small and robust proteins that are usually involved in
   the physiological transport or storage of chemically sensitive or insoluble compounds.
 o Several natural lipocalins occur in human tissues or body liquids. The protein architecture is
   reminiscent of immunoglobulins, with hypervariable loops on top of a rigid framework.
   However, in contrast with antibodies or their recombinant fragments, lipocalins are composed
   of a single polypeptide chain with 160 to 180 amino acid residues, being just marginally
   bigger than a single immunoglobulin domain. The set of four loops, which makes up the
 5 binding pocket, shows pronounced structural plasticity and tolerates a variety of side chains.
   The binding site can thus be reshaped in a proprietary process in order to recognize prescribed
   target molecules of different shape with high affinity and specificity. One protein of lipocalin
   family, the bilin-binding protein (BBP) of Pieris Brassicae has been used to develop anticalins
   by mutagenizing the set of four loops. One example of a patent application describing
 o anticalins is in PCT Publication No.WO 199916873.
    Affilin molecules are small non-immunoglobulin proteins which are designed for specific
   affinities towards proteins and small molecules. New affilin molecules can be very quickly
   selected from two libraries, each of which is based on a different human derived scaffold
   protein. Affilin molecules do not show any structural homology to immunoglobulin proteins.
25 Currently, two affilin scaffolds are employed, one of which is gamma crystalline, a human
   structural eye lens protein and the other is "ubiquitin" superfamily proteins. Both human
   scaffolds are very small, show high temperature stability and are almost resistant to pH
   changes and denaturing agents. This high stability is mainly due to the expanded beta sheet
   structure of the proteins. Examples of gamma crystalline derived proteins are described in
30 W0200104144 and examples of "ubiquitin-like" proteins are described in W02004106368.
    Protein epitope mimetics (PEM) are medium-sized, cyclic, peptide-like molecules (MW 1
   2kDa) mimicking beta-hairpin secondary structures of proteins, the major secondary structure
   involved in protein-protein interactions.

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949

   In some embodiments, the Fabs are converted to silent IgGI format by changing the Fc
   region. For example, antibodies in Table 1 can be converted to IgG format.
   Human or humanized antibodies
   The present invention provides fully human antibodies that specifically bind to a HER3
 5 protein (e.g., human and/or cynomologus/ mouse/rat HER3). Compared to the chimeric or
   humanized antibodies, the human HER3 -binding antibodies of the invention have further
   reduced antigenicity when administered to human subjects.
   The human HER3-binding antibodies can be generated using methods that are known in the
   art. For example, the humaneering technology used to converting non-human antibodies into
 o engineered human antibodies. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050008625 describes an in vivo
   method for replacing a nonhuman antibody variable region with a human variable region in an
   antibody while maintaining the same or providing better binding characteristics relative to that
   of the nonhuman antibody. The method relies on epitope guided replacement of variable
   regions of a non-human reference antibody with a fully human antibody. The resulting
 5 human antibody is generally unrelated structurally to the reference nonhuman antibody, but
   binds to the same epitope on the same antigen as the reference antibody. Briefly, the serial
   epitope-guided complementarity replacement approach is enabled by setting up a competition
   in cells between a "competitor" and a library of diverse hybrids of the reference antibody
   ("test antibodies") for binding to limiting amounts of antigen in the presence of a reporter
 o system which responds to the binding of test antibody to antigen. The competitor can be the
   reference antibody or derivative thereof such as a single-chain Fv fragment. The competitor
   can also be a natural or artificial ligand of the antigen which binds to the same epitope as the
   reference antibody. The only requirements of the competitor are that it binds to the same
   epitope as the reference antibody, and that it competes with the reference antibody for antigen
25 binding. The test antibodies have one antigen-binding V-region in common from the
   nonhuman reference antibody, and the other V-region selected at random from a diverse
   source such as a repertoire library of human antibodies. The common V-region from the
   reference antibody serves as a guide, positioning the test antibodies on the same epitope on
   the antigen, and in the same orientation, so that selection is biased toward the highest antigen
30 binding fidelity to the reference antibody.
   Many types of reporter system can be used to detect desired interactions between test
   antibodies and antigen. For example, complementing reporter fragments may be linked to
   antigen and test antibody, respectively, so that reporter activation by fragment

       WO 2013/084147                                                             PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    77
   complementation only occurs when the test antibody binds to the antigen. When the test
   antibody- and antigen-reporter fragment fusions are co-expressed with a competitor, reporter
   activation becomes dependent on the ability of the test antibody to compete with the
   competitor, which is proportional to the affinity of the test antibody for the antigen. Other
 5 reporter systems that can be used include the reactivator of an auto-inhibited reporter
   reactivation system (RAIR) as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 10/208,730
   (Publication No. 20030198971), or competitive activation system disclosed in U.S. Patent
   Application Ser. No. 10/076,845 (Publication No. 20030157579).
   With the serial epitope-guided complementarity replacement system, selection is made to
 o identify cells expresses a single test antibody along with the competitor, antigen, and reporter
   components. In these cells, each test antibody competes one-on-one with the competitor for
   binding to a limiting amount of antigen. Activity of the reporter is proportional to the amount
   of antigen bound to the test antibody, which in turn is proportional to the affinity of the test
   antibody for the antigen and the stability of the test antibody. Test antibodies are initially
 5 selected on the basis of their activity relative to that of the reference antibody when expressed
   as the test antibody. The result of the first round of selection is a set of "hybrid" antibodies,
   each of which is comprised of the same non-human V-region from the reference antibody and
   a human V-region from the library, and each of which binds to the same epitope on the
   antigen as the reference antibody. One of more of the hybrid antibodies selected in the first
 o round will have an affinity for the antigen comparable to or higher than that of the reference
   antibody.
   In the second V-region replacement step, the human V-regions selected in the first step are
   used as guide for the selection of human replacements for the remaining non-human reference
   antibody V-region with a diverse library of cognate human V-regions. The hybrid antibodies
25 selected in the first round may also be used as competitors for the second round of selection.
   The result of the second round of selection is a set of fully human antibodies which differ
   structurally from the reference antibody, but which compete with the reference antibody for
   binding to the same antigen. Some of the selected human antibodies bind to the same epitope
   on the same antigen as the reference antibody. Among these selected human antibodies, one
30 or more binds to the same epitope with an affinity which is comparable to or higher than that
   of the reference antibody.
   Using one of the mouse or chimeric HER3-binding antibodies described above as the
   reference antibody, this method can be readily employed to generate human antibodies that

                                                   78
   bind to human HER3 with the same binding specificity and the same or better binding
   affinity. In addition, such human HER3-binding antibodies can also be commercially
   obtained from companies which customarily produce human antibodies, e.g., KaloBios, Inc.
   (Mountain View, CA).
 5 Camelid antibodies
   Antibody proteins obtained from members of the camel and dromedary (Camelus bactrianus
   and Calelus dromaderius) family including new world members such as llama species (Lama
   paccos, Lama glama and Lama vicugna) have been characterized with respect to size,
   structural complexity and antigenicity for human subjects. Certain IgG antibodies from this
 o family of mammals as found in nature lack light chains, and are thus structurally distinct from
   the typical four chain quaternary structure having two heavy and two light chains, for
   antibodies from other animals. See PCT/EP93/02214 (WO 94/04678 published 3 March
   1994).
   A region of the camelid antibody which is the small single variable domain identified as VHH
 5 can be obtained by genetic engineering to yield a small protein having high affinity for a
   target, resulting in a low molecular weight antibody-derived protein known as a "camelid
   nanobody". See U.S. patent number 5,759,808 issued June 2, 1998; see also Stijlemans et al.,
   (2004) J Biol Chem 279:1256-1261; Dumoulin et al., (2003) Nature 424:783-788;
   Pleschberger et al., (2003) Bioconjugate Chem 14:440-448; Cortez-Retamozo et al., (2002)
 o Int J Cancer 89:456-62; and Lauwereys et al., (1998) EMBO J 17:3512-3520. Engineered
   libraries of camelid antibodies and antibody fragments are commercially available, for
   example, from Ablynx, Ghent, Belgium. (e.g., US20060115470; Domantis (US20070065440,
   US20090148434). As with other antibodies of non-human origin, an amino acid sequence of a
   camelid antibody can be altered recombinantly to obtain a sequence that more closely
25 resembles a human sequence, i.e., the nanobody can be "humanized". Thus the natural low
   antigenicity of camelid antibodies to humans can be further reduced.
   The camelid nanobody has a molecular weight approximately one-tenth that of a human IgG
   molecule, and the protein has a physical diameter of only a few nanometers. One
   consequence of the small size is the ability of camelid nanobodies to bind to antigenic sites
30 that are functionally invisible to larger antibody proteins, i.e., camelid nanobodies are useful
   as reagents detect antigens that are otherwise cryptic using classical immunological
   techniques, and as possible therapeutic agents. Thus yet another consequence of small size is
   that a camelid nanobody can inhibit as a result of binding to a specific site in a groove or

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   79
   narrow cleft of a target protein, and hence can serve in a capacity that more closely resembles
   the function of a classical low molecular weight drug than that of a classical antibody.
   The low molecular weight and compact size further result in camelid nanobodies being
   extremely thermostable, stable to extreme pH and to proteolytic digestion, and poorly
 5 antigenic. Another consequence is that camelid nanobodies readily move from the circulatory
   system into tissues, and even cross the blood-brain barrier and can treat disorders that affect
   nervous tissue. Nanobodies can further facilitated drug transport across the blood brain
   barrier. See U.S. patent application 20040161738 published August 19, 2004. These features
   combined with the low antigenicity to humans indicate great therapeutic potential. Further,
 o these molecules can be fully expressed in prokaryotic cells such as E. coli and are expressed
   as fusion proteins with bacteriophage and are functional.
   Accordingly, a feature of the present invention is a camelid antibody or nanobody having high
   affinity for HER3. In certain embodiments herein, the camelid antibody or nanobody is
   naturally produced in the camelid animal, i.e., is produced by the camelid following
 5 immunization with HER3 or a peptide fragment thereof, using techniques described herein for
   other antibodies. Alternatively, the HER3-binding camelid nanobody is engineered, i.e.,
   produced by selection for example from a library of phage displaying appropriately
   mutagenized camelid nanobody proteins using panning procedures with HER3 as a target as
   described in the examples herein. Engineered nanobodies can further be customized by
 o genetic engineering to have a half life in a recipient subject of from 45 minutes to two weeks.
   In a specific embodiment, the camelid antibody or nanobody is obtained by grafting the CDRs
   sequences of the heavy or light chain of the human antibodies of the invention into nanobody
   or single domain antibody framework sequences, as described for example in
   PCT/EP93/02214. In one embodiment, the camelid antibody or nanobody binds to at least
25 one of the following HER3 residues: Asn266, Lys267, Leu268, Thr269, Gln271, Glu273,
   Pro274, Asn275, Pro276, His277, Asn315, Asp571, Pro583, His584, Ala596, Lys597. In one
   embodiment, the camelid antibody or nanobody binds to at least one of the following HER3
   residues : Tyr265, Lys267, Leu268, Phe270, Gly582, Pro583, Lys597, Ile600, Lys602,
   Glu609, Arg6l 1, Pro612, Cys613, His614, Glu615.
30 Bispecific Molecules and Multivalent Antibodies
   In another aspect, the present invention features biparatopic, bispecific or multispecific
   molecules comprising an HER3-binding antibody, or a fragment thereof, of the invention. An
   antibody of the invention, or fragments thereof, can be derivatized or linked to another

       WO 2013/084147                                                            PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   80
   functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or protein (e.g., another antibody or ligand for a
   receptor) to generate a bispecific molecule that binds to at least two different binding sites or
   target molecules. The antibody of the invention may in fact be derivatized or linked to more
   than one other functional molecule to generate biparatopic or multi-specific molecules that
 5 bind to more than two different binding sites and/or target molecules; such biparatopic or
   multi-specific molecules. To create a bispecific molecule of the invention, an antibody of the
   invention can be functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, non-covalent
   association or otherwise) to one or more other binding molecules, such as another antibody,
   antibody fragment, peptide or binding mimetic, such that a bispecific molecule results.
 o Further clinical benefits may be provided by the binding of two or more antigens within one
   antibody (Coloma et al., (1997); Merchant et al., (1998); Alt et al., (1999); Zuo et al., (2000);

   The bispecific molecules of the present invention can be prepared by conjugating the
   constituent binding specificities, using methods known in the art. For example, each binding
   specificity of the bispecific molecule can be generated separately and then conjugated to one
   another. When the binding specificities are proteins or peptides, a variety of coupling or
25 cross-linking agents can be used for covalent conjugation. Examples of cross-linking agents
   include protein A, carbodiimide, N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA), 5,5'
   dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), o-phenylenedimaleimide (oPDM), N-succinimidyl-3
   (2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), and sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)
   cyclohaxane-l-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) (see e.g., Karpovsky et al., (1984) J. Exp. Med.
30 160:1686; Liu et al., (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:8648). Other methods include
   those described in Paulus (1985) Behring Ins. Mitt. No. 78:118-132; Brennan et al., (1985)
   Science 229:81-83), and Glennie et al., (1987) J. Immunol. 139: 2367-2375). Conjugating
   agents are SATA and sulfo-SMCC, both available from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL).

       WO 2013/084147                                                         PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                  81
   When the binding specificities are antibodies, they can be conjugated by sulfhydryl bonding
   of the C-terminus hinge regions of the two heavy chains. In a particularly embodiment, the
   hinge region is modified to contain an odd number of sulfhydryl residues, for example one,
   prior to conjugation.
 5 Alternatively, both binding specificities can be encoded in the same vector and expressed and
   assembled in the same host cell. This method is particularly useful where the bispecific
   molecule is a mAb x mAb, mAb x Fab, Fab x F(ab') 2 or ligand x Fab fusion protein. A
   bispecific molecule of the invention can be a single chain molecule comprising one single
   chain antibody and a binding determinant, or a single chain bispecific molecule comprising
 o two binding determinants. Bispecific molecules may comprise at least two single chain
   molecules. Methods for preparing bispecific molecules are described for example in U.S.

 5 Number 5,482,858.
   Binding of the bispecific molecules to their specific targets can be confirmed by, for example,
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (REA), FACS analysis,
   bioassay (e.g., growth inhibition), or Western Blot assay. Each of these assays generally
   detects the presence of protein-antibody complexes of particular interest by employing a
 o labeled reagent (e.g., an antibody) specific for the complex of interest.
   In another aspect, the present invention provides multivalent compounds comprising at least
   two identical or different fragments of the antibodies of the invention binding to HER3. The
   antibody fragments can be linked together via protein fusion or covalent or non covalent
   linkage. Tetravalent compounds can be obtained for example by cross-linking antibodies of
25 the antibodies of the invention with an antibody that binds to the constant regions of the
   antibodies of the invention, for example the Fc or hinge region. Trimerizing domain are
   described for example in Borean patent EP 1012280B 1. Pentamerizing modules are described
   for example in PCT/EP97/05897.
   In one embodiment, a biparatopic/bispecific binds to amino acid residues within domain 2 and
30 domain 4 of HER3.
   In another embodiment, the invention pertains to dual function antibodies in which a single
   monoclonal antibody has been modified such that the antigen binding site binds to more than

   one antigen, such as a dual function antibody which binds both HER3 and another antigen
   (e.g., HERI, HER2, and HER4). In another embodiment, the invention pertains to a dual
   function antibody that targets antigens having the same conformation, for example an antigen
   that has the same conformation of HER3 in the "closed" or "inactive" state. Examples of
 5 antigens with the same conformation of HER3 in the "closed" or "inactive" state include, but
   are not limited to, HERI and HER4. Thus, a dual function antibody may bind to both HER3
   and HERI; HER3 and HER4, or HERI and HER4. The dual binding specificity of the dual
   function antibody may further translate into dual activity, or inhibition of activity. (See e.g.,
   Jenny Bostrom et al., (2009) Science: 323; 1610-1614).
 o Antibodies with Extended Half Life
   The present invention provides for antibodies that specifically bind to HER3 protein which
   have an extended half-life in vivo.
   Many factors may affect a protein's half life in vivo. For examples, kidney filtration,
   metabolism in the liver, degradation by proteolytic enzymes (proteases), and immunogenic
 5 responses (e.g., protein neutralization by antibodies and uptake by macrophages and dentritic
   cells). A variety of strategies can be used to extend the half life of the antibodies of the
   present invention. For example, by chemical linkage to polyethyleneglycol (PEG), reCODE
   PEG, antibody scaffold, polysialic acid (PSA), hydroxyethyl starch (HES), albumin-binding
   ligands, and carbohydrate shields; by genetic fusion to proteins binding to serum proteins,
 o such as albumin, IgG, FcRn, and transferring; by coupling (genetically or chemically) to other
   binding moieties that bind to serum proteins, such as nanobodies, Fabs, DARPins, avimers,
   affibodies, and anticalins; by genetic fusion to rPEG, albumin, domain of albumin, albumin
   binding proteins, and Fc; or by incorporation into nanocarriers, slow release formulations, or
   medical devices.
25 To prolong the serum circulation of antibodies in vivo, inert polymer molecules such as high
   molecular weight PEG can be attached to the antibodies or a fragment thereof with or without
   a multifunctional linker either through site-specific conjugation of the PEG to the N- or C
   terminus of the antibodies or via epsilon-amino groups present on lysine residues. To
   pegylate an antibody, the antibody, or fragment thereof, typically is reacted with polyethylene
30 glycol (PEG), such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of PEG, under conditions in
   which one or more PEG groups become attached to the antibody or antibody fragment. The
   pegylation can be carried out by an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive
   PEG molecule (or an analogous reactive water-soluble polymer). As used herein, the term

                                                    83
   "polyethylene glycol" is intended to encompass any of the forms of PEG that have been used
   to derivatize other proteins, such as mono (Cl-C10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol or
   polyethylene glycol-maleimide. In certain embodiments, the antibody to be pegylated is an
   aglycosylated antibody. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal
 5 loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation can be closely monitored
   by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the
   antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody-PEG conjugates by size
   exclusion or by ion-exchange chromatography. PEG-derivatized antibodies can be tested for
   binding activity as well as for in vivo efficacy using methods well-known to those of skill in
 o the art, for example, by immunoassays described herein. Methods for pegylating proteins are
   known in the art and can be applied to the antibodies of the invention. See for example, EP 0
   154 316 by Nishimura et al. and EP 0 401 384 by Ishikawa et al.
   Other modified pegylation technologies include reconstituting chemically orthogonal directed
   engineering technology (ReCODE PEG), which incorporates chemically specified side chains
 5 into biosynthetic proteins via a reconstituted system that includes tRNA synthetase and tRNA.
   This technology enables incorporation of more than 30 new amino acids into biosynthetic
   proteins in E.coli, yeast, and mammalian cells. The tRNA incorporates a nonnative amino
   acid any place an amber codon is positioned, converting the amber from a stop codon to one
   that signals incorporation of the chemically specified amino acid.
 o Recombinant pegylation technology (rPEG) can also be used for serum half-life extension.
   This technology involves genetically fusing a 300-600 amino acid unstructured protein tail to
   an existing pharmaceutical protein. Because the apparent molecular weight of such an
   unstructured protein chain is about 15-fold larger than its actual molecular weight, the serum
   half-life of the protein is greatly increased. In contrast to traditional PEGylation, which
25 requires chemical conjugation and repurification, the manufacturing process is greatly
   simplified and the product is homogeneous.
   Polysialytion is another technology, which uses the natural polymer polysialic acid (PSA) to
   prolong the active life and improve the stability of therapeutic peptides and proteins. PSA is a
   polymer of sialic acid (a sugar). When used for protein and therapeutic peptide drug delivery,
30 polysialic acid provides a protective microenvironment on conjugation. This increases the
   active life of the therapeutic protein in the circulation and prevents it from being recognized
   by the immune system. The PSA polymer is naturally found in the human body. It was
   adopted by certain bacteria which evolved over millions of years to coat their walls with it.

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    84
   These naturally polysialylated bacteria were then able, by virtue of molecular mimicry, to foil
   the body's defense system. PSA, nature's ultimate stealth technology, can be easily produced
   from such bacteria in large quantities and with predetermined physical characteristics.
   Bacterial PSA is completely non-immunogenic, even when coupled to proteins, as it is
 5 chemically identical to PSA in the human body.
   Another technology include the use of hydroxyethyl starch ("HES") derivatives linked to
   antibodies. HES is a modified natural polymer derived from waxy maize starch and can be
   metabolized by the body's enzymes. HES solutions are usually administered to substitute
   deficient blood volume and to improve the rheological properties of the blood. Hesylation of
 0 an antibody enables the prolongation of the circulation half-life by increasing the stability of
   the molecule, as well as by reducing renal clearance, resulting in an increased biological
   activity. By varying different parameters, such as the molecular weight of HES, a wide range
   of HES antibody conjugates can be customized.
   Antibodies having an increased half-life in vivo can also be generated introducing one or more
 5 amino acid modifications (i.e., substitutions, insertions or deletions) into an IgG constant
   domain, or FcRn binding fragment thereof (preferably a Fc or hinge Fc domain fragment).
   See, e.g., International Publication No. WO 98/23289; International Publication No. WO
   97/34631; and U.S. Patent No. 6,277,375.
   Further, antibodies can be conjugated to albumin in order to make the antibody or antibody
 0 fragment more stable in vivo or have a longer half life in vivo. The techniques are well-known
   in the art, see, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 93/15199, WO 93/15200, and WO
   01/77137; and European Patent No. EP 413,622.
   The HER3 antibody or a fragment thereof may also be fused to one or more human serum
   albumin (HSA) polypeptides, or a portion thereof. HSA, a protein of 585 amino acids in its
25 mature form, is responsible for a significant proportion of the osmotic pressure of serum and
   also functions as a carrier of endogenous and exogenous ligands. The role of albumin as a
   carrier molecule and its inert nature are desirable properties for use as a carrier and transporter
   of polypeptides in vivo. The use of albumin as a component of an albumin fusion protein as a
   carrier for various proteins has been suggested in WO 93/15199, WO 93/15200, and EP 413
30 622. The use of N-terminal fragments of HSA for fusions to polypeptides has also been
   proposed (EP 399 666). Accordingly, by genetically or chemically fusing or conjugating the

       WO 2013/084147                                                              PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                      85
   antibodies or fragments thereof to albumin, can stabilize or extend the shelf-life, and/or to
   retain the molecule's activity for extended periods of time in solution, in vitro and/or in vivo.
   Fusion of albumin to another protein may be achieved by genetic manipulation, such that the
   DNA coding for HSA, or a fragment thereof, is joined to the DNA coding for the protein. A
 5 suitable host is then transformed or transfected with the fused nucleotide sequences, so
   arranged on a suitable plasmid as to express a fusion polypeptide. The expression may be
   effected in vitro from, for example, prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, or in vivo e.g. from a
   transgenic organism. Additional methods pertaining to HSA fusions can be found, for
   example, in WO 2001077137 and WO 200306007, incorporated herein by reference. In a
 o specific embodiment, the expression of the fusion protein is performed in mammalian cell
   lines, for example, CHO cell lines. Altered differential binding of an antibody to a receptor at
   low or high pHs is also contemplated to be within the scope of the invention. For example,
   the affinity of an antibody may be modified such that it remains bound to it's receptor at a low
   pH, e.g., the low pH within a lyzozome, by modifying the antibody to include additional
 5 amino acids such as a histine in a CDR of the antibody (See e.g., Tomoyuki Igawa et al.
   (2010) Nature Biotechnology; 28, 1203-1207).
   Antibody Conjugates
   The present invention provides antibodies or fragments thereof that specifically bind to a
   HER3 protein recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalent and
 0 non-covalent conjugations) to a heterologous protein or polypeptide (or fragment thereof,
   preferably to a polypeptide of at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least
   60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90 or at least 100 amino acids) to generate fusion proteins.
   In particular, the invention provides fusion proteins comprising an antibody fragment
   described herein (e.g., a Fab fragment, Fd fragment, Fv fragment, F(ab)2 fragment, a VH
25 domain, a VH CDR, a VL domain or a VL CDR) and a heterologous protein, polypeptide, or
   peptide. Methods for fusing or conjugating proteins, polypeptides, or peptides to an antibody
   or an antibody fragment are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,336,603,

   Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene-shuffling, motif
   shuffling, exon-shuffling, and/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as "DNA

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   86
   shuffling"). DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of antibodies of the
   invention or fragments thereof (e.g., antibodies or fragments thereof with higher affinities and
   lower dissociation rates). See, generally, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,605,793, 5,811,238, 5,830,721,

   287:265-76; and Lorenzo and Blasco, (1998) Biotechniques 24(2):308- 313 (each of these
   patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Antibodies or
   fragments thereof, or the encoded antibodies or fragments thereof, may be altered by being
   subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other
 o methods prior to recombination. A polynucleotide encoding an antibody or fragment thereof
   that specifically binds to a HER3 protein may be recombined with one or more components,
   motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.
   Moreover, the antibodies or fragments thereof can be fused to marker sequences, such as a
   peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence
 5 is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259
   Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, CA, 91311), among others, many of which are commercially
   available. As described in Gentz et al., (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821-824, for
   instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other
   peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the hemagglutinin ("HA")
 o tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein
   (Wilson et al., (1984) Cell 37:767), and the "flag" tag.
   In other embodiments, antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof conjugated to
   a diagnostic or detectable agent. Such antibodies can be useful for monitoring or prognosing
   the onset, development, progression and/or severity of a disease or disorder as part of a
25 clinical testing procedure, such as determining the efficacy of a particular therapy. Such
   diagnosis and detection can accomplished by coupling the antibody to detectable substances
   including, but not limited to, various enzymes, such as, but not limited to, horseradish
   peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; prosthetic

   to a therapeutic moiety. An antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated to a therapeutic
   moiety such as a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a
 o radioactive metal ion, e.g., alpha-emitters. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent
   that is detrimental to cells.
   Further, an antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety or drug
   moiety that modifies a given biological response. Therapeutic moieties or drug moieties are
   not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug
 5 moiety may be a protein, peptide, or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity.
   Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas
   exotoxin, cholera toxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, a
   interferon, 0-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue
   plasminogen activator, an apoptotic agent, an anti-angiogenic agent; or, a biological response
 o modifier such as, for example, a lymphokine. In one embodiment, the anti-HER3 antibody, or
   a fragment thereof, conjugated to a therapeutic moiety, such as a cytotoxin, a drug (e.g., an
   immunosuppressant) or a radiotoxin. Such conjugates are referred to herein as
   "immunoconjugates". Immunoconjugates that include one or more cytotoxins are referred to
   as "immunotoxins." A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to
25 (e.g., kills) cells. Examples include taxon, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide,
   emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, t. colchicin, doxorubicin,

 5 Other examples of therapeutic cytotoxins that can be conjugated to an antibody of the
   invention include duocarmycins, calicheamicins, maytansines and auristatins, and derivatives
   thereof. An example of a calicheamicin antibody conjugate is commercially available
   (MylotargTm; Wyeth-Ayerst).
   Cytoxins can be conjugated to antibodies of the invention using linker technology available in
 o the art. Examples of linker types that have been used to conjugate a cytotoxin to an antibody
   include, but are not limited to, hydrazones, thioethers, esters, disulfides and peptide
   containing linkers. A linker can be chosen that is, for example, susceptible to cleavage by low
   pH within the lysosomal compartment or susceptible to cleavage by proteases, such as
   proteases preferentially expressed in tumor tissue such as cathepsins (e.g., cathepsins B, C,
 5 D).

   Methods of Producing Antibodies of the Invention
   (i) Nucleic Acids Encoding the Antibodies
   The invention provides substantially purified nucleic acid molecules which encode
   polypeptides comprising segments or domains of the HER3-binding antibody chains
 5 described above. Some of the nucleic acids of the invention comprise the nucleotide sequence
   encoding the HER3 antibody heavy chain variable region, and/or the nucleotide sequence
   encoding the light chain variable region. In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid
   molecules are those identified in Table 1. Some other nucleic acid molecules of the invention
   comprise nucleotide sequences that are substantially identical (e.g., at least 65, 80%, 95%, or
 o 99%) to the nucleotide sequences of those identified in Table 1. When expressed from
   appropriate expression vectors, polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are capable of
   exhibiting HER3 antigen binding capacity.
   Also provided in the invention are polynucleotides which encode at least one CDR region and
   usually all three CDR regions from the heavy or light chain of the HER3-binding antibody set
 5 forth above. Some other polynucleotides encode all or substantially all of the variable region
   sequence of the heavy chain and/or the light chain of the HER3-binding antibody set forth
   above. Because of the degeneracy of the code, a variety of nucleic acid sequences will encode
   each of the immunoglobulin amino acid sequences.
   The nucleic acid molecules of the invention can encode both a variable region and a constant
 o region of the antibody. Some of nucleic acid sequences of the invention comprise nucleotides
   encoding a mature heavy chain variable region sequence that is substantially identical (e.g., at
   least 80%, 90%, or 99%) to the mature heavy chain variable region sequence of a HER3
   antibody set forth in Table 1. Some other nucleic acid sequences comprising nucleotide
   encoding a mature light chain variable region sequence that is substantially identical (e.g., at
25 least 80%, 90%, or 99%) to the mature light chain variable region sequence of a HER3
   antibody set forth in Table 1.
   The polynucleotide sequences can be produced by de novo solid-phase DNA synthesis or by
   PCR mutagenesis of an existing sequence (e.g., sequences as described in the Examples
   below) encoding an HER3-binding antibody or its binding fragment. Direct chemical
30 synthesis of nucleic acids can be accomplished by methods known in the art, such as the
   phosphotriester method of Narang et al., (1979) Meth. Enzymol. 68:90; the phosphodiester
   method of Brown et al., (1979) Meth. Enzymol. 68:109; the diethylphosphoramidite method

       WO 2013/084147                                                         PCT/IB2012/056949

   of Beaucage et al., (1981) Tetra. Lett., 22:1859; and the solid support method of U.S. Patent
   No. 4,458,066. Introducing mutations to a polynucleotide sequence by PCR can be
   performed as described in, e.g., PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA
   Amplification, H.A. Erlich (Ed.), Freeman Press, NY, NY, 1992; PCR Protocols: A Guide to
 5 Methods and Applications, Innis et al. (Ed.), Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1990; Mattila
   et al., (1991) Nucleic Acids Res. 19:967; and Eckert et al., (1991) PCR Methods and
   Applications 1:17.
   Also provided in the invention are expression vectors and host cells for producing the HER3
   binding antibodies described above. Various expression vectors can be employed to express
 o the polynucleotides encoding the HER3-binding antibody chains or binding fragments. Both
   viral-based and nonviral expression vectors can be used to produce the antibodies in a
   mammalian host cell. Nonviral vectors and systems include plasmids, episomal vectors,
   typically with an expression cassette for expressing a protein or RNA, and human artificial
   chromosomes (see, e.g., Harrington et al., (1997) Nat Genet 15:345). For example, nonviral
 5 vectors useful for expression of the HER3-binding polynucleotides and polypeptides in
   mammalian (e.g., human) cells include pThioHis A, B & C, pcDNA3.1/His, pEBVHis A, B
   & C, (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), MPSV vectors, and numerous other vectors known in the
   art for expressing other proteins. Useful viral vectors include vectors based on retroviruses,
   adenoviruses, adenoassociated viruses, herpes viruses, vectors based on SV40, papilloma
 o virus, HBP Epstein Barr virus, vaccinia virus vectors and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). See,
   Brent et al., (1995) supra; Smith, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 49:807; and Rosenfeld et al., (1992)
   Cell 68:143.
   The choice of expression vector depends on the intended host cells in which the vector is to be
   expressed. Typically, the expression vectors contain a promoter and other regulatory
25 sequences (e.g., enhancers) that are operably linked to the polynucleotides encoding an
   HER3-binding antibody chain or fragment. In some embodiments, an inducible promoter is
   employed to prevent expression of inserted sequences except under inducing conditions.
   Inducible promoters include, e.g., arabinose, lacZ, metallothionein promoter or a heat shock
   promoter. Cultures of transformed organisms can be expanded under noninducing conditions
30 without biasing the population for coding sequences whose expression products are better
   tolerated by the host cells. In addition to promoters, other regulatory elements may also be
   required or desired for efficient expression of an HER3-binding antibody chain or fragment.
   These elements typically include an ATG initiation codon and adjacent ribosome binding site

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    93
   or other sequences. In addition, the efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the
   inclusion of enhancers appropriate to the cell system in use (see, e.g., Scharf et al., (1994)
   Results Probl. Cell Differ. 20:125; and Bittner et al., (1987) Meth. Enzymol., 153:516). For
   example, the SV40 enhancer or CMV enhancer may be used to increase expression in
 5 mammalian host cells.
   The expression vectors may also provide a secretion signal sequence position to form a fusion
   protein with polypeptides encoded by inserted HER3-binding antibody sequences. More
   often, the inserted HER3-binding antibody sequences are linked to a signal sequences before
   inclusion in the vector. Vectors to be used to receive sequences encoding HER3-binding
 o antibody light and heavy chain variable domains sometimes also encode constant regions or
   parts thereof. Such vectors allow expression of the variable regions as fusion proteins with
   the constant regions thereby leading to production of intact antibodies or fragments thereof.
   Typically, such constant regions are human.
   The host cells for harboring and expressing the HER3-binding antibody chains can be either
 5 prokaryotic or eukaryotic. E. coli is one prokaryotic host useful for cloning and expressing
   the polynucleotides of the present invention. Other microbial hosts suitable for use include
   bacilli, such as Bacillus subtilis, and other enterobacteriaceae, such as Salmonella, Serratia,
   and various Pseudomonas species. In these prokaryotic hosts, one can also make expression
   vectors, which typically contain expression control sequences compatible with the host cell
 o (e.g., an origin of replication). In addition, any number of a variety of well-known promoters
   will be present, such as the lactose promoter system, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, a
   beta-lactamase promoter system, or a promoter system from phage lambda. The promoters
   typically control expression, optionally with an operator sequence, and have ribosome binding
   site sequences and the like, for initiating and completing transcription and translation. Other
25 microbes, such as yeast, can also be employed to express HER3-binding polypeptides of the
   invention. Insect cells in combination with baculovirus vectors can also be used.
   In some preferred embodiments, mammalian host cells are used to express and produce the
   HER3-binding polypeptides of the present invention. For example, they can be either a
   hybridoma cell line expressing endogenous immunoglobulin genes (e.g., the 1D6.C9
30 myeloma hybridoma clone as described in the Examples) or a mammalian cell line harboring
   an exogenous expression vector (e.g., the SP2/0 myeloma cells exemplified below). These
   include any normal mortal or normal or abnormal immortal animal or human cell. For
   example, a number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact immunoglobulins

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    94
   have been developed including the CHO cell lines, various Cos cell lines, HeLa cells,
   myeloma cell lines, transformed B-cells and hybridomas. The use of mammalian tissue cell
   culture to express polypeptides is discussed generally in, e.g., Winnacker, FROM GENES TO
   CLONES, VCH Publishers, N.Y., N.Y., 1987. Expression vectors for mammalian host cells
 5 can include expression control sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, and an
   enhancer (see, e.g., Queen et al., (1986) Immunol. Rev. 89:49-68), and necessary processing
   information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and
   transcriptional terminator sequences. These expression vectors usually contain promoters
   derived from mammalian genes or from mammalian viruses. Suitable promoters may be
 o constitutive, cell type-specific, stage-specific, and/or modulatable or regulatable. Useful
   promoters include, but are not limited to, the metallothionein promoter, the constitutive
   adenovirus major late promoter, the dexamethasone-inducible MMTV promoter, the SV40
   promoter, the MRP polIII promoter, the constitutive MPSV promoter, the tetracycline
   inducible CMV promoter (such as the human immediate-early CMV promoter), the
 5 constitutive CMV promoter, and promoter-enhancer combinations known in the art.
   Methods for introducing expression vectors containing the polynucleotide sequences of
   interest vary depending on the type of cellular host. For example, calcium chloride
   transfection is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells, whereas calcium phosphate treatment
   or electroporation may be used for other cellular hosts. (See generally Sambrook, et al.,
 o supra). Other methods include, e.g., electroporation, calcium phosphate treatment, liposome
   mediated transformation, injection and microinjection, ballistic methods, virosomes,
   immunoliposomes, polycation:nucleic acid conjugates, naked DNA, artificial virions, fusion
   to the herpes virus structural protein VP22 (Elliot and O'Hare, (1997) Cell 88:223), agent
   enhanced uptake of DNA, and ex vivo transduction. For long-term, high-yield production of
25 recombinant proteins, stable expression will often be desired. For example, cell lines which
   stably express HER3-binding antibody chains or binding fragments can be prepared using
   expression vectors of the invention which contain viral origins of replication or endogenous
   expression elements and a selectable marker gene. Following the introduction of the vector,
   cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media before they are switched to
30 selective media. The purpose of the selectable marker is to confer resistance to selection, and
   its presence allows growth of cells which successfully express the introduced sequences in
   selective media. Resistant, stably transfected cells can be proliferated using tissue culture
   techniques appropriate to the cell type.

                                                   95
    (ii) Generation of monoclonal antibodies of the invention
   Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be produced by a variety of techniques, including
   conventional monoclonal antibody methodology e.g., the standard somatic cell hybridization
   technique of Kohler and Milstein, (1975) Nature 256:495. Many techniques for producing
 5 monoclonal antibody can be employed e.g., viral or oncogenic transformation of B
   lymphocytes.
   An animal system for preparing hybridomas is the murine system. Hybridoma production in
   the mouse is a well established procedure. Immunization protocols and techniques for
   isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are known in the art. Fusion partners (e.g.,
 o murine myeloma cells) and fusion procedures are also known.
   Chimeric or humanized antibodies of the present invention can be prepared based on the
   sequence of a murine monoclonal antibody prepared as described above. DNA encoding the
   heavy and light chain immunoglobulins can be obtained from the murine hybridoma of
   interest and engineered to contain non-murine (e.g.,. human) immunoglobulin sequences
 5 using standard molecular biology techniques. For example, to create a chimeric antibody, the
   murine variable regions can be linked to human constant regions using methods known in the
   art (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 to Cabilly et al.). To create a humanized antibody, the
   murine CDR regions can be inserted into a human framework using methods known in the art.
   See e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5225539 to Winter, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5530101; 5585089;
 o 5693762 and 6180370 to Queen et al.
   In a certain embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are human monoclonal antibodies.
   Such human monoclonal antibodies directed against HER3 can be generated using transgenic
   or transchromosomic mice carrying parts of the human immune system rather than the mouse
   system. These transgenic and transchromosomic mice include mice referred to herein as
25 HuMAb mice and KM mice, respectively, and are collectively referred to herein as "human Ig
   mice."
   The HuMAb mouse* (Medarex, Inc.) contains human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that
   encode un-rearranged human heavy (g and y) and       K light chain immunoglobulin sequences,
   together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous g and     K chain loci (see e.g.,
30 Lonberg et al., (1994) Nature 368(6474): 856-859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced
   expression of mouse IgM or     K, and in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy
   and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high

   In another embodiment, human antibodies of the invention can be raised using a mouse that
   carries human immunoglobulin sequences on transgenes and transchomosomes such as a
   mouse that carries a human heavy chain transgene and a human light chain transchromosome.
   Such mice, referred to herein as "KM mice", are described in detail in PCT Publication WO
 o 02/43478 to Ishida et al.
   Still further, alternative transgenic animal systems expressing human immunoglobulin genes
   are available in the art and can be used to raise HER3-binding antibodies of the invention. For
   example, an alternative transgenic system referred to as the Xenomouse (Abgenix, Inc.) can
   be used. Such mice are described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,939,598; 6,075,181; 6,114,598;
25 6, 150,584 and 6,162,963 to Kucherlapati et al.
   Moreover, alternative transchromosomic animal systems expressing human immunoglobulin
   genes are available in the art and can be used to raise HER3-binding antibodies of the
   invention. For example, mice carrying both a human heavy chain transchromosome and a
   human light chain tranchromosome, referred to as "TC mice" can be used; such mice are
30 described in Tomizuka et al., (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:722-727. Furthermore,
   cows carrying human heavy and light chain transchromosomes have been described in the art
   (Kuroiwa et al., (2002) Nature Biotechnology 20:889-894) and can be used to raise HER3
   binding antibodies of the invention.

                                                 97
   Human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can also be prepared using phage display
   methods for screening libraries of human immunoglobulin genes. Such phage display methods
   for isolating human antibodies are established in the art or described in the examples below.
   See for example: U.S. Patent Nos. 5,223,409; 5,403,484; and 5,571,698 to Ladner et al.; U.S.
 5 Patent Nos. 5,427,908 and 5,580,717 to Dower et al.; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,969,108 and
   6,172,197 to McCafferty et al.; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,885,793; 6,521,404; 6,544,731;
   6,555,313; 6,582,915 and 6,593,081 to Griffiths et al.
   Human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can also be prepared using SCID mice into
   which human immune cells have been reconstituted such that a human antibody response can
 o be generated upon immunization. Such mice are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.
   5,476,996 and 5,698,767 to Wilson et al.
   (iii) Framework or Fc engineering
   Engineered antibodies of the invention include those in which modifications have been made
   to framework residues within VH and/or VL, e.g. to improve the properties of the antibody.
 5 Typically such framework modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity of the
   antibody. For example, one approach is to "backmutate" one or more framework residues to
   the corresponding germline sequence. More specifically, an antibody that has undergone
   somatic mutation may contain framework residues that differ from the germline sequence
   from which the antibody is derived. Such residues can be identified by comparing the
 o antibody framework sequences to the germline sequences from which the antibody is derived.
   To return the framework region sequences to their germline configuration, the somatic
   mutations can be "backmutated" to the germline sequence by, for example, site-directed
   mutagenesis. Such "backmutated" antibodies are also intended to be encompassed by the
   invention.
25 Another type of framework modification involves mutating one or more residues within the
   framework region, or even within one or more CDR regions, to remove T cell -epitopes to
   thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity of the antibody. This approach is also referred to
   as "deimmunization" and is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Publication No.
   20030153043 by Carr et al.
30 In addition or alternative to modifications made within the framework or CDR regions,
   antibodies of the invention may be engineered to include modifications within the Fc region,
   typically to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as serum half-life,

       WO 2013/084147                                                            PCT/IB2012/056949

   complement fixation, Fc receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.
   Furthermore, an antibody of the invention may be chemically modified (e.g., one or more
   chemical moieties can be attached to the antibody) or be modified to alter its glycosylation,
   again to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody. Each of these embodiments is
 5 described in further detail below. The numbering of residues in the Fc region is that of the EU
   index of Kabat.
   In one embodiment, the hinge region of CH 1 is modified such that the number of cysteine
   residues in the hinge region is altered, e.g., increased or decreased. This approach is
   described further in U.S. Patent No. 5,677,425 by Bodmer et al. The number of cysteine
 o residues in the hinge region of CHI is altered to, for example, facilitate assembly of the light
   and heavy chains or to increase or decrease the stability of the antibody.
   In another embodiment, the Fc hinge region of an antibody is mutated to decrease the
   biological half-life of the antibody. More specifically, one or more amino acid mutations are
   introduced into the CH2-CH3 domain interface region of the Fc-hinge fragment such that the
 5 antibody has impaired Staphylococcyl protein A (SpA) binding relative to native Fc-hinge
   domain SpA binding. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,165,745
   by Ward et al.
   In yet other embodiments, the Fc region is altered by replacing at least one amino acid residue
   with a different amino acid residue to alter the effector functions of the antibody. For
 o example, one or more amino acids can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such
   that the antibody has an altered affinity for an effector ligand but retains the antigen-binding
   ability of the parent antibody. The effector ligand to which affinity is altered can be, for
   example, an Fc receptor or the C1 component of complement. This approach is described in
   further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260, both by Winter et al.
25 In another embodiment, one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues can be
   replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has altered C Iq binding
   and/or reduced or abolished complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). This approach is
   described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,194,551 by Idusogie et al.
   In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues are altered to thereby alter the
30 ability of the antibody to fix complement. This approach is described further in PCT
   Publication WO 94/29351 by Bodmer et al.

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    99
   In yet another embodiment, the Fe region is modified to increase the ability of the antibody to
   mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to increase the affinity of the
   antibody for an Fcy receptor by modifying one or more amino acids. This approach is
   described further in PCT Publication WO 00/42072 by Presta. Moreover, the binding sites on
 5 human IgGI for FcyRl, FcyRII, FcyRIII and FcRn have been mapped and variants with
   improved binding have been described (see Shields et al., (2001) J. Biol. Chen. 276:6591
   6604).
   In still another embodiment, the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For example, an
   aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can
 o be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for "antigen'. Such
   carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of
   glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid
   substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework
   glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may
 5 increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further
   detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861 by Co et al.
   Additionally or alternatively, an antibody can be made that has an altered type of
   glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl
   residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered
 o glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies.
   Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the
   antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation
   machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express
   recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered
25 glycosylation. For example, EP 1,176,195 by Hang et al. describes a cell line with a
   functionally disrupted FUT8 gene, which encodes a fucosyl transferase, such that antibodies
   expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation. PCT Publication WO 03/035835 by
   Presta describes a variant CHO cell line, Lecl3 cells, with reduced ability to attach fucose to
   Asn(297)-linked carbohydrates, also resulting in hypofucosylation of antibodies expressed in
30 that host cell (see also Shields et al., (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740). PCT
   Publication WO 99/54342 by Umana et al. describes cell lines engineered to express
   glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl transferases (e.g., beta(1,4)-N acetylglucosaminyltransferase
   III (GnTIII)) such that antibodies expressed in the engineered cell lines exhibit increased

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949

   bisecting GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC activity of the antibodies (see
   also Umana et al., (1999) Nat. Biotech. 17:176-180).
   In another embodiment, the antibody is modified to increase its biological half-life. Various
   approaches are possible. For example, one or more of the following mutations can be
 5 introduced: T252L, T254S, T256F, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,277,375 to Ward.
   Alternatively, to increase the biological half life, the antibody can be altered within the CHI
   or CL region to contain a salvage receptor binding epitope taken from two loops of a CH2
   domain of an Fc region of an IgG, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,869,046 and 6,121,022
   by Presta et al.
 o  (iv) Methods of Engineering Altered Antibodies
   As discussed above, the HER3-binding antibodies having VH and VL sequences or full length
   heavy and light chain sequences shown herein can be used to create new HER3-binding
   antibodies by modifying full length heavy chain and/or light chain sequences, VH and/or VL
   sequences, or the constant region(s) attached thereto. Thus, in another aspect of the invention,
 5 the structural features of a HER3-binding antibody of the invention are used to create
   structurally related HER3-binding antibodies that retain at least one functional property of the
   antibodies of the invention, such as binding to human HER3 and also inhibiting one or more
   functional properties of HER3 For example, one or more CDR regions of the antibodies of
   the present invention, or mutations thereof, can be combined recombinantly with known
 o framework regions and/or other CDRs to create additional, recombinantly-engineered, HER3
   binding antibodies of the invention, as discussed above. Other types of modifications include
   those described in the previous section. The starting material for the engineering method is
   one or more of the VH and/or VL sequences provided herein, or one or more CDR regions
   thereof. To create the engineered antibody, it is not necessary to actually prepare (i.e., express
25 as a protein) an antibody having one or more of the VH and/or VL sequences provided herein,
   or one or more CDR regions thereof. Rather, the information contained in the sequence(s) is
   used as the starting material to create a "second generation" sequence(s) derived from the
   original sequence(s) and then the "second generation" sequence(s) is prepared and expressed
   as a protein.
30 Accordingly, in another embodiment, the invention provides a method for preparing a HER3
   binding antibody consisting of: a heavy chain variable region antibody sequence having a

   349, 355, 367, and 373; altering at least one amino acid residue within the heavy chain
   variable region antibody sequence and/or the light chain variable region antibody sequence to
   create at least one altered antibody sequence; and expressing the altered antibody sequence as
 o a protein.The altered antibody sequence can also be prepared by screening antibody libraries
   having fixed CDR3 sequences or minimal essential binding determinants as described in
   US20050255552 and diversity on CDR1 and CDR2 sequences. The screening can be
   performed according to any screening technology appropriate for screening antibodies from
   antibody libraries, such as phage display technology.
25 Standard molecular biology techniques can be used to prepare and express the altered
   antibody sequence. The antibody encoded by the altered antibody sequence(s) is one that
   retains one, some or all of the functional properties of the HER3-binding antibodies described
   herein, which functional properties include, but are not limited to, specifically binding to
   human and/or cynomologus HER3; the antibody binds to HER3 and neutralizes HER3
30 biological activity by inhibiting the HER signaling activity in a phospho-HER assay.
   The functional properties of the altered antibodies can be assessed using standard assays
   available in the art and/or described herein, such as those set forth in the Examples (e.g.,
   ELISAs).

       WO 2013/084147                                                         PCT/IB2012/056949

   In certain embodiments of the methods of engineering antibodies of the invention, mutations
   can be introduced randomly or selectively along all or part of an HER3-binding antibody
   coding sequence and the resulting modified HER3-binding antibodies can be screened for
   binding activity and/or other functional properties as described herein. Mutational methods
 5 have been described in the art. For example, PCT Publication WO 02/092780 by Short
   describes methods for creating and screening antibody mutations using saturation
   mutagenesis, synthetic ligation assembly, or a combination thereof. Alternatively, PCT
   Publication WO 03/074679 by Lazar et al. describes methods of using computational
   screening methods to optimize physiochemical properties of antibodies.
 o Characterization of the Antibodies of the Invention
   The antibodies of the invention can be characterized by various functional assays. For
   example, they can be characterized by their ability to neutralize biological activity by
   inhibiting HER signaling in a phospho-HER assay as described herein, their affinity to a
   HER3 protein (e.g., human and/or cynomologus HER3), the epitope binning, their resistance
 5 to proteolysis, and their ability to block HER3 downstream signaling. Various methods can
   be used to measure HER3 -mediated signaling. For example, the HER signaling pathway can
   be monitored by (i) measurement of phospho-HER3; (ii) measurement of phosphorylation of
   HER3 or other downstream signaling proteins (e.g. Akt), (iii) ligand blocking assays as
   described herein, (iv) heterodimer formation, (v) HER3 dependent gene expression signature,
 o (vi) receptor internalization, and (vii) HER3 driven cell phenotypes (e.g. proliferation).
   The ability of an antibody to bind to HER3 can be detected by labelling the antibody of
   interest directly, or the antibody may be unlabelled and binding detected indirectly using
   various sandwich assay formats known in the art.
   In some embodiments, the HER3-binding antibodies of the invention block or compete with
25 binding of a reference HER3-binding antibody to a HER3 polypeptide or protein. These can
   be fully human HER3-binding antibodies described above. They can also be other mouse,
   chimeric or humanized HER3 -binding antibodies which bind to the same epitope as the
   reference antibody. The capacity to block or compete with the reference antibody binding
   indicates that a HER3-binding antibody under test binds to the same or similar epitope as that
30 defined by the reference antibody, or to an epitope which is sufficiently proximal to the
   epitope bound by the reference HER3-binding antibody. Such antibodies are especially likely
   to share the advantageous properties identified for the reference antibody. The capacity to
   block or compete with the reference antibody may be determined by, e.g., a competition

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    103
   binding assay. With a competition binding assay, the antibody under test is examined for
   ability to inhibit specific binding of the reference antibody to a common antigen, such as a
   HER3 polypeptide or protein. A test antibody competes with the reference antibody for
   specific binding to the antigen if an excess of the test antibody substantially inhibits binding
 5 of the reference antibody. Substantial inhibition means that the test antibody reduces specific
   binding of the reference antibody usually by at least 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 90%.
   There are a number of known competition binding assays that can be used to assess
   competition of a HER3-binding antibody with the reference HER3-binding antibody for
   binding to a HER3 protein. These include, e.g., solid phase direct or indirect
 0 radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA),
   sandwich competition assay (see Stahli et al., (1983) Methods in Enzymology 9:242-253);
   solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see Kirkland et al., (1986) J. Immunol. 137:3614-3619);
   solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see Harlow &
   Lane, supra); solid phase direct label RIA using 1-125 label (see Morel et al., (1988) Molec.
 5 Immunol. 25:7-15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (Cheung et al., (1990) Virology
   176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al., (1990) Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77
   82). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or
   cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test HER3-binding antibody and a labelled
   reference antibody. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label
 o bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test antibody. Usually the test
   antibody is present in excess. Antibodies identified by competition assay (competing
   antibodies) include antibodies binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody and
   antibodies binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the
   reference antibody for steric hindrance to occur.
25 To determine if the selected HER3-binding monoclonal antibodies bind to unique epitopes,
   each antibody can be biotinylated using commercially available reagents (e.g., reagents from
   Pierce, Rockford, IL). Competition studies using unlabeled monoclonal antibodies and
   biotinylated monoclonal antibodies can be performed using a HER3 polypeptide coated
   ELISA plates. Biotinylated MAb binding can be detected with a strep-avidin-alkaline
30 phosphatase probe. To determine the isotype of a purified HER3-binding antibody, isotype
   ELISAs can be performed. For example, wells of microtiter plates can be coated with 1
   gg/ml of anti-human IgG overnight at 4'C. After blocking with 1% BSA, the plates are
   reacted with 1 gg/ml or less of the monoclonal HER3-binding antibody or purified isotype

        WO 2013/084147                                                       PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   104
   controls, at ambient temperature for one to two hours. The wells can then be reacted with
   either human IgGl or human IgM-specific alkaline phosphatase-conjugated probes. Plates are
   then developed and analyzed so that the isotype of the purified antibody can be determined.
   To demonstrate binding of monoclonal HER3-binding antibodies to live cells expressing a
 5 HER3 polypeptide, flow cytometry can be used. Briefly, cell lines expressing HER3 (grown
   under standard growth conditions) can be mixed with various concentrations of a HER3
   binding antibody in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 10% fetal calf serum, and incubated at
   4'C for 1 hour. After washing, the cells are reacted with Fluorescein-labeled anti-human IgG
   antibody under the same conditions as the primary antibody staining. The samples can be
 o analyzed by FACScan instrument using light and side scatter properties to gate on single cells.
   An alternative assay using fluorescence microscopy may be used (in addition to or instead of)
   the flow cytometry assay. Cells can be stained exactly as described above and examined by
   fluorescence microscopy. This method allows visualization of individual cells, but may have
   diminished sensitivity depending on the density of the antigen.
 5 HER3-binding antibodies of the invention can be further tested for reactivity with a HER3
   polypeptide or antigenic fragment by Western blotting. Briefly, purified HER3 polypeptides
   or fusion proteins, or cell extracts from cells expressing HER3 can be prepared and subjected
   to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the
   separated antigens are transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 10% fetal calf
 o serum, and probed with the monoclonal antibodies to be tested. Human IgG binding can be
   detected using anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase and developed with BCIP/NBT substrate
   tablets (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, MO).
   A number of readouts can be used to assess the efficacy, and specificity, of HER3 antibodies
   in cell-based assays of ligand-induced heterodimer formation. Activity can be assessed by one
25 or more of the following:
   (i) Inhibition of ligand-induced heterodimerisation of HER2 with other EGF family members
   in a target cell line, for example MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Immunoprecipitation of HER2
   complexes from cell lysates can be performed with a receptor-specific antibody, and the
   absence/presence of other EGF receptors and their biologically relevant ligands within the
30 complex can be analysed following electrophoresis/Western transfer by probing with
   antibodies to other EGF receptors.

        WO 2013/084147                                                            PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   105
   (ii) Inhibition of the activation of signaling pathways by ligand-activated heterodimers.
   Association with HER3 appears key for other members of the EGF family of receptors to
   elicit maximal cellular response following ligand binding. In the case of the kinase-defective
   HER3, HER2 provides a functional tyrosine kinase domain to enable signaling to occur
 5 following binding of growth factor ligands. Thus, cells co-expressing HER2 and HER3 can be
   treated with ligand, for example heregulin, in the absence and presence of inhibitor and the
   effect on HER3 tyrosine phosphorylation monitored by a number of ways including
   immunoprecipitation of HER3 from treated cell lysates and subsequent Western blotting using
   anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (see Agus op. cit. for details). Alternatively, a high
 o throughput assay can be developed by trapping HER3 from solubilized lysates onto the wells
   of a 96-well plate coated with an anti-HER3 receptor antibody, and the level of tyrosine
   phosphorylation measured using, for example, europium-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine
   antibodies, as embodied by Waddleton et al., (2002) Anal. Biochem. 309:150-157.
 5 In a broader extension of this approach, effector molecules known to be activated downstream
   of activated receptor heterodimers, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and
   Akt, may be analysed directly, by immunoprecipitation from treated lysates and blotting with
   antibodies that detect the activated forms of these proteins, or by analysing the ability of these
   proteins to modify/activate specific substrates.
 0
   (iii) Inhibition of ligand-induced cellular proliferation. A variety of cell lines are known to co
   express combinations of ErbB receptors, for example many breast and prostate cancer cell
   lines. Assays may be performed in 24/48/96-well formats with the readout based around DNA
   synthesis (tritiated thymidine incorporation), increase in cell number (crystal violet staining)
25 etc.
   A number of readouts can be used to assess the efficacy, and specificity, of HER3 antibodies
   in cell-based assays of ligand-independent homo-and heterodimer formation. For example,
   HER2 overexpression triggers ligand-independent activation of the kinase domain as a result
30 of spontaneous dimer formation. Over expressed HER2 generates either homo- or
   heterodimers with other HER molecules such as HERI, HER3 and HER4.

 5 Prophylactic and Therapeutic Uses
   The present invention provides methods of treating a disease or disorder associated with the
   HER3 signaling pathway by administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of
   the antibodies of the invention. In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a
   method of treating or preventing cancers (e.g., breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer,
 o multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, acute
   myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma,
   peripheral nerve sheath tumors, schwannoma, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer,
   esophageal cancer, Barretts esophageal cancer, glioblastoma, clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue,
   malignant mesothelioma, neurofibromatosis, renal cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, benign
 5 prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), gynacomastica, and endometriosis) by administering to a subject
   in need thereof an effective amount of the antibodies of the invention. In some embodiments,
   the present invention provides methods of treating or preventing cancers associated with a
   HER signaling pathway by administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of
   the antibodies of the invention.
 o In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides methods of treating cancers
   associated with a HER signaling pathway that include, but are not limited to breast cancer,
   colorectal cancer, lung cancer, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer,
   pancreatic cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma,
   squamous cell carcinoma, peripheral nerve sheath tumors schwannoma, head and neck cancer,
25 bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, Barretts esophageal cancer, glioblastoma, clear cell
   sarcoma of soft tissue, malignant mesothelioma, neurofibromatosis, renal cancer, melanoma,
   prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), gynacomastica, and endometriosis.
   In one embodiment, the invention pertains to treating esophageal cancer using the HER3
   antibodies or fragments thereof.
30 In one embodiment, the invention pertains to treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
   using the HER3 antibodies or fragments thereof. BHP is a common disease in aging males
   that is characterized by a non-neoplastic enlargement of the prostate leading to pressure on the

        WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   107
   urethra and resulting in urination and bladder problems (Mahapokail W, van Sluijs FJ &
   Schalken JA. 2000 Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases 3, 28-33). Anatomic or
   microscopic evidence of BPH is present at autopsy in approximately 55% of men aged 60- 70
   years. Transurethal resection of the prostate has been the treatment of choice for many years.
 5 Consequently, BPH is one of the most common reasons for surgical intervention among
   elderly men. Less invasive methods of treatment include:
   (i) Alpha 1-blockers (doxazosin, prazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin) are a class of
   medications also used to treat high blood pressure. These medications relax the muscles of the
   bladder neck and prostate thus allowing easier urination.
 o (ii) Finasteride and dutasteride lower androgen levels thus reducing the size of the prostate
   gland, increasing urine flow rate, and decreasing symptoms of BPH. It may take 3 to 6 months
   before improvement in symptoms is observed. Potential side effects related to the use of
   finasteride and dutasteride include decreased sex drive and impotence
   The results in the Experiments section demonstrate for the first time that BPH is a neuregulin
 5 dependent indication. The finding also show that MOR10703 significantly reduced prostate
   size in sexually mature rats without affecting hormone levels suggests that MOR10703 could
   be useful for the treatment of BPH.
   To further test MOR10703 and other HER3 antibodies as therapeutics for BPH, primary
   human BPH surgical specimens can be transplanted into athymic mice or rats and effect of the
 o Her3 antibodies studied using models (Otto U et al. Urol Int 1992; 48: 167 -170).
   Alternatively, aspects of BPH can be induced in castrated dogs via the long-term
   administration of 5a-Androstane-3a, 170-diol plus estradiol and the HER3 antibodies tested in
   these canine models (Walsh PC, Wilson JD. J Clin Invest 1976; 57: 1093 - 1097).
   In one embodiment, the invention pertains to treating gynecomastia using the HER3
25 antibodies or fragments thereof. The physical manifestation of gynecomastia is breast
   enlargement in males, it normally occurs in both breasts but can sometimes be in one only,
   known as asymmetrical or unilateral gynecosmastia. Gynecomastia is commonly caused by:
   (i) Elevated estrogen levels resulting in the ratio of testosterone to oestrogen becoming
   unbalanced.
30 (ii) Androgen antagonists or anti-androgens used in the treatment of prostate cancer or BPH.
   These drugs suppress testosterone but by suppressing testosterone, oestrogen begins to rise.

       WO 2013/084147                                                         PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                  108
   Although a number of experimental drugs are currently being evaluated there are currently no
   approved treatments for gynecomastia. Consequently gynecomastia is treated via surgical
   removal of the breast tissue. The observation that MOR10703 induced irreversible atrophy of
   the male mammary gland indicates that it may be of benefit in the treatment of gynecomastia.
 5 To further test MORI 0703 and other HER3 antibodies for treating human gynecomastia,
   transgenic mouse models of gynecomastia can be used. These models have been developed
   by expressing human aromatase in the mouse mammary gland and recapitulate many aspects
   of human gynecomastia (Li et al., Endocrinology 2002;143:4074-4083; Tekmal et al., Cancer
   Res 1996;56:3180-318).
 o In one embodiment, the invention pertains to treating gynecomastia using the HER3
   antibodies or fragments thereof. MOR10703 and other HER3 antibodies can also be examined
   for treating endometriosis, a gynecological condition in which cells from the lining of the
   uterus (endometrium) appear and flourish outside the uterine cavity. The main, but not
   universal, symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain in various manifestations. Although the
 5 underlying causes of endometriosis are not well characterized is thought to be dependent on
   the presence of estrogen. Since MOR10703 induced endometrial atrophy in female mice
   resulting in a decrease in uterus weight, it may be used to treat endometriosis. To further study
   the effects of MOR10703 and other HER3 antibodies on endometriosis, human endometrium
   in the proliferative phase can be implanted into the peritoneal cavity of normal cycling and
 o ovariectomized athymic mice or cycling non-obese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined
   immuno-deficiency (SCID) mice, and these SCID mice used as models (Grummer et al.,
   2001. Human Reproduction; 16; 1736-1743).
   HER3 antibodies can also be used to treat or prevent other disorders associated with aberrant
   or defective HER signaling, including but are not limited to respiratory diseases, osteoporosis,
25 osteoarthritis, polycystic kidney disease, diabetes, schizophrenia, vascular disease, cardiac
   disease, non-oncogenic proliferative diseases, fibrosis, and neurodegenerative diseases such as
   Alzheimer's disease.
   Suitable agents for combination treatment with HER3-binding antibodies include standard of
   care agents known in the art that are able to modulate the ErbB signaling pathway. Suitable
30 examples of standard of care agents for HER2 include, but are not limited to Herceptin and
   Tykerb. Suitable examples of standard of care agents for EGFR include, but are not limited to
   Iressa, Tarceva, Erbitux and Vectibix. Other agents that may be suitable for combination

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   109
   treatment with HER3-binding antibodies include, but are not limited to those that modulate
   receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, growth/ survival signal transduction
   pathways, nuclear hormone receptors, apoptotic pathways, cell cycle and angiogenesis.
   Diagnostic Uses
 5 In one aspect, the invention encompasses diagnostic assays for determining HER3 protein
   and/or nucleic acid expression as well as HER3 protein function, in the context of a biological
   sample (e.g., blood, serum, cells, tissue) or from individual afflicted with cancer, or is at risk
   of developing cancer.
   Diagnostic assays, such as competitive assays rely on the ability of a labelled analogue (the
 o "tracer") to compete with the test sample analyte for a limited number of binding sites on a
   common binding partner. The binding partner generally is insolubilized before or after the
   competition and then the tracer and analyte bound to the binding partner are separated from
   the unbound tracer and analyte. This separation is accomplished by decanting (where the
   binding partner was preinsolubilized) or by centrifuging (where the binding partner was
 5 precipitated after the competitive reaction). The amount of test sample analyte is inversely
   proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance.
   Dose-response curves with known amounts of analyte are prepared and compared with the test
   results in order to quantitatively determine the amount of analyte present in the test sample.
   These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers. In
 o an assay of this form, competitive binding between antibodies and HER3-binding antibodies
   results in the bound HER3 protein, preferably the HER3 epitopes of the invention, being a
   measure of antibodies in the serum sample, most particularly, neutralizing antibodies in the
   serum sample.
   A significant advantage of the assay is that measurement is made of neutralizing antibodies
25 directly (i.e., those which interfere with binding of HER3 protein, specifically, epitopes).
   Such an assay, particularly in the form of an ELISA test has considerable applications in the
   clinical environment and in routine blood screening.
   Another aspect of the invention provides methods for determining HER3 nucleic acid
   expression or HER3 protein activity in an individual to thereby select appropriate therapeutic
30 or prophylactic agents for that individual (referred to herein as "pharmacogenomics").
   Pharmacogenomics allows for the selection of agents (e.g., drugs) for therapeutic or
   prophylactic treatment of an individual based on the genotype of the individual (e.g., the

       WO 2013/084147                                                             PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    110
   genotype of the individual examined to determine the ability of the individual to respond to a
   particular agent.)
   Yet another aspect of the invention pertains to monitoring the influence of agents (e.g., drugs)
   on the expression or activity of HER3 protein in clinical trials.
 5 Pharmaceutical Compositions
   To prepare pharmaceutical or sterile compositions including a HER3-binding antibodies
   (intact or binding fragments), the HER3-binding antibodies (intact or binding fragments) is
   mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The compositions can
   additionally contain one or more other therapeutic agents that are suitable for treating or
 o preventing cancer (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, multiple myeloma, ovarian
   cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic
   myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, peripheral nerve sheath tumors
   schwannoma, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, Barretts esophageal
   cancer, glioblastoma, clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue, malignant mesothelioma,
 5 neurofibromatosis, renal cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia
   (BPH), gynacomastica, and endometriosis).
   Formulations of therapeutic and diagnostic agents can be prepared by mixing with
   physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers in the form of, e.g., lyophilized
   powders, slurries, aqueous solutions, lotions, or suspensions (see, e.g., Hardman et al., (2001)

   Selecting an administration regimen for a therapeutic depends on several factors, including the
   serum or tissue turnover rate of the entity, the level of symptoms, the immunogenicity of the
30 entity, and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. In certain embodiments,
   an administration regimen maximizes the amount of therapeutic delivered to the patient
   consistent with an acceptable level of side effects. Accordingly, the amount of biologic
   delivered depends in part on the particular entity and the severity of the condition being

   Determination of the appropriate dose is made by the clinician, e.g., using parameters or
   factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment or predicted to affect treatment.
   Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is
   increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved
 5 relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of
   symptoms of, e.g., the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced.
   Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the
   present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is

   A composition of the present invention may also be administered via one or more routes of
   administration using one or more of a variety of methods known in the art. As will be
 o appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending
   upon the desired results. Selected routes of administration for antibodies or fragments
   thereofof the invention include intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal,
   subcutaneous, spinal or other parenteral routes of administration, for example by injection or
   infusion. Parenteral administration may represent modes of administration other than enteral
 5 and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous,
   intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal,
   intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular,
   subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion. Alternatively, a
   composition of the invention can be administered via a non-parenteral route, such as a topical,
 o epidermal or mucosal route of administration, for example, intranasally, orally, vaginally,
   rectally, sublingually or topically. In one embodiment, the antibodies or fragments thereof of
   the invention is administered by infusion. In another embodiment, the multispecific epitope
   binding protein of the invention is administered subcutaneously.
25 If the antibodies or fragments thereof of the invention are administered in a controlled release
   or sustained release system, a pump may be used to achieve controlled or sustained release
   (see Langer, supra; Sefton, (1987) CRC Crit. Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:20; Buchwald et al.,
   (1980), Surgery 88:507; Saudek et al., (1989) N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574). Polymeric materials
   can be used to achieve controlled or sustained release of the therapies of the invention (see

   99/20253. Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not
   limited to, poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid),
 5 poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG),
   polyanhydrides, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide,
   poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and
   polyorthoesters. In one embodiment, the polymer used in a sustained release formulation is
   inert, free of leachable impurities, stable on storage, sterile, and biodegradable. A controlled
 0 or sustained release system can be placed in proximity of the prophylactic or therapeutic
   target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical
   Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)).
   Controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer, (1990), Science 249:1527
 5 1533). Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release
   formulations comprising one or more antibodies or fragments thereofof the invention. See,

   If the antibodies or fragments thereof of the invention are administered topically, they can be
25 formulated in the form of an ointment, cream, transdermal patch, lotion, gel, shampoo, spray,
   aerosol, solution, emulsion, or other form well-known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g.,
   Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 19th
   ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa. (1995). For non-sprayable topical dosage forms, viscous to
   semi-solid or solid forms comprising a carrier or one or more excipients compatible with
30 topical application and having a dynamic viscosity, in some instances, greater than water are
   typically employed. Suitable formulations include, without limitation, solutions, suspensions,
   emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, salves, and the like, which are, if desired,
   sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents (e.g., preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents,
   buffers, or salts) for influencing various properties, such as, for example, osmotic pressure.

   Other suitable topical dosage forms include sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the active
   ingredient, in some instances, in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier, is packaged
   in a mixture with a pressurized volatile (e.g., a gaseous propellant, such as freon) or in a
   squeeze bottle. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions
 5 and dosage forms if desired. Examples of such additional ingredients are well-known in the
   art.
   If the compositions comprising antibodies or fragments thereof are administered intranasally,
   it can be formulated in an aerosol form, spray, mist or in the form of drops. In particular,
 o prophylactic or therapeutic agents for use according to the present invention can be
   conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or
   a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant (e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane,
   trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas). In
   the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to
 5 deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges (composed of, e.g., gelatin) for use in an
   inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a
   suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.
   Methods for co-administration or treatment with a second therapeutic agent, e.g., a cytokine,
 o steroid, chemotherapeutic agent, antibiotic, or radiation, are known in the art (see, e.g.,
   Hardman et al., (eds.) (2001) Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of
   Therapeutics, 1O.sup.th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.; Poole and Peterson (eds.) (2001)
   Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice:A Practical Approach, Lippincott, Williams &
   Wilkins, Phila., Pa.; Chabner and Longo (eds.) (2001) Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy,
25 Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., Pa.). An effective amount of therapeutic may decrease
   the symptoms by at least 10%; by at least 20%; at least about 30%; at least 40%, or at least
   50%.
   Additional therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents), which can be administered in
30 combination with the antibodies or fragments thereofof the invention may be administered
   less than 5 minutes apart, less than 30 minutes apart, 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour apart, at
   about 1 to about 2 hours apart, at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart, at about 3 hours to
   about 4 hours apart, at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart, at about 5 hours to about 6 hours

   about 11 hours apart, at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart, at about 12 hours to 18 hours
   apart, 18 hours to 24 hours apart, 24 hours to 36 hours apart, 36 hours to 48 hours apart, 48
   hours to 52 hours apart, 52 hours to 60 hours apart, 60 hours to 72 hours apart, 72 hours to 84
 5 hours apart, 84 hours to 96 hours apart, or 96 hours to 120 hours apart from the antibodies or
   fragments thereofof the invention. The two or more therapies may be administered within one
   same patient visit.
   The antibodies or fragments thereofof the invention and the other therapies may be cyclically
 0 administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first therapy (e.g., a first
   prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time, followed by the administration of a
   second therapy (e.g., a second prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time,
   optionally, followed by the administration of a third therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic
   agent) for a period of time and so forth, and repeating this sequential administration, i.e., the
 5 cycle in order to reduce the development of resistance to one of the therapies, to avoid or
   reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and/or to improve the efficacy of the therapies.
   In certain embodiments, the antibodies or fragments thereofof the invention can be formulated
   to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes
 o many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the therapeutic compounds of the
   invention cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For
   methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and
   5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively
   transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g.,
25 Ranade, (1989) J. Clin. Pharmacol. 29:685). Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or
   biotin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,016 to Low et al); mannosides (Umezawa et al., (1988)
   Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153:1038); antibodies (Bloeman et al., (1995) FEBS Lett.
   357:140; Owais et al., (1995) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39:180); surfactant protein A

   comprising antibodies or fragments thereofof the invention alone or in combination with other

   therapies to a subject in need thereof. The therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents)
   of the combination therapies of the present invention can be administered concomitantly or
   sequentially to a subject. The therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) of the
   combination therapies of the present invention can also be cyclically administered. Cycling
 5 therapy involves the administration of a first therapy (e.g., a first prophylactic or therapeutic
   agent) for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second therapy (e.g., a second
   prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time and repeating this sequential
   administration, i.e., the cycle, in order to reduce the development of resistance to one of the
   therapies (e.g., agents) to avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies (e.g., agents),
 o and/or to improve, the efficacy of the therapies.
   The therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) of the combination therapies of the
   invention can be administered to a subject concurrently. The term "concurrently" is not
   limited to the administration of therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) at exactly
 5 the same time, but rather it is meant that a pharmaceutical composition comprising antibodies
   or fragments thereofof the invention are administered to a subject in a sequence and within a
   time interval such that the antibodies of the invention can act together with the other
   therapy(ies) to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For
   example, each therapy may be administered to a subject at the same time or sequentially in
 o any order at different points in time; however, if not administered at the same time, they
   should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or
   prophylactic effect. Each therapy can be administered to a subject separately, in any
   appropriate form and by any suitable route. In various embodiments, the therapies (e.g.,
   prophylactic or therapeutic agents) are administered to a subject less than 15 minutes, less
25 than 30 minutes, less than 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour to about 2 hours
   apart, at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart, at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart, at about
   4 hours to about 5 hours apart, at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart, at about 6 hours to
   about 7 hours apart, at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart, at about 8 hours to about 9 hours
   apart, at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart, at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart, at
30 about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart, 24 hours apart, 48 hours apart, 72 hours apart, or 1
   week apart. In other embodiments, two or more therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic
   agents) are administered to a within the same patient visit.
   The prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the combination therapies can be administered to a

   subject in the same pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively, the prophylactic or therapeutic
   agents of the combination therapies can be administered concurrently to a subject in separate
   pharmaceutical compositions. The prophylactic or therapeutic agents may be administered to
   a subject by the same or different routes of administration.
 5 The invention having been fully described, it is further illustrated by the following examples
   and claims, which are illustrative and are not meant to be further limiting.
                                               Examples
   Example 1: Methods, Materials and Screening for Antibodies
   (i) Cell Lines
 o BXPC-3, SK-Br-3, BT-474, MDA-MB-453, FaDu and MCF-7 cell lines were purchased from
   ATCC and routinely maintained in growth media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
   (FBS).
    (ii) Generation of Recombinant Human, Cyno, Mouse and Rat HER3 Vectors
   Murine HER3 extracellular domain was PCR amplified from mouse brain cDNA (Clontech)
 5 and sequence verified by comparison with Refseq NM_010153. Rat HER3 ECD was reverse
   transcribed from Rat-2 cell mRNA and sequence verified by comparison with NM_0 17218.
   Cynomolgus HER3 cDNA template was generated using RNA from various cyno tissues
   (Zyagen Laboratories), and the RT-PCR product cloned into pCR*-TOPO-XL (Invitrogen)
   prior to sequencing of both strands. Human HER3 was derived from a human fetal brain
20 cDNA library (Source) and sequence verified by comparison with NM_001982.
   To generate tagged recombinant proteins, human, mouse, rat and cyno HER3 was PCR
   amplified using Pwo Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). Amplified PCR products were gel
   purified and cloned into a pDonR201 (Invitrogen) gateway entry vector that had previously
   been modified to include an in-frame N-terminal CD33 leader sequence and a C-terminal
25 TAG, e.g., FLAG TAG. The TAG allows purification of monomeric proteins via an anti
   TAG monoclonal antibody. The target genes were flanked with AttB 1 and AttB2 allowing
   recombination into Gateway adapted proprietary destination vectors (e.g., pcDNA3.1) using
   the Gateway® cloning technology (Invitrogen). Recombination reactions were performed
   using a Gateway LR reaction with proprietary destination vectors containing a CMV promoter

      WO 2013/084147                                                        PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                    120
  to create the TAG expression vectors, although any commercially available vector can be
  used.
  Further recombinant HER3 proteins were generated that fused the HER3 ECD upstream of a
  C-terminal Factor X cleavage site and the human IgG hinge and Fc domain to create an Fc
5 tagged protein. To achieve this, the various HER3 ECD's were PCR amplified and cloned into
  a vector (e.g., pcDNA3. 1) modified to contain an in-frame C-terminal fusion of Factor X site
  Hinge-hFc. The generated open reading frame was flanked with AttB 1 and AttB2 sites for
  further cloning with the Gateway® recombinant cloning technology (Invitrogen). An LR
  Gateway reaction was used to transfer HER3-Fc into a destination expression construct
0 containing a CMV promoter. HER3 point mutation expression constructs were generated
  using standard site directed mutagenesis protocols and the resultant vectors sequence verified.

   (iii)Expression of Recombinant HER3 Proteins
   The desired HER3 recombinant proteins were expressed in HEK293 derived cell lines
   previously adapted to suspension culture and grown in a Novartis proprietary serum-free
   medium. Small scale expression verification was undertaken in transient 6-well-plate
 5 transfection assays on the basis of lipofection. Large-scale protein production via transient
   transfection and was performed at the 10- 20 L scale in the WaveTM bioreactor system (Wave
   Biotech). DNA Polyethylenimine (Polysciences) was used as a plasmid carrier at a ratio of 1:3
   (w:w). The cell culture supernatants were harvested 7-10 days post transfection and
   concentrated by cross-flow filtration and diafiltration prior to purification.
 0 (iv) Tagged ProteinPurification
   Recombinant tagged HER3 proteins (e.g., TAG-HER3) were purified by collecting the cell
   culture supernatant and concentrating 10-fold by cross-flow filtration with a 10 kDa cut off
   filter (Fresenius). An anti-TAG column was prepared by coupling an anti-TAG monoclonal
   antibody to CNBr activated Sepharose 4B at a final ratio of 10 mg antibody per mL of resin.
 5 Concentrated supernatant was applied to a 35ml anti-Tag column at a flow rate of 1- 2 mL/
   minute. After base-line washing with PBS, bound material was eluted with 100 mM glycine
   (pH 2.7), neutralized and sterile filtered. Protein concentrations were determined by
   measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and converting using a theoretical factor of 0.66 AU/ mg.
   The purified protein was finally characterized by SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequencing and LC
 0 MS.
   (v) Fc Tag Purification
   Concentrated cell culture supernatant was applied to a 50 ml Protein A Sepharose Fast Flow
   column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After baseline washing with PBS, the column was washed
   with 10 column volumes of 10 mM NaH 2PO 4/ 30% (v/v) Isopropanol, pH 7.3 followed by 5
25 column volumes of PBS. Finally, bound material was eluted with 50 mM Citrate/140 mM
   NaCl (pH 2.7), neutralized and sterile filtered.
   (vi) Generation of Over-ExpressingCell Lines
   To generate a cell line that expresses high levels of HER3 on the cell surface, a mammalian
   expression vector was constructed containing an insert coding for a CD33 leader sequence
30 upstream of amino acid residues 20-667 of human HER3 fused in-frame to amino acid

   chimeric protein contains an N-terminal HER3 extracellular and transmembrane domain and a
   C-terminal EGFR cytoplasmic domain. The HER3/1 vector was transfected into CHO-S cells
   (Invitrogen) and stable pools generated following antibiotic selection. The resultant cell line
   (CHO HER3/1) expressed high levels of HER3 extracellular domain on its cell surface.
 5 (vii) HuCAL GOLD® Pannings
   For the selection of antibodies recognizing human HER3 multiple panning strategies were
   employed. Therapeutic antibodies against human HER3 protein were generated by selection
   of clones having high binding affinities, using as the source of antibody variant proteins a
   commercially available phage display library, the MorphoSys HuCAL GOLD@ library. The
 o phagemid library is based on the HuCAL® concept (Knappik et al., (2000) J Mol Biol 296:57
   86) and employs the CysDisplay@ technology for displaying the Fab on the phage surface
   (WO01/05950 to Lohning).
   For the isolation of anti-HER3 antibodies, standard as well as RapMAT panning strategies
   were performed using solid phase, solution, whole cell and differential whole cell panning
 5 approaches.
   (viii) Solid PhasePanning
   To identify anti-HER3 antibodies a variety of solid phase panning strategies were performed
   using differing recombinant HER3 proteins. To perform each round of solid phase panning,
   Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated with HER3 protein. Tagged proteins were either captured
 0 using plates previously coated with anti-Fc (goat or mouse anti-human IgG, Jackson Immuno
   Research), anti-Tag antibody or via passive adsorption. The coated plates were washed with
   PBS and blocked. Coated plates were washed twice with PBS prior to the addition of HuCAL
   GOLD® phage-antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature on a shaker. Bound phages were
   eluted were added to E. coli TG- land incubated for phage infection. Subsequently infected
25 bacteria were isolated and plated on agar plates. Colonies were scraped off the plates and
   phages were rescued and amplified. Each HER3 panning strategy comprised of individual
   rounds of panning and contained unique antigens, antigen concentrations and washing
   stringency.
   (ix) Solution PhasePanning
30 Each round of solution phase panning was performed using various biotinylated recombinant
   HER3 proteins in the presence or absence of neuregulin 1-0 1 (R&D Systems). Proteins were

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                  123
   biotinylated using the EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC biotinylation kit (Pierce) according to the
   manufacturers instructions. 800gl of Streptavidin linked magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal)
   were washed once with PBS and blocked overnight with Chemiblocker (Chemicon). HuCAL
   GOLD® phage-antibodies and the appropriate biotinylated HER3 were incubated in a reaction
 5 tube. Streptavidin magnetic beads were added for 20 minutes and were collected with a
   magnetic particle separator (Dynal). Bound phages were eluted from the Dynabeads by adding
   DTT containing bufferto each tube and added to E. coli TG-1. Phage infection was performed
   in an identical manner to that described in solid phase panning. Each HER3 panning strategy
   comprised of individual rounds of panning and contained unique antigens, antigen
 o concentrations and washing stringency.
    (x) Cell based panning
   For cell pannings, HuCAL GOLD® phage-antibodies were incubated with approximately 107
   cells on a rotator for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by centrifugation.. The cell pellet
   was isolated phages were eluted from the cells The supernatant was collected and added to E.
 5 coli TG-1 culture continued by the process described above . Two cell based strategies were
   employed to identify anti-HER3 antibodies:
        a) Whole cell panning: In this strategy a variety of intact cell lines were used as the
            antigens.
        b) Differential whole cell panning: In this strategy the antigens sequentially consisted of
 0          cells and recombinant HER3 proteins (see 1981.09 as an example). The cell based
            pannings were performed as described above whilst solid phase panning protocols
            were employed when recombinant proteins were utilized as antigens. The washes were
            conducted using PBS (2-3X) and PBST (2-3X).
   (xi) RapMAT TM librarygeneration andpannings
25 In order to increase antibody binding affinity whilst maintaining library diversity the second
   round output of both solution and solid phase pannings were entered into the RapMAT TM
   process whilst the third round output of the whole cell and differential whole cell panning
   strategies were entered (Prassler et al., (2009) Immunotherapy; 1: 571-583. RapMAT TM
   libraries were generated by sub-cloning Fab-encoding inserts of phages selected via panning
30 into the display vector pMORPH*25_bla_LHCand were further digested to either generate H
   CDR2 RapMAT TM libraries and L-CDR3 RapMAT TM libraries by using specific restriction

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                  124
   enzymes. The inserts were replaced with TRIM maturation cassettes (Vimekas et al., (1994)
   Nucleic Acids Research 22:5600- 5607) for H-CDR2 or L-CDR3 according to pool
   composition. Library sizes were estimated to range between 8x10 6 -1x10     8 clones. RapMAT
   antibody-phage were produced and subjected to two further rounds of solution, solid phase or
 5 cell based panning using the experimental methods described previously.
   Example 2: Transient expression of anti-HER3 IgG's
   Suspension adapted HEK293-6E cells were cultivated in a BioWave20 to a density of
   approximately 2x 106 viable cells/ mL. The cells were transiently transfected with the relevant
   sterile DNA: PEI-MIX and further cultivated. Seven days after transfection, cells were
 o removed by crossflow filtration using Fresenius filters (0.2 tm). The cell free material was
   concentrated with crossflow filtration using a 1 OkDa cut off filter (Fresenius) and the
   concentrate was sterile filtered through a stericup filter (0.22 tm). The sterile supernatant was
   stored at 4'C.
   Example 3: Purification of anti-HER3 IgG
 5 The purification of IgG was performed on a AKTA 100 explorer Air chromatography system
   at 6'C in a cooling cabinet, using a XK16/20 column with 25 mL of self-packed MabSelect
   SuRe resin (all GE Healthcare). All flow rates were 3.5 mL/min, except for loading, at a
   pressure limit of 5 bar. The column was equilibrated with 3 column volumes of PBS prior to
   loading the filtered fermentation supernatant at 2.0 mL/min. The column was washed with 8
 0 column volumes of PBS. IgG was eluted with a pH gradient, starting at 50 mM citrate/70 mM
   NaCl (pH 4.5), going linearly down in 12 Column volumes to 50 mM citrate/70 mM NaCl
   (pH 2.5), followed by a 2 column volume constant step of the same pH 2.5 buffer. The IgG
   containing fractions were pooled and immediately neutralized and sterile filtered (Millipore
   Steriflip, 0.22 um). OD 2 8 0 was measured and the protein concentration calculated based on the
25 sequence data. The pools were separately tested for aggregation (SEC-MALS) and purity
   (SDS-PAGE and MS).
   Example 4: Expression and Purification of HuCAL@-Fab Antibodies in E. coli
   Expression of Fab fragments encoded by pMORPH@X9_FabMH in TG-1 cells was carried
   out in shaker flask cultures using 500 mL of 2x YT medium supplemented with 34 gg/mL
30 chloramphenicol. Cultures were shaken at 30 'C until the OD600nm reached 0.5. Expression
   was induced by addition of 0.75 mM IPTG (isopropyl-B-D-thiogalactopyranoside) for 20

        WO 2013/084147                                                      PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   125
   hours at 30 'C. Cells were disrupted using lysozyme. His 6-tagged Fab fragments were isolated
   via IMAC (Bio-Rad). Buffer exchange to 1x Dulbecco's PBS (pH 7.2) was performed using
   PD10 columns. Samples were sterile filtered (0.2 gm). Protein concentrations were
   determined by UV-spectrophotometry. The purity of the samples was analyzed in denaturing,
 5 reducing 15% SDS-PAGE. The homogeneity of Fab preparations was determined in native
   state by size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) with calibration standards
   Example 5: HER3 Antibody Affinity (KD) Measurements by Solution Equilibrium
   Titration (SET)
   Affinity determination in solution was essentially performed as previously described (Friguet
 0 et al., (1985) J Immunol Methods 77:305-19). In order to improve the sensitivity and accuracy
   of the SET method, it was transferred from classical ELISA to ECL based technology (Haenel
   et al., (2005) Anal biochem 339:182-84).
   Unlabeled HER3-Tag (human, rat, mouse or cyno) described previously was used for affinity
   determination by SET.
 5 The data was evaluated with XLfit software (ID Business Solutions) applying customized
   fitting models. For KD determination of each IgG the following model was used (modified
   according to Piehler, et al (Piehleret al., (1997) J Immunol Methods 201:189-206).

   Example 6: Antibody Cell Binding Determination by FACS
   The binding of antibodies to endogenous human antigen expressed on human cancer cells was
25 accessed by FACS. In order to determine antibody EC50 values SK-Br-3 cells were harvested

       WO 2013/084147                                                        PCT/IB2012/056949

   with accutase and diluted to 1 x10 6 cells/mL in FACS buffer (PBS/ 3% FBS/ 0.2% NaN 3). 1
   x10 5 cells/ well were added to each well of a 96-well plate (Nunc) and centrifuged at 210 g for
   5 minutes at 4 'C before removing the supernatant. Serial dilutions of test antibodies (diluted
   in 1:4 dilution steps with FACS buffer) were added to the pelleted cells and incubated for 1
 5 hour on ice. The cells were washed and pelleted three times with 100 gL FACS buffer. PE
   conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1/200 with FACS buffer
   were added to the cells and incubated on ice for 1 hour. Additional washing steps were
   performed three times with 100 gL FACS buffer followed by centrifugation steps at 210 g for
   5 minutes at 4'C. Finally, cells were resuspended in 200 gL FACS buffer and fluorescence
 o values were measured with a FACSArray (BD Biosciences). The amount of cell surface
   bound anti-HER3 antibody was assessed by measuring the mean channel fluorescence.
   Example 7: HER3 Domain and Mutant Binding
   96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 'C with 200 ng of the appropriate
   recombinant human protein (HER3-Tag, D1-2- Tag, D2- Tag, D3-4- Tag, D4- Tag, HER3
 5 K267A- Tag, HER3 L268A-Tag, HER3 K267A/ L268A and a tagged irrelevant control). All
   wells were then washed three times with PBS/ 0.l1% Tween-20, blocked for one hour with
   PBS/ 1% BSA/ 0. 1% Tween-20 and washed three times with PBS/ 0. 1% Tween-20. Anti
   HER3 antibodies were added to the relevant wells up to a final concentration of 10 gg/mL
   were added to the appropriate wells and incubated at room temperature for two hours. Plates
 0 were washed three times with PBS/ 0.l1% Tween-20 prior to the addition of the appropriate
   peroxidase linked detection antibody diluted 1/10000 in PBS/ 1%BSA/ 0.l1% Tween-20. The
   detection antibodies used were goat anti-mouse (Pierce, 31432), rabbit anti-goat (Pierce,
   31402) and goat anti-human (Pierce, 31412). Plates were incubated at room temperature for
   one hour before washing three times with PBS/ 0.l1% Tween-20. 100 gl TMB (3,3', 5,5'
25 tetramethyl benzidine) substrate solution (BioFx) was added to all wells for 6 minutes before
   stopping the reaction with 50 gl 2.5% H 2 SO 4 . The extent of HER3 antibody binding to each
   recombinant protein was determined by measuring the OD 4 50 using a SpectraMax plate reader
   (Molecular Devices). Where appropriate, dose response curves were analzyed using Graphpad
   Prism.

   Example 8: HER3 Epitope Mapping Using Hydrogen/ Deuterium Exchange Mass
   Spectrometry
   Materials
   D2 0 buffer was made by dissolving 25 mM TBS (pH 7.5)/ 500 mM NaCl in heavy water
 5 (Sigma). The reduction solution was 50mM formate buffer (pH 4) 500mM TCEP and the
   quenching solution 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water. Buffer A was 0.25%
   formic acid/ 10% methanol/ 10% ethylene glycol in water, and buffer B was 0.25 % formic
   acid in acetonitrile. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, and HPLC grade solvents
   were from Fisher Scientific.
 o Liquid Handlingand Chromatography
   Automated hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX MS) experiments were
   designed based upon methods and equipment described by Wales et al., (2006) Anal. Chem.
   78:1005-1014). In short, all liquid handling operations used a Pal HTS liquid-handler (LEAP
   Technologies) housed in a refrigerated enclosure maintained at 20 C. A 6-port injection valve
 5 and a wash station were mounted on the liquid-handler rail and facilitated sample injection
   into the chromatographic system and syringe washing. The chromatographic system,
   consisted of an additional 10-port valve, a 2.1 mm x 30 mm Poroszyme pepsin column
   (Applied Biosystems), a reverse-phase 0.5 mm x 2 mm Cap Trap cartridge (Michrom
   Bioresources), and a self-packed electrospray emitter as analytical column (100 gm x ~60
 0 mm, Kinetex 2.6 gm C18, Phenomenex). The 10-port valve head, the trap cartridge and the
   analytical column were housed in a separate enclosure constructed from aluminum and
   maintained at -50 C by peltier stacks. Valves and columns were configured in such a way as to
   allow in-line protein digestion, peptide desalting, and reversed-phase chromatography prior to
   introduction of the sample into the electrospray ionization (ESI) source of the mass
25 spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific).
   The fluid streams required for operation were provided by two separate HPLC pumps. The
   first HPLC (Surveyor MS pump, Thermo Scientific) delivered buffer A at a constant flow rate
   of 125 gL/min and was used to transfer sample through the immobilized pepsin cartridge onto
   the reversed-phase trap cartridge mounted across the 10-port valve. After the loading and
30 desalting period, the 10-port valve was switched to elute the sample with the help of a
   gradient pump (AQUITY UPLC, Waters) from the reversed-phase trap cartridge, through the
   analytical column and into the ion source of the mass spectrometer. The immobilized enzyme

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                  128
   cartridge was isolated to waste during gradient elution. The gradient pump delivered linear
   gradient segments of 0 to 40% mobile phase B over 35 minutes at 5 gL/min and 40 to 95%
   mobile phase B at 5 gL/min over 10 minutes. The gradient flow from the pump was split at
   the 10-port valve using a passive splitter so that the actual flow through the trap cartridge and
 5 analytical column for gradient elution was 1 gL/min. The entire chromatographic run was 70
   minutes long including washing and equilibration steps.
   Mass Spectrometry
   For the purpose of identification of proteolytic fragments resulting from online digestion
   several data-dependent MS/MS experiments were performed. For these acquisitions, tandem
 o MS spectra were acquired with the LTQ analyzer of the LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid mass
   spectrometer. Precursor mass selection was based on MS scans acquired by the Orbitrap
   analyzer. Single stage MS acquisitions performed for the purpose of deuteration level
   determination were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 by the Orbitrap (over m/z 400-2000)
   analyzer.
 5 Preparationof Protein and Protein:FabComplexes
   HER3 protein was prepared by diluting 50 gg HER3-Tag with 25 mM TBS (pH 7.5)/ 500 mM
   NaCl to yield a final volume of 50 gL. Protein:Fab complexes were prepared by mixing 50 gg
   HER3-Tag in a 1:1 molar ratio with the Fab's studied. Protein:Fab mixtures were then diluted
   to a final volume of 50 gL with 25 mM TBS (pH 7.5)/ 500 mM NaCl.
 o Protein:Fab complexes were prepared and allowed to incubate for at least 2 hours at 40C. Four
   96-well plates containing sample, diluent, quench, and reduction solutions were loaded into
   the liquid-handler before the start of each experimental. For on-exchange experiments 50 gL
   of HER3 or HER3:Fab complex was diluted with 150 gL D2 0 buffer. The mixture was
   reduced by adding 200 gL reduction buffer for 1 minute before quenching with 600 gL of
25 quench buffer. The total volume after all liquid handling steps was 1ImL. Once mixed, the
   quenched solution was injected into the chromatographic system where it was automatically
   digested, separated and analyzed by LCMS. The average change in deuteration between
   sample and control was calculated as the difference between the deuterium uptake levels of
   the sample and control.

   Data Processing
   The Orbitrap RAW files were converted into mzXML files using an in-house program
   (RawXtract). Subsequently, tandem MS acquisitions were searched using SEQUEST (Yates
   Lab, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and search results were automatically filtered
 5 using DTASelect 2.0 (Yates Lab, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Using the peptide
   sequence identifications, an in-house written program was used to automatically extract
   single-ion chromatograms for each identified sequence and generate average spectra across
   the chromatographic peak. Average spectra were smoothed and centroided. The level of
   deuterium uptake was taken as the difference in mass between a deuterated sample and non
 o deuterated reference. Processed data was manually validated and adjusted to correct
   inaccuracies and errors from automated processing steps. Deuterium uptake levels were
   assigned to each residue of the protein sequence by delocalizing the deuterium content across
   each peptide (i.e., dividing the observed deuteration level by the number of amino acids in
   that peptide). If a residue was covered by more than one peptide, the normalized deuterium
 5 uptakes of all peptides covering that residue were averaged.
   Example 9: X-ray crystallographic structure determination of the human HER3/
   MOR09823 Fab and human HER3/MOR09825 Fab complexes
   The present example presents the crystal structure of full length HER3 bound to the Fab
 o fragment of MOR09823 and the Fab fragment of MOR09825, determined at 3.2A and 3.4A
   resolution, respectively. Tagged human HER3 was further purified on a HiLoad 26/60
   Superdex 200 PrepGrade column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS (pH 7.3). E. coli
   expressed MOR09823 and MOR09825 Fabs were isolated by lysing cells with lysozyme and
   His6 -tagged Fab fragments were captured on a HisTrapHP (GE Healthcare) column.
25 MOR09823 Fab-fragments were further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a
   Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM
   NaCl.
   HER3 Fab complexes were prepared by mixing excess Fab with tagged HER3 in a molar
   ratios of 1.3-1.8:1 (concentration estimated by absorbance at 280 nm using calculated
30 extinction coefficients of 0.9 and 1.4 (mg/ml)-lcm- 1 for HER3 and Fab, respectively) and
   purifying the complexes on a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in
   25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and

       WO 2013/084147                                                        PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                 130
   LCMS. For each complex, fractions containing both HER3 and Fab in an approximate
   equimolar ratio were pooled and concentrated. HER3/MOR09823 crystals were grown at
   293K by sitting drop vapor diffusion from drops containing 150 nl HER3/ MOR09823
   complex and 150 nl of reservoir solution (100 mM sodium citrate pH 5.6, 20% PEG 4000 and
 5 20% isopropanol). Crystals were transferred to reservoir solution containing additional 8%
   glycerol and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. HER3/MOR09825 crystals were grown at 293K
   by sitting drop vapor diffusion from drops containing 150 nl HER3/ MOR09825 complex and
   150 nl of reservoir solution (100 mM bis-tris pH 6.5, 16% PEG 10,000). Crystals were
   transferred to 100 mM bis-tris pH 6.5, 18% PEG 10,000 and 22% glycerol and flash cooled in
 o liquid nitrogen.
   Data were collected at beamline 17-ID at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National
   Laboratory). HER3/MOR09823 Fab complex data were processed and scaled at 3.2A using
   HKL2000 (HKL Research Inc) in space group 1222 with cell dimensions a=124.16, b=139.44,
   c=180.25 A, with good statistics. The HER3/ MOR09823 Fab structure was solved by
 5 molecular replacement using Phaser (McCoy et al., (2007) J. Appl. Cryst. 40:658-674) with
   fragments of a Fab and the published HER3 ECD structure 1mb6 as search models. The final
   model, which contains 1 molecule of the HER3/MOR09823 Fab complex per asymmetric
   unit, was built in COOT (Emsley & Cowtan (2004) Acta Cryst. 60:2126-2132) and refined to
   R and Rfree values of 19.0 and 24.5%, respectively, with an rmsd of 0.010 A and 1.37' for
 o bond lengths and bond angles, respectively, using BUSTER (Global Phasing, LTD). Residues
   of HER3 that contain atoms within 5A of any atom in MOR09823 Fab as identified in
   PyMOL (Schr6dinger, LLC) are listed in Tables 11 and 12. HER3/MOR09825 Fab complex
   data were processed and scaled at 3.4A using autoPROC (Global Phasing, LTD) in space
   group 1222 with cell dimensions a=124.23, b=140.94, c=180.25 A, with good statistics. The
25 HER3/ MOR09825 Fab structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (McCoy
   et al., (2007) J. Appl. Cryst. 40:658-674) with the HER3/MOR09823 Fab structure as a search
   model. The final model, which contains 1 molecule of the HER3/MOR09825 Fab complex
   per asymmetric unit, was built in COOT (Emsley & Cowtan (2004) Acta Cryst. 60:2126
   2132) and refined to R and Rfree values of 18.8 and 24.9%, respectively, with an rmsd of 0.009
30 A and 1.21' for bond lengths and bond angles, respectively, using BUSTER (Global Phasing,
   LTD). Residues of HER3 that contain atoms within 5A of any atom in MOR09825 Fab as
   identified in PyMOL (Schr6dinger, LLC) are listed in Tables 13 and 14.

   Example 10: Phospho-HER3 in vitro cell assays.
   MCF-7 cells were routinely maintained in DMEM/F 12, 15mM HEPES, L-glutamine, 10%
   FCS and SK-Br-3 in McCoy's 5a, 10% FCS, 1.5mM L-glutamine. Sub-confluent MCF7 or
   SK-Br-3 cells grown in complete media were harvested with accutase (PAA Laboratories) and
 5 resuspended in the appropriate growth media at a final concentration of 5x 10 5 cells/ mL. 100
   ptL of cell suspension was then added to each well of a 96-well flat bottomed plate (Nunc) to
   give a final density of 5x 104 cells/ well. MCF7 cells were allowed to attach for approximately
   3 hours before the media was exchanged for starvation media containing 0.5% FBS. All plates
   were then incubated overnight at 37 0 C prior to treatment with the appropriate concentration of
 0 HER3 antibodies (diluted in the appropriate media) for 80 minutes at 37 0 C. MCF7 cells were
   treated with 50 ng/mL neuregulin 1-0 1 EGF domain (R&D Systems) for the final 20 minutes
   to stimulate HER3 phosphorylation. All media was gently aspirated and the cells washed with
   ice-cold PBS containing 1mM CaCl 2 and 0.5 mM MgCl 2 (Gibco). The cells were lysed by
   adding 50 [tL ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH8.0)/ 137 mM NaCl/ 10% Glycerol/ 2mM
 5 EDTA/ 1% NP-40/ 1 mM sodium orthovanadate/, Aprotinin (1Ogg/mL)/ Leupeptin
   (1Ogg/mL)) and incubated on ice with shaking for 30 minutes. Lysates were then collected
   and spun at 1800 g for 15 minutes at 4'C to remove cell debris. 20 piL of lysate was added to a
   pre-prepared capture plate.
   HER3 capture plates were generated using a carbon plate (Mesoscale Discovery) coated
 0 overnight at 4'C with 20 ptL of 4 [tg/mL MAB3481 capture antibody (R&D Systems) diluted
   in PBS and subsequently blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in 1x Tris buffer (Mesoscale
   Discovery)/ 0.l1% Tween-20. HER3 was captured from the lysate by incubating the plate at
   room temperature for one hour with shaking before the lysate was aspirated and the wells
   washed with 1x Tris buffer (Mesoscale Discovery)/ 0.l1% Tween-20. Phosphorylated HER3

   For proliferation assays MCF-7 cells were routinely cultured in DMEM/ F 12 (1:1) containing
 5 4 mM L-Glutamine/ 15mM HEPES/ 10% FBS. Sub-confluent cells were trypsinized, washed

   Glutamine/ 15mM HEPES/ 10 [tg/mL Human Transferrin/ 0.2% BSA. Cells were plated in
   96-well clear bottom black plates (Costar) at a density of 5000 cells/ well. The appropriate
   concentration of HER3 antibody (typical final concentrations of 10 or 1 [ig/mL) was then
 o added. 10 ng/mL of NRG1-0 1 EGF domain (R&D Systems) was also added to the appropriate
   wells to stimulate cell growth. The plates were returned to the incubator for 6 days before
   assessing cell viability using CellTiter-Glo (Promega). The extent of growth inhibition
   obtained with each antibody was calculated by subtracting the background (no neuregulin)
   luminscence values and comparing the resulting values obtained with each anti-HER3
 5 antibody to a standard isotype control antibody (MOR0639 1).
   Example 13: Ligand blocking cell assays
   MCF-7 cells cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 [ig/mL insulin (Sigma)
   were rinsed and collected in a small volume of FACSmax cell dissociation buffer (Genlantis)
   prior to the addition of 5 mL of FACS buffer (PBS/ 1% FBS/ 0.1% sodium azide). The cell
 o density was counted and adjusted to a final concentration of 1 x10 6 cells/ mL. 100 [tl of cell
   suspension was added to each well of a 96-well plate and the cells pelleted via centrifugation
   (220g, 3 minutes, 4'C). Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 [iL of the appropriate test
   antibodies diluted in FACS buffer (typical final antibody concentrations ranged from 100 to
   0.1 nM) and the plate incubated on ice for 45 minutes. The ligand blocking antibody
25 MAB3481 (R&D Systems) was included as a positive control. Cells were washed twice with
   staining buffer prior to adding 10 nM NRG1- 01 EGF domain (R&D Systems) diluted in
   FACS buffer and incubating on ice for 45 minutes. Cells were washed twice with staining
   buffer and bound neuregulin detected by incubating the cells with 10 nM anti-human NRG1

   10,000 live cells were counted on a LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and the amount
   of cell surface bound neuregulin was assessed by measuring the mean channel fluorescence.
   Example 14: Ligand blocking biochemical assay
   The present method includes utility of a Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor
 5 (Biacore T M ' GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) to examine the ability of HER3/ antibody
   complexes to bind neuregulin.
   Biacore T M utilizes the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to detect and
   measure binding interactions. In a typical Biacore experiment, one of the interacting
   molecules (neuregulin) is immobilized on a matrix while the interacting partner (HER3) is
 o flowed over the surface. A binding interaction results in an increase in mass on the sensor
   surface and a corresponding direct change in the refractive index of the medium in the vicinity
   of the sensor surface. Changes in refractive index or signal are recorded in resonance units
   (R.U.) Signal changes due to association and dissociation of complexes are monitored in a
   non-invasive manner, continuously and in real-time, the results of which are reported in the
 5 form of a sensorgram.
   BiacoreTM T100 (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to conduct all experiments
   reported herein. Sensor surface preparation and interaction analyses were performed at 25 0C.
   Buffer and Biacore reagents were purchased from GE Healthcare. Running buffer containing
   1OmM Hepes, pH7.4/ 150mM NaCl, 0.05% P20, 0.5% BSA was utilized throughout the
 o assay.
   NRG-1 31 extracellular domain (R&D Systems) was incubated on ice for 45 minutes with EZ
   link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce) at a molar ratio of 5:1. The reaction was quenched via
   the addition excess ethanolamine and uncoupled biotin removed from the biotinylated-NRG
   using desalt spin columns (Zeba). Biotinylated-NRG was captured onto a sensor chip CAP
25 pre-immobilized with approximately 3000 R.U. of ssDNA-streptavidin (Biotin CAPture kit)
   to yield neuregulin surface densities in the range 400 - 600 R.U. A reference flowcell was
   generated by omitting biotinylated-NRG from the injection steps such that only ssDNA
   streptavidin was present on the flowcell surface.
   HER3/ antibody complexes were generated by incubating 1OnM human HER3-Fc with
30 increasing concentrations (0 - 50nM) of the appropriate test antibody for 15 minutes at room
   temperature prior to incubating in the Biacore TM at 1 o0C. Interaction analyses were performed

   by injecting HER3/ antibody complexes over reference and neuregulin surfaces in series for
   180 seconds at a flow-rate of 60pL/min. Complex dissociation was monitored for 180 seconds
   at a flow rate of 60pL/min. Surface regeneration was performed at the end of each analysis
   cycle using a 120 second injection of 8M guanidine: IM NaOH (3:1) followed by a 120
 5 second injection of 30% acetonitrile/ 0.25M NaOH at a flow rate of 30pL/min.
   Example 15: In vivo PD studies
   BxPC3 and BT-474cells were cultured and implanted in female athymic nu/nu Balb/C mice
   (Harlan Laboratories) as described in Examples 16 and 17.
   Once tumors had reached an appropriate size, animals were examined for tumor quality.
 0 Animals with ulcerated tumors or animal with fluid-filled tumors were excluded from the
   study. The remaining animals were dosed intravenously with antibody via lateral tail vein
   injection. At the given time points, animals were euthanized via CO 2 asphyxiation and whole
   blood was collected via cardiac puncture and placed into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf collection tube.
   Tumor tissue was immediately dissected, placed into a screw-top polypropylene sample tube
 5 and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue was stored at -80 0 C until lysates were prepared.
   Example 16: In vivo BT-474 efficacy studies
   BT-474 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
   without antibiotics until the time of implantation.
   One day before cell inoculation, female athymic nu/nu Balb/C mice (Harlan Laboratories)
20 were implanted subcutaneously with a sustained release 17p-estradiol pellet (Innovative
   Research of America) to maintain serum estrogen levels. One day after 17p-estradiol pellet
   implantation, 5  x10 6 cells were injected orthotopically into the 4 th mammary fatpad in a
   suspension containing 50% phenol red-free matrigel (BD Biosciences) in Hank's balanced
   salt solution. The total injection volume containing cells in suspension was 200 tL. 20 days
25 following cell implantation animals with a tumor volume of approximately 200 mm were
   enrolled in the efficacy study. In general, a total of 10 animals per group were enrolled in
   efficacy studies.
   For single-agent studies, animals were dosed intravenously via lateral tail vein injection with
   either MOR10701 or MOR10703. An initial loading dose of 40 mg/kg was given for the first
30 dose. After the initial dose, animals were on a 20 mg/kg, every other day schedule for the

   duration of the study. For combination studies, animals were dosed with either MOR10701 or
   MOR10703 (20mg/kg, iv, q2d) and a sub-optimal dose of trastuzumab (1mg/kg, iv, 2qw).
   For the duration of the studies, tumor volume was measured by calipering twice per week.
   Percent treatment/ control (T/C) values were calculated using the following formula:
 5 % T/C = 100 x AT/AC if AT >0
   where:
   T =  mean tumor volume of the drug-treated group on the final day of the study;
   AT   = mean tumor volume of the drug-treated group on the final day of the study - mean
   tumor volume of the drug-treated group on initial day of dosing;
 0 C  = mean tumor volume of the control group on the final day of the study; and
   AC   = mean tumor volume of the control group on the final day of the study - mean tumor
   volume of the control group on initial day of dosing.
   Body weight was measured twice per week and dose was body weight adjusted. The %
   change in body weight was calculated as (BWcurrent -   BWinitial)/(BWinitial) x 100. Data is
 5 presented as percent body weight change from the day of treatment initiation.
   All data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Delta tumor volume
   and body weight were used for statistical analysis. Between groups comparisons were carried
   out using a one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey. For all statistical evaluations the
   level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Significance compared to the vehicle control group is
20 reported.

   of 10 animals per group were enrolled in studies. Animals were excluded from enrollment if
   they exhibited unusual tumor growth characteristics prior to enrollment.
   Animals were dosed intravenously via lateral tail vein injection. An initial loading dose of 40
   mg/kg was given for the first dose. After the initial dose, animals were on a 20 mg/kg, every
 5 other day schedule for the duration of the study (25 days under treatment). Tumor volume and
   T/C values were calculated as previously detailed.

   100- 300 iLof T-PER buffer (Pierce) containing phosphatase (Roche) and protease inhibitors
 o (Roche) was added to each sample. The volume of lysis buffer added was dependent upon the
   size of the tumor sample. The tissue was broken down using a 1.5 mL pestle (Fisher
   Scientific) and the resultant suspensions were incubated on ice for 15 minutes before being
   frozen overnight at -80 'C. Samples were thawed and spun for 15 minutes at 13000 g, 4 'C

   each plate contained a dose response curve of each drug in a two-dimensional matrix. The
   plates were returned to the incubator for 3- 6 days before assessing cell viability using
25 CellTiter-Glo (Promega). CellTiter-Glo solution was added to each well and incubated at
   room temperature with gentle shaking for 10 minutes. The amount of luminescence was

   inhibition obtained with each combination was calculated and combination activity
   highlighted using the Loewe additivity model.

  were implanted subcutaneously with 3     x10 6 cells in FBS free DMEM. The total injection
  volume containing cells in suspension was 100 tL. 12 days following cell implantation,
  animals were enrolled in the efficacy study with a mean tumor volume of approximately
  100mm 3 for all groups. In general, a total of 8 animals per group were enrolled in studies.
5 Animals were excluded from enrollment if they exhibited unusual tumor growth
  characteristics prior to enrollment.
  Animals were dosed intravenously with MOR10703 via lateral tail vein injection on a 20
  mg/kg, every other day schedule for the duration of the study (14 days under treatment).
  Erlotinib was dosed at 50mg/kg (PO) on a daily schedule either as a single-agent or in
0 combination with MOR10703. Tumor volume and T/C values were calculated as previously
  detailed.
  Results and Discussion
  Collectively, these results show that a class of antibodies bind to amino acid residues within
  domain 2 and domain 4 of a conformational epitope of HER3 and stabilizes HER3 in an
5 inactive or closed conformation. Binding of these antibodies inhibits both ligand-dependent
  and ligand-independent signaling. These antibodies are also able to bind concurrently with a
  HER3 ligand.
  (i) Affinity Determination
  Antibody affinity was determined by solution equilibrium titration (SET) as described above.
o The results are summarized in Table 9 and example titration curves for MOR10701 are
  contained in Figure 1. The data indicate that a number of antibodies were identified that
  tightly bound human, cyno, rat and murine HER3.

   (iii)HER3 Domain Binding
   A subset of anti-HER3 antibodies were characterized for their ability to bind the various
10 extracellular domains of human HER3 in an ELISA assay. To achieve this, the extracellular
   domain of HER3 was divided into its four constitutive domains and various combinations of
   these domains were cloned, expressed and purified as independent proteins as described
   above. Using this strategy the following domains were successfully generated as soluble
   proteins: domains 1 and 2 (D1-2), domain 2 (D2), domains 3 and 4 (D3-4) and domain 4 (D4).
15 A number of internally generated mouse anti-human HER3 antibodies (8D7, 1F5 and 8P2)
   were also tested as positive controls to demonstrate the integrity of each isolated domain.

       WO 2013/084147                                                         PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                 141
   As shown in Figure 3 MOR09823 and MOR09825 were both observed to successfully bind
   the HER3 extracellular domain, but little binding to the isolated domains was observed in this
   assay with these antibodies. There are several possible explanations for this binding pattern:
   a) MOR09823 and MOR09825 may bind a linear epitope that spans a domain boundary thus
 5 part of the binding epitope would be lost when the domains were expressed as isolated
   proteins.
   b) MOR09823 and MOR09825 may bind a non-linear epitope that bridges multiple domains.
   Consequently, separation of HER3 into its component units may destroy the binding site.
   c) The shape/conformation of HER3 may be a component of the binding of MOR09823 and
 o MOR09825 to HER3 such that only the full-length extracellular domain of HER3 is capable
   of adopting this shape/ conformation whilst the isolated domains cannot fully assume this
   conformation.
   (vi) HER3 Epitope Mapping Using Hydrogen/ Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry
   The HER3 epitope was further explored by HDX-MS analysis of HER3 ECD in the presence
 5 and absence of Fab versions of MOR09823, MOR09824, MOR09825 and MOR09974. Figure
   4A shows that in the absence of bound Fab, approximately 69% of the HER3 ECD sequence
   was covered by at least one peptide. Gaps in coverage may be due to glycosylation of residues
   within these regions or insufficient reduction of disulphide bonds in cysteine rich regions,
   which is particularly apparent in domain 2. Interestingly, although each Fab yielded individual
 o protection patterns, one region of strong protection was consistently observed with
   MOR09823, MOR09824, MOR09825 and MOR09974 (see Figure 4B) indicating that these
   highly related family of antibodies bind HER3 in an identical manner. The strongest
   protection was observed for domain 2 residues 269-286 (TFQLEPNPHTKYQYGGVC) (SEQ
   ID NO: 146) indicating that residues in this vicinity may be important for mAb binding.
25 Mapping of the Fab protected residues onto the published HER3 crystal structure (Cho &
   Leahy, (2002) Science 297:1330-1333) highlights that residues 269-286 are within and
   proximal to a functionally important -hairpin loop within domain 2 (see Figure 4C).
   (vii) HER3/MOR09823 crystal structure
   The 3.2A resolution x-ray crystal structure of MOR09823 Fab fragment bound to the HER3
30 extracellular domain was solved to further define the HER3 epitope that is recognized by this
   family of related antibodies (see Figure 5A). In addition, the 3.4A structure of MOR09825

       WO 2013/084147                                                           PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   142
   Fab fragment bound to human HER3 was resolved. In both the MOR09823/ HER3 and
   MOR09825/ HER3 crystal structures, HER3 is in the tethered (inactive) conformation (see
   Figure 5A, B, C and D). This conformation is characterized by a significant interaction
   interface between domains 2 and 4 mediated by a -hairpin dimerization loop in domain 2.
 5 The observed conformation of HER3 is similar to that previously described by Cho et al. (Cho
   & Leahy, (2002), Science 297:1330-1333) who published the crystal structure of the HER3
   extra-cellular domain in the absence of neuregulin. Since neuregulin can activate HER3, the
   tethered conformation of HER3 is presumed to be inactive. Similar tethered conformations
   have also been observed when the related EGFR family members HER4 (Bouyain et al.,
 o (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 102:15024-15029) and HERI (Ferguson et al., (2003)
   Molec. Cell 11:507-517) have been crystallized.
   The spatial relationships between domains 1 to 4 of HER3 in the inactive (tethered) state are
   significantly different from that of the extended (active) state. This finding is based upon the
   crystal structures of the related EGFR family members HER2 and ligand-bound HERI (Cho
 5 et al., (2003) Nature 421:756-760; Ogiso et al., (2002) Cell 110:775-787; Garrett et al.,
   (2002) Cell 110:763-773) both of which are in an extended (active) state. In the extended
   state, the domain 2 P-hairpin dimerization loop is released from its inhibitory interaction with
   4 and is thus free to interact with its dimerization partner proteins. Thus, the domain 2 0
   hairpin dimerization loop is functionally important both in maintaining the tethered (inactive)
 o state and in mediating dimerization of EGF receptors in the extended state, leading to
   activation of the intracellular kinase domain. The MOR09823/ HER3 and MOR09825/ HER3
   crystal structures (see Figure 5) therefore suggest that both MOR09823 and MOR09825
   function by stabilizing the inactive conformation of HER3.
   The crystal structure also revealed that the HER3 epitope recognized by both MOR09823 and
25 MOR09825 is a non-linear epitope that includes residues from both domains 2 and 4 (see
   Figure 5C and D, Tables 11, 12, 13 and 14). The HER3 epitope recognized by this family of
   highly related antibodies can therefore be defined as:
   Domain 2: residues 265-277, 315
   Domain 4 residues: 571, 582-584, 596-597, 600-602, 609-615
30 Binding of both domains 2 and 4 by MOR09823 or MOR09825 would consequently stabilize
   the tethered conformation of HER3 thus antagonizing its ability to signal.

      WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                  143
  The MOR09823/ MOR09825 binding mode observed in the crystal structure is consistent
  with our other epitope mapping studies. Specifically, the ELISA domain binding experiments
  demonstrate that the affinity of MOR09823 and MOR09825 are significantly greater for the
  intact HER3 extracellular protein than for any isolated domains (e.g. D1, D1-D2, D3, or D3
5 D4 fragments) (see Figure 3). There is also agreement with the HER3 HDX-MS data (see
  Figure 4B), which indentifies domain 2 P-hairpin as part of the antibody recognition epitope.
  Finally, both crystal structures indicate that the ligand-binding surface of HER3, which has
  been mapped by analogy to HERI to domains 1 and 3 (Ogiso et al., (2002) Cell, 110:775-787;
  Garrett et al., (2002) Cell, 110:763-773) is not occluded by either MOR09823 or MOR09825
0 binding (see Figure 5B). This is consistent with our findings that neither MOR09823 nor
  MOR09825 block neuregulin binding to MCF7 cells (see Figure 9) and that
  HER3/MOR09823 complexes can bind to immobilized neuregulin in biacore studies (see
  Figure 10).

  Visual inspection of the MOR09823/ MOR09825 crystal structures highlighted that HER3
  residues Lys267 and Leu268 formed multiple interactions with various antibody CDR's
  suggesting that they may be important for antibody binding. Consequently, Lys267 and/ or
5 Leu268 were mutated to alanine, expressed and the resultant recombinant proteins purified in
  order to assess their impact upon antibody binding. ELISA binding assays indicated that
  mutation of either Lys267 or Leu268 abolished MORI 0703 binding to HER3 (Figure 5F)
  suggesting that both residues are an integral part of the HER3 epitope and thus supporting the
  proposed interactions between MOR09823/ MOR09825 and HER3.
0 (viii)Inhibition of Cell Signaling
  To ascertain the effect of anti-HER3 antibodies upon ligand dependent HER3 activity MCF7
  cells were incubated with IgG prior to stimulation with neuregulin. Example inhibition curves
  are illustrated in Figure 6A and summarized in Table 15. The effect of anti-HER3 antibodies
  upon HER2- mediated HER3 activation was also studied using the HER2 amplified cell line
5 SK-Br-3 (Figure 6B and Table 15).

   (ix) Inhibition of Proliferation
   Since MOR09823, MOR09824, MOR09825, MOR09974, MOR10701, MOR10702 and
   MORI 0703 all inhibited HER3 activity and downstream signaling they were tested for their
   ability to block ligand dependent and independent in vitro cell growth (Example data is shown
15 in Figure 8 and summarized in Table 17). The anti-HER3 antibodies tested were all effective
   inhibitors of cell proliferation.

    (x) Ligand blocking assessment
 5 The ability of the described anti-HER3 antibodies to block ligand binding was assessed by
   examining the binding of neuregulin to MCF7 cells previously treated with either MOR09823
   or MOR09825. The presence of either MOR09823 or MOR09825 had no significant effect
   upon the ability of neuregulin to bind MCF7 cells whilst the positive control used in the
   experiment (Mab3481) was capable of profoundly interfering with neuregulin binding (see
 0 Figure 9). These results are consistent with the crystal structure since MOR09823 interacts
   with domains 2 and 4 whilst the major contact points for HER3's interaction with neuregulin
   are hypothesized to be primarily clustered within domains 1 and 3. Given that neuregulin is
   capable of binding the inactive conformation of HER3 (Kani et al., (2005) Biochemistry 44:
   15842-15857) it is probable that MOR09823 and MOR09825 function by preventing the
15 HER3 domain rearrangements necessary for signaling or by interfering with receptor
   dimerization.
   (xi)Ligand blocking assessment (biochemical)
   To explore whether MOR09823 and neuregulin can bind HER3 concurrently a biochemical
   assay was established using Biacore T M technology. Interaction analyses were performed by
20 capturing biotinylated neuregulin on the surface of a BiacoreTM sensor chip CAP (GE
   Healthcare) utilizing a Biotin CAPture kit (GE Healthcare). HER3 complexes were generated
   by incubating human HER3-Fc with increasing concentrations of either MOR09823, 105.5

        WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   151
   (Thermo Scientific) or human IgG. Preformed HER3/ antibody complexes were injected over
   reference and active surfaces and the interaction of HER3 with neuregulin observed.
   Control IgG had no effect upon HER3/ neuregulin complex formation whilst 105.5 was
   observed to significantly inhibit the ability of HER3 to bind neuregulin confirming its
 5 description as a ligand blocking antibody (Figure 10). In contrast HER3/ MOR09823
   complexes were capable of binding neuregulin demonstrating that MOR09823 does not
   prevent ligand binding. Interestingly, a dose-dependent increase in RU values was uniquely
   observed when MOR09823/ HER3 complexes were injected. This data indicates that a
   trimeric complex containing neuregulin, HER3 and MOR09823 is generated on the chip
 o surface. The ability of this trimeric complex to form is predicted by the HER3/ MOR09823
   crystal structure since MOR09823 binding does not occlude the ligand binding site of HER3
   suggesting that binding of neuregulin and MOR09823 are not mutually exclusive.
   In another embodiment, the antibody or fragment thereof binds to both domain 2 and domain
   4 of HER3 and without blocking the concurrent binding of a HER3 ligand such as neuregulin.
 5 While not required to provide a theory, it is feasible that the antibody or fragment thereof
   binding to both domain 2 and domain 4 of HER3, holds HER3 in an inactive conformation
   without blocking the ligand binding site on HER3. Thus a HER3 ligand (e.g., neuregulin) is
   able to bind to HER3 at the same time as the antibody.
   The antibodies of the invention or fragments thereof inhibit both ligand dependent and
 o independent activation of HER3 without preventing ligand binding. This is considered
   advantageous for the following reasons:
   (i) The therapeutic antibody would have clinical utility in a broad spectrum of tumors than an
   antibody which targeted a single mechanism of HER3 activation (i.e. ligand dependent or
   ligand independent) since distinct tumor types are driven by each mechanism.
25 (ii) The therapeutic antibody would be efficacious in tumor types where both mechanisms of
   HER3 activation are simultaneously involved. An antibody targeting a single mechanism of
   HER3 activation (i.e. ligand dependent or ligand independent) would display little or no
   efficacy in these tumor types
    (iii) The efficacy of an antibody which inhibits ligand dependent activation of HER3 without
30 preventing ligand binding would be less likely to be adversely affected by increasing
   concentrations of ligand. This would translate to either increased efficacy in a tumor type

        WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   152
   driven by very high concentrations of HER3 ligand or a reduced drug resistance liability
   where resistance is mediated by up-regulation of HER3 ligands.
   (iv) An antibody which inhibits HER3 activation by stabilizing the inactive form would be
   less prone to drug resistance driven by alternative mechanisms of HER3 activation.
 5 Consequently, the antibodies of the invention may be used to treat conditions where existing
   therapeutic antibodies are clinically ineffective.
    (xii) In vivo inhibition of HER3 activity and effect upon tumor growth
   To determine the in vivo activity of the described anti-HER3 antibodies, MOR09823 was
   tested in both BxPC-3 and BT-474 tumor models. MOR09823 was demonstrated to inhibit
 0 HER3 activity as evidenced by a significant reduction in tumor pHER3 levels (Figure 11).
   Signaling downstream of HER3 was similarly inhibited as demonstrated by reduced pAkt
   levels in both BxPC-3 and BT-474 (Figure 11). In a HER2 driven BT-474 efficacy study,
   repeated MOR10701 treatment yielded a 74% inhibition of tumor growth (see Figure 12A)
   whilst MOR10703 yielded 83% inhibition. In the BxPC3 tumor growth model, both
 5 MOR1070 land MOR10703 very effectively inhibited ligand driven tumor growth (see Figure
   13).
   (xiii)In vitro drug combinations and impact upon cell growth.
   Since tumor cell growth is frequently driven by multiple signaling pathways we assessed
   whether combinations of MOR09823 or MOR10703 with various targeted agents would be of
20 benefit in blocking cell proliferation. The targeted agents chosen primarily inhibited HER2
   (trastuzumab, lapatinib) EGFR (cetuximab, erlotinib), PI3K/mTOR (BEZ235), P13K
   (BKM120), PIK3CA (BYL719) and mTOR (RAD001) since these targets are commonly
   activated in human tumors. Isobologram analysis (see Figure 14) indicated that MOR09823
   and MORI 0703 displayed synergistic drug combinations with trastuzumab, lapatinib,
25 erlotinib, cetuximab, BEZ235, BKM120, BYL719 and RADOOL. This data suggests that
   inhibition of HER3 signaling is of particular benefit to inhibitors that target receptor tyrosine
   kinases or the P13K signaling pathway.
   (xiv) In vivo MOR10703 drug combinations
   Since HER3 inhibition combined with receptor tyrosine kinase targeted agents in vitro we
30 assessed the impact of either MOR10701 or MOR10703 in combination with trastuzumab and

       WO 2013/084147                                                          PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   153
   erlotinib in vivo. In BT-474 xenografts (see Figure 15A), combination of either MOR10701 or
   MOR10703 (20mg/kg) with a sub-optimal dose of trastuzumab (1mg/kg) was sufficient to
   induce tumor regressions (%T/C= -50 and -37 respectively). In L3.3 pancreatic xenografts,
   combination of MORI 0703 (20mg/kg) with daily erlotinib (50mg/kg) resulted in tumor stasis
 5 (%T/C= 3, see Figure 15B). In both models, the combination of two drugs was significantly
   more efficacious than either drug alone thus supporting our earlier in vitro finding of the
   benefit of combining HER3-targeted antibodies with ErbB-targeted agents.
   In summary, the unique ability of this family of antibodies to stabilize the inactive
   conformation of HER3 results in significant in vivo efficacy in models where HER3 is
 o activated in either a ligand dependent or independent manner. Furthermore, HER3 inhibition
   by this family of antibodies appears beneficial in combination with a wide variety of targeted
   therapies.

   and Endometriosis
 5 Experimentalprocedure
   Sexually mature IGS Wistar Hannover rats of approximately 9 weeks of age were dosed via
   intravenous injection on a twice weekly schedule with 30, 75 and 200 mg/kg MOR10703.
   Following completion of the 13 week dosing period, 10 rats from each dose group were
   sacrificed and major organs collected for further analysis. In addition, 6 rats from the
 o 200mg/kg dose group were allowed to recover from MOR10703 for 10 weeks prior to
   sacrifice in order to determine the reversibility of any observed changes. Post animal sacrifice,
   organ weights were recorded prior to fixation in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Tissue
   sections were prepared and assessed by microscopic examination.
   Results
25 In male rats, decreased prostate weight was observed at all doses, which correlated with
   reduced secretion in the prostate and seminal vesicles (Table 18). These effects were
   reversible after 10 weeks of recovery. Differences in absolute mean vs. control were as
   follows: 30 mg/kg: -31%, 75 mg/kg: -40%, and 200 mg/kg: -35%. Mammary gland atrophy,
   mostly moderate or marked, was present in all dosed males and was not reversible after 10
30 weeks recovery. This change was characterized by the absence of the normally abundant

   Discussion
   Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disease in aging males that is characterized
 5 by a non-neoplastic enlargement of the prostate leading to pressure on the urethra and
   resulting in urination and bladder problems {Mahapokail W, van Sluijs FJ & Schalken JA.
   2000 Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases 3, 28-33}. Anatomic or microscopic evidence of
   BPH is present at autopsy in approximately 55% of men aged 60- 70 years. Transurethal
   resection of the prostate has been the treatment of choice for many years. Consequently, BPH
10 is one of the most common reasons for surgical intervention among elderly men. Less
   invasive methods of treatment include:

                                                   156
   (i) Alpha 1-blockers (doxazosin, prazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin) are a class of
   medications also used to treat high blood pressure. These medications relax the muscles of the
   bladder neck and prostate thus allowing easier urination.
   (ii) Finasteride and dutasteride lower androgen levels thus reducing the size of the prostate
 5 gland, increasing urine flow rate, and decreasing symptoms of BPH. It may take 3 to 6 months
   before improvement in symptoms is observed. Potential side effects related to the use of
   finasteride and dutasteride include decreased sex drive and impotence
   The results in the Experiments section demonstrate for the first time that BPH is a neuregulin
   dependent indication. The finding that MOR10703 significantly reduced prostate size in
 o sexually mature rats without affecting hormone levels suggests that MOR10703 could be
   useful for the treatment of BPH.
   To further test MOR10703 and other HER3 antibodies as therapeutics for BPH, primary
   human BPH surgical specimens can be transplanted into athymic mice or rats and effect of the
   Her3 antibodies studied using models (Otto U et al. Urol Int 1992; 48: 167 -170).
 5 Alternatively, aspects of BPH can be induced in castrated dogs via the long-term
   administration of 5a-Androstane-3a, 170-diol plus estradiol and the HER3 antibodies tested in
   these canine models (Walsh PC, Wilson JD. J Clin Invest 1976; 57: 1093 - 1097).
   The physical manifestation of gynecomastia is breast enlargement in males, it normally occurs
   in both breasts but can sometimes be in one only, known as asymmetrical or unilateral
 o gynecosmastia. Gynecomastia is commonly caused by:
   (i) Elevated estrogen levels resulting in the ratio of testosterone to oestrogen becoming
   unbalanced.
   (ii) Androgen antagonists or anti-androgens used in the treatment of prostate cancer or BPH.
   These drugs suppress testosterone but by suppressing testosterone, oestrogen begins to rise.
25 Although a number of experimental drugs are currently being evaluated there are currently no
   approved treatments for gynecomastia. Consequently gynecomastia is treated via surgical
   removal of the breast tissue. The observation that MOR10703 induced irreversible atrophy of
   the male mammary gland indicates that it may be of benefit in the treatment of gynecomastia.
   To further test MOR10703 and other HER3 antibodies for treating human gynecomastia,
30 transgenic mouse models of gynecomastia can be used. These models have been developed

   by expressing human aromatase in the mouse mammary gland and recapitulate many aspects
   of human gynecomastia (Li et al., Endocrinology 2002;143:4074-4083; Tekmal et al., Cancer
   Res 1996;56:3180-318).
   MOR10703 and other HER3 antibodies can also be examined for treating endometriosis, a
 5 gynecological condition in which cells from the lining of the uterus (endometrium) appear and
   flourish outside the uterine cavity. The main, but not universal, symptom of endometriosis is
   pelvic pain in various manifestations. Although the underlying causes of endometriosis are
   not well characterized is thought to be dependent on the presence of estrogen. Since
   MOR10703 induced endometrial atrophy in female mice resulting in a decrease in uterus
 0 weight, it may be used to treat endometriosis. To further study the effects of MOR10703 and
   other HER3 antibodies on endometriosis, human endometrium in the proliferative phase can
   be implanted into the peritoneal cavity of normal cycling and ovariectomized athymic mice or
   cycling non-obese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined immuno-deficiency (SCID) mice, and
   these SCID mice used as models (Grummer et al., 2001. Human Reproduction; 16; 1736
 5 1743).
   Example 23: In Vitro Studies to Assess HER3 Antibodies for Esophageal Cancer
   In vitro esophagealdrug combinationstudies
   To assess the ability of HER3-targeted antibodies to combine with targeted therapies
   MOR10703 was combined with cetuximab or BYL719 in cell viability assays. Approximately
 0 1000-1200 KYSE140 and KYSE180 cells were seeded into 384-well plates in the appropriate
   culture media supplemented with 2% FBS and allowed to adhere overnight at 37'C. The
   appropriate drug combinations (typical final drug concentrations for BYL719 ranged from
   2.8[tM to 3.8 nM; for cetuximab ranged from 93nM to 0.13nM; for MOR10703 1OOnM to
   4. 1nM) were subsequently added to the wells such that each plate contained a dose response
25 curve of each drug in a two-dimensional matrix. Treated cells were subsequently incubated
   for 96-120 hours. At the end of the drug treatment, CellTiter-Glo regent were added to each
   well to lyse the cells, and luminescence signals were recorded using an Envision plate reader.
   The extent of growth inhibition obtained with each combination was calculated and
   combination activity highlighted using the Loewe additivity model.

   Esophageal in vitro drug combinations and impact upon cell growth
   Since tumor cell growth is frequently driven by multiple signaling pathways, combinations of
   MOR10703 with cetuximab or BYL719 were assessed to determine whether they would be of
   benefit in blocking proliferation of esophageal cancer cell lines. The targeted agents chosen
 5 primarily inhibited EGFR (cetuximab) and PIK3CA (BYL719) since these targets are
   commonly activated in human tumors. Isobologram analysis (see Figure 16) indicated that
   MOR10703 displayed synergistic drug combinations with cetuximab and BYL719. This data
   shows that inhibition of HER3 signaling is of particular benefit to inhibitors that target
   receptor tyrosine kinases or the P13K signaling pathway.
 o Example 24: In Vivo Studies to Assess HER3 Antibodies for Esophageal Cancer
   To assess the in vivo ability of HER3-targeted antibodies to combine with targeted therapies
   MOR10703 was combined with cetuximab or BYL719 and tested in two in vivo xenograft
   models.
   (i) In vivo KYSE140 xenografts
 5 KYSE140 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal
   bovine serum without antibiotics until the time of implantation. KYSE140 cells were
   harvested in exponential growth. Ten million cells were mixed with PBS/ Matrigel (50:50)
   were subcutaneously implanted into the upper right flank of SCID-Beige mice. On Day 28,
   tumors were measured and animals with a tumor volume of approximately 200 mm were
 o enrolled in the efficacy study. In general, a total of 10 animals per group were enrolled in
   efficacy studies. For single-agent and combination studies, animals were dosed intravenously
   via lateral tail vein injection with MOR10703 or cetuximab. BYL719 was formulated in 0.5%
   methylcellulose and dosed via oral gavage.
   (ii)In vivo KYSEJ80 xenografts
25 KYSE180 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal
   bovine serum without antibiotics until the time of implantation. KYSE180 cells were
   harvested in exponential growth. Five million cells were subcutaneously implanted into the
   upper right flank of nude mice. On Day 18, tumors were measured and animals with a tumor
   volume of approximately 200 mm3 were enrolled in the efficacy study. In general, a total of
30 10 animals per group were enrolled in efficacy studies. For single-agent and combination

        WO 2013/084147                                                        PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                  159
   studies, animals were dosed intravenously via lateral tail vein injection with MOR10703 or
   cetuximab. BYL719 was formulated in 0.5% methylcellulose and dosed via oral gavage.
   (iii)In vivo primary esophagealxenografts
   Human esophageal primary tumors were passaged in mice. When tumor size reached
 5 approximately 150 mm in size, animals were enrolled in the efficacy study. For single-agent
   and combination studies, animals were dosed intravenously via lateral tail vein injection with
   MOR10703 or cetuximab. BYL719 was formulated in 0.5% methylcellulose and dosed via
   oral gavage.
   In vivo inhibition of HER3 and effect upon esophageal tumor growth
 o To determine the in vivo activity of the described anti-HER3 antibodies, MOR10703 was
   tested in both KYSE140 and KYSE 180 esophageal tumor models, as well as two primary
   esophageal tumor models, CHES007 and CHES015. In both KYSE140 and KYSE180 in
   vivo models, treatment with single-agent MOR10703 was demonstrated to effectively inhibit
   tumor growth (Figure 17). In KYSE180, the combination of MOR10703 and BYL719 was
 5 sufficient to induce significant tumor regressions. These findings were extended to the
   primary esophageal tumor models, where a combination of MOR10703 with either cetuximab
   or BYL719 also induced potent tumor regressions (Figure 18). Together, these data further
   support our earlier in vitro finding of the benefit of combining HER3-targeted antibodies with
   wither EGFR or P13K-targeted agents.
 o Example 25: In Vivo Studies to Assess HER3 combinations with BYL 719 in Gastric
   Cancer.
   To assess the in vivo ability of HER3-targeted antibodies to combine with targeted therapies
   in gastric cancer, MOR10703 was combined with BYL719 and tested in an in vivo xenograft
   model.
25 (i). In vivo NCI-N87 xenograft
   NCI-N87 cells were grown in DMEM culture medium containing 4.5g/l glucose
   supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate
   until the point of implantation. NCI-N87 tumors were established by injecting 8 x 106 to 1 x
   107 cells (in HBSS containing 50% v/v Matrigel) subcutaneously. On Day 10, tumors were
30 measured and animals with a tumor volume of approximately 250 mm were enrolled in the

        WO 2013/084147                                                        PCT/IB2012/056949
                                                   160
   efficacy study. For single-agent and combination arms, animals were dosed intravenously via
   lateral tail vein injection with MOR10703. BYL719 was formulated in 0.5% methylcellulose
   and dosed via oral gavage.
   Effect of combination treatment on N87 gastrictumor growth
 5 As seen was seen for esophageal tumors, the combination of MOR10703 and BYL719 was
   sufficient to induce significant, prolonged tumor regressions in the N87 gastric tumor model
   thus further supporting the benefit of combining HER3-targeted antibodies with P13K
   targeted agents (see Figure 19).
   Example 26: In Vivo Studies to Assess HER3 combinations with Cetuximab in squamous
 o cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN).
   To assess the in vivo ability of HER3-targeted antibodies to combine with targeted therapies
   in SCCHN, MOR10703 was combined with cetuximab and tested in an in vivo xenograft
   model.
   (i). In vivo A253 xenograft
 5 A253 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
   without antibiotics until the time of implantation. A253 cells were harvested in exponential
   growth. Five million cells in 200 gl PBS were subcutaneously implanted into the upper right
   flank of nude mice. On Day 25, tumors were measured and animals with a tumor volume of
   approximately 200 mm3 were enrolled in the efficacy study. In general, a total of 9 animals
20 per group were enrolled in efficacy studies. For single-agent and combination studies,
   animals were dosed intravenously via lateral tail vein injection with MOR10703 or
   cetuximab.
   Effect of combination treatment on A253 SCCHN tumor growth
   In the A253 SCCHLEN model, treatment with either MOR10703 or cetuximab as a single agent
25 resulted in tumor stasis. Combination of MOR10703 with cetuximab was significantly more
   active and resulted in tumor regression (see Figure 20).
   Collectively, these results show MOR10703 as a single agent can inhibit tumor growth. The
   results also show there is a synergistic effect on tumor regression when MOR10703 is
   combined with inhibitors that target other receptor tyrosine kinases or the P13K signaling
30 pathway.
