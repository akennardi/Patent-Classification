                                       Abstract
The mixed combination of the step segment and diamond segment tool for removing
coatings, polishing and cutting stone in very hard concrete floors. Use of a
combination diamond shoe/plate/plug/cup wheel tool design and modification to the
step segment tooling design, makes this effective for large floor grinder use, and
makes a substantial difference of the step diamond tool design and allows for smooth
operation of a floor grinder. Combining and mixing the step diamond segment shape
with all other diamond segment shapes designs used on diamond shoes, plates, plugs,
cup wheels or other diamond tools that provides for better working equilibrium,
which employs a sacrificial segment, to improve both the wear and ride of the floor
grinder.

      Mixed Step Segment - Diamond Tool Innovation
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method
of preforming it known to me:

   Mixed Step Segment - Diamond Tool Innovation
                                          Description
   People who work in the concrete renovation, road construction, floor
   preparation, floor coating, and concrete polishing industry, commonly preform
   work tasks that involve the removal of hard to remove carpet, vinyl & tile glue,
   thermoplastic paints, epoxy, and adhesives, whereby the recently developed
5  step segment diamond tool design has proven to be to the most effective
   diamond tool shape and design for performing this task, and now also is being
   increasing used and embraced by the concrete polishing industry for cutting
   and exposing stone as contained within extremely hard concrete floors.
   Although the step segment design has proven to be very effective at cutting
10 hard concrete floors, it has also proven to have significant design flaws being
   that it also have a very rapid rate of wear rate due to only having a very narrow
   thin sharp shape and multiple sharp cutting edges, and when used on a large
   heavy planetary floor grinder, exerts too much fiction that can either results in
   heavy scratching, or friction that trips out the electrical safety switch on the 3
15 phase generators used to power these grinders or alternatively damages the
   electrical boards contained within these grinders themselves, this results in
   expensive work stoppages and repairs. To solve this problem more
   experienced operators currently have learned to mix the use of these step
   grinder segments with a smoother riding segment design tooling on their tool
20 holder plates [most grinders have 3 x counter rotating tool plates that contain x
   3 shoes per plate], however due odd number mix of sharp and smoother
   diamond tooling grinder working instability is created with this diamond tooling
   mix, which can either result in floor grinder vibration, floor scratching or
   additional machine break downs and expensive repairs. This innovation patent
25 is therefore intended to solve these identified problems and solves this - lop
   sided mix of diamond tooling by use of a combination diamond
   shoe/plate/plug/cup wheel tool design, although simple in concept, it is a new
   and innovative step, and modification to the step segment tooling design, that
   makes this effective tool design more useable or more effective for large floor
   grinder use, that makes a substantial difference and contribution to the working

   economy of the step diamond tool design and allows for smooth operation of a
   floor grinder when using this diamond tooling, whereby this innovation involves
5  combining and mixing the step diamond segment shape with all other known
   and unknown diamond segment shapes designs and ordination as currently
   used on diamond shoes, plates, plugs, cup wheels or other diamond tools, that
   provides for better working equilibrium, that employs a sacrificial segment, to
   improve both the wear and ride of the floor grinder, this innovation patent
10 therefore claims monopoly on the mixed combination of the step segment
   diamond segment with "all current known and unknown diamond segment
   shapes" as related to all design, ordination and configuration, currently
   manufactured and used by all diamond shoes, tools, plugs and cup wheels in
   the market place.
