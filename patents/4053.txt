                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention relates to the field of plant molecular biology, more
   particularly to influencing male fertility.
15    REFERENCE TO ELECTRONICALLY-SUBMITTED SEQUENCE LISTING
           The official copy of the sequence listing is submitted electronically via EFS-Web
   as an ASCII formatted sequence listing with a file named 5282-PCTST25.txt, last
   modified on September 6, 2013, having a size of 42 KB, and is filed concurrently with the
   specification. The sequence listing contained in this ASCII formatted document is part of
20 the specification and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           Development of hybrid plant breeding has made possible considerable advances in
   quality and quantity of crops produced. Increased yield and combination of desirable
25 characteristics, such as resistance to disease and insects, heat and drought tolerance, along
   with variations in plant composition are all possible because of hybridization procedures.
   These procedures frequently rely heavily on providing for a male parent contributing
   pollen to a female parent to produce the resulting hybrid.
           Field crops are bred through techniques that take advantage of the plant's method
30 of pollination. A plant is self-pollinated if pollen from one flower is transferred to the
   same or another flower of the same plant or a genetically identical plant. A plant is cross
   pollinated if the pollen comes from a flower on a genetically different plant.
                                                 -2-

           In certain species, such as Brassica campestris, the plant is normally self-sterile
   and can only be cross-pollinated. In self-pollinating species, such as soybeans and cotton,
   the male and female plants are anatomically juxtaposed. During natural pollination, the
   male reproductive organs of a given flower pollinate the female reproductive organs of
 5 the same flower.
           Bread wheat (Triticum aestivurm) is a hexaploid plant having three pairs of
   homologous chromosomes defining genomes A, B and D. The endosperm of wheat grain
   comprises 2 haploid complements from a maternal cell and 1 from a paternal cell. The
   embryo of wheat grain comprises one haploid complement from each of the maternal and
10 paternal cells. Hexaploidy has been considered a significant obstacle in researching and
   developing useful variants of wheat. In fact, very little is known regarding how
   homologous genes of wheat interact, how their expression is regulated, and how the
   different proteins produced by homologous genes function separately or in concert.
           An essential aspect of much of the work underway with genetic male sterility
15 systems is the identification of genes influencing male fertility. Such a gene can be used
   in a variety of systems to control male fertility including those described herein.
                           BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            Compositions and methods for modulating male fertility in a plant are provided.
20 Compositions comprise nucleotide sequences, and active fragments and variants thereof,
   which modulate male fertility. Further provided are expression cassettes comprising one
   or more of the male fertility polynucleotides, or active fragments or variants thereof,
   operably linked to a promoter, wherein expression of the polynucleotides modulates the
   male fertility of a plant. Various methods are provided wherein the level and/or activity
25 of a polynucleotide that influences male fertility is modulated in a plant or plant part.

   locus. Deletions as a result of imperfect NHEJ are shown by a     "-", while the gap
   represents a C nucleotide insertion in SEQ ID NO: 50. The mutations were identified by
   sequencing of subcloned PCR products in DNA vectors.

   L        Male Fertility Polynucleotides
            Compositions disclosed herein include polynucleotides and polypeptides that
   influence male fertility. In particular, isolated polynucleotides are provided comprising
   nucleotide sequences encoding the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4,
                                                 -4-

   6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18 or active fragments or variants thereof. Further provided are
   polypeptides having an amino acid sequence encoded by a polynucleotide described
   herein, for example those set forth in SEQ ID NOS:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, or 17 or active
   fragments or variants thereof.
 5          Sexually reproducing plants develop specialized tissues specific for the production
   of male and female gametes. Successful production of male gametes relies on proper
   formation of the male reproductive tissues. The stamen, which embodies the male
   reproductive organ of plants, contains various cell types, including for example, the
   filament, anther., tapetum, and pollen. As used herein, "male tissue" refers to the
10 specialized tissue in a sexually reproducing plant that is responsible for production of the
   male gamete. Male tissues include, but are not limited to, the stamen, filament, anther,
   tapetum, and pollen.
            The process of mature pollen grain formation begins with microsporogenesis,
   wherein meiocytes are formed in the sporogenous tissue of the anther.
15 Microgametogenesis follows, wherein microspores divide mitotically and develop into
   the microgametophyte, or pollen grains. The condition of "male fertility" or "male
   fertile" refers to those plants producing a mature pollen grain capable of fertilizing a
   female gamete to produce a subsequent generation of offspring. The term "influences
   male fertility" or "modulates male fertility", as used herein, refers to any increase or
20 decrease in the ability of a plant to produce a mature pollen grain when compared to an
   appropriate control. A "mature pollen grain" or "mature pollen" refers to any pollen
   grain capable of fertilizing a female gamete to produce a subsequent generation of
   offspring. Likewise, the term "male fertility polynucleotide" or "male fertility
   polypeptide" refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide that modulates male fertility. A
25 male fertility polynucleotide may, for example, encode a polypeptide that participates in
   the process of microsporogenesis or microgametogenesis.
            Male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein include homologs and orthologs of
   polynucleotides shown to influence male fertility. For example, male fertility
   polynucleotides, and active fragments and variants thereof, disclosed herein include
30 homologs and orthologs of Ms22 (also referred to as Mscal). Mutagenesis studies of
   Ms22 resulted in phenotypically male sterile maize plants with anthers that did not
   extrude from the tassel and lacked sporogenous tissue. West and Albertsen (1985) Maize
   Newsletter 59:87; Neuffer et al. (1977) Mutants of maize. Cold Spring Harbor
   Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.
                                                -5-

           Plants deficient in Ms22 expression exhibit physiological changes early in
   reproductive-tissue development. Ms22 is believed to have a role in another development
   that occurs earlier than that of Ms45 or Ms26. Certain male sterility genes such as MA C],
   EMS] or GNE2 (Sorensen et al. (2002) Plant J. 29:581-594) prevent cell growth in the
 5 quartet stage. Mutations in the SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE gene act early in
   development, but impact both anther and ovule formation such that plants are male and
   female sterile. The SPOROCYTELESS gene of Arabidopsis is required for initiation of
   sporogenesis and encodes a novel nuclear protein (Genes Dev. 1999 Aug 15;13(16):2108
   17). Because Ms22 is critical for the progression of microsporogenesis, maintenance of
10 male sterility in Ms22 mutants is very reliable compared to other male sterility mutant
   constructs. As disclosed elsewhere herein, Ms22 polynucleotides from wheat are set forth
   in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, and 5.
           Additional male fertility polynucleotides include the Ms26 polynucleotide and
   homologs and orthologs thereof. Ms26 polypeptides have been reported to have
15 significant homology to P450 enzymes found in yeast, plants, and mammals. P450
   enzymes have been widely studied and characteristic protein domains have been
   elucidated. The Ms26 protein contains several structural motifs characteristic of
   eukaryotic P450's, including the heme-binding domain FxxGxRxCxG (domain D; SEQ
   ID NO: 19), domain A A/GGXD/ETT/S (dioxygen-binding; SEQ ID NO: 20), domain B
20 (steroid-binding) and domain C. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that Ms26 is most
   closely related to P450s involved in fatty acid omega-hydroxylation found in Arabidopsis
   thalianaand Vicia sativa. See, for example, US Patent Publication No. 2012/0005792,
   herein incorporated by reference. As disclosed elsewhere herein, Ms26 polynucleotides
   from wheat are set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 7, 9, and 11.
25         Additional male fertility polynucleotides, and active fragments and variants
   thereof, disclosed herein may also include homologs and orthologs of Ms45
   polynucleotides. The Ms45 polynucleotide is a male fertility polynucleotide
   characterized in maize. Mutations of Ms45 can result in breakdown of microsporogenesis
   during vacuolation of the microspores rendering the mutated plants male sterile. When
30 the cloned maize Ms45 polynucleotide is introduced into such mutated male sterile plants,
   the gene can complement the mutation and confer male fertility. As disclosed elsewhere
   herein, Ms45 polynucleotides from wheat are set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 13, 15, and 17.
           Strategies for manipulation of expression of male-fertility polynucleotides in
   wheat will require consideration of the ploidy level of the individual wheat variety.
                                               -6-

   Triticum aestivum is a hexaploid containing three genomes designated A, B, and D
   (N=21); each genome comprises seven pairs of nonhomologous chromosomes. Einkorn
   wheat varieties are diploids (N=7) and emmer wheat varieties are tetraploids (N=14).
           Isolated or substantially purified nucleic acid molecules or protein compositions
 5 are disclosed herein. An "isolated" or "purified" nucleic acid molecule, polynucleotide,
   or protein, or biologically active portion thereof, is substantially or essentially free from
   components that normally accompany or interact with the polynucleotide or protein as
   found in its naturally occurring environment. Thus, an isolated or purified polynucleotide
   or protein is substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when
10 produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other
   chemicals when chemically synthesized. Optimally, an "isolated" polynucleotide is free
   of sequences (optimally protein encoding sequences) that naturally flank the
   polynucleotide (i.e., sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends of the polynucleotide) in the
   genomic DNA of the organism from which the polynucleotide is derived. For example,
15 in various embodiments, the isolated polynucleotide can contain less than about 5 kb, 4
   kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb, or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequence that naturally flank the
   polynucleotide in genomic DNA of the cell from which the polynucleotide is derived. A
   protein that is substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of protein
   having less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, or 1% (by dry weight) of contaminating
20 protein. When the polypeptides disclosed herein or biologically active portion thereof is
   recombinantly produced, optimally culture medium represents less than about 30%, 20%,
   10%, 5%, or 1% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-protein-of-interest
   chemicals.
           A "subject plant" or "subject plant cell" is one in which genetic alteration, such as
25 transformation, has been effected as to a gene of interest, or is a plant or plant cell which
   is descended from a plant or cell so altered and which comprises the alteration. A
   "control" or "control plant" or "control plant cell" provides a reference point for
   measuring changes in phenotype of the subject plant or plant cell.
           A control plant or plant cell may comprise, for example: (a) a wild-type plant or
30 plant cell, i.e., of the same genotype as the starting material for the genetic alteration
   which resulted in the subject plant or cell; (b) a plant or plant cell of the same genotype as
   the starting material but which has been transformed with a null construct (i.e. with a
   construct which has no known effect on the trait of interest, such as a construct
   comprising a marker gene); (c) a plant or plant cell which is a non-transformed segregant
                                                  -7-

   among progeny of a subject plant or plant cell; (d) a plant or plant cell genetically
   identical to the subject plant or plant cell but which is not exposed to conditions or stimuli
   that would induce expression of the gene of interest; or (e) the subject plant or plant cell
   itself, under conditions in which the gene of interest is not expressed.
 5          A.      Fragments and Variants of Male Fertility Sequences
            Fragments and variants of the disclosed polynucleotides and proteins encoded
   thereby are also provided. By "fragment" is intended a portion of the polynucleotide or a
   portion of the amino acid sequence and hence protein encoded thereby. Fragments of a
   polynucleotide may encode protein fragments that retain the biological activity of the
10 native protein and hence influence male fertility. Alternatively, fragments of a
   polynucleotide that are useful as hybridization probes generally do not encode fragment
   proteins retaining biological activity. Thus, fragments of a nucleotide sequence may
   range from at least about 20 nucleotides, about 50 nucleotides, about 100 nucleotides, and
   up to the full-length polynucleotide encoding the polypeptides disclosed herein.
15          A fragment of a polynucleotide that encodes a biologically active portion of a
   polypeptide that influences male fertility will encode at least 15, 25, 30, 50, 100, 150,
   200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 525, or 537 contiguous amino acids, or up to the total
   number of amino acids present in a full-length polypeptide that influences male fertility
   (for example, SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18, respectively). Fragments of
20 a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide that influences male fertility that are useful as
   hybridization probes or PCR primers generally need not encode a biologically active
   portion of a polypeptide that influences male fertility.
            Thus, a fragment of a male fertility polynucleotide as disclosed herein may encode
   a biologically active portion of a male fertility polypeptide, or it may be a fragment that
25 can be used as a hybridization probe or PCR primer using methods disclosed below. A
   biologically active portion of a male fertility polypeptide can be prepared by isolating a
   portion of one of the male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein, expressing the
   encoded portion of the male fertility protein (e.g., by recombinant expression in vitro),
   and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the male fertility polypeptide.
30 Polynucleotides that are fragments of a male fertility polynucleotide comprise at least 16,
   20,50,75,100,150,200,250,300,350,400,450,500,550,600,650,700,800,900,
   1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, or 1629 nucleotides, or up to the number of
   nucleotides present in a full-length male fertility polynucleotide disclosed herein (i.e.,
   SEQ ID NOS:1, 3, 5, 7. 9, 11, 13, 15, or 17, respectively).
                                                 -8-

             "Variants" is intended to mean substantially similar sequences. For
   polynucleotides, a variant comprises a deletion and/or addition of one or more nucleotides
   at one or more internal sites within the native polynucleotide and/or a substitution of one
   or more nucleotides at one or more sites in the native polynucleotide. As used herein, a
 5 "native" or "wild type" polynucleotide or polypeptide comprises a naturally occurring
   nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively. For polynucleotides,
   conservative variants include those sequences that, because of the degeneracy of the
   genetic code, encode the amino acid sequence of one of the male fertility polypeptides
   disclosed herein. Naturally occurring allelic variants such as these can be identified with
10 the use of well-known molecular biology techniques, as, for example, with polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization techniques as outlined below. Variant
   polynucleotides also include synthetically derived polynucleotides, such as those
   generated, for example, by using site-directed mutagenesis but which still encode a male
   fertility polypeptide. Generally, variants of a particular polynucleotides disclosed herein
15 will have at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%,
   91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity to that
   particular polynucleotide (e.g., any one of SEQ ID NOS: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, or 17) as
   determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere herein.
            Variants of a particular polynucleotide disclosed herein (i.e., the reference
20 polynucleotide) can also be evaluated by comparison of the percent sequence identity
   between the polypeptide encoded by a variant polynucleotide and the polypeptide
   encoded by the reference polynucleotide. Thus, for example, an isolated polynucleotide
   that encodes a polypeptide with a given percent sequence identity to the polypeptide of
   SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18 are disclosed. Percent sequence identity
25 between any two polypeptides can be calculated using sequence alignment programs and
   parameters described elsewhere herein. Where any given pair of polynucleotides
   disclosed herein is evaluated by comparison of the percent sequence identity shared by
   the two polypeptides they encode, the percent sequence identity between the two encoded
   polypeptides is at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%,
30 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity.
             "Variant" protein is intended to mean a protein derived from the native protein by
   deletion or addition of one or more amino acids at one or more internal sites in the native
   protein and/or substitution of one or more amino acids at one or more sites in the native
   protein. Variant proteins disclosed herein are biologically active, that is they continue to
                                                 - 9-

   possess the desired biological activity of the native protein, that is, male fertility activity
   as described herein. Such variants may result from, for example, genetic polymorphism
   or from human manipulation. Biologically active variants of a male fertility protein
   disclosed herein will have at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%,
 5 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence
   identity to the amino acid sequence for the native protein (e.g. any one of SEQ ID NO: 2,
   4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18) as determined by sequence alignment programs and
   parameters described elsewhere herein. A biologically active variant of a protein
   disclosed herein may differ from that protein by as few as 1-15 amino acid residues, as
10 few as 1-10, such as 6-10, as few as 5, as few as 4, 3, 2, or even 1 amino acid residue.
            The proteins disclosed herein may be altered in various ways including amino acid
   substitutions, deletions, truncations, and insertions. Methods for such manipulations are
   generally known in the art. For example, amino acid sequence variants and fragments of
   the male fertility polypeptides can be prepared by mutations in the DNA. Methods for
15 mutagenesis and polynucleotide alterations are well known in the art. See, for example,
   Kunkel (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488-492; Kunkel et al. (1987) Methods in
   Enzymol. 154:367-382; U.S. Patent No. 4,873,192; Walker and Gaastra, eds. (1983)
   Techniques in Molecular Biology (MacMillan Publishing Company, New York) and the
   references cited therein. Guidance as to appropriate amino acid substitutions that do not
20 affect biological activity of the protein of interest may be found in the model of Dayhoff
   et al. (1978) Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure (Natl. Biomed. Res. Found.,
   Washington, D.C.), herein incorporated by reference. Conservative substitutions, such as
   exchanging one amino acid with another having similar properties, may be optimal.
            Thus, the genes and polynucleotides disclosed herein include both the naturally
25 occurring sequences as well as DNA sequence variants which retain function. Likewise,
   the male fertility polypeptides and proteins encompass both naturally occurring
   polypeptides as well as variations and modified forms thereof. Such polynucleotide and
   polypeptide variants will continue to possess the desired male fertility activity. The
   mutations that will be made in the DNA encoding the variant must not place the sequence
30 out of reading frame and optimally will not create complementary regions that could
   produce secondary mRNA structure. See, EP Patent Application Publication No. 75,444.
            The deletions, insertions, and substitutions of the protein sequences encompassed
   herein are not expected to produce radical changes in the characteristics of the protein.
   However, when it is difficult to predict the exact effect of the substitution, deletion, or
                                                 - 10 -

   insertion in advance of doing so, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the effect will
   be evaluated by routine screening assays. That is, the activity can be evaluated by
   assaying for male fertility activity.
            Increases or decreases in male fertility can be assayed in a variety of ways. One
 5 of ordinary skill in the art can readily assess activity of the variant or fragment by
   introducing the polynucleotide into a plant homozygous for a stable male sterile allele of
   the polynucleotide, and observing male tissue development in the plant. For example, to
   assay for male fertility activity of Ms22 (i.e. SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, or 5), one of skill in the art
   can begin by constructing a plant homozygous for a mutation in the native Ms22 gene
10 resulting in male sterility. Subsequently, one could complement the mutation by
   providing the Ms22 polynucleotide, or active fragment or variant thereof, and observing
   whether the male tissues of the plant develop normally and are able to produce mature
   pollen. Likewise, the same procedure can be carried out to assay for the male fertility
   activity of variants or fragments of Ms26 (i.e. SEQ ID NO: 7, 9, or 11) or Ms45 (i.e. SEQ
15 ID NO: 13, 15, or 17), also disclosed herein.
            Variant functional polynucleotides and proteins also encompass sequences and
   proteins derived from a mutagenic and recombinogenic procedure such as DNA shuffling.
   With such a procedure, one or more different male fertility sequences can be manipulated
   to create a new male fertility polypeptide possessing the desired properties. In this
20 manner, libraries of recombinant polynucleotides are generated from a population of
   related sequence polynucleotides comprising sequence regions that have substantial
   sequence identity and can be homologously recombined in vitro or in vivo. For example,
   using this approach, sequence motifs encoding a domain of interest may be shuffled
   between the male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein and other known male fertility
25 polynucleotides to obtain a new gene coding for a protein with an improved property of
   interest, such as an increased Km in the case of an enzyme. Strategies for such DNA
   shuffling are known in the art. See, for example, Stemmer (1994) Proc. Natl. A cad. Sci.
   USA 91:10747-10751; Stemmer (1994) Nature 370:389-391; Crameri et al. (1997)

   IL           Sequence Analysis
                                                - 11 -

           As used herein, "sequence identity" or "identity" in the context of two
   polynucleotides or polypeptide sequences makes reference to the residues in the two
   sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified
   comparison window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to
 5 proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by
   conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other
   amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and
   therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. When sequences differ
   in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to
10 correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences that differ by such
   conservative substitutions are said to have "sequence similarity" or "similarity". Means
   for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically this
   involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch,
   thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an
15 identical amino acid is given a score of I and a non-conservative substitution is given a
   score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The
   scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., as implemented in the program
   PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, California).
           As used herein, "percentage of sequence identity" means the value determined by
20 comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the
   portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise
   additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not
   comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The
   percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical
25 nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of
   matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of
   positions in the window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the
   percentage of sequence identity.
           Unless otherwise stated, sequence identity/similarity values provided herein refer
30 to the value obtained using GAP Version 10 using the following parameters: % identity
   and % similarity for a nucleotide sequence using GAP Weight of 50 and Length Weight
   of 3, and the nwsgapdna.cmp scoring matrix; % identity and % similarity for an amino
   acid sequence using GAP Weight of 8 and Length Weight of 2, and the BLOSUM62
   scoring matrix; or any equivalent program thereof. By "equivalent program" is intended
                                                - 12 -

   any sequence comparison program that, for any two sequences in question, generates an
   alignment having identical nucleotide or amino acid residue matches and an identical
   percent sequence identity when compared to the corresponding alignment generated by
   GAP Version 10.
 5         The use of the term "polynucleotide" is not intended to limit the present disclosure
   to polynucleotides comprising DNA. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that
   polynucleotides, can comprise ribonucleotides and combinations of ribonucleotides and
   deoxyribonucleotides. Such deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides include both
   naturally occurring molecules and synthetic analogues. The polynucleotides disclosed
10 herein also encompass all forms of sequences including, but not limited to, single
   stranded forms, double-stranded forms, hairpins, stem-and-loop structures, and the like.
   III.    Expression cassettes
15         The male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein can be provided in expression
   cassettes for expression in an organism of interest. The cassette can include 5' and 3'
   regulatory sequences operably linked to a male fertility polynucleotide as disclosed
   herein. "Operably linked" is intended to mean a functional linkage between two or more
   elements. For example, an operable linkage between a polynucleotide of interest and a
20 regulatory sequence (e.g., a promoter) is a functional link that allows for expression of the
   polynucleotide of interest. Operably linked elements may be contiguous or non
   contiguous. When used to refer to the joining of two protein coding regions, by operably
   linked is intended that the coding regions are in the same reading frame.
           The expression cassettes disclosed herein may include in the 5'-3' direction of
25 transcription, a transcriptional and translational initiation region (i.e., a promoter), a
   polynucleotide of interest, and a transcriptional and translational termination region (i.e.,
   termination region) functional in the host cell (i.e., the plant). Expression cassettes are
   also provided with a plurality of restriction sites and/or recombination sites for insertion
   of the male fertility polynucleotide to be under the transcriptional regulation of the
30 regulatory regions described elsewhere herein. The regulatory regions (i.e., promoters,
   transcriptional regulatory regions, and translational termination regions) and/or the
   polynucleotide of interest may be native/analogous to the host cell or to each other.
   Alternatively, the regulatory regions and/or the polynucleotide of interest may be
   heterologous to the host cell or to each other. As used herein, "heterologous" in reference
                                                - 13 -

   to a polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence is a sequence that originates from a foreign
   species, or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from its native form in
   composition and/or genomic locus by deliberate human intervention. For example, a
   promoter operably linked to a heterologous polynucleotide is from a species different
 5 from the species from which the polynucleotide was derived, or, if from the
   same/analogous species, one or both are substantially modified from their original form
   and/or genomic locus, or the promoter is not the native promoter for the operably linked
   polynucleotide. As used herein, a chimeric polynucleotide comprises a coding sequence
   operably linked to a transcription initiation region that is heterologous to the coding
10 sequence.
            In certain embodiments the polynucleotides disclosed herein can be stacked with
   any combination of polynucleotide sequences of interest or expression cassettes as
   disclosed elsewhere herein. For example, the male fertility polynucleotides disclosed
   herein may be stacked with any other polynucleotides encoding male-gamete disruptive
15 polynucleotides or polypeptides, cytotoxins, markers, or other male fertility sequences as
   disclosed elsewhere herein. The stacked polynucleotides may be operably linked to the
   same promoter as the male fertility polynucleotide, or may be operably linked to a
   separate promoter polynucleotide.
            As described elsewhere herein, expression cassettes may comprise a promoter
20 operably linked to a polynucleotide of interest, along with a corresponding termination
   region. The termination region may be native to the transcriptional initiation region, may
   be native to the operably linked male fertility polynucleotide of interest or with the male
   fertility promoter sequences, may be native to the plant host, or may be derived from
   another source (i.e., foreign or heterologous). Convenient termination regions are
25 available from the Ti-plasmid of A. tunefaciens, such as the octopine synthase and
   nopaline synthase termination regions. See also Guerineau et al. (1991) Mol. Gen. Genet.

            Where appropriate, the polynucleotides of interest may be optimized for increased
   expression in the transformed plant. That is, the polynucleotides can be synthesized using
   plant-preferred codons for improved expression. See, for example, Campbell and Gowri
   (1990) PlantPhysiol. 92:1-11 for a discussion of host-preferred codon usage. Methods
                                                - 14 -

   are available in the art for synthesizing plant-preferred genes. See, for example, U.S.
   Patent Nos. 5,380,831, and 5,436,391, and Murray et al. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res.
   17:477-498, herein incorporated by reference.
            Additional sequence modifications are known to enhance gene expression in a
 5 cellular host. These include elimination of sequences encoding spurious polyadenylation
   signals, exon-intron splice site signals, transposon-like repeats, and other such well
   characterized sequences that may be deleterious to gene expression. The G-C content of
   the sequence may be adjusted to levels average for a given cellular host, as calculated by
   reference to known genes expressed in the host cell. When possible, the sequence is
10 modified to avoid predicted hairpin secondary mRNA structures.
            The expression cassettes may additionally contain 5' leader sequences. Such
   leader sequences can act to enhance translation. Translation leaders are known in the art
   and include: picornavirus leaders, for example, EMCV leader (Encephalomyocarditis 5'
   noncoding region) (Elroy-Stein et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:6126-6130);
15 potyvirus leaders, for example, TEV leader (Tobacco Etch Virus) (Gallie et al. (1995)
   Gene 165(2):233-238), MDMV leader (Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus) (Johnson et al.
   (1986) Virology 154:9-20), and human immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein
   (BiP) (Macejak et al. (1991) Nature 353:90-94); untranslated leader from the coat protein
   mRNA of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV RNA 4) (Jobling et al. (1987) Nature
20 325:622-625); tobacco mosaic virus leader (TMV) (Gallie et al. (1989) in Molecular
   Biology of RNA, ed. Cech (Liss, New York), pp. 237-256); and maize chlorotic mottle
   virus leader (MCMV) (Lommel et al. (1991) Virology 81:382-385). See also,
   Della-Cioppa et al. (1987) Plant Physiol. 84:965-968. Other methods known to enhance
   translation can also be utilized, for example, introns, and the like.
25          In preparing the expression cassette, the various DNA fragments may be
   manipulated, so as to provide for the DNA sequences in the proper orientation and, as
   appropriate, in the proper reading frame. Toward this end, adapters or linkers may be
   employed to join the DNA fragments or other manipulations may be involved to provide
   for convenient restriction sites, removal of superfluous DNA, removal of restriction sites,
30 or the like. For this purpose, in vitro mutagenesis, primer repair, restriction, annealing,
   resubstitutions, e.g., transitions and transversions, may be involved.
            A.     Expression Cassettes Comprising a Male Fertility Polynucleotide
                                                 - 15 -

            In particular embodiments, the expression cassettes disclosed herein comprise a
   promoter operably linked to a male fertility polynucleotide, or active fragment or variant
   thereof, as disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, a male fertility promoter or an
   active fragment or variant thereof, is operably linked to a male fertility polynucleotide
 5 disclosed herein, such as the male fertility polynucleotide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5,
   7, 9, 11, 13, 15, or 17, or an active fragment or variant thereof.
            In certain embodiments, plant promoters can preferentially initiate transcription in
   certain tissues, such as stamen, anther, filament, and pollen, or developmental growth
   stages, such as sporogenous tissue, microspores, and microgametophyte. Such plant
10 promoters are referred to as "tissue-preferred", "cell type-preferred", or "growth-stage
   preferred". Promoters which initiate transcription only in certain tissue are referred to as
   "tissue-specific". Likewise, promoters which initiate transcription only at certain growth
   stages are referred to as "growth stage-specific". A "cell type-specific" promoter drives
   expression only in certain cell types in one or more organs, for example, stamen cells, or
15 individual cell types within the stamen such as anther, filament, or pollen cells.
            Male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein, and active fragments and variants
   thereof, can be operably linked to male-tissue-specific or male-tissue-preferred promoters
   including, for example, stamen-specific or stamen-preferred promoters, anther-specific or
   anther-preferred promoters, pollen-specific or pollen-preferred promoters, tapetum
20 specific promoters or tapetum-preferred promoters, and the like. Promoters can be
   selected based on the desired outcome. For example, the polynucleotides of interest can
   be operably linked to constitutive, tissue-preferred, growth stage-preferred, or other
   promoters for expression in plants.
            In one embodiment, the promoters may be those which preferentially express a
25 polynucleotide of interest in the male tissues of the plant. No particular male fertility
   tissue-preferred promoter must be used in the process, and any of the many such
   promoters known to one skilled in the art may be employed. One such promoter is the
   5126 promoter, which preferentially directs expression of the polynucleotide to which it
   is linked to male tissue of the plants, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,851 and
30 5,689,051. Other examples include the maize Ms45 promoter described at U.S. Pat. No.
   6,037,523; SF3 promoter described at U.S. Pat. No. 6,452,069; the BS92-7 promoter
   described at WO 02/063021; a SGB6 regulatory element described at U.S. Pat. No.

            In some embodiments, expression cassettes comprise male-gamete-preferred
   promoters operably linked to a male fertility polynucleotide. Male-gamete-preferred
 5 promoters include the PG47 promoter (US 5,412,085; US 5,545,546; PlantJ 3(2):261
   271 (1993)), as well as ZM13 promoter (Hamilton, et al., (1998) Plant Mol. Biol. 38:663
   669); actin depolymerizing factor promoters (such as Zmabpl, Zmabp2; see, for example
   Lopez, et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:7415-7420); the promoter of the
   maize pectin methylesterase-like gene, ZmC5 (Wakeley, et al., (1998) Plant Mol. Biol.
10 37:187-192); the profilin gene promoter Zmprol (Kovar, et al., (2000) The Plant Cell
   12:583-598); the sulphated pentapeptide phytosulphokine gene ZmPSKI (Lorbiecke, et

   calmodulin binding protein Mpcbp (Reddy, et al., (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275(45):35457
   70).
15          As disclosed herein, constitutive promoters include, for example, the core
   promoter of the Rsyn7 promoter and other constitutive promoters disclosed in WO
   99/43838 and U.S. Patent No. 6,072,050; the core CaMV 35S promoter (Odell et al.

   5,268,463; 5,608,142; and 6,177,611.
25          "Seed-preferred" promoters include both those promoters active during seed
   development such as promoters of seed storage proteins as well as those promoters active
   during seed germination. See Thompson et al. (1989) BioEssays 10:108, herein
   incorporated by reference. Such seed-preferred promoters include, but are not limited to,

   Plant Mol. 19:665-75; Marrs et al. (1993) Dev. Genet. 14:27-41), and smHSP (Waters et
25 al. (1996) J. Experimental Botany 47:325-338). Other stress-inducible promoters include
   rip2 (U.S. Patent No. 5,332,808 and U.S. Publication No. 2003/0217393) and rp29a
   (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki et al. (1993) Mol. Gen. Genetics 236:331-340).
           As discussed elsewhere herein, the expression cassettes comprising male fertility
   polynucleotides may be stacked with other polynucleotides of interest. Any
30 polynucleotide of interest may be stacked with the male fertility polynucleotide, including
   for example, male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotides and marker polynucleotides.
           Male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein may be stacked in or with
   expression cassettes comprising a promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide which is
   male-gamete-disruptive; that is, a polynucleotide which interferes with the function,
                                               - 18 -

   formation, or dispersal of male gametes. A male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide can
   operate to prevent function, formation, or dispersal of male gametes by any of a variety of
   methods. By way of example but not limitation, this can include use of polynucleotides
   which encode a gene product such as DAM-methylase or barnase (See, for example, U.S.
 5 Pat. No. 5,792,853 or 5,689,049; PCT/EP89/00495); encode a gene product which
   interferes with the accumulation of starch or affects osmotic balance in pollen (See, for
   example, US. Pat. Nos. 7,875,764; 8,013,218; 7,696,405); inhibit formation of a gene
   product important to male gamete function, formation, or dispersal (See, for example.
   U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,859,341; 6,297.,426); encode a gene product which combines with
10 another gene product to prevent male gamete formation or function (See U.S. Pat. Nos.
   6,162,964; 6,013,859; 6,281,348; 6,399,856; 6,248,935; 6,750,868; 5,792,853); are
   antisense to, or cause co-suppression of, a gene critical to male gamete function,
   formation, or dispersal (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,184,439; 5,728,926; 6,191,343; 5,728,558;
   5,741,684); interfere with expression of a male fertility polynucleotide through use of
15 hairpin formations (Smith et al. (2000) Nature 407:319-320; WO 99/53050 and WO
   98/53083) or the like.
           Male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotides include dominant negative genes such as
   methylase genes and growth-inhibiting genes. See, U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,856. Dominant
   negative genes include diphtheria toxin A-chain gene (Czako and An (1991) Plant
20 Physiol. 95 687-692; Greenfield et al. (1983) PNAS 80:6853); cell cycle division
   mutants such as CDC in maize (Colasanti et al. (1991) PNAS 88: 3377-3381); the WT
   gene (Farmer et al. (1994) Mol. Genet. 3:723-728); and P68 (Chen et al. (1991) PNAS
   88:315-319).
           Further examples of male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotides include, but are not
25 limited to, pectate lyase gene pelE from Erwinia chrysanthermi (Kenn et al (1986) J.
   Bacteriol. 168:595); CytA toxin gene from Bacillus thuringiensisIsraeliensis (McLean et
   al (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169:1017 (1987), U.S. Patent No. 4,918,006); DNAses, RNAses,
   proteases, or polynucleotides expressing anti-sense RNA. A male-gamete-disruptive
   polynucleotide may encode a protein involved in inhibiting pollen-stigma interactions,
30 pollen tube growth, fertilization, or a combination thereof.
           Male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein may be stacked with expression
   cassettes disclosed herein comprising a promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide of
   interest encoding a reporter or marker product. Examples of suitable reporter
   polynucleotides known in the art can be found in, for example, Jefferson et al. (1991) in
                                               - 19 -

   (1990); Kain et al. BioTechniques 19:650-655 (1995); and Chiu et al. Current Biology
   6:325-330 (1996). In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide of interest encodes a
 5 selectable reporter. These can include polynucleotides that confer antibiotic resistance or
   resistance to herbicides. Examples of suitable selectable marker polynucleotides include,
   but are not limited to, genes encoding resistance to chloramphenicol, methotrexate,
   hygromycin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, bleomycin, sulfonamide, bromoxynil,
   glyphosate, and phosphinothricin.
10          In some embodiments, the expression cassettes disclosed herein comprise a
   polynucleotide of interest encoding scorable or screenable markers, where presence of the
   polynucleotide produces a measurable product. Examples include a P-glucuronidase, or
   uidA gene (GUS), which encodes an enzyme for which various chromogenic substrates
   are known (for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,268,463 and 5,599,670); chloramphenicol
15 acetyl transferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Other screenable markers include the
   anthocyanin/flavonoid polynucleotides including, for example, a R-locus polynucleotide,
   which encodes a product that regulates the production of anthocyanin pigments (red
   color) in plant tissues, the genes which control biosynthesis of flavonoid pigments, such
   as the maize C1 and C2 , the B gene, the pl gene, and the bronze locus genes, among
20 others. Further examples of suitable markers encoded by polynucleotides of interest
   include the cyan fluorescent protein (CYP) gene, the yellow fluorescent protein gene, a
   lux gene, which encodes a luciferase, the presence of which may be detected using, for
   example, X-ray film, scintillation counting, fluorescent spectrophotometry, low-light
   video cameras, photon counting cameras or multiwell luminometry, a green fluorescent
25 protein (GFP), and DsRed2 where plant cells transformed with the marker gene are red in
   color, and thus visually selectable. Additional examples include a p-lactamase gene
   encoding an enzyme for which various chromogenic substrates are known (e.g., PADAC,
   a chromogenic cephalosporin), a xylE gene encoding a catechol dioxygenase that can
   convert chromogenic catechols, an a-amylase gene, and a tyrosinase gene encoding an
30 enzyme capable of oxidizing tyrosine to DOPA and dopaquinone, which in turn
   condenses to form the easily detectable compound melanin.
            The expression cassette can also comprise a selectable marker gene for the selection
   of transformed cells. Selectable marker genes are utilized for the selection of transformed
   cells or tissues. Marker genes include genes encoding antibiotic resistance, such as those
                                               - 20 -

   encoding neomycin phosphotransferase II (NEO) and hygromycin phosphotransferase
   (HPT), as well as genes conferring resistance to herbicidal compounds, such as glufosinate
   ammonium, bromoxynil, imidazolinones, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D).
   Additional selectable markers include phenotypic markers such as j-galactosidase and
 5 fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Su et al. (2004) Biotechnol
   Bioeng 85:610-9 and Fetter et al. (2004) Plant Cell 16:215-28), cyan florescent protein
   (CYP) (Bolte et al. (2004) J. Cell Science 117:943-54 and Kato et al. (2002) Plant

            In some embodiments, the expression cassettes disclosed herein comprise a first
30 polynucleotide of interest encoding a male fertility polynucleotide operably linked to a
   first promoter polynucleotide stacked with a second polynucleotide of interest encoding a
   male-gamete-disruptive gene product operably linked to a male tissue-preferred promoter
   polynucleotide. In other embodiments, the expression cassettes described herein may

   also be stacked with a third polynucleotide of interest encoding a marker polynucleotide
   operably linked to a third promoter polynucleotide.
            In specific embodiments, the expression cassettes disclosed herein comprise a first
   polynucleotide of interest encoding a wheat male fertility gene disclosed herein, such as
 5 Ms22, Ms26, or Ms45 operably linked to a constitutive promoter, such as the cauliflower
   mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. The expression cassettes may further comprise a
   second polynucleotide of interest encoding a male-gamete-disruptive gene product
   operably linked to a male tissue-preferred promoter. In certain embodiments, the
   expression cassettes disclosed herein may further comprise a third polynucleotide of
10 interest encoding a marker gene, such as the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT)
   gene from Streptomyces viridochomagenes operably linked to a constitutive promoter,
   such as the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter.
   IV.      Plants
15          A.      Plants Having Altered Levels/Activity of Male FertilityPolypeptide
            Further provided are plants having altered levels and/or activities of a male
   fertility polypeptide and/or altered levels of male fertility. In some embodiments, the
   plants disclosed herein have stably incorporated into their genomes a heterologous male
   fertility polynucleotide, or active fragments or variants thereof, as disclosed herein. Thus,
20 plants, plant cells, plant parts, and seeds are provided which comprise at least one
   heterologous male fertility polynucleotide as set forth in any one of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5,
   7, 9, 11, 13, 15, or 17 or any active fragments or variants disclosed herein.
            Plants are further provided comprising the expression cassettes disclosed herein
   comprising a male fertility polynucleotide operably linked to a promoter that is active in
25 the plant. In some embodiments, expression of the male fertility polynucleotide
   modulates male fertility of the plant. In certain embodiments, expression of the male
   fertility polynucleotide increases male fertility of the plant. For example, plants are
   provided comprising an expression cassette comprising an Ms22 polynucleotide as set
   forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, or 5, or an active fragment or variant thereof, operably linked
30 to a constitutive promoter, such as the CaMV 35S promoter. Upon expression of the
   Ms22 polynucleotide, male fertility of the plant is increased.
            In certain embodiments, expression cassettes comprising a heterologous male
   fertility polynucleotide as disclosed herein, or an active fragment or variant thereof,
   operably linked to a promoter active in a plant, are provided to a male sterile plant. Upon
                                                 - 22 -

   expression of the heterologous male fertility polynucleotide, the male fertility of the plant
   is restored. In specific embodiments, the plants disclosed herein comprise an expression
   cassette comprising a heterologous male fertility polynucleotide as disclosed herein, or an
   active fragment or variant thereof, operably linked to a promoter, stacked with one or
 5 more expression cassettes comprising a polynucleotide of interest operably linked to a
   promoter active in the plant. For example, the stacked polynucleotide of interest can
   comprise a male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide and/or a marker polynucleotide.
            Plants disclosed herein may also comprise stacked expression cassettes described
   herein comprising at least two polynucleotides such that the at least two polynucleotides
10 are inherited together in more than 50% of meioses, i.e., not randomly. Accordingly,
   when a plant or plant cell comprising stacked expression cassettes with two
   polynucleotides undergoes meiosis, the two polynucleotides segregate into the same
   progeny (daughter) cell. In this manner, stacked polynucleotides will likely be expressed
   together in any cell for which they are present. For example, a plant may comprise an
15 expression cassette comprising a male fertility polynucleotide stacked with an expression
   cassette comprising a male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide such that the male fertility
   polynucleotide and the male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide are inherited together.
   Specifically, a male sterile plant could comprise an expression cassette comprising a male
   fertility polynucleotide disclosed herein operably linked to a constitutive promoter,
20 stacked with an expression cassette comprising a male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide
   operably linked to a male tissue-preferred promoter, such that the plant produces mature
   pollen grains. However, in such a plant, development of the daughter pollen cells
   comprising the male fertility polynucleotide will be prevented by expression of the male
   gamete-disruptive polynucleotide.
25
            B.      Plants and Methods of Introduction
            As used herein, the term plant includes plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant cell
   tissue cultures from which a plant can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps, and plant
   cells that are intact in plants or parts of plants such as embryos, pollen, ovules, seeds,
30 leaves, flowers, branches, fruit, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, stalks, roots, root tips, anthers,
   grain and the like. As used herein "grain" is intended the mature seed produced by
   commercial growers for purposes other than growing or reproducing the species.
   Progeny, variants, and mutants of the regenerated plants are also included within the
                                                  - 23 -

   scope of the disclosure, provided that these parts comprise the introduced nucleic acid
   sequences.
             The methods disclosed herein comprise introducing a polypeptide or
   polynucleotide into a plant cell. "Introducing" is intended to mean presenting to the plant
 5 the polynucleotide or polypeptide in such a manner that the sequence gains access to the
   interior of a cell. The methods disclosed herein do not depend on a particular method for
   introducing a sequence into the host cell, only that the polynucleotide or polypeptides
   gains access to the interior of at least one cell of the host. Methods for introducing
   polynucleotide or polypeptides into host cells (i.e., plants) are known in the art and
10 include, but are not limited to, stable transformation methods, transient transformation
   methods, and virus-mediated methods.
             "Stable transformation" is intended to mean that the nucleotide construct
   introduced into a host (i.e., a plant) integrates into the genome of the plant and is capable
   of being inherited by the progeny thereof. "Transient transformation" is intended to mean
15 that a polynucleotide is introduced into the host (i.e., a plant) and expressed temporally or
   a polypeptide is introduced into a host (i.e., a plant).
             Transformation protocols as well as protocols for introducing polypeptides or
   polynucleotide sequences into plants may vary depending on the type of plant or plant
   cell, i.e., monocot or dicot, targeted for transformation. Suitable methods of introducing
20 polypeptides and polynucleotides into plant cells include microinjection (Crossway et al.
   (1986) Biotechniques 4:320-334), electroporation (Riggs et al. (1986) Proc.Natl. Acad.
   Sci. USA 83:5602-5606, Agrobacterium-mediatedtransformation (Townsend et al., U.S.

            In specific embodiments, the male fertility polynucleotides or expression cassettes
   disclosed herein can be provided to a plant using a variety of transient transformation
20 methods. Such transient transformation methods include, but are not limited to, the
   introduction of the male fertility polypeptide or variants and fragments thereof directly
   into the plant or the introduction of a male fertility transcript into the plant. Such
   methods include, for example, microinjection or particle bombardment. See, for example,
   Crossway et al. (1986) Mol Gen. Genet. 202:179-185; Nomura et al. (1986) Plant Sci.
25 44:53-58; Hepler et al. (1994) Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. 91: 2176-2180 and Hush et al.
   (1994) The Journalof Cell Science 107:775-784, all of which are herein incorporated by
   reference. Alternatively, the male fertility polynucleotide or expression cassettes
   disclosed herein can be transiently transformed into the plant using techniques known in
   the art. Such techniques include viral vector system and the precipitation of the
30 polynucleotide in a manner that precludes subsequent release of the DNA. Thus, the
   transcription from the particle-bound DNA can occur, but the frequency with which it is
   released to become integrated into the genome is greatly reduced. Such methods include
   the use of particles coated with polyethylimine (PEI; Sigma #P3143).
                                                - 25 -

            In other embodiments, the male fertility polynucleotides or expression cassettes
   disclosed herein may be introduced into plants by contacting plants with a virus or viral
   nucleic acids. Generally, such methods involve incorporating a nucleotide construct of
   disclosed herein within a viral DNA or RNA molecule. It is recognized that a male
 5 fertility sequence disclosed herein may be initially synthesized as part of a viral
   polyprotein, which later may be processed by proteolysis in vivo or in vitro to produce the
   desired recombinant protein. Methods for introducing polynucleotides into plants and
   expressing a protein encoded therein, involving viral DNA or RNA molecules, are known
   in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,889,191, 5,889,190, 5,866,785,
10 5,589,367, 5,316,931, and Porta et al. (1996) MolecularBiotechnology 5:209-221; herein
   incorporated by reference.
            Methods are known in the art for the targeted insertion of a polynucleotide at a
   specific location in the plant genome. In one embodiment, the insertion of the
   polynucleotide at a desired genomic location is achieved using a site-specific
15 recombination system. See, for example, W099/25821, WO99/25854, W099/25840,
   W099/25855, and W099/25853, all of which are herein incorporated by reference.
   Briefly, the polynucleotide disclosed herein can be contained in transfer cassette flanked
   by two non-identical recombination sites. The transfer cassette is introduced into a plant
   having stably incorporated into its genome a target site which is flanked by two non
20 identical recombination sites that correspond to the sites of the transfer cassette. An
   appropriate recombinase is provided and the transfer cassette is integrated at the target
   site. The polynucleotide of interest is thereby integrated at a specific chromosomal
   position in the plant genome.
            The cells that have been transformed may be grown into plants in accordance with
25 conventional ways. See, for example, McCormick et al. (1986) Plant Cell Reports 5:81
   84. These plants may then be grown, and pollinated with either the same transformed
   strain or different strains, and the resulting progeny having desired expression of the
   desired phenotypic characteristic identified. Two or more generations may be grown to
   ensure that expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic is stably maintained and
30 inherited and then seeds harvested to ensure expression of the desired phenotypic
   characteristic has been achieved. In this manner, the present disclosure provides
   transformed seed (also referred to as "transgenic seed") having a male fertility
   polynucleotide disclosed herein, for example, an expression cassette disclosed herein,
   stably incorporated into their genome. Seed comprising any expression cassette disclosed
                                                 - 26 -

   herein can be sorted based on size parameters, including but not limited to, seed length,
   seed width, seed density, or any combination thereof.
           The male fertility polynucleotides and expression cassettes disclosed herein may be
   used for transformation of any plant species, including, but not limited to, monocots and

   Also encompassed are plants that are produced by conventional techniques using Triticum
                                                - 27 -

   sp. as a parent in a sexual cross with a non-Triticum species, such as rye Secale cereale,
   including but not limited to Triticale. In some embodiments, the wheat plant is suitable
   for commercial production of grain, such as commercial varieties of hexaploid wheat or
   durum wheat, having suitable agronomic characteristics which are known to those skilled
 5 in the art.
            Vegetables include tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentun), lettuce (e.g., Lactuca
   sativa), green beans (Phaseolusvulgaris), lima beans (Phaseoluslinensis), peas (Lathyrus
   spp.), and members of the genus Cucumis such as cucumber (C. sativus), cantaloupe (C.

20 embodiments, plants disclosed herein are crop plants (for example, corn, alfalfa, sunflower,
   Brassica,soybean, cotton, safflower, peanut, sorghum, wheat, millet, tobacco, etc.). In other
   embodiments, corn and soybean plants are optimal, and in yet other embodiments corn
   plants are optimal.
            Other plants of interest include grain plants that provide seeds of interest, oil-seed
25 plants, and leguminous plants. Seeds of interest include grain seeds, such as corn, wheat,
   barley, rice, sorghum, rye, etc. Oil-seed plants include cotton, soybean, safflower,

30          Typically, an intermediate host cell will be used in the practice of the methods and
   compositions disclosed herein to increase the copy number of the cloning vector. With an
   increased copy number, the vector containing the nucleic acid of interest can be isolated
   in significant quantities for introduction into the desired plant cells. In one embodiment,
   plant promoters that do not cause expression of the polypeptide in bacteria are employed.
                                                 - 28 -

            Prokaryotes most frequently are represented by various strains of E. coli;
   however, other microbial strains may also be used. Commonly used prokaryotic control
   sequences which are defined herein to include promoters for transcription initiation,
   optionally with an operator, along with ribosome binding sequences, include such
 5 commonly used promoters as the beta lactamase (penicillinase) and lactose (lac) promoter
   systems (Chang et al. (1977) Nature 198:1056), the tryptophan (trp) promoter system
   (Goeddel et al. (1980) Nucleic Acids Res. 8:4057) and the lambda derived P L promoter
   and N-gene ribosome binding site (Shimatake et al. (1981) Nature 292:128). The
   inclusion of selection markers in DNA vectors transfected in E coli. is also useful.
10 Examples of such markers include genes specifying resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline,
   or chloramphenicol.
            The vector is selected to allow introduction into the appropriate host cell.
   Bacterial vectors are typically of plasmid or phage origin. Appropriate bacterial cells are
   infected with phage vector particles or transfected with naked phage vector DNA. If a
15 plasmid vector is used, the bacterial cells are transfected with the plasmid vector DNA.
   Expression systems for expressing a protein disclosed herein are available using Bacillus
   sp. and Salmonella (Palvaet al. (1983) Gene 22:229-235); Mosbach et al. (1983) Nature
   302:543-545).
            In some embodiments, the expression cassette or male fertility polynucleotides
20 disclosed herein are maintained in a hemizygous state in a plant. Hemizygosity is a
   genetic condition existing when there is only one copy of a gene (or set of genes) with no
   allelic counterpart on the sister chromosome. In certain embodiments, the expression
   cassettes disclosed herein comprise a first promoter operably linked to a male fertility
   polynucleotide which is stacked with a male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide operably
25 linked to a male tissue-preferred promoter, and such expression cassettes are introduced
   into a male sterile plant in a hemizygous condition. When the male fertility
   polynucleotide is expressed, the plant is able to successfully produce mature pollen grains
   because the male fertility polynucleotide restores the plant to a fertile condition. Given
   the hemizygous condition of the expression cassette, only certain daughter cells will
30 inherit the expression cassette in the process of pollen grain formation. The daughter
   cells that inherit the expression cassette containing the male fertility polynucleotide will
   not develop into mature pollen grains due to the male tissue-preferred expression of the
   stacked encoded male-gamete-disruptive gene product. Those pollen grains that do not
   inherit the expression cassette will continue to develop into mature pollen grains and be
                                                - 29 -

   functional, but will not contain the male fertility polynucleotide of the expression cassette
   and therefore will not transmit the male fertility polynucleotide to progeny through
   pollen.
 5 V.       Modulating the Concentrationand/or Activity of Male Fertility Polypeptides
            A method for modulating the concentration and/or activity of the male fertility
   polypeptides disclosed herein in a plant is provided. The term "influences" or
   "modulates", as used herein with reference to the concentration and/or activity of the
   male fertility polypeptides, refers to any increase or decrease in the concentration and/or
10 activity of the male fertility polypeptides when compared to an appropriate control. In
   general, concentration and/or activity of a male fertility polypeptide disclosed herein is
   increased or decreased by at least 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%,
   or 90% relative to a native control plant, plant part, or cell. Modulation as disclosed
   herein may occur during and/or subsequent to growth of the plant to the desired stage of
15 development. In specific embodiments, the male fertility polypeptides disclosed herein
   are modulated in monocots, particularly wheat.
            A variety of methods can be employed to assay for modulation in the
   concentration and/or activity of a male fertility polypeptide. For instance, the expression
   level of the male fertility polypeptide may be measured directly, for example, by assaying
20 for the level of the male fertility polypeptide in the plant (i.e., Western or Northern blot),
   or indirectly, for example, by assaying the male fertility activity of the male fertility
   polypeptide in the plant. Methods for measuring the male fertility activity are described
   elsewhere herein. In specific embodiments, modulation of male fertility polypeptide
   concentration and/or activity comprises the modulation (i.e., an increase or a decrease) in
25 the level of male fertility polypeptide in the plant. Methods to measure the level and/or
   activity of male fertility polypeptides are known in the art and are discussed elsewhere
   herein. In still other embodiments, the level and/or activity of the male fertility
   polypeptide is modulated in vegetative tissue, in reproductive tissue, or in both vegetative
   and reproductive tissue.
30          In one embodiment, the activity and/or concentration of the male fertility
   polypeptide is increased by introducing the polypeptide or the corresponding male
   fertility polynucleotide into the plant. Subsequently, a plant having the introduced male
   fertility sequence is selected using methods known to those of skill in the art such as, but
   not limited to, Southern blot analysis, DNA sequencing, PCR analysis, or phenotypic
                                                 - 30 -

   analysis. In certain embodiments, marker polynucleotides are introduced with the male
   fertility polynucleotide to aid in selection of a plant having or lacking the male fertility
   polynucleotide disclosed herein. A plant or plant part altered or modified by the foregoing
   embodiments is grown under plant forming conditions for a time sufficient to modulate
 5 the concentration and/or activity of the male fertility polypeptide in the plant. Plant
   forming conditions are well known in the art.
            As discussed elsewhere herein, many methods are known the art for providing a
   polypeptide to a plant including, but not limited to, direct introduction of the polypeptide
   into the plant, or introducing into the plant (transiently or stably) a polynucleotide
10 construct encoding a male fertility polypeptide. It is also recognized that the methods
   disclosed herein may employ a polynucleotide that is not capable of directing, in the
   transformed plant, the expression of a protein or an RNA. Thus, the level and/or activity
   of a male fertility polypeptide may be increased by altering the gene encoding the male
   fertility polypeptide or its promoter. See, e.g., Kmiec, U.S. Patent 5,565,350; Zarling et
15 al., PCT/US93/03868. Therefore mutagenized plants that carry mutations in male fertility
   genes, where the mutations increase expression of the male fertility gene or increase the
   activity of the encoded male fertility polypeptide are provided.
            In other embodiments, the concentration and/or activity of a male fertility
   polypeptide is increased by introduction into a plant of an expression cassette comprising
20 a male fertility polynucleotide (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, or 17), or an
   active fragment or variant thereof, as disclosed elsewhere herein. The male fertility
   polynucleotide may be operably linked to promoter that is heterologous to the plant or
   native to the plant. By increasing the concentration and/or activity of a male fertility
   polypeptide in a plant, the male fertility of the plant is likewise increased. Thus, the male
25 fertility of a plant can be increased by increasing the concentration and/or activity of a
   male fertility polypeptide. For example, male fertility can be restored to a male sterile
   plant by increasing the concentration and/or activity of a male fertility polypeptide.
            It is also recognized that the level and/or activity of the polypeptide may be
   modulated by employing a polynucleotide that is not capable of directing, in a
30 transformed plant, the expression of a protein or an RNA. For example, the
   polynucleotides disclosed herein may be used to design polynucleotide constructs that can
   be employed in methods for altering or mutating a genomic nucleotide sequence in an
   organism. Such polynucleotide constructs include, but are not limited to, RNA:DNA
   vectors, RNA:DNA mutational vectors, RNA:DNA repair vectors, mixed-duplex
                                                  -31 -

   oligonucleotides, self-complementary RNA:DNA oligonucleotides, and recombinogenic
   oligonucleobases. Such nucleotide constructs and methods of use are known in the art,
   See, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,565,350; 5,731,181; 5,756,325; 5,760,012; 5,795,972; and
   5,871,984; all of which are herein incorporated by reference. See also, WO 98/49350,
 5 WO 99/07865, WO 99/25821, and Beetham et al. (1999) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA
   96:8774-8778; herein incorporated by reference. It is therefore recognized that methods
   disclosed herein do not depend on the incorporation of the entire polynucleotide into the
   genome, only that the plant or cell thereof is altered as a result of the introduction of the
   polynucleotide into a cell.
10         In one embodiment, the genome may be altered following the introduction of the
   polynucleotide into a cell. For example, the polynucleotide, or any part thereof, may
   incorporate into the genome of the plant. Alterations to the genome disclosed herein
   include, but are not limited to, additions, deletions, and substitutions of nucleotides into
   the genome. While the methods disclosed herein do not depend on additions, deletions,
15 and substitutions of any particular number of nucleotides, it is recognized that such
   additions, deletions, or substitutions comprises at least one nucleotide.

15 EXPERIMENTAL
   Example 1. Identification of Male Fertility Polynucleotides in Wheat
                                                 - 33 -

            Male-fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein may be identified using
   bioinformatic approaches. As an example, sequences putatively representing male
   fertility genes in wheat are initially identified by an in silico search of proprietary
   databases using known fertility genes from other species, such as maize. Candidate ESTs
 5 are selected based on protein-level homology to the reference sequences and
   consideration of the library from which the candidate sequence originated, e.g.
   representing expression in male reproductive tissue.             Based on the candidate EST
   sequences, primers are created and used to screen a proprietary wheat BAC library.
   Super-pools identified are further screened with appropriate primers to identify specific
10 BAC clones comprising the ESTs.
   Touchdown PCR may be performed (GeneAmp@ PCR System 9700, Applied
   Biosystems), using the following cycling parameters: 94'C for 3 min (one cycle), 94'C
   for 1 min, 55'C for 1 min and 72'C for 1 min 30s, (35 cycles), 72'C for 7 min, and
   termination at 4'C. Pfu Ultra HotstartTM DNA polymerase (Stratagene) may be
15 preferred for its very low average error rate (less than 0.5 % per 500-bp fragment
   amplified).
            Wheat insert DNA isolated from the BAC clones is digested for Southern blot
   confirmation using a candidate EST clone as a probe. BAC fragments are subcloned into
   pBluescript@ (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). White colonies are grown in LB medium
20 and transferred onto a membrane using a dot-blot procedure. After denaturation the
   membrane is probed with a candidate EST clone. Positive clones are identified and
   sequenced.

   Example 3. Wheat Transformation
          Wheat transformation protocols are available to one of skill in the art. See, for
   example, He et al. (2010) J. Exp. Botany 61(6):1567-1581; Wu et al. (2008) Transgenic

   Example 4. Directed modification of MS26.
            This example describes methods to mutate wheat genes using double-strand-break
   technologies to enable directed DNA modification or gene insertion via homologous
   recombination. More specifically, this example describes a method which includes, but is
 5 not limited to, delivery of a custom homing endonuclease, MS26+, to recognize, cleave,
   and mutate wheat chromosomal DNA through imprecise non-homologous end-joining
   (NHEJ) repair.
            Vectors and transformation:
10          Male fertility MS26 genes located within wheat genomes A, B and D contain a 22
   base pair sequence (5'-GATGGTGACGTACGTGCCCTAC-3';                 SEQ ID NO: 21) which
   is recognized by an MS26+ homing endonuclease as a substrate for introducing a double
   strand break. The 22 bp MS26 recognition site is present within the A, B and D wheat
   genomes and conserved across maize, sorghum and rice MS26 orthologous genes (Figure
15 1). The MS26+ homing endonuclease has been shown to generate mutations in maize,
   rice and sorghum plants W02013/066423, published on May 10, 2013. To generate
   mutations in the genomic Ms26 genes in wheat plants, PHP42063 was introduced into
   wheat Fielder variety by Agrobacterium-mediatedtransformation methods similar to
   those described (Tamas-Nyitrai et al Plant Cell Cultures Protocols Methods in Molecular
20 Biology 877, 2012, 357-384; He, et al., (2010) J. Exp. Botany 61(6):1567-1581; Wu, et
   al., (2008) TransgenicRes. 17:425-436; Nehra, et al., (1994) Plant J. 5(2):285-297;
   Rasco-Gaunt, et al., (2001) J. Exp. Botany 52(357):865-874; Razzaq, et al., (2011)
   African J. Biotech. 10(5):740-750).
            PHP42063 contains a single chain MS26+ placed under the transcriptional control
25 of the maize CAS 1 promoter. The CAS 1 promoter can be transcriptionally induced by
   either the sulfonylurea-safener, 2-CBSU, or by elevated temperature (US patent
   application 13/896,437 filed May 17, 2013).        PHP42063 also contains a blue
   fluorescence gene (CFP) regulated by the ZmEND2 promoter which is used as visual
   marker for the selection of integration of the T-DNA into wheat cells. In addition,
30 PHP42063 contains a copy of a red fluorescence gene regulated by the maize Histone 2B
   promoter. A portion of the red fluorescence gene in this construct was duplicated in a
   direct orientation, consisting of two fragments of the RFP gene with 369 bp of overlap.
   The two fragments are separated by a 136-bp spacer containing an MS26 target site. Blue
   fluorescing calli were selected and used for regeneration of wheat plants and grown in the
                                                - 37 -

   greenhouse to maturity and seed set. Wheat plants containing TDNA insertions of
   PHP42063 were verified by copy-number analysis. Four independent single or low-copy
   PHP42063 transformed plants were selected for additional experimentation. Blue
   fluorescing immature embryos were harvested 14-20 days after pollination, sterilized,
 5 placed on maintenance media and incubated in the dark at 37C for 24 hours. At the end
   of this period, embryos incubated at the elevated temperature were moved to room
   temperature (<26C) and embryos were allowed to grow in the dark. Approximately 72
   hours after the initiation of treatment at elevated temperature, embryos incubated at 37C
   begin to develop red fluorescing sectors. This observation suggests that the heat
10 inducible gene cassette, CAS 1:MS26+, has resulted in double-strand-breaks at the MS26
   target site between the two overlapping sequences of the RF-FP reporter, promoting
   intramolecular recombination and producing a functional RFP gene which is revealed by
   the appearance of red fluorescing cells against a background of blue fluorescence. Red
   fluorescing callus events were selected for additional molecular characterization and plant
15 regeneration.
            Identification of mutations at the TaMS26 target site in plant tissues.
            Total genomic DNA was extracted from the heat treated and non-heat treated
   callus transformed with the MS26+ homing endonuclease and the region surrounding the
20 genomic target site was PCR amplified with Phusion@ High Fidelity PCR Master Mix
   (New England Biolabs, M0531L) adding on the sequences necessary for amplicon
   specific barcodes and Illumnia sequencing using "tailed" primers through two rounds of

   DNA extracted from leaves of untransformed Fielder plants served as a negative control.
            The resulting PCR amplifications were concentrated using a Qiagen Minielute
   PCR purification spin column, electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and the appropriate
 5 amplifications were excised and purified with a Qiagen Gel Extraction spin column. The
   concentration of the gel purified amplifications was measured with a Hoechst dye-based
   fluorometric assay, combined in an equimolar ratio, and single read 100 nucleotide-length
   deep sequencing was performed on Illumina's Genome Analyzer lIx (ELIM
   Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.) with a 30-40% (v/v) spike of PhiX control v3 (Illumina, FC
10  110-3001) to off-set sequence bias. Only those reads with a >1 nucleotide indel arising
   within a 6 nucleotide window centered over the expected site of cleavage and not found
   in a similar level in the negative control were classified as NHEJ mutations. The total
   numbers of NHEJ mutations were then used to calculate the % mutant reads based on the
   total number of reads of an appropriate length containing a perfect match to the barcode
15 and forward primer.

   compared to the negative control is shown in Table 6. The ten most prevalent types of
   NHEJ mutations recovered from the heat treated callus are shown in Figure 2. These data
20 suggest that the MS26+ homing endonuclease effectively introduced NHEJ mutations and
   alterations into the native MS26 wheat genes.

   was screened for MS26-1 target site mutations by amplification of the region by PCR
   using the primer pair UNIMS26 5'-2 (GACGTGGTGCTCAACTTCGTGAT; SEQ ID

   and digestion of the amplified products with the DNA restriction enzyme, BsiWI, which
10 recognizes the sequence 5'-CGTACG-3'. Products of these reactions were
   electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels and screened for BsiWI digestion resistant bands
   indicative of mutations at the MS26-1 targets site.
           Ten out of the 122 regenerated plants screened from PHP42063 heat treated
   embryos contained PCR products resistant to BsiWI restriction enzyme digestion
15 indicating mutations at the MS26 target site. Subcloning and DNA sequence analysis of
   these PCR products revealed a variety of mutations across the MS26 target site ranging
   from a single nucleotide insertion to deletions of 4 to 98 nucleotides. In total, seven non
   identical mutations were identified in these regenerated wheat plants (Figure 3). Plants
   containing these mutations were allowed to self-pollinate. Progeny plants were screened
20 for meiotic inheritance of the above describe mutations by PCR amplification to reveal
