ABSTRACT
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CREATING AN INSTANCE MODEL
A system and method for creating an instance model is provided. The system provides an information
extraction and modeling framework from wide spectrum of document types such as PDF, Text,
HTML, LOG, CSV, images, audio/video files and DOCX. In this framework information is extracted
and mapped on a domain conceptual model like ER model and the instance model is created. Initially
a template model is created using the existing ER model and the plurality of data sources. The
template model, the existing ER model and the information extracted from the plurality of data
sources are then provided as input to generate the instance model. The system or method is not limited
to extract information from log files. This can be useful for different types of files type if the structures
and formats of data are different. The system can also be used with unstructured type of data sources.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS AND PRIORITY
         [001]   The present application claims priority from Indian provisional specification no.
<removed-apn>69 filed on 07th December, 2016, the complete disclosure of which, in its entirety is
herein incorporated by references.
TECHNICAL FIELD
         [002]   The embodiments herein generally relate to the field of knowledge acquisition and
knowledge representation and reasoning, and, more particularly, method and system for instance
model generation using an existing entity relationship (ER) model and template model using an
extract, transform, load (ETL) process.
BACKGROUND
         [003]   Meta-modeling environments allow modelers to simulate complex scenarios with
high-level modeling tools. Meta-modeling environments provide the user with the basic tools with
which the user can create a meta-model. The user-defined meta-model, which may also be referred
to as an ontology, can then be processed by the meta-modeling environment to generate an interface
that can be used to create one or more instance models. Often, meta-modeling environments provide
                                             2

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
a visual language, allowing modelers to create detailed models, without requiring low-level
knowledge of the underlying classes that make up the model.
         [004]   Existing meta-modeling environments typically may be used to create domain-specific
modeling tools. Meta-models include syntax, semantics and entities. Entities such as routers,
switches, operating systems, VMs, Servers continuously generate vast amount of logs data per
second. This data contain useful information which can be used to take automatic action if machine
can understand it. Automation tools can perform troubleshooting, security check if this unstructured
information can be converted into structured format. The input information such as log files or any
other data sources can be straightforward or obscure, depending on the attitude of the developer who
wrote them. Either way, most of the time they are written with human readers in mind. It is necessary
to extract relevant information from the data.
         [005]   Information extraction is task to extract domain specific relevant information from
different data sources. Extracted information can be domain entities, association between entities,
attributes like hostname, port number, data etc. and associated verbs with each entity. Extracting
information can be from logs, html files, pdf files, domain corpus, webs and scanned images of forms.
The extraction of data from speech data and other data sources is also addressed.
         [006]   In the existing solutions, a generic unified approach is missing for creating instance of
a model for infrastructure, forms, invoice, purchase orders, goods received notes, clinical trials,
processes etc. and associating them with existing instance models to do analysis especially in the field
of forecasting, healthcare, compliance, diagnostic, automation etc. In addition to that, there are
problems related to unstructured message, entity mapping problems, attribute mapping problem, and
artificial ignorance problem etc.

accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. The examples used herein are
intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be
practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein.
Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.
        [00201 Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to Fig. 1 through Fig. 5, where
similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there
are shown preferred embodiments and these embodiments are described in the context of the
following exemplary system and/or method.
        [00211 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, a system 100 for creating an instance
model is shown in Fig. 1. The system 100 extracts information to fill the domain conceptual model
like entity relationship (ER) model and create different instance models. In view of the foregoing,
according to an embodiment, the system and method for creating the instance model is for services
as software is disclosed. The services may be infrastructure services, business process services,
enterprise services, healthcare services and the like.
        [00221 In the context of present disclosure, the term 'knowledge' and 'information' can be
defined as follow: Knowledge: a domain model capturing structural and the functional properties of
all domain elements. The knowledge representation may be termed as (domain) ontology or
knowledge graph. And the reasoning and inference engine is the processing unit. Information: It is
the subset of knowledge (in exact/specific context) used to solve a certain problem And both
information extraction as well as information retrieval is performed here.
        [00231 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the system 100 comprises a user
interface 102, a processor 104 and a memory 106 in communication with the processor 104. The
                                              7

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
processor 104 configured to execute algorithms stored in the memory 106. According to an
embodiment of the disclosure, the processor 104 further includes a plurality of modules for
performing various functions. The processor 104 may include a template model generation module
 108, an extraction module 110, an instance model generation module 112, a merging module 114 and
a validation module 116.
         [00241 According to an embodiment of the disclosure the user interface 102 is configured to
provide inputs to the system 100. The user interface 102 is configured to provide a plurality of data
sources as a first input. The user interface 102 can also be configured to provide an existing entity
relationship (ER) model as a second input. The user interface 102 can include a variety of software
and hardware interfaces, for example, a web interface, a graphical user interface, and the like and can
facilitate multiple communications within a wide variety of networks N/W and protocol types,
including wired networks, for example, LAN, cable, etc., and wireless networks, such as WLAN,
cellular, or satellite.
         [00251 The first input of the plurality of data sources which is provided to the system 100 can
be in various form, structured, unstructured, semi-structured, media, images and the like. The
information can be extracted using at least one of natural language processing (NLP) pipeline tools
to perform stemming, co-reference resolution, chunk parsing and part of speech tagging. In another
example, the image processing tools may be used to perform OCR and similar tasks. In yet another
example, scripting tools like groovy, Perl, and so on, audio/video processing tools, text to speech, and
the like can also be used.
         [00261 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the processor 104 includes the template
model generation module 108 as shown in Fig. 1 and in the data extraction framework of Fig. 3. The
                                                8

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
data extraction framework extracts the relevant information from various structured input sources
such as log files, pdf files, invoices, etc. using annotations. The first input and the second input are
provided to the template model generation module 108. The template model generation module 108
has pattern generation and entity scope resolution. Extraction pattern is automatically generated from
user marking and annotations. The template model generation module 108 generates a template
model. The output of the template model generation module 108 is given to the extraction module
 110. The extraction module 110 resolves entity scopes and associations and extracts information from
the plurality of data sources.
         [0027] According to another embodiment of the disclosure, the template model can also be
generated automatically. The automated method first finds initial set of potential mappings with
context and exact segment matching and semantic level mappings using lexical and concept level
matching. The help inherent structure can also be taken while finding the template elements. For
example, consider the tabular form data where top row contains ER elements such as classes and
attributes, whereas data rows contains existing instance model elements or entries satisfying rules or
patterns attached with ER elements about their instances. The exact matching means high confidence
and semantic or context-concept level matching means relatively lower confidence in the findings.
The secondary type matching also include data types defined in domain ontology and regular
expression matching, which applied directly on data or after some post processing like additions of
part-of-speech tags to the words if it's on text form data or co-reference resolutions like natural
language processing. Every potential mapping's confidence is computed as weighted score of
individual scores. The highest confidence mappings are established first and other mappings
established by doing connectivity analysis or inferencing on ontology.
         [00281 This method involves finding the ER elements in the plurality of data sources and
                                                9

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
predicting the location of the ER element values by localization (searching nearby locations), pattern
matching (searching for known patterns of the ER element values). For example, if date is being
searched available date formats can be used to search data that represents a date. Similarly and IP
address can be searched using a pattern \b((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)(\.l$)){4}\b     and so
on, and past knowledge application. In another example, from past templates it might be a common
knowledge that credit card number will be always a 16 digit number. Such patterns can be
automatically learned to aid automatic template model generation. Also location of a plausible data
presence can also be utilized as learnings from earlier template models. In yet another example, the
presence of 'date' in the data source denotes that the date will be present either to the right of it or
below it. Such various analysis can be done and knowledge extracted for increasing the efficiency
and quality of the template model generation.
        [0029] According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the processor 104 also includes the
instance model generation module 112, the merging module 114 and the validation module 116. The
template model, the extracted information from the extraction module 110 and the existing ER model
is given to the instance model generation module 112 as shown in Fig. 4. The template model 110
indicates 'where' part of information extraction, from where the user wants to extract the information.
The existing ER model indicates 'what' part of information extraction, exactly what data the user
wants to extract, the same is available (reference) in the template model and the template model
indicates 'how' part of the information extraction, i.e. how the information is to be extracted. The
instance model generation module 112 generates the instance model as output. The merging module
 114 then merges the created instance model with the one or more existing instance models. For
example, if a medical data (clinical trials, medical report, etc.) is converted to an instance model then
the same will be merged with the existing instance model of the patient if the patient already exists
                                              10

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
in the existing instance models.
         [00301 The instance model then can be validated using the validation module 116. Based on
the validation, the review information or feedback can be given back to the template model generation
module for it to adapt. The meaning of adapt here can be explained as follows: Template model
generation is performed initially using the plurality of data sources, the existing ER model and the
knowledge. An additional data which needs to be extracted from the plurality of data sources is then
annotated. This template model is then shown to the user in form of annotations on the data source.
The user can change / delete / add annotations as appropriate. The annotated additional data is then
mapped with the ER model elements. These annotations are then used along with the plurality of data
sources and the ER model to generate a new template model. Also the modifications made by user
are used as feedback to enhance the knowledge which is used for further automated generations of
the new template model.
         [00311 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, there are two parts of the method the
first part is authoring of the template model to create the instance model and the second part is the
further designing of the template model depending on the type of the plurality of data sources. In the
first part as explained above, authoring of template model is done by the user and in this process
extracting the information, converting to the instance model, validation by the user for feedback and
fixing the template model is achieved.
         [00321 Further in the second part, once the template model is defined and agreed, the plurality
of data sources can be monitored online and the conversion to instance model can be triggered on
data presence. During this process an appropriate template is picked up which best matches to the
data source. For this in the template data source specific images, texts, or any other identifiable data
                                              11

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
can be marked as key for a template to match. In absence of any such key markings a best template
can also be configured to be chosen based on the content and largest match of the templates available.
For example, a bank name, a bank logo along with the name of form can be looked for matching by
specifying these as key markings. A template with all three will be best match and will be used for
the instance model generation.
         [00331 The existing ER model will change as domain changes. Each domain consists of
specific set of entities and attributes. Telecom domain will have entities like call summary, call items
and attributes like date-time, calls/sec etc. Whereas pharmaceutical domain will contain entities like,
drug, patient-details and it will have attributes like dosage, price, patient DOB, initials, etc. Whereas
the template model will be different for different data sources. Data source will be defined by what
information it contains, in what structure, in what format (pdf, image, text) and source of the
information (customer, department, producer of information, etc.).
         [00341 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the processor 104 further comprises a
data preprocessor 118 and a data postprocessor 120. The data preprocessor 118 is configured to pre
process / clean the input data which is provided for the data extraction. Similarly, the data
postprocessor 120 is configured to process the extracted data. The content of the data preprocessor
 118 and the data post processor 120 can be customized depending on the source of data. For example,
account opening form of HDFC bank will need a different processing compared to account opening
form of Baroda bank. In another example, if a user gets an IP address, but output is expected to be
the blueprinted node ID along with the IP address, then the IP address needs to be translated to some
other form, which is the part of data post-processing.
         [0035] The plurality of data sources need to be processed using the data preprocessor 118
                                               12

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
before providing it to information extraction. Depending on the type of the use case and the type of
the plurality of data source, the processing steps change. For position or marker based (structured)
information extraction, a simple static pattern based approach is sufficient. In communication based
mode, the discourse is open for semantic interpretation and requires Natural Language Processing,
hence position or marker based approach will not be sufficient. For NLP processing, there is a need
of all relevant NLP ontologies like Lexical DB, Concept-Net, WordNet, Domain Lexicon, Verb Net,
etc. Also to make the processing faster and smarter for given domain, ontology of knowledge
elements can also be created over the set of given entity, attribute, actions within the domain. The
knowledge elements are open to link (or contain) elements from NLP ontologies. That way it is a pre
processing of knowledge (data sources) to increase the processing efficiency and accuracy. Over the
time, the learning (continual improvement) will make this domain ontology more and more complete
and correct. Language structures can also be learnt over the period to avoid processing in some cases
and to minimize processing in others.
         [0036] In case of simple information extraction (structured data), only ER model and simple
static patterns are sufficient. Once a template is provided, the template gets applied on input data and
the instance model gets generated. Also there could be need of time series data extraction, targeting
the time factor over the infrastructure and their properties. The time based blueprint is useful for time
based data analytics like predicting future events and setting alarms etc.
         [00371 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the system 100 provides an
information extraction and modeling framework from wide spectrum of document types such as PDF,
Text, HTML, LOG, CSV, Audio/Video files, DOCX and the likes. It should be appreciated that the
information can also be extracted from SMS, email, tweet etc. data formats for which natural language
processing would be essential to make sense out of the data. The example of data may include
                                               13

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
Application logs, Database logs, Network logs, Configuration files, Performance data (iostat, vmstat,
ps, etc.), invoices, cioms forms, rave forms or anything else that has a time component. It should also
be appreciated that the information can also be extracted from the scanned documents for which OCR
is must for extracting text. In an example, automation and compliance is used for explanation and
logs as example of data under extraction.
          [00381 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the knowledge model could be an
entity relationship (ER) model and blueprint model. Entity Relationship model is domain model
representation of entities and association between them. Association can be 'is-a', 'has-a' etc.
Associations could also be between entity-to-entity and attribute-to-attribute. Each entity represents
resource and technology service in service as a software computing model. Here entities can have
attributes without having any attribute value. Meta level association is defined between entities.
Blueprint model is an instance of the ER model. Entity can have more than one instance, for example
user, file, file system can have multiple instance. Entity Instances can have association with other
entity instances.
          [00391 According to another embodiment of the disclosure, a schematic architecture of
generic extraction framework for creating the instance model is shown in Fig. 4. In this case, domain
corpus such as logs, manuals, forms, web site links are taken as the input. In addition to that
information provided by the user in the form of annotation or validation and a domain knowledge is
also provided as the input. These three inputs are provided to an annotator 122. If the information
may not be auto detected then user will give information or vice-versa or it could be combination of
both. The output from the annotator 122 is provided to the template model generation module 108.
The annotation is not limited to text data. User can annotate images, logos from the image input. To
be more generic, user can also annotate in audio, video data as well. The annotator 122 has the
                                              14

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
capability for auto generating the annotation by analyzing its inputs. The information from the
template model generation module 108 is reviewed and validated using the validation module 116,
which results in the generation of the template model.
         [0040] According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the template model can also be
provided to a document parser engine 124. The document parser engine 124 also receives input from
the domain knowledge model and the domain corpus. This example is specific to text/html/pdf form
data. It could be even excel, xml etc. that is in machine readable form. And finally the document
parser engine generates the domain knowledge instance model as the output.
         [00411 This system or method is not limited to extract information from log files using ER
model and annotations, other data sources can also be used. This can useful for different types of files
including log, text, pdf, html etc. and this can also be useful if the structures and formats of data are
different. The system is also applicable for image search by applying visual search. The main
component of the system are pattern learning or pattern builder and pattern execution. The
architecture of system is generic enough to easily build plugins for new data format. It also supports
partial matching and aggregation of pattern from historical evidence and existing patterns. Framework
supports Image Processing (OCR), script based extractions, and plain string matching, regex
matching, and NLP feature matching to extract key value pair from data sources. It also supports time
search data extraction in real time.
         [00421 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the system can have scope associations
as follows: i) Containment or Has or ii) Scope to Scope. The scope can have multiple child scopes.
Further in another example, the scope can have only single element. The element is reference to a
component. The element could be anything which is specified in the ER model for example,
                                               15

user.name, company id etc.
         [00431 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the system 100 can also involve
chaining, i.e., part of transformation. In chaining, more than one transformation is performed, the
input remains same but output keep on changing. The user may have more than one templates. The
first step is to identify which is the next template to apply. Chaining is used when there is a need
different template for different vendors.
         [00441 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the system 100 can also store the
created instance model.
         [00451 In operation, a flowchart 200 illustrating the steps involved for creating the instance
model is shown in Fig. 2A-2B. Initially at step 202, the plurality of data sources is provided as the
first input using the user interface 102 to the template model generation module 108. In the next step,
204 the existing ER model are provided as the second input to the template model generation module
 108. The second input is also provided using the user interface 102. In the ER model, the entities can
have attributes without having any attribute value. At step 206, the template model is created using
the first input and the second input by the template model generation module 108. The created
template model can have scope and extraction pattern for metadata. In the next step 208, the
information is extracted from the plurality of data sources using the extraction module 110. There can
be different types of files including log, text, pdf, and html etc. from which the information can be
extracted. The same ER model applying on different sources of data, mixing of digital model is also
possible if the structures and formats of data is different.
         [00461 In the next step 210, the template model, the extracted information and the ER model
are provided as input to the instance model generation module 112. At step 212, the instance model
                                               16

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
is created by the instance model generation module 112. And finally at step 214, the created instance
model is merged with the one or more existing instance models. The instance model may also be
referred as the blueprint model. Blueprint model is instance model of the ER model. Entity can have
more than one instance, for example user, file, file system can have multiple instance. Entity Instances
can have association with other entity instances.
         [00471 According to an embodiment of the disclosure, Fig. 5 shows a schematic
representation of a conversational interface 300 for processing the input data in case the data is in
unstructured format. There could be various scenarios when the input data is day to day conversations
rather than high-end complicated queries or forms. Initially at 302, the user input in the form of input
string is provided. The user input could be in any form such as any question or any statement. The
input string is expected to contain enough information to perform the required operation. The
information provided by the user contains ER element, verb, blueprint node, and function parameters
information. At 304, the ER elements from the input string is extracted. The user input string is
compared with the existing ER model to know which ER element the user is referring. At 306, verb
and functions are extracted from the input string. Verbs on the leaf node of list of ER Element will
be searched in the user input in order to know which operation the user wishes to perform. At 308,
the blueprint model is extracted. The key attribute of each element in ER are extracted, followed by
the finding of the value of each key attribute and storing it in a map. And, if key value map is present
in blueprint model, then corresponding node is selected. At 310, the function parameter list is
extracted. Value for function parameters will be searched in the user input string and stored in map.
Only if required key value map is present, then the function will be executed. And finally at 312, If
the required function contains all the required parameters, then the function will be executed as per
requested by the user. The conversational interface can also work if there are 2 or more sentences
                                              17

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
represent the same meaning but have different usage of words. The work of conversational interface
is to find out the similarity between sentences and take out the meaning accordingly.
         [0048] According to another embodiment of the disclosure, the system 100 can also be
explain with the help of the following example:
         [00491 Table, Line and Map are extended classes (meta-meta models) defined as an identifier
to understand there semantic meanings. It was aimed to specify each of these extended classes in
terms of meta-meta model without having any specific meaning associated with them.
         [00501 For example : Table is a container scope, semantically which contains Scope Header
and Scope Rows and key-value mapping between them and Scope Header is set of scopes heading.
Meta-meta scope model is only semantic meaning and structural model which doesn't have any
underneath information about the domain or ER model. The meta scope model have other information
like key-key mapping, key-value mapping related to the ER model. Whereas the Instance model is
actual scope instance which contains values. Scope merger was specified which helps to identify the
merging between scopes. Scope relation was also specified to reflect an association between scopes
e.g. User Ul is the owner of File Fl. Entity-to-entity relations also could have its own attributes like
entity. hasPermission (user-to-file) relation could have permission as attribute (read, write etc.)
         [00511 The meta-meta model will be only structure and not bounded with any data format or
not restricted to any specific input data, that means its input data format agnostic. The input data
could be text format data or an image format data. The meta-model has key-value and value-value
mapping which use the ER model information. So meta-model instance were obtained when the meta
meta model is bounded with ER and the template model. If only the structure part is looked from
meta-model, it's still input data agnostic. The Pattern (start, end etc.) and the attributeMapping from
                                              18

meta-model are input data format dependent. Those parts were separated from meta-model and put
under Formatter group. On Instance model ETL was performed to generate blueprint model. 1.
(Extract) how to extract data from input, 2. (Transform) how to process input data and transform to
blueprint model attribute values 3. (Part of transform) (Load) how to build entities and relationships
among those, to create blueprint model, these are 3 ETL steps. The first step (Extract) is only input
data format dependent. The second step (Transform) is input data format and ER data format
dependent. The third step (Load) is only ER model dependent.
Meta-Meta Model Examples
1.      Table
<Scope name="Table">
        <Scope name="header">
           (<Scope name="heading"/><Scope name="separator"/>)*
          </Scope>
        <Scope name="separator"/>
         (<Scope name="row">
               (<Scope name="cell"/><S cope name="separator"/>)*
          </Scope>
        <Scope name="separator"/>)*
        <KeyValueScopeMapping KeyScope="header.heading" valueScope="row. cell"!>
</Scope>
Here <Scope name="cell" ref="heading"/> is the meta-meta level mapping between value (cell) and
key (heading), and mostly key will be constant for underneath domain (or specific document
type/version.)
        [00521 More important point here is the positional/index based mapping. As it's marked *, the
heading scope will repeat. Similarly cell scope will repeat. There is heading scope ref into the cell
scope. Hence according to the meta level schema/syntax, the mapping scheme/rule/pattern will be
                                              19

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
carried forward with the heading and cell scope's repetitions, and the repetition order will be inherited
for mapping. Mathematically this means cell[i] has ref=heading[i] entry.
Also in the following structure:
           (<Scope name="row">
            (<Scope name="cell" ref="heading"/><Scope name="separator"/>)*
             </Scope>)*
*  at the end for the row scope, means haveMultiplicity flag for row scope set to be true.
Whereas for
            (<Scope name="cell" ref-"heading"/><Scope name="separator"/>)*
*  at the end of the group of 2 scopes, another mechanism was needed to mention grouping of scopes
to be repeated in the same order (scope was a structure for grouping and repetition purpose only but
with many more additional members.) This list is complete idReferences for row scope, another
variable innerGroupRepeat can be provided to allow repetition of idReferences group within the row
scope.
2.       Map
<Scope name="map">
             (<Scope name="key"/><S cope name="Separator"><S cope name="value"/>
              <Scope name="Separator">)*
             <KeyValueScopeMapping KeyScope="key" valueScope="value"/>
</Scope>
3.       Line
<Scope name="line">
            (<Scope name="word"> <Scope name="separator"/>)*
</Scope>
          [00531 Here ref="infra.attr" assignment will be needed as default value or default ref value
                                              20

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
assignment option can be given to user via UI. That is because, Line as a meta meta scope will be
designed by user via (by making use of) the system provided by us. So if ref uninitialized is kept for
word scope, by default it's user's responsibility to provide the mapping at a meta level i.e. for the
instance of meta meta level Line scope while generating the domain (ER) dependent template.

Meta Model Examples:
         [00541 The meta-meta model instance will be meta model, the scopes will be created by
applying default logic. But the user can modify the scopes and its properties while defining the meta
model. ScopeMeger is for merging the Scopes, that means the InfraEntity from those scopes will
instantiate into unified BlueprintEntity and not into distinct BlueprintEntities.
         [00551 To specify the value-value mapping, ScopeRelation is required which will contain
sourceScope and targetScope, both being objects of ScopeMeger, which is container for the list of
scope paths. So ideally there should be reference of ScopeMeger object from Scope, unless it's a
single attribute entity container scope which not needed ScopeMerger at all. To make it more simple
or scalable/implementable, one or many ScopeMerger can be kept for each InfraEntity from the scope
branch (InfraEntity of that scope and of all child scopes as well.)
         [00561 For the blueprint model generation stick to binary relationships between entities, i.e.
entity-entity associations, so source and target, generic terminology have been used to specify those
entities. But to become more generic from modeling point of view, the ScopeRelation will contain
List<ScopeMerger> as then the relationship between those entities. Generally for relationships, order
                                                22

James & Wells Ref: 308390AU
is important, but there could exist few entity order agnostic relationships and even few
set/group/category like relationships as well where even the count of entities (relationship arity) is
even not fixed.

        <KeyValueScopeMapping KeyScope="header.heading3" valueScope="row.cell3"/>
</Scope>
Here repetition of row scope will not be there in meta model, rather it is the repetition of the scope
group and hence similar to meta-meta Table scope example, the innerGroupRepeat variable will allow
the repetition of the idReferences group within the row scope. To incorporate the "cell[i] has
ref--heading[i] entry" mapping rule/logic, similar to heading scope instances, the cell scope instances
will be created along with the ref entry updates. But the row scope repetition is not part of the meta
scope, rather this row scope instances will be created as ScopeInstance at run time after getting row
                                             23

This is an example of the attributeMapping for above stated Scope.
2.       Map
The template will be applied on the input log file, else the user will annotate the scopes manually and
it will look like as follows (It's Map meta model applied on a file via User Interface)
The Map meta will look as follows:
<Scope name="map" pattern="start,end">
          (<HashMap key="key" value="Entity.name.Attribute.name">

         <KeyValueScopeMapping KeyScope="key3" valueScope="value3 ">

Similar to the meta level Table scope logic explained above for repeating the header and cell scope
at meta level, same logic will be applicable here in the meta level Map scope for repeating the key
and value scope (the innerGroupRepeat variable within map 1 scope will allow the repetition.)

Here line is a special case where isMandatory field also is very useful at word scope level. For those
Scopes where isMandatory-false, the '?' regular expression will appear in the extraction pattern.
Instance Model Example:
         [0057] No need of start, end pattern to be kept at Instance model due to un-neccessory
repetition of information. Pattern is a template related (input data's pattern specific) information,
which is not mandatory and also not useful anymore at the instance level. Similarly, ScopeMerger
will contain scope paths which are not needed to repeat along with each ScopeInstance. Rather
ScopeMerger and ScopeRelation are meta information for the ScopeInstance.
