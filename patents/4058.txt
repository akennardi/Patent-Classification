   This application is a divisional of Australian patent application 2013313717, which is the
   national phase entry of PCT international application PCT/NZ2013/000155 (filed
   3 September 2013 and published as WO 2014/038959). The entire contents of each of these
 5 applications are incorporated herein.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Field of the Invention
            [0001]      The present invention generally relates to face masks that cover at least
   one of a nose and a mouth of a user to supply respiratory gas under positive pressure. More
10 particularly, certain aspects of the present invention relate to such masks that have an
   improved nasal seal portion.
   Description of the Related Art
            [0002]      Face masks can be used to provide respiratory gases to a user under
   positive pressure. In configurations in which both a mouth and a nose of a user are covered,
15 the full face mask typically will overlie a bridge of the nose. Generally, a single seal will
   circumscribe the nose and the mouth of the user.
            [0003]       Such full face masks commonly are secured to a head of the user with
   headgear. In order to sufficiently reduce leakage, the headgear typically is tightened, which
   results in an elevated pressure being exerted on a bridge of a user's nose. As the headgear is
20 tightened, the seal typically applies a progressively increasing load on the bridge of the nose.
   The pressure can be a source of discomfort and, in some circumstances, can lead to pressure
   sores over time. Looser fitting headgear may provide greater patient comfort, but air leakage
   can occur. In particular, loose fitting and in some cases even tight fitting masks can leak air
   around the portion of the mask near the user's tear ducts and nasal bridge.

15           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
            [0078]    With reference initially to Figures 1 and 2, an interface 100 is shown in
   position on a user U. The interface 100 comprises an interface that can be used in the field of
   respiratory therapy. The interface 100 has particular utility with forms of positive pressure
   respiratory therapy. For example, the interface 100 can be used for administering continuous
20 positive airway pressure ("CPAP") treatments.       In addition, the interface 100 can be used
   with variable positive airway pressure ("VPAP") treatments and bi-level positive airway
   pressure ("BiPAP") treatments. The interface can be used with any suitable CPAP system.
            [0079]    The interface 100 can comprise any suitable mask configuration.          For
   example, certain features, aspects and advantages of the present invention can find utility
25 with nasal masks, full face masks, oronasal masks or any other positive pressure mask. The
   illustrated mask is a full face mask. The interface 100 generally comprises a mask assembly
    102, a seal adjustment mechanism 103, a connection port assembly 104 and a headgear
   assembly 106.     A mask seal 110 is attached to an edge of the mask assembly 102, and
   generally traverses the mask assembly's 102 perimeter. The headgear assembly 106 is used
30 to secure the interface 100 to the patient's face. As the headgear assembly 106 is tightened
                                                 -10-

   (e.g., as its straps are pulled into tension), the interface 100 is pulled in an anterior direction F
   to compress the mask seal 110 against the user's face. However, due to typical irregularity in
   the contours of a user's face, the mask seal 110 may not adequately prevent air from
   escaping, or leaking, at all locations. In particular, the regions 105 of the mask seal 110 near
 5 the user's tear ducts can leak air. Air that escapes from inside the mask assembly 102 at the
   tear duct regions 105 can dry out the user's eyes, and provide general discomfort during use.
   A seal adjustment mechanism 103 can provide additional control over mask seal 110
   compression and help eliminate air leakage, particularly around the tear duct regions 105.
            [0080]       The seal adjustment mechanism 103, shown in generic, block form in
10 Figures 1 and 2, provides a user-controllable, compressive force along an axis transverse to
   the mask assembly's 100 vertical plane of symmetry, which is defined by the mask
   assembly's F and Z axes. In other words, the seal adjustment mechanism 103, provides a
   compressive force directed towards the side of the user's nasal bone, as indicated as
   directions C and C' in Figures 1 and 3. Any of a variety of mask configurations may be
15 configured to comprise such seal adjustment mechanism 103, including, but not limited to,
   the particular mask configurations described below.          In addition, any of a variety of seal
   adjustment mechanism configurations can help eliminate air leakage around the tear duct
   region 105 without putting excessive forces on the user's nasal bridge region.
            [0081]       For example, Figures 3A-3D illustrates one such configuration of an
20 interface 700.       The interface 700 comprises a mask assembly 702, a seal adjustment
   mechanism 704, a connection port assembly 706, and headgear (not shown).                   The mask
   assembly 702 comprises a mask seal 708 and a mask base 710.                  The mask seal 708 is
   removably attached to the mask base 710. The seal adjustment mechanism 704 includes a
   dial 712, cage 714 and threaded shaft 716.          An interlock 718 couples the seal adjustment
25 mechanism 704 to the mask base 710.
            [0082]       As the control dial 712 is rotated, threads on the threaded shaft 716 spin
   while engaged with an opening in the cage 714. Dial 712 rotation causes the cage 714 to
   advance anteriorly A (towards the mask base 710) or posteriorly P (away from the mask base
   710), depending upon whether the dial 712 is rotated in a clockwise or counterclockwise
30 direction. As the cage 714 moves towards the mask base 710, arms 720 push against the
                                                     -11-

   outside surface of the seal 708. Because the seal 708 is generally more flexible than the mask
   base 710, this movement of the arms 720 causes the flexible seal 708 to bend about the area
   where it is attached the more rigid mask base 710. As the seal 708 bends, the seal's distal
   ends 724 are pushed inwardly, towards the user's nasal bone B.          The compressive forces
 5 applied by the seal 708 help prevent air leakage around the user's tear ducts.
            [0083]     Similarly, as the control dial 712 is rotated in the opposite direction, the
   cage 714 moves posteriorly, away from the user's face. As the cage 714 moves posteriorly,
   the cage's arms 720 move away from the seal 708, which allows the seal 708 to flex back to
   its original shape.   By turning the control dial 712 the user may control the amount of
10 compressive force provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 704 in order to achieve
   maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
            [0084]     Figures 4A and 4B illustrate another configuration of an interface 730
   configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 730
   includes a mask assembly 732, a seal adjustment mechanism 734, a connection port assembly
15 736, and headgear (not shown). The mask assembly 732 comprises a mask seal 738 and a
   mask base 740. The mask seal 738 is removably attached to the mask base 740. The seal
   adjustment mechanism 734 includes a lift bar 742 that is mounted to the mask base 740 at
   pivots 744 located at opposite sides of the mask assembly 732.
            [0085]     As a crossbar portion 746 of the lift bar 742 is raised (e.g., moved in the
20 superior S direction towards the top of the interface 730), the ends 748 of the lift bar 742
   move in the opposite direction. Pads 750 positioned at the lift bar 742 ends 748 compress or
   squeeze the seal 738 as the ends 748 are lowered. In some configurations, the lift bar 742
   position is maintained as a result of frictional forces between the pads 750 and the seal 738.
   In other configurations,     a control mechanism 752 is provided.           For example, the
25 configuration of Figures 4C-4E illustrate the interface 730 comprising a control mechanism
   752 in the form of a ratchet 754. A tongue 756 formed on the crossbar portion 746 of the lift
   bar 742 mates with teeth 758 formed on the outside surface of the mask base 740. The
   ratchet 752 secures the crossbar portion 746 in the desired position.             Similarly, the
   configuration of Figures 4F-4H illustrate the interface 730 comprising a control mechanism
30 752 in the form of a dial 760 and cog 762. The dial 760 is coupled to the cog 762 such that
                                                  -12-

   as the dial 760 is rotated the cog 762 spins in the same direction. Teeth 764 in the cog 762
   engage with teeth 766 located along a wall of a cavity formed within the mask base 740.
   Turning the dial 760 thereby allows the user to control distance that the ends 748 of the lift
   bar 742 are moved, which in turn control the amount of compressive force is applied by the
 5 pads 750 against the mask seal 738.        In this manner the user may control the amount of
   compressive force provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 734 in order to achieve
   maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
           [0086]      Figure 5 illustrates another configuration of an interface 770 configured to
   provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 770 includes a mask
10 assembly 772, a seal adjustment mechanism 774, a connection port assembly 776, and
   headgear (not shown). The mask assembly 772 comprises a mask seal 778 and a mask base
   780. The mask seal 778 is removably attached to the mask base 780. The seal adjustment
   mechanism 774 includes a malleable strip 782 that is attached to the mask base 780 at
   attachment points 784.
15         [0087]      The malleable strip 782 is formed from a malleable strip of material that
   can be easily shaped by sqeezing, pushing, or pulling on the material. The malleable strip
   782 may be formed from any suitable material, such as metal, an alloy, or plastic, including
   but not limited to, aluminum, copper, magnesium, gold, silver, tin, etc. The malleable strip
   782 extends from one side of the mask seal to the other.           In other configurations, the
20 malleable strip 782 is embedded within the mask seal 778. The malleable 782 extends within
   a channel formed in the mask base 780. Pinching the malleable strip 782 at locations near or
   at the attachment points 784 causes the malleable strip 782 to apply and sustain a
   compressive force against the mask seal 778. In this manner the user may control the amount
   of compressive force provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 774 in order to achieve
25 maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
           [0088]      Figures 6A-6E illustrate another configuration of an interface 790
   configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 790
   includes a mask assembly 792, a seal adjustment mechanism 794, a connection port assembly
   796, and headgear 798 (partially shown in Figure 6B). The mask assembly 792 comprises a
30 mask seal 800 and a mask base 802. The mask seal 800 is removably attached to the mask
                                                   -13-

   base 802. The seal adjustment mechanism 794 includes a T-piece 804 that is attached to the
   mask base 802 at pivots 806.
           [0089]     The T-piece 804 comprises tabs 808 that squeeze and compress the mask
   seal 800 as the T-piece 804 is rotated about the pivots 806 from an open position (as shown
 5 in Figure 6D) to a closed position (as shown in Figure 6E). Rotation of the T-piece 804 is
   achieved by tensioning the headgear 798, as shown in Figure 6B. The tabs 808 of the T-piece
   804 are angled sufficiently inward with respect to the mask seal's 800 outer surface such that
   tension in the headgear 798 is translated into mask seal 800 compression. By adjusting the
   tension in the headgear's 798 straps, the user may control the amount of compressive force
10 provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 794 in order to achieve maximum comfort and to
   eliminate air leakage.
           [0090]     Figures 7A and 7B illustrate another configuration of an interface 810
   configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 810
   includes a mask assembly 812, a seal adjustment mechanism 814, a connection port assembly
15 (not shown), and headgear (not shown). The mask assembly 812 comprises a mask seal 816
   and a mask base 818. The mask seal 816 is removably attached to the mask base 818. The
   connection port assembly (not shown) attaches to the mask assembly 812 at an opening 820
   in the mask base 818.
           [0091]     The seal adjustment mechanism 814 comprises a finger wheel 822, a
20 double threaded screw 824, and adjustment arms 826 positioned at opposite ends of the
   double threaded screw 824.     As the finger wheel 822 is rotated, the screw 824 spins and
   causes adjustment arms 826 to move inwardly (towards each other) or outwardly (away from
   each other), depending upon the direction of finger wheel 822 rotation. The adjustment arms
   826 are positioned outside of respective portions of the mask seal 816, such that the mask
25 seal 816 is compressed as the adjustment arms 826 are moved towards each other. Similarly,
   the compressive force acting upon the mask seal 816 is reduced as the adjustment arms 826
   are moved away from each other. By rotating the finger wheel 822, the user may control the
   amount of compressive force provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 814 in order to
   achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
                                                -14-

            [0092]     Figures 8A and 8B illustrate another configuration of an interface 830
   configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 830
   comprises a mask assembly 832, a seal adjustment mechanism 834, a connection port
   assembly 836, and headgear (not shown). The mask assembly 832 comprises a mask seal 838
 5 and a mask base 840. The mask seal 838 is removably attached to the mask base 840.
            [0093]     The seal adjustment mechanism 834 comprises a dial 842 coupled to a
   cam 844. The seal adjustment mechanism 834 also comprises L-shaped rocker arms 846 that
   are rotatably coupled to the mask assembly 832 at pivots 848. First ends of the rocker arms
   846 are aligned with the cam 844 and second ends of the rocker arms 846 are aligned with the
10 mask seal 838. Rotating the dial 842 causes the cam 844 to rotate and engage or disengage
   the first ends of the rocker arms 846 and push them upward and away from the dial 842. As
   the first end of the rocker arms 846 move away from the dial 842, the second ends of the
   rocker arms 846 are rotated towards each other about respective pivots 848. The second ends
   of the rocker arms 846 engage and compress the outside surface of the mask seal 838, thereby
15 providing compressive force to improve sealing.     By rotating the dial 842, the user may
   control the amount of compressive force provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 834 in
   order to achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
            [0094]     Figures 9A-9E illustrate another configuration of an interface       850
   configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 850
20 comprises a mask assembly 852, a seal adjustment mechanism 854, a connection port
   assembly (not shown), and headgear (not shown). The mask assembly 852 comprises a mask
   seal 858 and a mask base 860. The mask seal 858 is removably attached to the mask base
   860. The connection port assembly (not shown) attaches to the mask assembly 852 at an
   opening 862 in the mask base 860.
25          [0095]     The seal adjustment mechanism 854 comprises a gear dial assembly
   formed from a dial 864, a screw 866, and two geared paddles 868. Dial 864 is rotated to turn
   the threads on the screw 866. The rotating screw 866 engages the geared ends of the paddles
   868 and causes the paddles 868 to rotate about respective pivots 870. Arms 872 attached to
   the paddles 868 comprise compression portions 874 at their distal ends. The compression
30 portions 874 rotate into and compress the mask seal 858 as the dial 864 is rotated. By
                                                -15-

   rotating the dial 864, the user may control the amount of compressive force provided by the
   seal adjustment mechanism 854 in order to achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate air
   leakage.
           [0096]     Figures 1OA-1OD illustrate another configuration of an interface 880
 5 configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 880
   comprises a mask assembly 882, a seal adjustment mechanism 884, a connection port
   assembly (not shown), and headgear (not shown). The mask assembly 882 comprises a mask
   seal 888 and a mask base 890. The mask seal 888 is removably attached to the mask base
   890. The connection port assembly (not shown) attaches to the mask assembly 882 at an
10 opening 892 in the mask base 890.
           [0097]     The seal adjustment mechanism 884 comprises a taper dial assembly
   formed from a dial 894 and two arms 896. The dial 894 comprises a threaded outer surface
   898 and a tapered internal channel 900.      The dial 894 is positioned within a thread 902
   formed within or attached to the mask base 890. As the dial 894 is rotated within the thread
15 902, the dial 894 moves inward or outward with respect to the thread 902 and mask base 890.
   When the dial 894 moves inward, proximal end portions 904 of the arms 896 interface with
   the tapered internal channel 900, which causes the arms 896 to move towards each other. As
   the arms 896 move towards each other, the arms' distal end portions 906 compress the outer
   surface of the mask seal 888. Similarly, rotating the dial 894 in the opposite direction causes
20 the dial 894 to move outward with respect to the mask base 890. As the dial 894 move
   outward, proximal end portions 904 of the arms 896 move away from each other, thereby
   reducing the compression of the outer surface of the mask seal 888. By rotating the dial 894,
   the user may control the amount of compressive force provided by the seal adjustment
   mechanism 884 in order to achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
25         [0098]     Figures 11A-I1G illustrate another configuration of an interface 910
   configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 910
   comprises a mask assembly 912, a seal adjustment mechanism 914, a connection port
   assembly (not shown), and headgear (not shown). The mask assembly 912 comprises a mask
   seal 918 and a mask base 920. The mask seal 918 is removably attached to the mask base
                                                -16-

   920. The connection port assembly (not shown) attaches to the mask assembly 912 at an
   opening 922 in the mask base 920.
            [0099]    The seal adjustment mechanism 914 comprises a horizontal scissors
   assembly formed from first and second scissor arms 924. The first and second scissor arms
 5 924 connect to each other at a pivot 926 and extend from the rear toward the front of the
   mask assembly 912.     The diameter of the pivot 926 is aligned with a vertical axis V that
   bisects the mask assembly 912. As first ends 928 of the scissor arms 924 are pinched and
   moved towards each other, second ends 930 of the scissor arms 924 are advanced towards
   each other, as well. The second ends 930 comprise enlarged regions configured to engage
10 and compress the mask seal 918 towards the vertical axis V. By pinching the first ends 928
   of the scissor arms 924, the user may control the amount of compressive force provided by
   the seal adjustment mechanism 914 in order to achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate
   air leakage.
            [0100]    Figures 12A-12G illustrate another configuration of an interface 940
15 configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 940
   comprises a mask assembly 942, a seal adjustment mechanism 944, a connection port
   assembly (not shown), and headgear 946 (partially shown).          The mask assembly 942
   comprises a mask seal 948 and a mask base 950. The mask seal 948 is removably attached to
   the mask base 950.
20          [0101]    The seal adjustment mechanism 944 comprises a vertical scissor assembly
   formed from first and second scissor arms 952.       The first and second scissor arms 952
   connect to each other at a pivot 954 and extend from a position above the top of the mask
   assembly 942 toward the bottom of the mask assembly 942. The pivot 954 includes a geared
   interface in the configurations of Figures 12C-12E such that the rotation of one scissor arm
25 952 about the pivot 954 rotates the other scissor arm 952 about the pivot 954, as well. In the
   configuration of Figures 12F-12H, the pivot 954 does not include a geared interface such that
   the scissor arms 952 are independently movable with respect to the pivot 954.
            [0102]    Straps of the headgear assembly 946 attach to slots formed in at the upper
   ends of the scissor arms 952. As the straps are drawn into tension, the upper ends of the
30 scissor arms 952 are pulled away from each other. Rotation of the upper ends of the scissor
                                                -17-

   arms 952 away from each other causes the lower ends of the scissor arms 952 to rotate
   towards each other. As the lower ends of the scissor arms 952 rotate towards each other, they
   pinch and compress the mask seal (as shown in Figure 12B). The lower ends of the scissor
   arms 952 are adhered to the outside surface of the mask seal 948. In other configurations, the
 5 mask base 950 extends in the upward direction, and the pivot 954 is attached to the mask
   base 950. By tightening the straps of the headgear assembly 946, the user may control the
   amount of compressive force provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 944 in order to
   achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
           [0103]      Figures 13A-13E illustrate another configuration of an interface 960
10 configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 960
   comprises a mask assembly 962, a seal adjustment mechanism 964, a connection port
   assembly (not shown), and headgear 966 (partially shown).            The mask assembly 962
   comprises a mask seal 968 and a mask base 970. The mask seal 968 is removably attached to
   the mask base 970. The connection port assembly (not shown) attaches to the mask assembly
15 962 at an opening 972 in the mask base 970.
           [0104]      The seal adjustment mechanism 964 comprises one or more lugs 974
   attached to or integrally formed with the mask seal 968. Straps of the headgear assembly 966
   pass through openings in the lugs 974 and attach to the mask base 970 at attachment points
   976. In some configurations, the attachment points 976 are also lugs, as illustrated in Figures
20  13A- 13E. In other configurations, the attachment points 976 comprise clips, snaps, hook and
   loop fabric, etc.
           [0105]      As the headgear 966 straps are tensioned around the user's head, the lugs
   974 are compressed into the mask seal 968, as shown in Figures 13C and 13E. The mask seal
   968 rotates about its connection to the mask base 970 and compresses against the user's skin,
25 typically along the side of the user's nose, in the direction of the side of the nasal bone. In
   this manner, tensioning the straps in a first direction (posteriorly, towards the rear of the
   user's head) results in a transverse compressive force (laterally, inwardly, towards the center
   of the user's nose). By tightening the straps of the headgear assembly 966, the user may
   control the amount of compressive force provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 964 in
30 order to achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
                                                 -18-

           [0106]     Figures 14A-14E illustrate another configuration of an interface 980
   configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 980
   comprises a mask assembly 982, a seal adjustment mechanism 984, a connection port
   assembly (not shown), and headgear assembly (not shown).           The mask assembly 982
 5 comprises a mask seal 988 and a mask base 990. The mask seal 988 is removably attached to
   the mask base 990. The connection port assembly (not shown) attaches to the mask assembly
   982 at an opening 992 in the mask base 990.
           [0107]     The seal adjustment mechanism 984 comprises a ratchet mechanism and
   button assembly configured to apply pressure on opposite sides of the mask seal 988. The
10 seal adjustment mechanism 984 comprises a button 994 that slides within a channel of the
   mask assembly 982. As the user presses against the outside surface of the button 994, the
   inside surface of the button 994 presses into the side of the mask seal 988, thereby
   compressing the seal 988 laterally, for example, against the user's nasal bone.     A ratchet
   mechanism 996 (as shown in Figure 14D) secures the button 994 in position, as the button's
15 teeth 998 engage an end of a lever arm 1000. The lever arm 1000 attaches to the mask base
   990 at a pivot 1002, and rotates about the pivot 1002 to release the button's teeth 998 when
   pressed. A spring 1004 positioned within the button 994 biases the button 994 in an outward
   direction. The outward bias provided by the spring 1004 allows the button 994 to pop out
   and release compressive forces applied to the mask seal 988 when the lever arm 1000 is
20 pressed.
           [0108]     Another configuration of a ratchet mechanism 1006 is illustrated in Figure
    14E. The ratchet mechanism 1006 also includes a button 1008 and a linkage assembly 1010.
   Pressing the button 1008 compresses the mask seal 988 laterally, for example, against the
   user's nasal bone. Teeth in the button 1008 engage the distal end of the linkage assembly
25  1010 and hold the button 1008 in position.       Pressing the proximal end of the linkage
   assembly 1010 releases the teeth of the button 1008 from the linkage assembly's distal end.
   When released the button 1008 moves back to its resting position, which releases the pressure
   applied by the button 1008 against the mask seal 988. In some configurations, the ratchet
   mechanism 1006 does not include a spring. Instead, the natural tendency of the mask seal
30 988 to revert to its noncompressed state enables the button 1008 to move outwardly to its
                                               -19-

   open position when the proximal end of the linkage assembly 1010 is pressed. By pressing
   on the buttons, the user controls the amount of compressive force provided by the seal
   adjustment mechanism 984 in order to achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate air
   leakage.
 5          [0109]     Figures 15A-15E illustrate another configuration of an interface 1020
   configured to provide a lateral compressive force to reduce air leakage. The interface 1020
   comprises a mask assembly 1022, a seal adjustment mechanism 1024, a connection port
   assembly (not shown), and a headgear assembly (not shown).             The mask assembly 1022
   comprises a mask seal 1028 and a mask base 1030.             The mask seal 1028 is removably
10 attached to the mask base 1030.
            [0110]     The seal adjustment mechanism 1024 comprises a dial 1032, linkage 1034,
   and paddles 1036. The dial 1032 is secured to mask base 1030 via a pivot 1035. Proximal
   ends of the linkage are attached to the dial 1032 at openings within the dial 1032.       The
   openings 1032 are larger than the diameters of the linkage proximal ends, such that linkage
15 freely rotates within the openings as the dial is rotated about the pivot 1035.
            [0111]     The distal ends of the linkage 1034 fit within receptacles located at the
   proximal ends of the paddles 1036. The paddles 1036 are secured to the mask base 1030 at
   pivots 1038.    The distal ends of the paddles 1036 are comprise enlarged contact portions
   configured to compress the mask seal 1028.
20          [0112]     As the dial 1032 is rotated, the linkage length changes from a short
   configuration (as shown in Figures 15C and 15D) to a long configuration (as shown in
   Figures 15B and 15 E). In the short configuration, the linkage arms pull the proximal ends of
   the paddles 1036 towards each other and the dial 1032. As the proximal ends of the paddles
    1036 are pulled towards each other and the dial 1032, the paddles 1036 rotate about
25 respective pivots 1038, such as pins 1038, and the distal ends of the paddles 1036 move apart
   and away from each other. Pressure applied to the mask seal 1038 is released as the paddles
    1036 move apart.
            [0113]     To compress the mask seal 1038, the dial 1032 is rotated to bring the
   linkage length into the long configuration. In the long configuration, the linkage arms push
30 the proximal ends of the paddles 1036 outward and away from each other. The paddles 1036
                                                  -20-

   rotate about their respective pivots 1038 to bring their distal ends closer towards each other.
   The paddle 1036 distal ends compress the mask seal 1038 in a lateral direction, for example,
   inward, toward the user's nasal bone. By rotating the dial 1032, the user controls the amount
   of compressive force provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 1024 in order to achieve
 5 maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
           [0114]      Figures 16A-16C illustrate one embodiment of a mask assembly 1600
   configured to provide a lateral compressive force against a user's nose in order to reduce air
   leakage.    The mask assembly 1600 includes a housing (sometimes referred to herein as a
   mask base) 1602 and a seal 1604. The mask seal 1604 is removably attached to the mask
10 base 1602. The mask assembly 1600 also includes a seal adjustment mechanism 1606. The
   mask assembly 1600 is compatible with any of the interfaces described herein, and may be
   provided with a connection port assembly (not shown) and/or a headgear assembly (not
   shown).
           [0115]      The seal adjustment mechanism 1606 comprises a slider 1608, which in
15 the illustrated embodiment, is formed as an end portion 1610 of the mask seal 1604. The
   slider 1608 may be integrally formed with the mask seal 1604, or may be attached to the
   mask seal 1604.     The slider 1608 and/or end portion 1610 may be made from a harder
   material than the mask seal 1604.      For example, in one embodiment, the slider 1608 is
   formed from a harder grade of silicone than the remaining portion of the mask seal 1604.
20         [0116]      The slider 1608 extends through a channel 1612 in the mask base 1602.
   Moving the slider 1608 within the channel 1612 adjusts the seal geometry around the user's
   side nose bridge. For example, in one embodiment, the inclination angle 1614 between the
   seal side nose bridge portion 1616 and the end plane 1618 of the seal 1604 increases or
   decreases depending upon the distance and direction that the slider 1608 is moved. In one
25 embodiment, adjusting the slider 1608 from a first position, as shown in Figure 16A to a
   second position, as shown in Figure 16B, causes the inclination angle 1614 to adjust from
   about 350 (as shown in Figure 16A) to about 500 (as shown in Figure 16B).              In other
   embodiments, the inclination angle 1614 is adjustable between about 200 and about 700,
   between about 270 and about 600, or between about 400 and about 450.          As the inclination
30 angle 1614 is increased, the seal side nose bridge portion 1616 applies less pressure against
                                                -21-

   the side of the user's nose. As the inclination angle 1614 in decreased, the seal side nose
   bridge portion 1616 applies greater pressure against the side of the user's nose. By adjusting
   the slider 1608, the user controls the amount of compressive force provided by the seal
   adjustment mechanism 1606 in order to achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate air
 5 leakage.
            [0117]     The slider 1608 can include a control 1620 to facilitate manipulation by a
   user. The slider 1608 can also include a tang 1622 to help maintain the slider 1608 in the
   desired position with respect to the base 1602 once adjusted.          The tang 1622 can be
   configured to contact an inside surface of the base 1602.       In one embodiment, frictional
10 forces between the tang 1622 and the base 1602 maintain the slider 1608 in the desired
   position.    In other embodiments, the tang 1622 includes a ratcheting mechanism that
   interfaces with a corresponding structure on the mask base 1602.
            [0118]     Figures 17A-17E illustrate one embodiment of another mask assembly
    1700 configured to provide a lateral compressive force against a user's nose in order to
15 reduce air leakage. The mask assembly 1700 includes a mask base 1702 and a mask seal
    1704. The mask seal 1704 is removably attached to the mask base 1702. The mask assembly
    1700 also includes a seal adjustment mechanism 1706.            The mask assembly 1700 is
   compatible with any of the interfaces described herein, and may be provided with a
   connection port assembly (not shown) and/or a headgear assembly (not shown).
20          [0119]     The seal adjustment mechanism 1706 comprises a dial 1708, which in the
   illustrated embodiment, is positioned within an opening 1710 of the mask base 1702. The
   dial 1708 is configured to rotate within the opening 1710. The dial 1708 includes one or
   more channels 1712, through which an end portion 1714 of the seal 1704 extends. In the
   illustrated embodiment, the dial 1708 includes two channels 1712. An end portion 1714
25 extends through each of the channels 1712. In some embodiments, the end portions 1714 are
   integrally formed with the seal 1704.       In other embodiments, the end portions 1714 are
   attached to the seal 1704.      For example, in some embodiments, the end portions 1714
   comprise one or more cables, wires, or other flexible member.
            [0120]     As the dial 1708 is rotated within the opening 1710, the end portions 1714
30 wind (or unwind, depending upon the direction of rotation) around the dial's outside surface
                                                  -22-

    1716. As the end portions 1714 wind around the dial's outside surface 1716, the seal 1704 is
   pulled upward, in tension, towards the dial 1708, which causes an inclination angle 1718 to
   increase.   As the end portions 1714 are unwound from the dial's outside surface 1716, the
   seal 1704 is relaxed, which causes the inclination angle 1718 to decrease.
 5          [0121]    In one embodiment, rotating the dial 1708 from a first position, as shown
   in Figure 17C to a second position, as shown in Figure 17D, causes the inclination angle
    1714 to adjust from about 350 to about 500.       In other embodiments, the inclination angle
    1714 is adjustable between about 200 and about 70', between about 270 and about 60', or
   between about 400 and about 450.      As the inclination angle 1714 is increased, the seal side
10 nose bridge portion 1720 applies less pressure against the side of the user's nose. As the
   inclination angle 1714 in decreased, the seal side nose bridge portion 1720 applies greater
   pressure against the side of the user's nose. By adjusting the dial 1708, the user controls the
   amount of compressive force provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 1706 in order to
   achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
15          [0122]    Figures 18A- 18D illustrate another embodiment of a mask assembly 1800
   configured to provide a lateral compressive force against a user's nose in order to reduce air
   leakage. The mask assembly 1800 includes a mask base 1802 and a seal 1804. The mask
   seal 1804 is removably attached to the mask base 1802.          The mask assembly 1800 also
   includes a seal adjustment mechanism 1806. The mask assembly 1800 is compatible with
20 any of the interfaces described herein, and may be provided with a connection port assembly
   (not shown) and/or a headgear assembly (not shown).
            [0123]    The seal adjustment mechanism 1806 comprises a tab 1808, which in the
   illustrated embodiment, is formed as an end portion 1810 of the seal 1804. The tab 1808 may
   be integrally formed with the mask seal 1804, or may be attached to the mask seal 1804. The
25 tab 1808 extends through an opening 1812 in the mask base 1802. The tab 1808 may include
   ratcheting features or teeth that engage the edge of the mask base opening 1812. The teeth of
   the tab 1808 hold the end portion 1810 at the desired position.
            [0124]    Pulling or pushing the tab 1808 with respect to the base 1802 adjusts the
   seal geometry around the user's side nose bridge. For example, the inclination angle 1814
30 between the seal side nose bridge portion 1816 and the seal end plane 1818 increases or
                                                 -23-

   decreases depending upon the direction that the tab 1808 is moved. For example, pulling the
   tab 1808 from a first position (as shown in Figure 18A) to a second position (as shown in
   Figure 18B) adjusts the inclination angle 1814 from about 400 to about 56'.            In other
   embodiments, the inclination angle 1814 is adjustable between about 250 and about 70',
 5 between about 350 and about 60', or between about 400 and about 500.         As the inclination
   angle 1814 is increased, the seal side nose bridge portion 1816 applies less pressure against
   the side of the user's nose. As the inclination angle 1814 in decreased, the seal side nose
   bridge portion 1816 applies greater pressure against the side of the user's nose. By adjusting
   the tab 1808, the user controls the amount of compressive force provided by the seal
10 adjustment mechanism 1806 in order to achieve maximum comfort and to eliminate air
   leakage.
            [0125]     In some embodiments, a gasket 1820 is provided within the mask base
   opening 1812. The gasket 1820 can provide a seal between the tab 1808 and the mask base
    1802. In one embodiment, the gasket 1820 is formed of a flexible silicone material. The
15 gasket 1820 is configured to flex from a first position when the tab 1808 is not pulled (as
   shown in Figure 18C) to a second position when the tab 1808 is pulled (as shown in Figure
    18D).
            [0126]     In some embodiments, the mask assembly 1800 comprises a seal 1804 that
   includes at least one additional seal wall 1900. The additional seal wall 1900 is formed on an
20 inside portion of the seal 1804. In some embodiments, the additional seal wall 1900 extends
   from the seal 1804 at the location where the tab 1808 is formed. However, the additional seal
   wall 1900 may be provided with any of the mask seals described herein.                In some
   embodiments, the seal wall 1900 extends from the seal 1804 near or at the points where the
   seal 1804 intersects the seal end plane 1818, such as shown in Figures 19A and 19B. In other
25 embodiments, the seal wall 1900 extends from the seal 1800 near the points where the seal
    1804 is coupled to the mask base 1802, as shown in Figures 19C and 19D.
            [0127]     Pulling or pushing the tab 1808 with respect to the base 1802 adjusts the
   seal geometry around the user's side nose bridge. For example, the inclination angle 1902
   between the seal wall 1900 and the seal end plane 1818 increases or decreases depending
30 upon the direction that the tab 1808 is moved. For example, pulling the tab 1808 from a first
                                                 -24-

   position (as shown in Figures 19A and 19C) to a second position (as shown in Figures 19B
   and 19D) adjusts the inclination angle 1902 from about 400 to about 560.                In other
   embodiments, the inclination angle 1902 is adjustable between about 250 and about 700,
   between about 350 and about 600, or between about 400 and about 500.         As the inclination
 5 angle 1902 is increased, the seal wall 1900 applies less pressure against the side of the user's
   nose. As the inclination angle 1902 in decreased, the seal wall 1900 applies greater pressure
   against the side of the user's nose. By adjusting the tab 1808, the user controls the amount of
   compressive force provided by the seal adjustment mechanism 1806 in order to achieve
   maximum comfort and to eliminate air leakage.
10         [0128]      Figures 20A and 20B illustrate illustrate one embodiment of a mask
   assembly 2000 configured to provide a lateral compressive force against a user's nose in
   order to reduce air leakage. The mask assembly 2000 includes a mask base 2002 and a seal
   2004. The mask seal 2004 is removably attached to the mask base 2002. The mask assembly
   2000 also includes a seal adjustment mechanism 2006.             The mask assembly 2000 is
15 compatible with any of the interfaces described herein, and may be provided with a
   connection port assembly (not shown) and/or a headgear assembly (not shown).
           [0129]      The seal adjustment mechanism 2006 is provided as a thinner section of
   the seal 2004 wall. In the illustrated embodiment, the thinner wall section is formed between
   two notches 2008 in the wall of the seal 2004. The apexes of the notches 2008 are aligned
20 with each other on opposite sides of the seal 2004.          In some embodiments, the seal
   adjustment mechanism 2006 includes 1, 3, 5 or less than 10 notches 2008. The notches 2008
   may be provided on the outside and/or inside surface of the seal 2004. In some embodiments,
   the inside and outside notches are aligned with each other (as shown in Figures 20A and
   20B), and in other embodiments, they are not.
25         [0130]      The outside notch 2008 is configured to open from about 450, as shown in
   Figure 20A, to about 900, as shown in Figure 20B. The seal 2004 bends at the adjustment
   mechanism 2006 as the mask assembly 2000 is applied to a user's face. When applied, the
   user's nose presses against the seal side nose bridge portion 2010, which causes the seal side
   nose bridge portion 2010 to bend with respect to the seal 2004 at the adjustment mechanism
30 2006.
                                                 -25-

            [0131]     As the seal side nose bridge portion 2010 bends, the inclination angle 2012
   between the seal side nose bridge portion 2010 and the seal end plane 2014 changes. By
   adjusting the position of the mask assembly 2000 on the user's face, the user controls the
   amount of compressive force provided by the seal 2004 in order to achieve maximum
 5 comfort and eliminate air leakage.
            [0132]     Figure 21 illustrates one configuration of a mask assembly 102 compatible
   with any of the interface configurations described herein. The mask assembly 102 generally
   comprises a mask seal 110, which can include a mask seal clip 112, and a mask base 114. As
   will be described, the mask seal clip 112 preferably connects the mask seal 110 to the mask
10 base 114. While the illustrated mask seal 110 and mask seal clip 112 are formed separately
   and secured together, in some configurations, the mask seal 110 and the mask seal clip 112
   can be integrated into a single component.       In some configurations, the mask seal 110 is
   overmolded onto the mask seal clip 112. Indeed, in any of the mask assembly configurations
   described above and below, the mask seal may be removably attached to the mask base, or
15 may be integrally formed with (e.g., co-molded, permanently bonded, etc.) the mask base.
            [0133]     With reference to Figure 22, the mask seal clip 112 is relatively more
   rigid, stiffer or more inflexible than the mask seal 110. In some configurations, the mask seal
   clip 112 is formed of a polycarbonate material. In some configurations, at least a portion of
   the mask seal clip 112 is formed of a polycarbonate or other rigid or semi-rigid material. In
20 some configurations, the mask seal clip 112 is formed at least partially of silicone or another
   suitable material. In such configurations, at least the silicone portion of the mask seal clip
    112 may be formed to be relatively thicker compared to the more flexible portions of the
   mask seal 110. The mask seal clip 112 provides structural support to the mask seal 110 in the
   illustrated configuration.
25          [0134]     With reference to Figures 23 and 24, the illustrated mask seal clip 112
   comprises a substantially cup-shaped configuration. A proximal end 120 defines an open end
   of the illustrated mask seal clip 112 while a distal end 122 defines a generally closed end of
   the illustrated mask seal clip 112. In the illustrated configuration, the proximal end 120 is
   generally circumscribed by a lip 124. The lip 124 is generally pentagonal when viewed from
30 the back. As shown in Figure 25, a wall 126 generally sweeps forward in an arcuate manner.
                                                  -26-

   The arcuate shape to the wall 126 provides a three dimensional configuration to the
   illustrated mask seal clip 112.
            [0135]     With continued reference to Figure 25, an upper portion 130 of the
   illustrated mask seal clip 112 is generally arcuate in configuration. In addition, the generally
 5 arcuate configuration of the illustrated mask seal clip 112 is configured to accommodate
   larger noses while not extending upward over the nose to as great an extent as the mask seal
    110, as shown in Figures 1 and 2.
            [0136]     Referring again to Figure 22, the upper portion 130 of the illustrated mask
   seal clip 112 preferably comprises two arcuate dimensions. First, an arc length 132 can be
10 defined along an upper extremity of the upper portion 130 of the illustrated mask seal clip
    112.   The arc length 132 can be defined between inflection points 134 found along a
   perimeter of the illustrated mask seal clip 112.
            [0137]     As shown in Figure 25, the upper portion 130 of the illustrated mask seal
   clip 112 also comprises a side profile radius 136. As shown, the upper portion 130 can have
15 a slightly increasing side profile radius 136 such that the radius increases slightly as a
   distance from the upper end increases.      In some configurations, the upper portion 130 can
   comprise a substantially constant side profile radius 136 or a decreasing side profile radius.
   Advantageously, the slightly increasing side profile radius 136 provides an increased volume
   in the mask 100 proximate the user's nose.
20          [0138]     With reference to Figure 22 and Figure 24, the mask seal clip 112
   preferably comprises at least two recesses 140. In the illustrated configuration, the mask seal
   clip 112 comprises two recesses 140 that are disposed on two lateral sides of a generally
   vertical center plane CP (see Figure 24). The generally vertical center plane CP preferably
   corresponds to a mid-sagittal plane of the user and splits the illustrated mask seal clip 112
25 into substantially mirror image halves. The two recesses 140 define two generally enclosed
   pockets in the illustrated mask seal clip 112. The illustrated recesses 140 comprise further
   recesses 142 that are used to provide adequate clearance for reasons that will be discussed
   below while limiting an amount of encroachment into a nasal region of a chamber defined by
   the mask assembly 102.
                                                  -27-

            [0139]      The illustrated mask seal also comprises a generally central passage 144
   that is defined by a wall 146. In the illustrated configuration, the wall 146 generally encloses
   the passage 144.      Preferably, the wall 146 is generally cylindrical in configuration and
   extends through the wall 126. Other configurations are possible.
 5          [0140]      With reference now to Figures 1 and 2, the mask assembly 102 includes
   the mask base 114, which is more rigid than the mask seal 110. The mask base 114 can be
   formed of any suitable material. In some configurations, the mask base 114 is formed of a
   polycarbonate material such that it is capable of flexing for connection with the mask seal
    110 and/or the mask seal clip 112.
10          [0141]      With reference now to Figure 21, the mask assembly 102 is shown with
   the mask base 114 secured to the mask seal 110.            More particularly, in the illustrated
   configuration, the mask base 114 is secured to the mask seal clip 112 that is attached to the
   mask seal 110 in any suitable manner. In some configurations, the mask base 114 and the
   mask seal 110 or mask seal clip 112 are removably connected. In some configurations, the
15 mask base 114 snaps together with one or both of the mask seal 110 and the mask seal clip
    112. Preferably, the mask seal 110 and the mask seal clip 112 can be removed from the mask
   base 114 and a snap connection secures the mask seal clip 112 to the mask base 114.
            [0142]      The illustrated mask base 114 overlies at least a portion of the mask seal
   clip 112. In some configurations, the mask base 114 almost entirely covers the mask seal clip
20  112. In some configurations, the mask base 114 extends over more than half of the mask seal
   clip 112. When the mask base 114 overlies a substantial portion of the mask seal clip 112 or
   the mask seal 110, a double layer effect is created (e.g., the mask seal clip 112 and the mask
   base 114). The double layer effect provides increased insulation when a significant portion
   of the mask base 114 overlaps a significant portion of the mask seal clip 112 or the mask seal
25  110. The increased insulation provides a warmer inner portion (e.g., mask seal 110 and/or
   mask seal clip 112), which results in less rain out of humidity during use. Preferably, at least
   a portion of the mask seal clip 112 is exposed from under the mask base 114 such that the
   mask base 114 can be more easily separated from the mask seal clip 112.           To aid in the
   separation of the mask base 114 from the underlying mask seal 110 and/or mask seal clip
30  112, the illustrated mask base 114 comprises a peripheral surface 200 on the proximal end.
                                                  -28-

   The mask base 114 is concave on the inside to accommodate the underlying components. In
   other words, the mask base 114 is bowl shaped in a distal direction relative to the proximal
   peripheral surface 200.
            [0143]     The peripheral surface 200 comprises one or more recessed portions 202.
 5 Preferably, the recessed portions 202 comprise at least two recessed portions 202 that are
   positioned on opposite sides of the mask base 114 from each other. The recessed portions
   202 are configured to receive a thumb and a finger such that the mask base 114 can be more
   easily removed from the front of the underlying mask seal clip 112.         While the recessed
   portions 202 can define means for grasping the assembly underlying the mask base 114 for
10 removal of the mask base, other configurations can be used, such as outwardly extending
   tabs, protruding portions and the like, for example but without limitation. In addition, while
   the illustrated recessed portions 202 are disposed on opposing lateral sides of the mask base
    114, the recessed portions 202 can be positioned on the top and bottom or on other regions as
   desired.
15          [0144]     As shown in Figure 21, the mask base 114 preferably comprises an
   opening 210 that is defined by a wall 212. The wall 212 that defines the opening 210 through
   the mask base 114 preferably fits within the wall 146 that defines the passage 144 through the
   mask seal clip 112. The wall 212 can be axially coextensive with the wall 146. In addition,
   the dimensions and shapes of the walls 146, 212 can be such that the walls interact with each
20 other to reduce relative slippage between the walls 146, 212 and to reduce the likelihood of
   the mask seal base 114 inadvertently separating from the mask seal clip 112.           In some
   configurations, the walls 146, 212 fit together and reduce the likelihood of leakage through
   the interface between the walls. Preferably, a taper lock secures the walls 146, 212 together.
            [0145]     The wall 212 comprises a contoured inner surface 214. The contoured
25 surface 214 can be radiused to receive a ball end 220 of a swiveling elbow 222, such as that
   shown in Figure 26. As better shown in Figure 27, the ball end 220 has a contoured surface
   224 that can be snap fit into the contoured surface 214 formed in the mask base 114. The
   connection between the two contoured surfaces 214, 224 allows the surfaces to slide
   relatively freely with each other such that the position of the swiveling elbow 222 can be
                                                 -29-

   easily changed. In some configurations, the elbow 222 could be configured for rotation or
   swiveling without having a ball-joint configuration.
            [0146]     With reference again to Figure 21, the mask base 114 also comprises at
   least two pockets 230.     The illustrated mask base 114 comprises two pockets 230.        The
 5 pockets 230 recede into the mask base 114 and protrude rearward from the mask base 114.
   The pockets 230 are received within the recesses 140 of the mask seal clip 112. Overlying
   the further recesses 142 formed in the mask seal clip 112 are openings 232 that are defined by
   a surrounding wall 234.
            [0147]     The illustrated pockets 230 are formed such that one pocket 230 is formed
10 on each lateral side of the mask base 114.         The pockets 230 can be positioned to be
   symmetrical relative to the central plane CP, which plane substantially bisects the mask base
    114.   In some configurations, the pockets 230 have an enlarged vertical dimension 240
   relative to a transverse dimension 242. Similarly, the openings 232 have an enlarged vertical
   dimension 244 relative to a transverse dimension 246.
15          [0148]     In the illustrated mask base 114, the laterally inward portion of each
   pocket 230 comprises a support wall 250. The support wall 250 is positioned toward the
   center plane CP relative to normal to a base surface 248 of the pocket 230. Each of the
   pockets 230 is configured to receive a clip 252 (see Figure 28). Once the clip 252 is installed
   within the pocket 230, the support wall 250 helps to limit rotation of the clip 252 relative to
20 the pocket 230. Moreover, the large vertical dimension helps users to locate the pocket 230
   with the clip 252 during installation.
            [0149]     With reference to Figure 28, the clip 252 can have a two part construction:
   an outer cover 254 and an inner catch 256. Straps 260 can be secured to each clip 252 in any
   suitable manner.       One suitable configuration is illustrated in Figure 2.        In some
25 configurations, the straps 260 can be sandwiched between the outer cover 254 and the inner
   catch 256. In some configurations, loops or openings or holes could be provided on the clips
   252 through which the straps 260 are threaded. Preferably, one clip 252 can be connected to
   both an upper strap and a lower strap of the headgear assembly 106. Such a configuration
   facilitates easy connection of the headgear assembly 106 to the full face mask assembly 102
30 and easy disconnection of the headgear assembly 106 from the full face mask assembly 102.
                                                 -30-

            [0150]     As shown in Figure 29, the clip 252 comprises a sloping surface 262. The
   sloping surface 262 can be positioned on the outer cover 254.         The sloping surface 262
   cooperates with the support wall 250 to help orient the clip 252 relative to the pocket 203 of
   the mask base 114.
 5          [0151]     The clip 252 includes an interlock feature 264. The interlock feature 264
   is configured for insertion into the opening 232 defined in the pocket 230 of the mask base
    114. The interlock feature 264 can engage in a snap-fit manner with a tab 236 defined along
   the wall 234 that defines the opening 232 in the mask base 114, as shown in Figure 21. Other
   manners of interlocking the clip 252 with the pocket 230 also can be used.
10          [0152]     Referring to Figure 29, the interlock feature 264 of the illustrated clip 252
   comprises a U-shaped component 268 that terminates in a release lever 266. The U-shaped
   end 268 protrudes a sufficient distance to allow the connection with the tab 236 but does not
   protrude so far as to allow the bottom of the further recess 142 in the mask seal clip 112 to
   stop proper insertion of the interlock feature 264 into the opening 232. The U-shaped end
15 268 initially makes contact with a wall of the opening 232 during connection of the clip 252
   to the mask base 114. In the illustrated configuration, the U-shaped end 268 contacts the wall
   234 of the opening 232 during insertion and the wall 234 guides the clip 252 into position
   within the pocket 230. The opening 232, or one or more surfaces that define the opening
   232, generally align the clip 252 relative to the mask base 114 during connection of the clip
20 252 to the mask base 114.
            [0153]     The end of the release lever 266 protrudes through an opening 270 defined
   by a wall 272. Preferably, the end of the release lever 266 protrudes through the opening 270
   a sufficient distance to allow easy manipulation of the release lever 266. Moving the release
   lever 266 in manner that closes the U-shape of the interlock feature 264 allows the interlock
25 feature 264 to be removed from engagement with the tab 236 in the wall 234 that defines the
   opening 232 in the mask base 112.
            [0154]     Figures 30-37 illustrate additional configurations of clip assemblies 252
   that are configured to secure a mask assembly 102 to a user's head. The clip 252 of Figures
   30 and 31, for example has a raised edge 400 (sometimes referred to as a finger tab 400) that
30 enables the user to easily detach the headgear 106 from the mask assembly 102. The raised
                                                 -31-

   edges 400 are oriented such that the user may merely pull them rearwardly to pop the clips
   252 off of the mask base 114. Removing one or more clips 252 from the mask base 114
   allows the mask assembly 102 to be easily removed from the user's head. The raised edge
   400 provides a grasping point during attachment and removal of the headgear 106 with
 5 respect to the mask assembly 102. For example, the user's thumb and index finger may be
   placed on opposite sides of the raised edge 400 during removal of the clip 252 from the mask
   assembly 102. In addition, the user may grip the clip 252 and maintain the grip throughout
   the mask fitting process.    This eliminates the need to grasp blindly for straps 260 during
   assembly. It also allows the user to attach the clip 252, remove it, and re-attach it while
10 maintaining a grip on the raised edge 400.
           [0155]      Figure 32 shows an exploded view of the clip 252 of Figures 30 and 31.
   The clip 252 includes an outer cover 254 and an inner catch 256.          The inner catch 256
   includes one or more slots 402 to receive the distal end of the headgear straps 260. The inner
   catch 256 can also include several pressure bumps, such as those shown in connection with
15 the configuration of Figures 36 and 37. The pressure bumps provide additional pressure
   against the outer cover 254 and inner catch 256, so that they are secured to one another. In
   one configuration, the headgear straps 260 are removable from the assembled clip 252.
           [0156]      The inner catch 256 includes an elongated slot 404, as shown in Figure 36.
   The slot 404 includes a circular opening 406 having a diameter larger than the width of the
20 slot 404. The slot 404 and circular opening 406 can include chamfered recesses to help align
   the clip 252 to the mask assembly 102. The circular opening 406 facilitates attachment and
   removal of the clip 252 to the mask assembly 102, as will be discussed in greater detail
   below. Two channels 408 extend parallel to the sides of the slot 404, thereby defining slot
   walls 410 (sometimes referred to as clip levers) on either side of the slot 404. The channels
25 408 are sized to permit adequate flexing of the slot walls 410 during attachment and removal
   of the clip 252 from the mask assembly 102. In addition, the slot walls 410 extend along the
   longest dimension of the inner catch 256, towards top and bottom, which allows longer slot
   walls 410 to be employed. Longer slot walls 410 reduces the level of stress on the slot walls
   when fitting the clip over the mounting post.
                                                 -32-

            [0157]     One configuration of a mask base 114 suitable for use with the clip 252 of
   Figures 30-33 is illustrated in Figure 34.      The mask base 114 includes two recesses 140
   symmetrically positioned on opposite sides of the mask base 114. A mounting post 412
   extends from the body of the mask base 114 within each recess 140. The mounting post 412
 5 may be integrally formed with the mask base 114, or separately formed and secured to the
   mask base 114. The mounting post 412 can have a mushroom-shaped configuration to secure
   the clip 256 to the mask base 114 once the user snaps the clip 256 in place. The rounded top
   of the bulbous mushrooms-shaped post 412 helps locate and orient the central hole 406. As
   the clip 252 is pressed onto the post 412, the slot walls 410 deflect outwardly, away from the
10 post 412. Once the head of the post 412 clears the edge of the slot wall 410, the slot walls
   410 snap back to their original position, thereby providing tactile, and sometimes audible
   feedback, that the clip 252 is properly attached to the mask assembly 102.
            [0158]     The mounting post 412 can also comprise an elongated, elliptical, elevated
   portion 414 (sometimes referred to as a lug or wing) that is sized to mate with the elongated
15 slot 404 of the inner catch 256. The elongated, elevated portion 414 comprises a chamfered
   edge to help properly align the head gear 106 with respect to the mask assembly 102. The
   portion 414 also prevents the clip 252 from rotating with respect to the mask assembly 102.
   This helps assure constant tension on the headgear straps 260 while the user sleeps.
            [0159]     Figure 42 illustrates a partial assembly of yet another configuration to
20 secure a clip 252 to a mask base 114 of a mask assembly. The clip 252 sits within a recess
    140 of the mask base 114. A cylindrical, button-head post 412 extends from the surface of
   the mask base 114 within the recess 140. The post 412 allows slight rotation of the clip 252
   when attached thereto due to its cylindrical configuration. However, as shown in Figure 36
   and Figure 37, the slot 404, channels 408 and slot walls 410 extend along the shorter planar
25 direction of the inner catch 256, towards its front and back ends.
            [0160]     The inner catch 256 also includes several pressure bumps 414.           As
   discussed above, the pressure bumps provide additional pressure against the outer cover 254
   and inner catch 256, so that they are secured to one another.
            [0161]     Additional configurations of a clip 252 are illustrated in Figures 38-45.
30 The clip 252 of Figure 38 includes three elongated, elliptical slots 404 and a finger tab 400.
                                                  -33-

   The finger tab 400 is used to create a lever to release the clip 252 from a mask assembly 102.
   The central slot 404 is sized to receive a mounting post 412 that extends from the outside
   surface of the mask body. One such suitable mounting post 412 is illustrated in Figure 41.
   The mounting post 412 includes a ridge 414 and two slots 416. As the clip 252 is pressed
 5 onto the mounting post 412, the outer portions of the post 412 flex towards each other due to
   the spacing provided by the slots 416. Once the ridge 414 clears the upper surface of the clip
   252, the mounting post 412 snaps back to its original position, and the ridge 414 locks the
   clip 252 in place,
            [0162]     A similar configuration is shown in Figures 42-45. The clip 252 of Figure
10 43 does not include a finger tab and its central opening 404 has a rounder, more elliptical
   shape than the elongated slots of Figures 38-41.
            [0163]     All of the foregoing configurations simplify the procedure for securing the
   mask assembly 102 to the user's head. For example, the clips 252 allow the headgear 106 to
   open up so that it is not a closed loop. By opening up, the headgear 106 may be swung
15 around the head rather than forcing the user to pull his head through it.
            [0164]     With reference to Figure 2, in addition to the straps 260, the headgear
   assembly 106 also comprises a back strap 280 and a top strap 282.             Other head gear
   assemblies also can be used. The back strap 280 extends around the back of the head of the
   user U at a location generally above a nape of the neck but generally below the occipital
20 protuberance. At a location rearward of the ear of the user, the back strap 280 forks into an
   upper arm 284 and a lower arm 286. The upper arm 284 arcs upward to a location above the
   ear of the user and then arcs downward to a location generally forward of the ear of the user.
   The lower arm 286 arcs downward to a location generally below the ear of the user and
   extends slightly forward of the ear.
25          [0165]     The straps 260 can be connected to the back strap 280 in any suitable
   manner. In the illustrated configuration, the straps 260 connect to the upper arm 284 and the
   lower arm 286 respectively. Preferably, the upper arm 284 and the lower arm 286 are more
   rigid than the straps 260 such that the arms 284, 286 generally maintain shape as the headgear
   assembly 106 is being donned. In some configurations, each of the upper arm 284 and the
30 lower arm 286 supports its own weight. In some configurations, each of the upper arm 284
                                                  -34-

   and the lower arm 286 is structured to be tangle-free during donning. For example, the arms
   284, 286 have sufficient torsion stiffness to reduce the likelihood of twisting when being put
   on.
            [0166]     Preferably, the straps 260 connect to at least one of the upper arm 284 and
 5 the lower arm 286 at a location forward of the ear. Such a configuration helps the user to
   locate the straps 260 without much difficulty.      In addition, because the straps 260 in the
   illustrated configuration are embedded into the clips 252, the ends of the upper arms 284 and
   the lower arms 286 can comprise slots 290, 292 such that the straps 260 can be threaded
   through the slots 290, 292.        In addition, the straps 260 can comprise an adjustment
10 mechanism 294, such as a Velcro or buckle configuration. The adjustment mechanism 294
   allows a force between the mask seal 110 and the face of the user U to be adjusted. Any
   suitable adjustment mechanism 294 can be used.
            [0167]     As shown in Figure 2, the top strap 282 preferably is flexible and has an
   adjustable length. The top strap 282 connects to the upper arms 284 through a slot 296 and
15 reduces the likelihood of the upper arms 284 sliding down the head of the user and contacting
   the ears of the user. Preferably, the top strap 282 connects to the upper arms 284 at a location
   generally above the ears of the user.
            [0168]     Advantageously, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, the straps 260 exert a force
   in the direction of the arrow F while they connect to the mask base 114 by movement in the
20 direction C, which direction is generally normal to the direction of the force F.       In other
   words, the straps 360 are tensioned by pulling forward and the clips 252 are connected to the
   mask base 114 by movement in a direction normal to the forward pull. Such a configuration
   eases securement of the interface 100 on the face of the user.
            [0169]     In another configuration, the headgear assembly 106 includes a semi-rigid
25 headgear 380 (as shown in Figure 41) to secure the mask assembly 102 to the user's head.
   The semi-rigid headgear 380 is formed as a composite structure comprising a semi-rigid strap
   382 that is joined to a soft edging 384. For example, the soft edging 384 can be bonded to
   the semi-rigid strap 382 by plastic overmolding or by use of an adhesive. As shown in Figure
   46, the soft edging 384 can be butt-joined to the semi-rigid strap 382, without the soft edging
30 384 overlapping the semi-rigid strap 382, to maintain the continuous profile of the semi-rigid
                                                  -35-

   headgear 380. The semi-rigid strap 382 defines and maintains the semi-rigid headgear shape
   as tension is applied from the straps 260 to pull the mask assembly 102 towards the user's
   head. In other words, the semi-rigid strap 382 is sufficiently rigid along its planar axis to
   prevent its upper and lower arms 284, 286 from overly deforming under tension. The semi
 5 rigid strap 382 can be made from a variety of rigid or semi-rigid materials, including plastic
   or metal. In some configurations, the semi-rigid strap 382 is made from PVC.
            [0170]     Especially in connection with a semi-rigid headgear assembly, it has been
   found that the shape holding, or self-supporting nature, can result in an overall assembly that
   is intuitive to fit. In particular, where the connection and/or headgear members are self
10 supporting such that they maintain a three-dimensional form, the headgear can be fitted in the
   correct orientation with very little if any instruction. In a self-supporting arrangement, the
   tendency of the straps to not tangle also reduces the time taken to fit the overall assembly.
            [0171]     As used herein, the term "semi-rigid" is used to denote that the headgear
   assembly is sufficiently stiff such that the headgear assembly 380 can assume a three
15 dimensional shape with dimensions approximating the head of the patient for which the
   headgear is designed to fit while also being sufficiently flexible to generally conform to the
   anatomy of the patient. For example, some of the other components (e.g., arms or straps) of
   the headgear assembly 380 may also be partially or wholly "semi-rigid" such that the
   components are capable of holding a three-dimensional form that is substantially self
20 supporting. A "semi-rigid" headgear assembly is not intended to mean that each and every
   component of the headgear assembly is necessarily semi-rigid. For example, the substantially
   three-dimensional form that the self-supporting headgear assembly 380 may assume may
   relate primarily to the rear and top portions of the headgear assembly 380. In addition, the
   semi-rigid headgear assembly 380 may include semi-rigid regions that extend forward of the
25 ears and above the ears when placed on the head of the patient.
            [0172]     The left and right upper and lower arms 284, 286 may be formed of a
   semi-rigid material, as well. Where used herein, the semi-rigid materials may include molded
   plastic or sheet materials that include but are not limited to homogeneous plastic materials
   and bonded non-woven fiber materials.
                                                 -36-

            [0173]     In some configurations, one or more of arms or straps are formed of a
   substantially inelastic material.  The arms or straps can be formed of a semi-rigid, self
   supporting material such that the semi-rigid headgear assembly 380 can assume a
   substantially three-dimensional shape and generally does not tangle. In some configurations,
 5 the material can comprise a laminate structure of both conformable and semi-rigid portions,
   for example but without limitation. The semi-rigid strap 382 may be of a self-supporting,
   resilient, substantially inelastic material, such as Santoprene, polyolefin, polypropylene,
   polyethylene, foamed polyolefin, nylon or non-woven polymer material for example but
   without limitation.    In some configurations, the semi-rigid strap 382 is formed from the
10 polyethylene or polypropylene families. The material can be a low density polyethylene such
   as Dowlex 2517, which is a linear low density polyethylene that has a yield tensile strength of
   9.65 MPa, a break tensile strength of 8.96 MPa, and a flexural modulus - 2% secant of 234
   MPa. The semi-rigid strap 382 preferably is formed of a material such that the semi-rigid
   headgear 380 is substantially shape-sustaining under its own weight regardless of its
15 orientation.   In some configurations, the semi-rigid strap 382 does not stretch more than
   approximately 6 mm under a 30 N tensile load. In some configurations, the semi-rigid strap
   382 does not stretch more than approximately 3 mm under a 30 N tensile load.
            [0174]     In some configurations, the semi-rigid strap 382 is formed from non
   woven polyolefin (NWP), which is bonded (e.g., overmolded or laminated) with a polyolefin.
20 In such configurations, the overmolded polyolefin material provides the principle shape
   sustaining properties. In addition, the softer NWP material is adapted to contact the skin and
   provide a desired comfort level. Furthermore, the NWP material may assist in providing the
   desired load bearing properties, such as the desired tensile load bearing properties.
            [0175]     The semi-rigid headgear 380 is generally formed of a semi-rigid material.
25 Where used herein, the semi-rigid materials may include molded plastic or sheet materials
   that include but are not limited to homogeneous plastic materials and bonded non-woven
   fiber materials. The upper and lower arms 284, 286 also include such semi-rigid materials, as
   the arms 284, 286 are formed integrally with and are portions of the semi-rigid headgear 380.
   Preferably, the right and left lower arms 286 are formed as an integrated component that, in
30 use, will extend around the back of the head and above the neck of the patient.
                                                  -37-

            [0176]     A soft edging 384 covers or attaches to at least a portion of the periphery
   of the semi-rigid strap 382. In one configuration, the soft edging 384 does not cover the front
   or rear faces of the semi-rigid strap 382. For example, the thicknesses of the soft edging 384
   and semi-rigid strap 382 can be the same at the location where they are joined together.
 5          [0177]     The soft edging 384 provides a soft, comfortable interface between the
   periphery of the semi-rigid strap 382 and the user's skin. The soft edging 384 can be made
   from a variety of soft materials, including but not limited to a plastic, an elastomer, silicone
   or thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) plastic. The soft edging 384 can have a Shore hardness
   in the range of 10-80 Shore A.
10          [0178]     As used herein with respect to headgear and straps, "soft" is used to
   describe a hand of the material, which means the quality of the material assessed by the
   reaction obtained from the sense touch. In addition, as used herein with respect to headgear
   and straps, "conformable" is used to describe the ability of the material to conform to the
   anatomical features of the patient (e.g., around a facial feature).        In particular, a strap
15 including at least an element of "soft" and/or "conformable" material also may be "semi
   rigid" and/or axially inelastic.
            [0179]     The soft edging 384 can have a uniform thickness, or in some
   configurations, an uneven thickness.     For example, in some configurations the soft edging
   384 is the same thickness as the semi-rigid strap 382. In other configurations, the soft edging
20 384 is thinner than the semi-rigid strap 382, forms a bulbous end to the semi-rigid strap 382,
   or is simply thicker than the semi-rigid strap 382. A variety of cross-sectional views of the
   semi-rigid headgear 380 are shown in Figure 46. Each cross-sectional view (A-A' through F
   F') shows one possible configuration of semi-rigid strap 382 and soft edging 384 thicknesses,
   which may be combined as desired.          For example, any one particular soft edging 384
25 thickness and shape could apply to a portion or the entire semi-rigid strap 382, or may be
   combined with any other particular covering thickness and shape shown in Figure 46.
            [0180]     Many other thickness configurations may be provided, as well.              In
   addition, material thickness may be symmetrically or asymmetrically applied to the semi
   rigid strap 382. For example, cross-sectional views C-C' and F-F' are shown as asymmetric;
30 however, in other configurations the thickness of either end the soft edging 384 is
                                                 -38-

   symmetrically applied to the semi-rigid strap 382.In some configurations the semi-rigid strap
   382 is selectively thickened to provide extra rigidity and support. For example, the second of
   the two configurations illustrated as cross-sectional view F-F' has such a thickening. Finally,
   in some configurations, venting through-holes 396 are provided throughout the semi-rigid
 5 headgear 380 (such as on the semi-rigid strap 382, as shown in Figure 46, or on soft edging
   384) to provide ventilation and sweat management.
            [0181]     When laid flat, as shown in Figure 46, the semi-rigid headgear 380 defines
   three C-shaped, arcuate regions 386, 388, 390. Two ear-surrounding regions 386, 388 are
   defined by upper and lower arms 284, 286, and a rear region 390 is defined by lower arms
10 286 and the back strap portion 280. The semi-rigid headgear 380 is flexible enough to bend
   to adapt to the shape of the user's head, such that the ear-surrounding regions 386, 388 at
   least partially surround or encircle the user's ears, and the rear region 390 at least partially
   surrounds or encircles the back of the user's head, above the neck.
            [0182]     The curvature of each arm 280, 284, 286 can be selected to provide a
15 comfortable fit and to facilitate application and removal of the semi-rigid headgear 380 from
   the user's head. For example, in the illustrated configuration, the upper arms 284 have a
   concave curvature and the lower arms 286 have a convex curvature with respect to the
   opening in the upper ear surrounding arcuate regions 386, 388. The back strap portion 280
   and the lower arms 286 all have a concave curvature with respect to opening in the neck
20 surrounding arcuate region 390. These curvatures facilitate application and removal of the
   semi-rigid headgear 380 from the user's head by, for example, providing openings to the
   arcuate regions sized and oriented to easily fit over a user's neck and ears.
            [0183]     The configuration of Figure 46 utilizes integrated crown straps comprising
   first and second crown arms 392, 394 to secure the semi-rigid headgear 380 to the user's
25 head. Once the semi-rigid headgear 380 is positioned to partially surround the user's head,
   the first and second crown arms 392, 394 are brought into contact with one another to secure
   the semi-rigid headgear 380 in place. Any of a variety of mechanisms can be provided with
   the first and second crown arms 392, 394 to enable them to attach to one another.           For
   example, in some configurations, a hook-and-loop fabric (e.g., Velcro), or one or more snaps
30 or clips can be used to attach the first and second crown arms 392, 394 to one another.
                                                   -39-

            [0184]    The crown straps extend laterally over the top of the skull in line with the
   ears.  When the crown straps extend in this manner and the arcuate regions 386, 388 are
   positioned to partially encircle the user's ears, the back strap 280 of the semi-rigid headgear
   380 should locate on or below the inion. The user's inion is the most prominent projection of
 5 the occiptal bone at the posterioinferior portion of the skull. In other words, the inion is the
   highest point of the external occipital protruberance.    The semi-rigid headgear 380 can be
   positioned on the user's head according to any desired configuration.
            [0185]    For example, the back strap portion 280 is adapted to engage with the rear
   of head of the user. Preferably, the back strap portion 280 is adapted to engage with the head
10 at a location on or below the external occipital protuberance.      The back strap portion 280
   spans the distance around the back of the head and extends to each side of the head. In some
   configurations, the back strap portion 280 comprises a longitudinal center that is adapted to
   be located about 25 degrees below a horizontal plane that extends through the ear canal of the
   patient.
15          [0186]    On either side of the head, the semi-rigid headgear 380 extends upward
   and downward into left and right side regions that form arcuate regions 386, 388. The side
   regions are adapted to extend behind the ears of the patient. Preferably, the side regions also
   are adapted to extend behind the mastoid processes of the patient. Each of the left and right
   side regions of the semi-rigid headgear 380 extends into or comprises an arched portion 386,
20 388. The arched portions 386, 388 bend forward. The arched portions 386, 388 are adapted
   to extend around the respective ears of the patient. Preferably, each of the arched portions
   386, 388 terminates at a respective termination portion. The termination portions preferably
   are adapted to be located forward of the ears of the patient. In some configurations, the side
   regions and the arched portions 386, 388 of the semi-rigid headgear 380 do not include a soft
25 inner padding portion but may comprise a self-supporting, resilient material that is in direct
   contact with the head/hair of the patient.
            [0187]    The top portion of the semi-rigid headgear 380 connects the arched
   portions 386, 388 together. The top portion can be positioned forward of the ears in some
   configurations.   Preferably, the top portion is positioned generally vertical from the ears.
30 More preferably, a longitudinal center of the top portion is adapted to be spaced more than 13
                                                  -40-

   mm, preferably between 13-100 mm, rearward of a vertical plane that intersects the ear
   canals. In some configurations, the top portion comprises a first segment 392 and a second
   segment 394 with the first segment 392 and the second segment 394 combining to form the
   top portion. The first segment 394 extends upward from an apex of the left arched portion
 5 386 while the second segment 392 extends upward from an apex of the right arched portion
   388. Preferably, the top portion is formed of a self-supporting and semi-rigid material. In
   some configurations, the top portion does not include any backing, including a soft padded
   backing layer.
            [0188]    Each of the upper and lower arms 284, 286 comprises a slot 292, 290 near
10 each arm end. Each slot is configured to receive straps 260 from the mask assembly 102, as
   shown in Figure 2. In addition, the portion 398 of the semi-rigid headgear 380 covered by
   straps 260 is thinner than the corresponding arm 284, 286 in order to accommodate the
   thickness of the strap 260. For example, as shown in Figures 47 and 48, the semi-rigid
   headgear portion 398 is thinner than the arm 286. The portion 398 is dimensioned such that
15 when the strap 260 is inserted into the slot 290 and tensioned, its thickness will not extend
   beyond the arm 286. By maintaining the strap 260 and portion 398 thickness less than the
   arm 286 thickness, the strap 260 does not irritate the user when worn.
            [0189]    In addition, the upper arms 284 are configured to extend downward from a
   location above the user's ear such that the adjustable top straps 260 extend no closer than
20 about 10 mm to the user's eye when worn. The lower arm 286 is configured to be located off
   of the user's neck when the head is tilted up and down, and the termination point of the lower
   arm 286 is located generally below the user's ears so that the lower strap as attached to the
   lower arm 286 angles upwards from the termination point 290 to the mask assembly 120. In
   such a configuration, as illustrated in Figures 49 and 50, the lower straps and the upper straps
25 form a triangle, and the space between the lower straps and the upper straps on the mask is
   smaller than the space between the lower straps and the upper straps on the headgear, thereby
   stabilizing the mask assembly 120 against upward and downward movements.
            [0190]    With reference to Figure 26, the elbow 222 connects to a conduit 300
   through a disconnectable swivel assembly 302. As shown in the section view of Figure 52,
                                                  -41-

   the elbow 222 comprises a stem 304 that comprises an inner wall 306 at the base. The inner
   wall 306 comprises a recess 308.
            [0191]    A sleeve 310 comprises a flange 312 that is received within the recess 308.
   The sleeve 310 can be secured into position within the elbow 222 using any suitable
 5 technique. The sleeve 310 comprises a generally cylindrical outer wall 314. The flange 312
   comprises a section that extends outward to connect to a lever 316. Preferably, the flange
   312 and the lever 316 are integrally formed. With reference to Figure 53, the lever 316
   includes a lower inwardly extending catch 320 and is capable of pivoting about the section
   that connects the lever 316 to the flange 312. Thus, pressing inward on an upper portion 322
10 of the lever 316 results in the catch 320 moving away from the generally cylindrical outer
   wall 314 of the sleeve 310.
            [0192]    A swivel 330 comprises a generally cylindrical inner wall 332. The inner
   wall 332 slides over the outer wall 314 of the sleeve 310 such that a sliding fit results
   between the swivel 330 and the sleeve 310. An upper portion 334 comprises a shoulder 336.
15 The catch 320 of the lever 316 can secure the swivel 330 in axial position on the sleeve 310
   by engaging with the shoulder 336.        When the upper portion 322 of the lever 316 is
   depressed, the catch 320 moves away from the shoulder 336, which allows the swivel 330 to
   be removed from the sleeve 310.
            [01931      A flap 350 can be mounted between the stem 304 and the sleeve 310. In
20 the illustrated configuration, the flap 350 extends into a flow channel 352 from a base 354
   that is sandwiched between the stem 304 and the sleeve 310. The flap 350 can pivot upward
   (as shown in Figure 52, see arrow P) about an axis X (see Figure 53) away from the sleeve
   310 such that flow from a positive pressure generator can continue generally unobstructed to
   the user through the interface 100. The flap 350 pivots downward into contact with the
25 sleeve 310 to seal the flow channel 352 in the event that the positive pressure source stops
   providing a pressurized flow of air.     In some configurations, the flap 350 will not fully
   contact the sleeve 310. In some configurations, the flap 350 will not seal the channel 352
   when in the down position.
            [0194]    With reference to Figure 53, a port 360 is defined through the elbow 222 at
30 a location above the flap 350. The port 360 preferably is positioned along a portion of the
                                                 -42-

   elbow 222 that is in the vicinity of the axis X. In some configurations, the port 360 is
   positioned to be substantially shielded by the flap 350 from an inspiratory flow of air. In
   other words, as the air pivots the flap 350 away from the sleeve 310, the flap 350 is moved
   into a position that at least partially or completely covers the port 360.
 5         [0195]      In some configurations, the port 360 extends through a wall of the elbow
   222 that comprises a generally planar inner wall 362. The generally planar inner wall 362
   helps the flap 350 to generally seal the port 360 when the flap is moved upward away from
   the flange 312 of the sleeve 310.
           [0196]      In some configurations, the lever 316 overlies a majority of the port 360
10 such that the port 360 is generally obscured from view. As shown in Figure 52, however, a
   gap 364 preferably surrounds at least a portion of the lever 316 such that a relatively free flow
   of air can pass through the port 360 when the flap 350 does not overly the port 360. In
   addition, in some configurations, the port 360 and the lever 316 are positioned on a same side
   of the elbow 222 as an opening 370 defined within the ball end 220, which opening is
15 positioned within the mask assembly 102 when the connection port assembly 104 is
   assembled to the mask assembly 102. Advantageously, such a positioning places the port 360
   in a position on the elbow 222 that faces the user. Such a location further obscures the port
   360 from view during use, which results in a more aesthetically pleasing configuration.
   Moreover, because flow through the port 360 will be very infrequent, having the port 360
20 disposed toward the user will not cause any significant discomfort for the user.
           [0197]      While not shown, the elbow 222 also can comprise one or more bias flow
   vent holes.    The bias flow vent holes preferably are positioned in a forwardly directed
   orientation such that any bias flow does not directly impinge upon the user.
           [0198]      Another configuration of an elbow assembly 302 is illustrated in Figures
25 54-57. The elbow assembly 302 comprises an elbow 222, a sleeve, 310, and/or a swivel 330,
   as shown in Figure 55. In some configurations, the elbow assembly 302 only includes the
   elbow 222 and sleeve and omits the swivel 330.              The swivel may be permanently or
   removably attached to the sleeve 310 and elbow 222; in some configuration, the swivel 330 is
   integrally formed with the end of the delivery conduit. A flap 350 is positioned over the
30 sleeve 310 such that it at least partially obstructs the sleeve's flow channel 352. The elbow
                                                   -43-

   assembly 302 functions similarly to the elbow assembly 302 of Figures 26, 27, and 51-53;
   however, the elbow assembly 302 of Figures 54-57 provides the additional benefit of
   directing gases away from the patient when the flap 350 drops to its closed position (as
   shown in Figures 56 and 57).
 5           [0199]    With reference to Figure 55, the sleeve 310 preferably comprises two or
   more cut out regions or recesses 356. The recesses 356 can have any suitable shape and, in
   the illustrated configuration, the recesses 356 comprise a semicircular configuration that
   extends upward into the sleeve 310. The sleeve 310 also comprises at least one bump 357,
   and preferably two or more bumps 357. Preferably, each of the bumps 357 extends around an
10 arc of about 70 degrees.     More preferably, each of the bumps 357 is generally centered
   between two recesses 356 and each of the bumps 357 extends about 70 degrees around an
   outer surface of the sleeve 3 10.
             [0200]    The swivel 330 preferably is generally cylindrical in configuration.    As
   shown in Figure 55, the swivel 330 has an inwardly extending ridge 358. The ridge 358
15 preferably encircles the entire inner surface. In some configurations, the ridge 358 can be
   interrupted. Preferably, however, the ridge 358 does not have any interruptions large enough
   to accommodate the entire bump 357 such that the ridge 358 and the bump 357 can cooperate
   to keep the swivel 330 mounted over the sleeve 310. When assembling the swivel 330 to the
   sleeve 310, the recesses 216 allow the bumps 220 to deflect inward such that the bumps 357
20 can slide over the ridge 358 and then snap back outward to secure the bumps 357 under the
   ridge 358.
             [0201]    The elbow 222 comprises openings 420 at its sides that are in fluid
   communication with an air venting channel 422. The air venting channel 422 is formed by
   the spacing between the elbow's inner and outer walls 362, 424, as shown in Figures 56 and
25 57.
             [0202]    When the flap 350 drops to its closed position, as shown in Figures 56 and
   57, air exhaled from the user enters opening 370 of the elbow 222.        The exhalation flows
   through the port 360 in the elbow's inner wall 362, and through the venting channel 422 until
   it exits the elbow 222 via the opening 420.
                                                -44-

            [0203]     The configuration of Figures 54-57 provides a reduced overall length and
   improves product aesthetic by eliminating an unsightly hole positioned at the front of the
   elbow 222. In addition, the configuration of Figures 54-57 and improves patient comfort by
