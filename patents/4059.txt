                                           ABSTRACT
[0074]     Disclosed is a family of intranasal spray dispensers for administering uniform low
doses of desmopressin so as to achieve safe antidiuresis in human patients. The dispensers of
the invention may be used in the treatment of nocturia, primary nocturnal enuresis,
incontinence, urinary frequency, diabetes insipidus, or any disease or syndrome where
desmopressin therapy is useful or where safe temporary suppression of urine production may
lead to beneficial health effects or increased convenience in voiding control.

reference herein.
                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]      The invention relates to compositions and devices for intranasal administration of
desmopressin so as to induce antidiuretic effects such as voiding postponement in a patient
while minimizing the likelihood that the patient suffers from hyponatremia.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]      Desmopressin (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, dDAVP*) is an analogue of
vasopressin. Desmopressin has decreased vasopressor activity and increased anti-diuretic
activity compared to vasopressin, and, unlike vasopressin, does not adversely effect blood
pressure regulation. This enables desmopressin to be used clinically for anti-diuresis without
causing significant increases in blood pressure. Desmopressin is commercially available as the
acetate salt and is commonly prescribed for primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) and central
diabetes insipidus.
[0004]      Desmopressin is a small peptide and is characterized by poor bioavailability. For
treatment of severe illness such as cranial diabetes insipidus, it may be administered
intravenously or subcutaneously, routes which essentially are 100% bioavailable. When taken
in the commercialized dose forms of oral, sublingual and nasal spray delivery, bioavailability is
poor. Oral doses (pills) have a bioavailability far less than one percent, produce a wide range
of blood concentrations of the drug depending on many factors, and produce a generally
indeterminate duration of antidiuretic effect. Administration of desmopressin via the buccal
mucosa and trans dermally also have been suggested. Intranasal dosage forms have been
approved for treatment of PNE, but the commercially available product (MinirinTM) has now
been declared to be unsafe for this use.

                                                 -2
[0005]       Hyponatremia is a condition in which the sodium concentration in the plasma is too
low, e.g. below about 135 mmol/L. Severe hyponatremia can result in electrolyte abnormalities
that can cause cardiac arrhythmias, heart attack, seizures or stroke. A hyponatremic state in
patients administered desmopressin therapy occurs when the water channels in the kidneys of
the patient are activated by the drug and the patient consumes aqueous liquids. This can but
does not always result in lowering of blood osmolarity, lowering of sodium concentration, and
consequent neurological damage. Some patients on a desmopressin regimen exhibit
hyponatremia suddenly after having taken the drug without incident for long periods. Others
develop the condition very early in the therapeutic regime. In short, the incidence of
hyponatremia has largely been regarded as a stochastic side effect of the antidiuretic
desmopressin therapy, avoidable only by avoidance of fluid intake while under the drug's
effect.
[0006]       Recent deaths from hyponatremia have been attributed to over intake of water while
under the influence of desmopressin. As a result of these experiences, the U.S. Food & Drug
Administration recently has warned physicians that use of desmopressin should be curtailed,
that it is no longer indicated as appropriate for certain conditions, such as primary nocturnal
enuresis (PNE), and has "Black Boxed" the drug. The recent warning stated that "[c]ertain
patients, including children treated with the intranasal formulation of [desmopressin acetate] for
primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE), are at risk for developing severe hyponatremia that can
result in seizures or death."
[0007]       Currently, approved labeling for desmopressin administered intranasally for
treatment of PNE indicates bioavailability in the formulation is 3-5% and recommends dosing
 10-40 micrograms per day. The average maximum plasma/serum concentrations achieved
(Cmax) with a typical intranasal dose (20 pg, 10 pg in each nostril) of desmopressin for PNE is
at least approximately 20-30 pg/ml, based on 3-5% bioavailability with a 6 to 10 fold range.
While existing formulations of desmopressin have proven to be adequate for many patients
when used for these clinical indications, variable efficacy and occasional hyponatremic
episodes continue to be problems related to the aforementioned variability.
[0008]       U.S. Patent 7,405,203 discloses antidiuretic therapy methods and desmopressin
dosage forms. It discloses that the threshold plasma concentration for activation of the
antidiuretic effect of desmopressin in humans is very low, less than about 1.0 pg/ml, and based

   WO 2010/075266                                                           PCT/US2009/068962
                                                  -3
in part on this observation, proposes the use and teaches how to make and use novel low dose
desmopressin dosage forms that can substantially avoid the stochastic and unpredictable onset
of hyponatremia. This is accomplished by administration of a very low dose of the drug, a dose
sufficient to raise the desmopressin concentration in the blood only slightly above its threshold
(e.g., about 0.5 pg/ml) from about 1.0, to about 10, and perhaps as high as 15 pg drug per ml of
blood in some patients, but preferably no greater than about 10 pg/ml. This low concentration
was discovered to be sufficient to induce potent antidiuretic effects of limited and controlled
duration. Thus, the low blood concentration in combination with the known, approximate 90+
minute half life of desmopressin in a healthy person can function to control the "off switch" of
the drug's activity and thereby to limit the duration of antidiuresis. This very significantly
reduces the likelihood that the patient will drink sufficient liquids during the interval the drug is
physiologically active such that the patient's homeostasis mechanisms are overwhelmed and
blood sodium concentration falls to dangerous levels.
[0009]      For example, in the treatment of nocturia (awakening from sleep to void at night) a
low dose producing, e.g., a blood concentration of 5-7 pg/ml, can be administered at bed time.
In less than about one half hour, desmopressin concentration is at its maximum of about 7
pg/ml, and urine production is suppressed. After two hours (one half life) the desmopressin
concentration falls to about 3.5 pg/ml, at 3.5 hr (second half life), concentration is about 1.75,
at 5 hr, approximately 0.85, and at 6 hours the concentration has fallen below the activation
threshold (in many patients about 0.5 pg/ml) and the patient is making urine normally. If he
retires at 11:00 PM, during the first six hours the patient makes little or no urine, his bladder is
essentially empty, and his urge to urinate is accordingly suppressed. By 5 AM or so, urine
production is restored and in an hour or two the patient wakes to urinate. As another example,
a small dose, say 2-3 pg/ml administered intranasally or through a trans or intradermal patch,
can induce safe antidiuresis for about three hours before normal urine production is restored.
[0010]      Intranasal administration is an attractive dosage route, and if one could formulate an
intranasal dosage form that would consistently produce a desmopressin blood concentration
within or near the desired low dose range disclosed in the '203 patent, the incidence of the
hyponatremia side effect would be reduced or eliminated, and the drug could be used safely as
a convenience, as well as for the management of serious and bothersome conditions. While it
clearly is within the skill of the art to produce a low dose intranasal desmopressin formulation

   WO 2010/075266                                                             PCT/US2009/068962

that will be serviceable and induce safe antidiuresis reproducibly, the ideal intranasal dose form
would, from one administration to the next, and from batch to batch, consistently produce a
blood concentration within a relatively narrow target blood concentration range. It also would
be desirable to formulate such a product so as to minimize the chances of abuse (multiple
dosing) that could lead to antidiuresis of longer duration and potentially the development of
hyponatremia.
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0011]      The invention provides a convenient, intranasal desmopressin safety dispenser for
inducing in members of a target patient population an antidiuretic effect while reducing the risk
that a member of the population may develop hyponatremia. The dispenser comprises a
reservoir having disposed therein a composition comprising a preparation of desmopressin and
a nasal membrane permeation enhancer in an amount sufficient to constitute multiple drug
doses. The reservoir is in communication with an outlet and is fitted with a pump, preferably a
disposable pump, and preferably one that can be actuated manually, such as a squeeze bottle
actuated dispenser, or a plunger pump fitted onto a glass bottle. The pump enables serially
dispensing multiple metered doses from the reservoir through the outlet in the form of a spray
into a nostril or nostrils of a patient so as to deposit a dose of consistent size onto an intranasal
mucosal or other surface.
[0012]      Each spray comprises a multiplicity of droplets, preferably with an average volume
distribution in the range of 20 pm for D10 to about 300 pm for D90. This means that about
 10% of the droplets are smaller than about 20 pm in diameter and 90% are smaller than 300 Pm
in diameter. Each spray dose is preferably of a weight and desmopressin concentration such
that it comprises between 0.5 ng desmopressin per kilogram of the patient's body weight and
75 ng desmopressin per kilogram of the patient's body weight. The spray is characterized by a
desmopressin bioavailability greater than about 5%, that is, between about 5% and 25% of the
active in the composition actually enters the patient's bloodstream and contributes to the drug
effect, and the remainder is degraded, typically by digestion. Generally, the higher the
bioavailability of a spray, the less desmopressin per spray needs to be delivered into a nasal
cavity, and vice versa, the goal being to achieve more consistently a target desmopressin
maximum blood concentration (Cmax) in members of the patient population.

   WO 2010/075266                                                            PCT/US2009/068962
                                                  -5
[0013]       In accordance with the invention, the combination of properties of the spray
dispenser and the composition it contains enables respective doses of spray to be effective to
restrict the concentration of desmopressin produced in the bloodstream of patients, on a per
kilogram basis, to a relatively narrow range, thereby to achieve a relatively consistent, time
limited duration of antidiuresis. Stated differently, respective successive spray doses establish
in a patient by drug transport across intranasal mucosal membranes a Cmax of desmopressin
which is relatively consistent. The amount of drug delivered to the bloodstream for repeated
doses from the same dispenser to the same person preferably should differ no more than 100%,
and preferably less than 50%. The dispenser's coefficient of variation is similar to the
coefficient of variation of Cmax produced by serial subcutaneous doses of desmopressin
designed to achieve the same target Cmax. Preferably, respective successive spray doses are
sufficient to establish in a patient by intranasal delivery a Cmax of desmopressin having a
coefficient of variation within about 50%, more preferably about 25%, of the coefficient of
variation of Cmax produced by a subcutaneous dose of desmopressin designed to achieve the
same target   Cmax.
[0014]       This consistency of bioavailability also is reflected in another property of dispensers
of the invention, namely, they serve to establish in a patient by drug transport across intranasal
mucosal membranes delivery of blood concentrations of desmopressin substantially directly
proportional to the mass of desmopressin dispensed into the nostril(s) of a said patient. This
permits self titration of the length of antidiuresis desired by a patient. Generally, the
desmopressin    Cmax is directly proportional to the amount of nasally administered desmopressin
over a  Cmax  ranging from about 0.5 pg/ml to about 10.0 pg/ml.
[0015]       The value of the target  Cmax may be varied, depending on the duration of the
antidiuretic interval the dispensed composition is designed to induce. For example, a product
designed for a 7-8 hour interval of urine production suppression might be designed to deliver a
Cmax  of no more than 15 +/- 3 pg/ml. Thus, by way of illustration, a 7 hour product designed
for children might have a bioavailability of 20% and a desmopressin load per spray of 0.75 Pg
or 750 ng. This would mean that about 150 ng of drug would reach the patient's bloodstream,
and that a 33 kg (-75 lb.) child would achieve the target    Cmax of about 15 pg/ml. Another
embodiment of the same product might have a bioavailability of 10% and a desmopressin load
per spray of 1.5 pg or 1500 ng, again producing about 150 ng drug in the patient's bloodstream

   WO 2010/075266                                                           PCT/US2009/068962
                                                 -6
and the target Cmax of about 15 pg/ml. Another exemplary product may be designed for a 3-4
hour urine interruption and might deliver a Cmax of no more than about 3 pg/ml. Such a
product, designed, for example, for use by women averaging 60 kg (-130 lb.), might be 25%
bioavailable and comprise a 250 ng desmopressin load per spray, or 15% bioavailable with a
350 ng load. In both cases, the bioavailable dose would be about 50 ng desmopressin, and the
Cmax about 3 pg/ml.
[0016]      Alternatively, a single dispenser which delivers, e.g., 200 ng or 500 ng per spray,
when used in accordance with package insert or physician instructions, may serve to achieve,
for example, different durations of antidiuresis in the same person or the same duration of
antidiuresis in a 75 kg child or 150 kg adult, simply by varying the number of spays delivered
per administration event. Typically, about 20 minutes after administration of the
pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, the mean urine output per minute in a
treated individual decreases to less than about 4 ml/minute, preferably less than about 1 ml/min,
and stays in this low range for a desired time period, such as 180 minutes, 240 minutes, 300
minutes, 360 minutes, or 420 minutes. About twenty minutes after administration, the mean
urine osmolarity is greater than about 300 mOsmol/kg and remains at high concentration for a
period of time ranging up to 180 minutes, 240 minutes, 300 minutes, 360 minutes, or 420
minutes.
[0017]      A primary and important property of the dosage forms of the invention is that they
consistently deliver per spray a maximum blood concentration within a relatively narrow time
and dose range, and therefore avoid or minimize accidental delivery of a larger dose resulting
in a longer than expected antidiuretic effect and the possibility of induction of hyponatremia.
Consistent delivery, as the phrase is used herein, should be taken to mean repeatable within a
range similar to the range observed when administering very low doses of desmopressin by
subcutaneous injection, or perhaps somewhat greater. Such consistency generally is achieved
more easily exploiting formulations with higher bioavailability, and accordingly a
bioavailability of at least 5%, preferably at least 10%, more preferably at least 15%, and
preferably even higher is preferred. Higher bioavailability is achieved by exploiting
formulation technology, especially the use of permeation enhancers, and by chemical
engineering of the spray composition as disclosed herein.

                                                -7
[0018]      In one embodiment, the dispenser may further comprise means for blocking
dispensing of a second desmopressin spray, or series of sprays above a certain dose, e.g., above
about a dose sufficient to produce a blood concentration above about 10 to 12 pg/ml, for a
predetermined time interval after dispensing a first dose. This can be achieved passively as a
consequence of the design of the spray mechanism as disclosed, for example, in U.S. patent
number 7,335,186, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively,
an active timer, powered by a battery, mechanical spring, or compressed gas within the
dispenser, may be included together with mechanisms known per se designed to preclude a
second dispensing until passage of a predetermined interval, e.g., 8 hours, or somewhere
between 6 to 24 hours. Such a mechanism can discourage abuse of the product and further
minimize the chances that a patient may inadvertently or intentionally self-induce antidiuresis
for too long.
[0019]      In various embodiments, the dispenser may be formulated to induce antidiuresis in a
target patient population for less than six hours, for between 2 and 4 hours, or for between 4
and 7 hours. Maintaining the antidiuretic state for more than about 8 hours is not
recommended. The target patient population may be, for example, children, children weighing
less than 35 kg, children weighing between 35 and 50 kg, adult females, females weighing
between 50 and 75 kg, adult males, males weighing between 70 and 85 kg, or males weighing
more than 85 kg.
[0020]      The currently preferred permeation enhancers for use in the formulation are "Hsieh
enhancers" (see U.S. 5,023,252) available commercially from CPEX Pharmaceuticals
(formerly Bentley) of Exeter, New Hampshire. Preferred within the class of Hsieh enhancers
useful in the articles of manufacture of the invention are those disclosed in U.S. 7,112,561 and
U.S. 7,112,561, and the currently most preferred are disclosed in U.S. 7,244,703, such as
cyclopentadecanolide, known in the trade as CPE-215. Many other enhancers may be used.
[0021]      In some embodiments, the invention provides uses of the safety dispenser to induce
an antidiuretic effect. The dispenser and desmopressin formulation may comprise any of the
properties described herein. For example, in one embodiment, the desmopressin Cmax is
directly proportional to the amount of nasally administered desmopressin over a    Cmax  ranging
from about 0.5 pg/ml to about 10.0 pg/ml. The value of the target    Cmax may be varied,
depending on the duration of the antidiuretic interval the dispensed composition is designed to

less than about 8 hours, less than about 6 hours, for between about 2 and 4 hours, or for
between about 4 and 7 hours. Another exemplary use of a product may be designed to deliver a
Cmax in a patient of no more than about 15 pg/ml, 10 pg/ml, 7 pg/ml, or 3 pg/ml.

                                          DESCRIPTION
[0024]      The term bioavailability is used to describe the fraction of an administered dose of
drug that reaches the systemic circulation. By definition, when a medication is administered
intravenously, its bioavailability is 100%. However, when administered via other routes, such
as intranasally, bioavailability decreases due to incomplete absorption and other factors. Thus,
bioavailability is a measurement of the extent of a therapeutically active drug that reaches the
systemic circulation and is available at the site of action. It differs widely depending on
chemical and physical properties of the drug in question and its route of administration. A
quantity of the composition of the invention administered intranasally refers to the quantity that
exits the spray nozzle and enters the nostril(s). A quantity of the composition of the invention
delivered refers to the quantity that actually reaches the bloodstream, i.e., becomes
bioavailable. Proteins and peptides are relatively large and fragile molecules whose activity
generally depends on their tertiary structure. The bioavailability of protein and peptide
therapeutics administered other than parenterally is notoriously poor and variable.
[0025]      The coefficient of variation, C, as used herein, refers to a number expressed as a
percentage that is a measure of the variability of the amount of and rapidity with which active
drug gets into the bloodstream when the same drug dose form is administered the same way, to
the same person over many administrations or to many different persons. A coefficient of

   WO 2010/075266                                                           PCT/US2009/068962
                                                  -9
variation can be measured for Cmax, Tmax, or AUC. It is often expressed as the ratio of the
standard deviation of a set of measurements to the mean of those measurements. Generally,
intravenous or subcutaneous administration of any drug will have an inherently smaller C, as
compared with transdermal or oral administration. Intranasal administration of desmopressin is
characterized not only by poor bioavailability, but also by a high Cv. Thus, the commercially
available Minirin* nasal spray product on the basis of Cmax achieved per nasal spray dose has a
high C, 2 to 2.5 times that of subcutaneous injection. Thus, two patient's of the same weight
using the same drug ostensibly the same way may experience widely varying blood
concentrations of desmopressin, as measured, for example, using Cmax, which may have a range
of six to ten fold.
[0026]       The coefficient of variation is calculated from measured blood concentrations.
Accordingly, the imprecision of the analytical technique used to make the measurements
comprising the raw data will contribute to Cv. An assay with a large inherent error bar will
produce a higher measured Cv than an assay with a smaller error bar. When the measurements
are made at the lower end of the dynamic range of an assay, where the standard deviation of the
measurements is larger, C, as calculated based on the data will be larger than the C, of a larger
dose of the same drug administered the same way and measured using the same assay.
[0027]       The term "permeation enhancer," as used herein, refers to one or a mixture of
substances which when formulated together with a peptide active, such as desmopressin, have
the effect of increasing the fraction of the peptide applied to a nasal mucosal surface that
traverses the mucosal membrane and enters the bloodstream, i.e., increases bioavailability.
Many such permeation enhancers are known, as described herein. Generally, the addition of a
permeation enhancer to a peptide drug formulation designed for intranasal administration will
increase the fraction of peptide that reaches the circulation by at least about 25%, preferably at
least 50%, and most preferably at least about 100%. Thus, consider two intranasal
formulations of identical composition except composition 1 has no enhancer and composition 2
comprises an additional substance. If composition 1, when administered, results in a blood
concentration of 50 pg/ml, the substance falls within the definition of an enhancer if
composition 2 results in a blood concentration of at least 62.5 pg/ml (25% improvement). A
preferred permeation enhancer would produce a blood concentration of about 100 pg/ml (100%
improvement).

[0028]       The invention herein provides improvements in desmopressin nasal spray devices
characterized by delivering through the nasal mucosal surfaces and into the circulation of a
more consistent as well as a lower desmopressin dose so as to induce a predetermined time
limited antidiuretic effect. The nasal spray drug product contains desmopressin and a mucosal
permeation enhancer which functions to promote passage of the peptide drug through the nasal
mucosa. The active typically is dissolved or suspended in solutions or mixtures of excipients
(e.g., preservatives, viscosity modifiers, emulsifiers, buffering agents, etc.) in a pressurized, but
preferably non-pressurized, dispenser that delivers a specifically controlled amount of spray
containing a metered dose into one or both nostrils. The dose typically is metered by the spray
pump, which is typically finger or hand actuated. The nasal spray is designed for discharge of
multiple spray doses, e.g., 10 to 100 or more. It may be designed to administer the intended
dose with multiple sprays, e.g., two sprays, e.g., one in each nostril, or as a single spray, or to
vary the dose in accordance with the weight, sex, or maturity of the patient, or to permit
variation by the patient of the duration of antidiuresis.
[0029]       The object of the design of the safety spray device is to assure to the extent possible
that a consistent low concentration of desmopressin (the "target concentration") is delivered to
the bloodstream, e.g., generally not more that an amount sufficient to produce a maximum
blood concentration of 15 +/-3 pg/ml, and preferably less than 10 pg/ml. In many cases the
device will deliver an amount of drug which achieves a blood concentration of 5 +/-3 pg/ml or
less.
[0030]       The technical difficulty of achieving this goal is presented by the low and variable
bioavailability of intranasally administered peptides, including desmopressin, by the very small
amounts of active being administered, and by the low target blood concentrations. To promote
consistent bioavailability, the concentration of active drug ingredient per spray and the mass
(amount or load) of active per spray must be controlled to control precisely the amount of
active that enters a nasal passage. This involves formulation of the drug and selection of design
parameters of the pump spray using known methods. However, the amount of active that
reaches the nasal mucosa can depend, upon other factors, on the physical composition of the
spray, i.e., total amount injected, fluid properties such as viscosity, the momentum of the spray,
and its droplet size distribution. These properties also are controlled by the chemistry of the
formulation and spray nozzle characteristics. Overlaid on these factors determining

                                                 - 11
bioavailability is that only a portion of the fraction of active reaching the mucosa successfully
traverses this membrane and enters the bloodstream. Unabsorbed drug is swallowed or
otherwise degraded and is not bioavailable. Trans-mucosal passage of peptides is enhanced by
including in the formulation certain substances that act as permeation enhancers. Of course,
inconsistent spray procedure and the patient's particular nasal anatomy also play a part, but the
inconsistency in drug uptake due to these factors cannot be controlled except by physician
and/or packaging instructions for use that are explicit and clear and followed by the patient.
[0031]      Applicants discovered that it is possible to safely administer desmopressin by
producing an intranasal spray dispenser exploiting these design principles in combination as
disclosed herein.
[0032]      A product designed, for example, to treat nocturia (urinary voiding at night
interrupting sleep) in adults, to treat bed wetting in children (primary nocturnal enuresis), or to
prevent bed wetting by a person suffering from incontinence, ideally would be taken by the
patient after urinating at bedtime. Ideally the dose would suppress urine production for at least
five hours, ideally six to six and a half, and possibly as much as eight. A product designed to
interrupt urine production for a few hours during the day, such as to take a car trip for three or
four hours, should interrupt urine production for two-three hours. At the end of the antidiuretic
interval the healthy body seeks homeostasis rapidly and urine is produced normally. Thus, the
urge to urinate returns in the next hour or next few hours. The products described herein of
course also may be used, preferably under the care of a physician, for more serious disease such
as central diabetes insipidus.
[0033]       Of course, all of the times recited above are approximate, as the duration of
antidiuresis achieved in a given person taking a given dose will have a certain inevitable
variability. However, the intent and effect of the practice of the invention is to assure to the
extent possible that a dose designed to last overnight does not in fact produce only three hours
of antidiuresis, resulting in early waking, or involuntary voiding. More important, the effect of
practice of the invention is to minimize the possibility that the interval of antidiuresis lasts
unexpectedly long, e.g., 10 or 12 hours, resulting in an awake patient drinking liquids, and
possibly developing hyponatremia.

   WO 2010/075266                                                            PCT/US2009/068962

[0034]       The urine production suppression begins when the patient's desmopressin blood
concentration exceeds the activation threshold of the water channels in the proximal kidney
tubules, and ends when the concentration falls below that threshold. The exact concentration
which is sufficient in a given individual to activate the water channels will vary, and it is so low
that it is hard to measure with precision, but as disclosed in U.S. Patent 7,405,203, experiments
suggest the threshold is somewhat less than 1.0 pg/ml, or about 0.5 pg/ml, and possibly
somewhat lower.
[0035]       Table 1 illustrates certain important features of various embodiments of the
invention. Referring to the Table, it discloses dosage parameters, ranges of maximum expected
blood concentrations, the average weight of members of various patient populations, and
expected durations of antidiuresis for each population. All listed dose forms are exemplary
only and should not be regarded as limiting, except as otherwise indicated in the claims. All
these products assume that one spray equals one dose. Of course multiple sprays could be
employed to achieve the same dose and this may be desirable as promoting consistent uptake.
[0036]       The first two products exemplify alternative ways to achieve antidiuresis for the
treatment of nocturia in adult males. Both generate a Cmax of about 5-8 pg/ml, but the first has
a 10 % bioavailability and delivers 1.0 to 1.6 pg desmopressin per spray, while the second has
a bioavailability of about 20%, so requires only about half as much active per spray. Both
deliver about 100 to 160 ng of drug to the patient's bloodstream, and this amount circulates to
produce the desired blood concentration (Cmax). Exemplary product 3 is designed to treat
enuresis in children. If the child has an average weight of 35 kg, he or she will experience 5 to
7 hours of antidiuresis with an intranasal dose of 300-400 ng and a 15% bioavailability. This
will deliver 45-70 ng desmopressin to the child's circulation and produce the desired 5-8 pg/ml
concentration that will fall below the threshold concentration as normal clearance mechanisms
reduce drug concentration until the threshold is passed five to seven hours later. Exemplary
product 4 is designed to induce short duration urine suppression in, e.g., females averaging 60
kg. In this case, the interval desirably is short, e.g., about three hours. This can be achieved by
intranasal administration of a dose that will produce a Cmax of 1-2 pg/ml. This blood
concentration can be achieved reliably with proper use of a dispenser delivering a 100-200ng
load characterized by a 15% bioavailability. Products 5 and 6 illustrate still other products

[0037]      Turning now to the details of the design of the safety dispenser, suitable drug
reservoir's such as glass bottles and plastic squeeze bottles are widely available and used for
pharmaceutical dispensing. Preferably the reservoir and the spray pump are disposable. Finger
actuated pump sprays comprising plastic parts and metal springs are available commercially,
for example, from Pfeiffer of America, Inc, Princeton New Jersey. These are available in
designs to control drop size distribution to meet various specifications. For use in intranasal
products the pumps typically deliver a 100 p1 load in a narrow spray pattern, although in
various embodiments of the invention the volume per spray may be varied, e.g., between 50 P1
and 150 p1 . Many different such metered drug pump designs can be adapted for use in the
invention. Non limiting examples are disclosed in U.S. patent numbers 4,860,738, 4,944,429,
6,321,942, 6,446,839, 6,705,493, 6,708,846, 6,772,915, and 7,182,226.

[0038]       The currently preferred spray apparatus is sold as the Pfeiffer APF pump and is
fitted to a 5.0 ml glass bottle. It delivers a metered, 100 l load in a narrow spray pattern.
Preferably, to promote consistency, the spray delivers the active formulation as a multiplicity of
droplets with an average volume distribution in the range of 20 P m for D10 to about 300 P m
for D90. This means that about 10% of the droplets are smaller than about 20 Pm in diameter
and 90% are smaller than 300 pm in diameter. Other distributions may be used. Very small
droplets tend to be inhaled and may or may not reach the circulation. Large droplets may not
penetrate the nostril lumen sufficiently and may result in leakage and loss. Such metered
pumps assure that, with proper injection protocol, each use results in expelling a metered
amount and that a relatively constant amount ends up in contact with the nasal mucosal surface.
[0039]       The composition disposed within the reservoir comprises desmopressin, also called
Anti-Diuretic Hormone, 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, or dDAVP. It is a water soluble
vasopressin analog having a molecular weight of 1069.23. Drug grade material is widely
commercially available as the acetate salt. The term desmopressin, as used herein, refers to 1
desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin and all other such analogs having antidiuretic activity,
including analogs of active allelic variants of human vasopressin, and including other anions.
See, for example U.S. 3,980,631, and U.S. 4,148,787.
[0040]       The composition also necessarily includes at least one substance that acts as a
permeation enhancer, that is, a substance which increases the net peptide transport across the
mucosal membranes from the nasal lumen to the capillary bed behind it. Many permeation
enhancers are known in the art, and there are many ways to formulate such enhancers with
peptide drugs so as to effectively increase their bioavailability. Permeation enhancers generally
function by opening the tight junctions formed between epithelial cells of the mucosal
membrane, thereby allowing diffusion of therapeutic agent into and through the membrane.
[0041]       Significant research has been conducted to enhance bioavailability across nasal
membranes directed toward developing intranasal administration of insulin. See, for example,
U.S. 5,112,804 and U.S. 7,112,561. The learning from these efforts can be applied in the
formulation of desmopressin compositions to improved trans mucosal bioavailability.
Generally, the enhancers used to promote insulin transport are more effective to improve trans
mucosal desmopressin bioavailability as the target blood concentration of desmopressin is

orders of magnitude smaller than effective insulin doses, and desmopressin is a much smaller
polypeptide (MW 1069 vs. 5808).
[0042]       The permeation enhancer used in the composition of the invention may include any
entity that is compatible with peptide administration and facilitates absorption of the peptide
across the nasal mucosal membrane. The currently preferred enhancers are the so called Hsieh
enhancers. See U.S. 5,023,252, 5,731,303, 7,112,561, and 7,244,703. These are macrocyclic
esters, diesters, amides, diamides, amidines, diamidines, thioester, dithioester, thioamides,
ketones or lactones. The macrocyclic moiety often contains at least twelve carbon atoms. The
preferred group are the cyclopentadecanolides disclosed in 5,023,252 and 7,112,561.
Cyclopentadecalactone or cyclohexadecanone are currently preferred, see 7,244,703. The
currently preferred species is cyclopentadecanolide, sold under the trade name CPE-215 by
CPEX, Inc of Exeter, New Hampshire.
[0043]       Many other less preferred enhancers disclosed in the art as being useful in
enhancing passage through mucosal tissue barriers such as the skin, GI tract, or other mucosal
surfaces also may be adapted for use in the products of the invention. Non limiting examples
include bile salts and other fatty acids, sugar esters or sugar alcohol esters such as sorbitan
esters of long chain aliphatic acids (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,122,383; 5,212,199 and 5,227,169).
Membrane (skin) permeation enhancement using aliphatic alcohol esters of lactic acid is
disclosed in U.S. 5,154,122. U.S. 5,314,694 discloses use of esters of fatty acid alcohols, i.e.
lauryl alcohol and lactic acid. Potentially useful permeation enhancers include bile salts such
as sodium cholate, sodium glycocholate, sodium glycodeoxycholate, taurodeoxycholate,
sodium deoxycholate, sodium taurodihydrofusidate, taurocholate, and ursodeoxycholate,
sodium lithocholate, chenocholate, chenodeoxycholate, ursocholate, ursodeoxycholate,
hyodeoxycholate, dehydrocholate, glycochenocholate, taurochenocholate, and
taurochenodeoxycholate. Also useful are other permeation enhancers such as sodium dodecyl
sulfate ("SDS"), dimethyl sulfoxide ("DMSO"), sodium lauryl sulfate, salts and other
derivatives of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, surfactants, bile salt analogs, or natural or
synthetic derivatives of bile salts. U.S. 5,719,122 discloses polyglycolysed glycerides which
may be employed as permeation enhancers and include saturated polyglycolysed glycerides
consisting of C8 - C18 glycerides and polyethylene glycol esters, such as those available under
the trade names Gelucire RTM., e.g. Gelucire RTM.33/01, 35/10, 37/02 or 44/14; unsaturated

trade name Labrasol. A mixture of such polyglycolysed glycerides may be employed, e.g.,
Gelucire 44/14 and Labrasol.
[0044]       Permeation enhancers suitable for use in the formulation of drug preparations which
enter the bloodstream via the GI tract also potentially may be adapted for use in the present
invention. These, without limitation, include those disclosed in U.S. 20030232078 such as
ethylene-diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), bile salt permeation enhancers such as those noted
above and fatty acid permeation enhancers, such as sodium caprate, sodium laurate, sodium
caprylate, capric acid, lauric acid, and caprylic acid, acyl carnitines, such as palmitoyl carnitine,
stearoyl carnitine, myristoyl carnitine, and lauroyl carnitine, and salicylates, such as sodium
salicylate, 5-methoxy salicylate, and methyl salicylate. U.S. 4,548,922 and 4,746,508 also
discloses a system for delivering proteins and polypeptides by intranasal or other transmucosal
routes using low toxicity permeation enhancers of the amphiphilic steroid family, e.g. fusidic
acid derivatives, to promote efficient transport of the drug across the mucosal surface. The
disclosed compositions, which are generally water-based, have been demonstrated to be useful
for the intranasal delivery in humans of a variety or proteins and peptides, including insulin,
human growth hormone, and salmon calcitonin, and are potentially useful in the compositions
component of the dispensers of the invention.
[0045]       It is very difficult to predict which enhancer will work best for a given drug. For
permeation enhancement of desmopressin, the actual effectiveness of an enhancer should be
verified by routine experiments of a nature well known to the skilled artisan, e.g., using the
porcine or rat model. The amount of permeation enhancer included in the formulation
component of the present invention will generally range between about 1 wt % to about 30 wt
%. The precise nature and amount of enhancer will vary depending on, for example, the
particular permeation enhancer or enhancer composition selected, and on the nature of other
components in the formulation. Thus, the concentration of the permeation enhancer within the
medicament medium may be varied depending on the potency of the enhancer. The upper limit
for enhancer concentration is set by toxic effect to or irritation limits of the mucosal membrane.

   WO 2010/075266                                                           PCT/US2009/068962
                                                 - 17
The solubility of the enhancer within the medicament medium may also limit enhancer
concentration.
[0046]      The composition may be formulated as a simple, typically mildly acidic, aqueous
solution of desmopressin, containing a water-soluble permeation enhancer molecule or multi
component permeation enhancer composition. Alternatively, the composition may be
formulated as a two phase system with a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic phase. The
composition of course may include other conventional components such as emulsifiers or
surface active agents to aid in stabilization and enhancement of drop formation within the
structure of the spray nozzle, preservatives so as to enhance shelf life or permit room
temperature storage, stabilizers, osmolarity controls (salts), and a buffer or a buffer system.
Formulations are best optimized empirically. Any given candidate formulation may be tested
by intranasal administration to experimental animals, e.g., pigs or rats, or with proper approvals
after appropriate pre clinical testing, to humans.    Periodic sampling of blood will reveal the
desmopressin concentration at various times post administration so as to permit calculation of
Cmax and other variables and the consistency of delivery to the circulation among successive
doses both inter patient and intra patient.
Example of formulation testing protocol
[0047]      This example describes how to test a given candidate formulation for efficiency in
transport across nasal membranes. It assumes testing of compositions comprising water
soluble permeation enhancers "A" and "B" and seeks to measure the fraction of desmopressin
that permeates the nasal mucosa and enters the bloodstream in a low dose range, and how this
bioavailability is altered as a function of the identity and concentration of these different
enhancers.
[0048]      Thus, by way of example, four formulations may be prepared having the following
compositions.

[0049]       A 10l drop of each formulation will contain 0.02 pg (20 ng) of desmopressin. A

weighing, for example, between 225 and 250 grams. Blood is drawn prior to dosing and at 10,
20, 40, 60, and 120 minutes after dosing. The desmopressin concentration of each blood
sample is determined using, for example, an immunoassay with sufficient sensitivity at the low
pg desmopressin concentrations in the samples. From these data Cmax can be calculated for
each formulation and all compositions tested can be rated for efficient passage of desmopressin
across rat nasal mucosal tissue. Promising formulations can be tested further, e.g., by
introduction of a spray of a given formulation, volume and desmopressin concentration into the
nostril of test pigs. Again, blood samples are drawn and Cmax, AUC, or other measures of drug
bioavailability can be determined. These data, in turn, permit preparation of test formulations
for use in a phase I clinical trial, with the goal of designing a safety dispenser which when used
correctly consistently produces a desmopressin drug concentration within a low dose target
concentration range.

concentration they delivered, duration of antidiuresis, their pharmacokinetic properties, etc., as
set forth below.
Clinical Testing of Prototype Product
[0054]       A clinical study using a safety dispenser embodying the invention described above
in human adult subjects in a water loaded state demonstrated that doses administered
intranasally of 500 ng to 2000 ng (one to four sprays) produced antidiuretic effects in a dose
proportional relationship for durations of from 2 to 7 hours. Peak blood concentrations ranged
from about 1.25 to about 10 pg/ml. None of the test subjects exhibited any drug related
decreases in serum sodium.
[0055]       The open-label preliminary study of the effects and pharmacokinetics of the
prototype dispensers was conducted with six male and six female healthy, water loaded, non
smoking volunteer subjects, following the protocol described generally below. In summary,
each subject was dosed up to four times over a period of one week with dosing administered
every other day. On days one, three, and five subjects were dosed intranasally with escalating
doses of the low dose desmopressin nasal spray formulation described above. On day seven,
subjects were given a single bolus injection of low dose desmopressin either intradermally or
subcutaneously as a comparison. All subjects were screened prior to the first treatment,
including evaluations of medical history, complete physical exam including nasopharyngeal
exam, serum chemistry including serum osmolality, urinalysis including urine osmolality.
[0056]       On day one all subjects were asked to have his/her morning void prior to breakfast,
and thereafter subjects started the water loading process. Water loading assures that a patient is
not generating endogenous vasopressin, and accordingly permits isolation of the effect of
exogenous desmopressin. To achieve a steady state diuresis, the subjects were directed to drink
a volume of water corresponding to at least 1.5% and up to 3% of body weight. The water
loading process started about two hours prior to the dosing of the first subject. Subjects were
asked to void every 20 minutes. To ensure continuous water loaded state, the subjects replaced

   WO 2010/075266                                                           PCT/US2009/068962
                                                -21
their urinary output loss with an equivalent amount of fluid. Insensible loss was not measured
or replaced. When the urinary output rate exceeded 10 ml/min in two consecutive
measurements (defined as water loaded state) in the subjects, dosing began. Subjects were
maintained in the water loaded state with equivalent fluid intake versus fluid loss.
[0057]       Each subject then was dosed intranasally with one spray (100 P1 containing 0.5 Pg
of desmopressin) of the nasal spray formulation in the right or left nostril. Urine volume was
measured in 20-minute intervals from the start of water loading (at least two hours prior to
dosing) to the time the subject's urine output returns to baseline (urinary output level that
exceeds 10 mL/minute in three consecutive 20-minute measurements) post dose. Serum
osmolality and sodium were measured prior to dosing and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours post dose.
[0058]       Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic determinations was performed at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4
and 6 hours post dose. Two seven ml blood samples were collected at each time point. The
concentration of desmopressin was determined by a validated radio immunoassay. The
concentration of desmopressin in plasma was analyzed for the individual volunteer in each
group, by use of non-compartmental methods using the commercially available software
WinNonlinTMPro, ver. 3.2 (Pharsight Corporation, USA).        A plasma concentration value below
the limit of quantitation ("LOQ") followed by values above the limit was set at 'LOQ/2' for the
analysis and for the descriptive statistics on concentrations. Values below LOQ not followed
by values above the LOQ were excluded from the analysis, and set to zero in the descriptive
statistics on concentrations.
[0059]       On days two, four, and six the subjects fasted beginning at 8 pm until breakfast the
following day and were encouraged to drink one to two liters of water between 7 pm and 9 pm.
Thereafter, they were to drink fluid ad libitum until the start of the water loading on the next
day.
[0060]       On day three, the subjects received one spray of desmopressin nasal spray
formulation in each nostril (total volume of 200 l equivalent to 1000 ng of desmopressin).
Other than the dose level, all procedures were the same as those described for day one.
[0061]       On day five, all subjects received a total volume of 2000 ng of desmopressin (one
nasal spray in each nostril followed five minutes later by a second spray in each nostril). Other
than the dose level, all procedures were the same as those described for day one.

   WO 2010/075266                                                           PCT/US2009/068962
                                                 - 22
[0062]       On day seven, three male and three female subjects received a single bolus
intradermal injection of desmopressin solution (150      l of 0.8 pg/ml solution equivalent to 120
ng of desmopressin), and the other six subjects received a single bolus subcutaneous injection
of desmopressin (150      l of 0.8 pg/ml solution equivalent to 120 ng of desmopressin). Other
than the dosing paradigm, all procedures were the same as described on day one.
[0063]       Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from the individual concentration of
desmopressin found in blood samples versus time curves of desmopressin, included AUC, and
Cmax.   Assay values below the limit of detection of the desmopressin immunoassay (<1.25
pg/ml) were set equal to zero for purposes of averaging concentrations. Assay values below the
level of detection that occurred between two non-zero concentrations were considered to be
"missing" for purposes of calculating the AUC. Blood concentration measurements from the
0.5 pg dose study were not conducted as often unreliable and below the limit of detection.
Since the traditional analysis resulted in many subject/treatment combinations not being
evaluable for T1/ 2 or AUC, a hypothesis was made that for a given subject, the half-life would
be consistent from treatment to treatment. Therefore, as long as one of the three treatments
generated an evaluable terminal half-life, that value could be used to extrapolate the AUC for
the treatments that did not have evaluable half-lives. Accordingly, an average terminal half-life
(Avg T 1/ 2) was calculated for each subject that included a treatment with evaluable half-lives in
that subject. Ten of the twelve subjects had half-lives evaluable for at least one treatment. The
AUC could be calculated for each treatment and subject using the calculated average T1 /2 value.
[0064]       It was determined that aside from one anomalous patient, all 11 patients in the study
had peak desmopressin drug concentrations at the 2000 ng dose level of between 3.9 and 10
pg/ml. Furthermore, 9 of the 11 achieved drug concentrations between 5.18 and 8.4 pg/ml.
This alone illustrates the consistency of the blood concentration achieved using the prototype
dispenser described above. Furthermore, as a result of the study, the following AUC and Cmax
values were calculated. The calculated coefficient of variation of each data point is indicated in
parentheses.

[0065]      Two conclusions may be derived from these data. First, the coefficient of variation
of Cmax of desmopressin administered intranasally using the safety dispenser of the invention
for the 1000 ng dose (51.6%) is only about 30% greater than coefficient of variation of Cmax of
a dose of desmopressin administered subcutaneously and designed to produce comparable low
blood concentrations. The measured coefficient of variation of Cmax of desmopressin
administered intranasally using the dispensed composition of the invention for the 2000 ng
dose (36.0%) is about equal to the coefficient of variation of Cmax of the subcutaneous dose.
These preliminary data support the hypothesis that the formulation of the invention indeed is
characterized by a coefficient of variation of Cmax comparable to that of subcutaneous
desmopressin doses designed to achieve a comparable low blood concentration. This is in
sharp contrast to commercially available intranasal desmopressin dose forms which, despite
being designed to deliver far higher blood concentrations, have a much higher variation in Cmax,
a variation that contributes to the stochastic induction of a hyponatremic state.
[0066]      Second, note that both AUC and Cmax produced by this formulation dispensed
intranasally in accordance with the invention appear to be directly linearly proportional to dose.
Thus, the 1000 ng intranasal dose yields a Cmax of 2.79 +/- 1.44 pg/ml, while the 2000 ng dose
yields a value of 6.24 +/- 2.25; the 1000 ng intranasal dose results in an AUC of 5.36+/
5.92,which is approximately doubled to 11.59+/-7.9 when the dose is doubled. This suggests

   WO 2010/075266                                                           PCT/US2009/068962
                                                -24
that desmopressin can be reliably dispensed intranasally to reproducibly achieve an antidiuretic
effect of limited duration without substantial risk of members of a patient population
developing hyponatremia. It also suggests that a dispenser delivering a low dose may be used
via multiple sprays to achieve any of several antidiuresis durations in a given patient, or that
one dispenser may be sold to service different patient populations provided there is proper
instruction for how many sprays should be used to produce a given duration of effect in a given
population.
[0067]      The results of this study suggest that the low-dose desmopressin nasal spray
embodying the invention provides improved, more reproducible pharmacokinetic parameters at
relatively consistent low blood concentrations, and delivers a Cmax proportional to the doses
administered.
[0068]      The urine output and urine osmolarity was measured just prior to nasal
administration of 2000 ng of the pharmaceutical composition of desmopressin and for a period
of up to about 10 hours (600 minutes) after administration. Figure 1 shows the mean urine
output for male and female subjects. As evidenced by the data, the urine output fell to less than
8 ml/minute within 20 minutes after administration of the desmopressin by nose (in water
loaded individuals). Urine output remained less than 8 ml/minute for a period ranging up to
about 400 minutes after administration. Figure 2 shows the mean urine osmolarity for the same
group of male and female subjects as in Figure 1. Urine osmolarity increased to greater than
about 400 mOsmol/kg within 40 minutes after administration of 2 Pg of desmopressin nasally
and remained greater than about 400 mOsmol/Kg for about 250 minutes after administration of
the desmopressin by nose.
[0069]      A second separate study in adult patients with nocturia established that doses of 500
and 1000 ng (one or two sprays administered intranasally) produced dramatic therapeutic
decreases in the number of night time urinary voids equal to or less than one per night in 41 of
43 patients. Serum sodium levels remained within normal limits throughout treatment.
