ABSTRACT
A fluid delivery device comprises a housing having a fluid reservoir. A needle is in fluid
communication with the fluid reservoir in an engaged position and out of fluid communication
with the fluid reservoir in armed and storage positions. A proximal end of a biasing member is
coupled to the housing and a distal end of the biasing member is configured to deliver a force
to the fluid reservoir. A piston member extends through the biasing member and is coupled to
the distal end of the biasing member. The piston member is fixed with respect to the housing in
a locked position such that the biasing member does not deliver the force to the fluid reservoir
and moveable with respect to the housing in a released position such that the biasing member
delivers the force to the fluid reservoir. Transitioning the needle from the storage position to the
armed position transitions the piston from the locked position to the released position.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.
61/251,236 filed October 13, 2009 entitled "Fluid Delivery Device", and U.S. Provisional Patent
Application No. 61/325,136 filed April 16, 2010 entitled "Fluid Delivery Device" both of which
are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]     The present invention generally relates to a fluid delivery device and more
particularly to an ambulatory device for delivering a medicament to a patient.
[0003]     Many attempts have been made to provide dosing of drugs and other fluids, such as
insulin, using ambulatory pump systems. Although some systems for continuous delivery work
quite well, individuals using these systems, particularly in continuous dose mode, need to
monitor the devices closely to ensure continuity and accuracy of dosing under variable
environmental conditions such as temperature and air pressure. In addition, there are few
options for individuals who require the ability to vary the dose of medication quickly and
accurately, and most of the available options are cumbersome, difficult to operate, intrusive,
and/or expensive.
[0004]     Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a simple, intuitive, inexpensive
ambulatory device able to provide fluid dosing under patient control, as well as safety and
consistency in the metered and/or continuous dose over a wide range of environmental
conditions.
[0005]     Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0050]     Referring to the drawings in detail, wherein like reference numerals indicate like
elements throughout, there is shown in Figs. 1-23C a fluid delivery device, generally
designated 110, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The
fluid delivery device 110 may include one or more features described herein which facilitate or
improve accurate delivery of a fluid and ease of use by a user or patient. The benefits provided
by these features translate readily to improved patient compliance and improved therapeutic
outcome.
[0051]     In one embodiment, the fluid delivery device 110 is a discrete ambulatory insulin
delivery pump. The fluid delivery device 110 may be single use, disposable and incapable of
reuse. In preferred embodiments, the fluid delivery device 110 is completely mechanical and
hydraulic and has no electronic components or aspects. The fluid delivery device 110 may
provide excellent therapeutic capability in a small, single use, disposable package and can be
produced using high volume manufacturing fabrication (e.g., injection molding) and assembly
processes, allowing for low cost-of goods. Devices of the invention can be used for a broad
range of applications, including, but not limited to, clinical applications (administration of
medicaments, etc.) and biomedical research (e.g., microinjection into cells, nuclear or
organelle transplantation, isolation of single cells or hybridomas, etc.).
[0052]     In one embodiment, the fluid delivery device 110 is a device for dispensing,
delivering, or administering the fluid or agent to the user or patient. The fluid may be any
therapeutic agent. In one embodiment, the fluid is a low viscosity gel agent. In one
embodiment, the fluid is an analgesic agent. In one embodiment, the fluid is insulin. In one
embodiment, the fluid is a U100 insulin. In another embodiment the fluid is a U200 insulin. In
another embodiment the fluid is a U300 insulin. In another embodiment, the fluid is a U500
insulin. In another embodiment the fluid is any insulin between U100 and U500. In other
embodiments, the fluid may be, but is not limited to, opiates and/or other palliatives or
analgesics, hormones, psychotropic therapeutic compositions, or any other drug or chemical
whose continuous dosing is desirable or efficacious for use in treating patients. Single fluids
and combinations of two or more fluids (admixed or co-administered) may be delivered using
the fluid delivery device 110. As used herein "patients" or "user" can be human or non-human
animals; the use of the fluid delivery device 110 is not confined solely to human medicine, but
can be equally applied to veterinarian medicine.
[0053]     The fluid delivery device 110 may dispense the fluid over a sustained period of time

                                               -8
(i.e., basal delivery). In one embodiment, the fluid delivery rate is continuously or near
continuously delivered to the user over the sustained period of time. The fluid delivery device
110 may also be capable of dispensing a supplementary amount of fluid, in addition to the
basal amount, on demand, under patient control (i.e., bolus delivery). In one embodiment, as
discussed further below, the bolus amount delivered in a single, selectable administration is
pre-determined. In preferred embodiments, the fluid delivery device 110 is hydraulically
actuated and comprises one or more reservoirs or chambers containing hydraulic fluid of a
suitable viscosity for transferring power from one or more actuators to the fluid and controlling
the delivery rate as discussed further below.
[0054]     One exemplary embodiment of the fluid delivery device 110 is shown in the
schematic of Fig. 3, illustrating select components and their relationships. The fluid delivery
device 110 may have a first operable state for dispensing or delivering the fluid through an
infusion set or needle 312 at a continuous or sustained basal dosage and a second operable
state for delivering the fluid through the needle 312 at a bolus dosage. In some embodiments,
the fluid delivery device can be in both the first and second operable states concurrently, i.e.,
delivering a bolus dose in addition to a basal dose of fluid. In one embodiment, the bolus
dosage is a fixed incremental dosage. In another embodiment, the bolus function is capable of
delivering multiple discrete bolus increments when activated by the user. In certain
embodiments, the basal rate of delivery is predetermined and preset.
[0055]     In one embodiment, the fluid delivery device 110 contains three hydraulic reservoirs
or chambers, a hydraulic basal chamber 314, a hydraulic bolus chamber 316 and a hydraulic
pump chamber 318. In some embodiments, the hydraulic bolus chamber 314 shares a
common chamber with the hydraulic pump chamber 318 and/or the flow between the hydraulic
bolus chamber 316 and the hydraulic pump chamber 318 is unrestricted as described further
herein. In a preferred embodiment, the hydraulic basal and bolus chambers 314, 316 are
separately and independently actuated by separate and independent basal and bolus
actuators 320, 322.
[0056]     Referring to Fig. 3, in one embodiment, the hydraulic basal and bolus chambers 314,
316 act on the hydraulic pump chamber 318 which in turn acts on a fluid reservoir or delivery
chamber 324, containing the fluid. In other embodiments, the hydraulic basal and bolus
chambers 314, 316 each act on a distinct pump chamber and each pump chamber is
functionally connected to a separate fluid reservoir (not shown).

                                               -9
[0057]     Referring to Fig. 2, the hydraulic basal, bolus and pump chambers 314, 316, 318
may be defined by a manifold 226. In one embodiment, the manifold 226 is an integral one
piece component 226. In one embodiment, the manifold 226 is comprised of a polymer. In one
embodiment, the manifold 226 is comprised of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In one embodiment,
the fluid reservoir 324 and a portion of the hydraulic pump chamber 318 are defined by a fluid
cartridge 228. In one embodiment, the fluid cartridge 228 is comprised of a polymer. In one
embodiment, the fluid cartridge 228 is comprised of Topas 6017 S-04. The hydraulic basal,
bolus and pump chambers 314, 316, 318 and the fluid reservoir 324 may be cylindrical. In
other embodiments, the hydraulic pump chambers 314, 316, 318 and the fluid reservoir 324
have any cross sectional shape such as square, rectangular or triangular. In one embodiment,
a first moveable barrier 230 separates the basal actuator 320 and the hydraulic basal chamber
314. In one embodiment, a second moveable barrier 232 separates the bolus actuator 322 and
the hydraulic bolus chamber 316. In one embodiment, a third moveable barrier 234 separates
the hydraulic pump chamber 318 and the fluid reservoir 324. The first, second and third
moveable barriers 230, 232, 234 may be pistons as described further below. In other
embodiments, the first, second and third moveable barriers 230, 232, 234 are any barriers that
can transfer movement between two chambers such as membranes or expandable walls.
[0058]     The hydraulic basal and bolus chambers 314, 316 may be parallel, spaced on either
side of and generally aligned with the hydraulic pump chamber 318 and the fluid reservoir 324
as illustrated in order to provide a more compact configuration. In one embodiment, the
hydraulic pump chamber 318 is provided toward one side of the fluid delivery device 110. In
other embodiments, the hydraulic basal, bolus and pump chambers 314, 316, 318 are
arranged in any configuration that allows fluid communication and achieves the desired outer
shape of the fluid delivery device 110 such as stacked in a triangle configuration.
[0059]     The basal actuator 320 may act on the hydraulic basal chamber 314 containing a
hydraulic fluid to pressurize the hydraulic basal chamber 314 and force a hydraulic fluid
through a flow restrictor 336 into the hydraulic pump chamber 318. Generally, but not
necessarily, the hydraulic fluid in hydraulic pump chamber 318 may be identical or similar in
composition to the hydraulic fluid in hydraulic basal chamber 314. Actuation of the basal
actuator 320 may result in a flow of hydraulic fluid from hydraulic basal reservoir 320 into the
hydraulic pump chamber 318 at a reduced rate as compared to if the flow restrictor 336 was
not provided. As the volume of hydraulic fluid in the hydraulic pump chamber 318 increases,
the third moveable barrier 234 is displaced, compressing or reducing the volume of the fluid
reservoir 324 and causing the fluid contained therein to be expelled through an output orifice or

                                                - 10
needle 312 at a sustained basal rate. In one embodiment, the basal rate is substantially
constant.
[0060]     In some embodiments, a bolus actuator 322 independently acts on the hydraulic
bolus chamber 316. In one embodiment, the bolus actuator 322 acts directly on the hydraulic
pump chamber 318. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to
devices comprising both a basal and a bolus capability. Devices of the invention having one or
more features described herein may comprise a basal capability, a bolus capability, or both
basal and bolus capabilities.
[0061]     Both hydraulic bolus chamber 316 and hydraulic pump chamber 318 may contain
hydraulic fluid of an appropriate viscosity. Generally, but not necessarily, the composition of the
hydraulic fluid in hydraulic pump chamber 318 will be identical or similar to the composition of
the hydraulic fluid in hydraulic basal and bolus chambers 314, 316. Actuation or displacement
of the bolus actuator 322 independently displaces the third moveable barrier 234, compressing
or reducing the volume of fluid reservoir 324 and causing the fluid contained therein to be
expelled through an output orifice such as the needle 312. Concurrent operation of both the
basal and bolus actuators 320, 322 causes compression of fluid reservoir 324 by an amount
greater than operation of either actuator alone.
[0062]     When present, both the basal and bolus actuators 320, 322 may be integrated within
the hydraulically actuated system in a manner that allows each function to provide independent
displacement force onto a common movable barrier 234, which in turn displaces fluid from
within a common fluid reservoir 324 to dispense the fluid from the device. In other
embodiments, the basal and bolus actuators 320, 322 may be integrated within the
hydraulically actuated system in a manner that allows each function to provide independent
displacement force onto separate moveable barriers (not shown), which in turn displace fluid
from within separate fluid reservoirs (not shown). Examples of a multi-cartridge fluid delivery
devices for use with the inventions presented herein are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application
Publication No. 2009/0240232 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0063]     In one embodiment, the fluid delivery device 110 utilizes a combination of force, high,
very high or ultra high viscosity fluid, and flow restriction to deliver the fluid on a continuous or
sustained basis. The flow restrictor 336 may facilitate continuous delivery of fluid at a basal
rate by, among other aspects, creating a large pressure differential or pressure drop between
the hydraulic basal chamber 314 and the hydraulic pump chamber 318, allowing the system to

                                              - 11
tolerate a wider range of frictional variations in the system such as movement of the third
movable barrier 234 within the fluid cartridge 228, tolerate small changes in the resistance to
flow, and overcome potential occlusions in the flow path. In one embodiment, the pressure
differential between the hydraulic basal chamber 314 and the hydraulic pump chamber 318
during use is approximately 10: 1. In one embodiment, the pressure differential between the
hydraulic basal chamber 314 and the hydraulic pump chamber 318 during                       use is
approximately 46: 1. In one embodiment the hydraulic basal chamber 314 operates at a
pressure between approximately 20 psi and between 70 psi. In one embodiment, the hydraulic
basal chamber 314 operates at a pressure of approximately 46.8 psi. In one embodiment, the
hydraulic pump chamber 318 operates at a pressure of approximately 0.5 psi to approximately
5 psi. In one embodiment, the hydraulic pump chamber 318 operates at a pressure of
approximately 1.2 psi.
[0064]     The flow restrictor 336 is dimensionally adapted to control the rate of fluid flow there
through. In one embodiment, the flow restrictor 336 has a diameter of approximately 1-1000
pin. It should be understood that all ranges provided herein encompass both the beginning and
end points of the range (e.g., includes 1 and 1000 pir in a range of from about 1 to about 1000
pin), as well as all values in between. Whatever the shape of the flow restrictor 336, the cross
sectional area and the length of the opening will be sized to achieve the flow rate desired. For
example, the flow restrictor 336 may be about one -ten thousandths of an inch (or 2-3 pir) in
diameter. Depending on use, the flow restrictor 336 size may be anything, including but not
limited to a diameter between 200 nm-500 nm, or 500 nm-1 000 nm, or 1-2 pin, or 5-10 pin, or
10-1000 pin. In one embodiment, the outer diameter of the flow restrictor 336 is approximately
0.026 inches and the inner diameter of the flow restrictor 336 is one of approximately 0.00758
inches, 0.00708 inches and 0.00638 inches. In one embodiment, the length and outer diameter
of the flow restrictor 336 remains constant from device to device based on the size of the
manifold 226 and the inner diameter of the flow restrictor 336 may be altered to achieve the
desired flow rate. Other sizes and dimensions of the flow restrictor 336 can be selected, and
the size and dimension selected will depend upon the application at hand and, in particular, the
viscosity of the hydraulic fluid and the force applied by the basal actuator 320. In one
embodiment, the flow restrictor 336 is comprised of topaz. Having a flow restrictor 336
comprised of topaz may help to ensure that the flow restrictor 336 has a substantially accurate
and constant cross sectional size and shape. Those of skill in the art will understand that any
suitable flow restrictor 336 may be employed, and that the size and the shape of the flow
restrictor 336 can vary to achieve the desired flow rate of the fluid being mediated under the
expected conditions, including temperature and ambient pressure. The flow restrictor 336 need

                                                - 12
not be circular in cross sectional shape, and can be an oval, a square, a rectangle, a triangle, a
polygon, or irregular in shape. The size and shape of the flow restrictor 336 may be determined
empirically by testing the fluid flow of selected fluids at conditions of interest.
[0065]     Referring to Fig. 4B, in one embodiment, the flow restrictor 336 extends through a
side 410a of the fluid delivery device 110. In one embodiment, the flow restrictor 336 extends
through the hydraulic bolus chamber 316 such that the hydraulic bolus chamber 316 is in fluid
communication with the hydraulic basal chamber 314 through the flow restrictor 336 and the
hydraulic basal and bolus chambers 314, 316 are both in fluid communication with the
hydraulic pump chamber 318 through a nonrestrictive fluid passageway 438. In an alternative
embodiment, the fluid passageway 438 is restrictive in order to retard the delivery rate of the
bolus dose rather than having the delivery rate be nearly equal to the rate of movement of the
bolus actuator 322.
[0066]    With continued reference to Fig. 4B, in one embodiment, the flow restrictor 336
includes a guide plug 440. In one embodiment, the guide plug 440 is sealed with the manifold
226 and positions the flow restrictor 336 within the fluid passageway 438. In one embodiment,
the guide plug 440 includes an opening 440a for fluidly coupling the flow restrictor 336 and the
hydraulic bolus chamber 316. The flow restrictor 336 may be secured to the manifold 226 by
an epoxy. In one embodiment, the guide plug 440 and the flow restrictor 336 are comprised of
generally translucent materials such that the flow restrictor 336 may be fixed to the manifold
226 by a UV curable resin after inserting the flow restrictor 336 and the guide plug 440 within
the manifold 226.
[0067]    When the fluid delivery device 110 is activated, the basal actuator 320 acts on the
hydraulic fluid, increasing the pressure within the hydraulic basal chamber 314. As a result of
this pressure increase, the hydraulic liquid within the hydraulic basal chamber 314 begins to
flow through the flow restrictor 336 into the hydraulic bolus chamber 316. In one embodiment,
the bolus actuator 320 prevents expansion of the hydraulic bolus chamber 316 and the
hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic basal chamber 314 flows through the fluid passageway 438
and into the hydraulic pump chamber 318 where the hydraulic fluid displaces the third
moveable barrier 234 causing the fluid within the fluid reservoir 324 to exit the fluid delivery
device 110 at a sustained basal rate. In one embodiment, the basal rate is predetermined or
preset by the manufacturer. Embodiments of the fluid delivery device 110 may be used to
continuously deliver a fluid over a range of time such as but limited to 1 min, 1 hr, 6 hrs, 12 hrs,
1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, one month, etc. In certain embodiments, the fluid is expelled

                                               - 13
from the fluid delivery device 110 at a basal rate selected from but not limited to: about 0.1 p1
to about 10 p1 per hour, about 10 to about 100 p1 per hour, about 100 p1 per hour to about 1
ml per hour, about 1 ml to about 100 ml per hour, or about 100 ml to about 200 ml per hour. In
one embodiment, the basal rate is approximately 100 units/day which is 42 p1 /hour or 1000
p1 /24 hours. The rate and delivery period selected will depend upon the application at hand,
and those of skill in the art will be able to determine the proper dosage rate for a given
application.
[0068]      Referring to Fig. 3, embodiments of the fluid delivery device 110 may be connected
to an infusion set or needle 312 through a connection point at the distal end 324a of the fluid
reservoir 324. In alternative embodiments, the needle 312 may be located on the side wall of
fluid reservoir 324. The needle 312 may be substituted with any delivery device such as a
lumen, a needle set, a catheter-cannula set or a microneedle or microneedle array attached by
means of one or more lumens.
[0069]      In one embodiment, basal flow rate is preset at the time of manufacture based on the
selection of the flow restrictor 336 in combination with the viscosity of the hydraulic fluid and
the force supplied on the hydraulic basal chamber 314. Alternatively, the length and/or
diameter of the flow restrictor 336 can be adjusted on demand to alter the basal flow rate. In
other embodiments, the flow restrictor 336 may be adjustable in size, as by means of an
adjustable iris-type aperture or telescoping restrictor passage miniature valve or paired gating
slits (not shown). In an alternate embodiment, an electrical motor or piezoelectric device (not
shown) may be used to open or close the aperture, thus affecting the rate at which hydraulic
fluid flows into pump chamber and displaces the third moveable barrier 234.
[0070]     The hydraulic fluid may be any non-compressible, flowable material such as gel or a
collection of miniature solid beads. In one embodiment, the hydraulic fluid is an ultra pure, bio
inert material. In one embodiment the hydraulic fluid is silicon oil. Useful viscosity of the
hydraulic fluid is limited at its upper bound by the size of the flow restrictor 336. At its lower
bound, the hydraulic fluid must be viscous enough that the flow of the hydraulic fluid can
remain highly regulated by the combination of the pressure from the basal actuator 320 and
the size of the flow restrictor 336 under a wide range of environmental conditions, especially in
the presence of low atmospheric pressure and/or high ambient temperature (where viscosity
tends to decrease).
[0071]     As used herein, "high viscosity" means the working hydraulic fluid has a viscosity

                                                  - 14
grade of at least about ISO VG 20, or at least about ISO VG 32, or at least about ISO VG 50,
or at least about ISO VG 150, or at least about ISO VG 450, or at least about ISO VG 1000, or
at least about ISO VG 1500 or more. In one embodiment the hydraulic fluid is very high
viscosity fluid. As used herein, "very high viscosity" means the working hydraulic fluid has a
viscosity of from about 80,000 to about 180,000 cPs. In one embodiment the hydraulic fluid is
ultra high viscosity fluid (e.g., from about 180,000 to about 200 cPs). In one embodiment, the
hydraulic fluid has a viscosity of 100,000 centiStokes.
[0072]      In one embodiment, since viscosity varies inversely with temperature it is important
to keep the hydraulic fluid at a generally constant temperature. The fluid delivery device 110 is
worn on the user's body for the duration of administration of the fluid. The fluid delivery device
110 may be dimensionally adapted to attach to a user's body via an adhesive patch 542 (see
Fig. 5) as described further below. Accordingly, the fluid delivery device 110 will be exposed to
a range of environmental conditions commensurate with the patient's lifestyle. Without
appropriate control of the variation in temperature of the hydraulic fluid, higher environmental
temperatures may cause a reduction in viscosity, resulting in an increase in fluid flow and lower
environmental temperatures may cause an increase in viscosity, resulting in a decrease in fluid
flow. In one embodiment, the hydraulic fluid is brought to a generally constant temperature
corresponding to the temperature of the user's skin. Thus, in some embodiments, the
configuration of the fluid delivery device 110 reduces the effect of environmental temperature
on the temperature of hydraulic fluid in the device. In one embodiment, because the
temperature of the user's skin is likely higher than the storage temperature of the hydraulic
fluid, the initial fluid delivery rate is ramped up to the sustained basal delivery rate.
[0073]      Referring to Fig. 5, the fluid delivery device 110 may comprise a conductive thermal
couple between the hydraulic fluid in the fluid delivery device and the body of the wearer. The
thermal couple utilizes the consistent temperature of the body to regulate or moderate the
temperature of the hydraulic fluid which might otherwise be subject to wide variation as a result
of environmental temperature changes. This modulation reduces variation in the viscosity of
the hydraulic fluid, thereby reducing undesired variation in the flow or delivery of the fluid
caused by changes in ambient temperature.
[0074]      In one embodiment, a thermally conductive path is provided between a hydraulic
basal chamber 314 and the skin. The fluid delivery device may have an attachment surface
542a having a first thermal conductance configured to engage with a skin surface 544. In one
embodiment, the manifold 226 housing the hydraulic basal chamber 314 has an outer wall

                                               -15
226a. In one embodiment, the outer wall 226a has a portion 226b proximate the attachment
surface 542a having a second thermal conductance; the second thermal conductance being
greater than the first thermal conductance of the attachment surface 542a. The portion 226b of
the manifold proximate the attachment surface 542a may be in direct contact with the skin
surface 544 to allow for the hydraulic fluid within the hydraulic basal chamber to be kept at a
substantially constant temperature corresponding to the temperature of the skin surface 544.
In one embodiment, the attachment surface 542a is integral with an outer housing 546. In one
embodiment, the attachment surface 542a is integral with a base 548 that is attached to the
housing 546 (see Fig. 2). As used herein, the base 548 may be considered to be part of the
housing 546.
[0075]      In another embodiment, thermal insulation is provided around the remaining surfaces
of the hydraulic basal chamber 314 that are exposed, directly or indirectly such as through the
housing 546 to the outside environment. The thermal insulation may be any thermally
conductive material and or an air space as shown. In a preferred embodiment, a thermally
conductive path is coupled with thermal insulation against the outside environment (Fig. 5). In
order to optimize the conductive coupling between the skin surface 544 body and the hydraulic
fluid, the hydraulic basal chamber 314 may be positioned in direct contact with the body of the
wearer. The fluid delivery device 110 may also be worn on the belly of the user and covered
with clothing to help further reduce the impact of changes in the ambient temperature.
[0076]     As shown in Fig. 5, the portion 226b of the manifold 226 housing the hydraulic basal
chamber 314 may be proud of the surrounding surface of the base 548. In one embodiment,
the portion 226b of the manifold 226 extending from the base 548 is generally tangent with
attachment surface 542a of the adhesive patch 542 such the entire bottom surface 110b of the
fluid delivery device 110 is substantially planar. If present, the adhesive patch or pad 542 that
affixes the fluid delivery device 110 to the skin surface 544 is preferably relieved in this area,
relief area 542a to further assure contact between the outer reservoir wall and the skin (see
also Fig. 2). The adhesive patch 542 may partially extend below or over the manifold 226 to
prevent the side of the manifold from extending through relief area 542a upon movement of
adhesive patch extending outwardly from the fluid delivery device 110. In one embodiment, the
outer wall of the manifold 226 may be thinned (as shown) or the housing or other materials
may be relieved in the area which contacts the skin surface 544 proximate the hydraulic basal
chamber 314 in order to reduce the mass of material separating the hydraulic fluid and the
user to increase the thermal couple between the body and the hydraulic fluid.

                                                 - 16
[0077]     In order to further reduce the influence of the outside environmental temperature on
the temperature of the hydraulic fluid, one or more additional features may be incorporated into
the device to insulate and isolate the hydraulic fluid from the outside environment. The
hydraulic basal chamber 314 can be a separate or isolated component from the remainder of
the manifold (not shown). In one embodiment, the manifold 226 and the housing 546 may be
separated by an open air gap in the areas that face toward the outside environment. To further
isolate the hydraulic liquid, the air gap between the hydraulic basal chamber and the housing
546 can be divided into separate air pockets to further decouple or insulate the air within this
gap. In one embodiment, the fluid reservoir 324 is thermally isolated from the skin surface 544.
In one embodiment, the air gap within the housing 546 substantially surrounds the fluid
reservoir 324 to keep the fluid at a cooler temperature than the skin surface 544.
[0078]     In one embodiment, one or more of the above configurations permits the fluid
delivery device 110 to operate within a temperature range of 40'F (50C) to 104'F (400C). In the
absence of a thermal coupling and if the hydraulic liquid were exposed to this full temperature
range during operation, the amount of resulting flow variation as a result of the change in the
viscosity of the hydraulic liquid (typically on the order of a 1% shift in viscosity per a 1 F shift in
temperature) could introduce too large a variation in the flow of the hydraulic fluid through the
flow restrictor 336 yielding unacceptable drug delivery performance. In one embodiment, the
improved temperature regulation features of the fluid delivery device 110 result in less than a
1% shift in viscosity per a 1F shift in ambient temperature. For example, the features may
result in a change of about 0.15%, 0.10% or 0.05% shift in viscosity per 1F shift in
temperature. In one embodiment, only an approximate 6'F difference exists between the skin
surface 544 and the hydraulic liquid at the low temperature limit and little to no difference exists
between the two measurements at the high temperature limit. As a result of this efficient couple
between the skin surface 544 and the hydraulic liquid, a change in temperature of less than
10'F may be observed in the hydraulic liquid over a 65'F change in ambient (environmental)
temperature.
[0079]     Referring to Figs. 6A-6C, in one embodiment, the basal actuator 320 exerts a force
on the hydraulic basal chamber 314 to pressurize the hydraulic fluid. The basal actuator 320
may be any device that applies a force on the hydraulic basal chamber 314 such as, but not
limited to a peristaltic actuator, miniaturized bellows crank, or paired rollers bearing on
hydraulic basal chamber 314, ratchet or stepper motor driven units that compress plates or
other structures bearing on the hydraulic basal chamber 314, electrically driven or piezoelectric
mechanisms, expanding gas volume, thermal energy, or any other device or process capable

                                                - 17
apply a pressure, either directly or indirectly, to the fluid being delivered. In one embodiment,
the basal actuator 320 is open loop such that no electronics are required and the fluid delivery
device 110 may be purely mechanical.
[0080]      In one embodiment, the basal actuator 320 is comprised of one or more biasing
members such as a first biasing member 650 and a second biasing member 652. In one
embodiment, the one first and second biasing members 650, 652 are springs. In one
embodiment, the first and second biasing members 650, 652 are helical compression springs.
The force exerted by a spring in a compressed state at the start of travel is greater than the
force exerted by the spring in a less compressed state toward the end of travel. The resulting
force differential can impact the flow of hydraulic fluid within the fluid delivery device 110 and
thus impact the flow of the fluid being delivered.
[0081]      In one embodiment, the difference in the force exerted by the first and second
biasing members 650, 652 between the initial compressed state and the less compressed
state is reduced, thus reducing the amount of possible variation in the device's ability to
achieve a sustained fluid delivery rate. In one embodiment, the force differential between the
compressed       and  less compressed      state   is minimized    by reducing     the spring  rate
(force/deflection) of the spring. The spring rate may be reduced by increasing the length of the
spring. In one embodiment, in order to keep the fluid deliver device 110 as compact in size as
possible and prevent the basal actuator 320 from having a decreased forced from beginning to
end, multiple, coaxial stacked biasing members are used. In an alternative embodiment, the
second biasing member 652 is coupled to the first biasing member 650 in parallel. However,
overlapping the first and second biasing members 650, 652 further reduces the size of the fluid
delivery device 110. In one embodiment, the cross sectional area of the hydraulic basal
chamber 314 is larger than the cross sectional area of the fluid reservoir 324 to move the third
moveable barrier 234 a greater axial distance than the axial distance traveled by the first
moveable barrier 230 (see e.g. Fig. 4A). Reducing the spring force attenuation that occurs over
the total travel of the spring (stroke) during operation and maintaining a more constant spring
force on the hydraulic fluid produces a more consistent flow of fluid from the device.
[0082]      Referring to Fig. 6A, in one embodiment, the second biasing member 652 is coupled
to the first biasing member 650 in series and at least partially overlaps the first biasing member
650. In one embodiment, the first biasing member 650 is co-axial with the second biasing
member 652. A co-axial arrangement of the first biasing member 650 and the second biasing
member 652 may be preferred over a parallel arrangement. In one embodiment, a proximal

                                              -18
end 650a of the first biasing member 650 is coupled to the housing 546. In one embodiment,
the proximal end 650a abuts against a stop 654 extending from the base 548 (see also Fig. 2).
In one embodiment, a sleeve 656 couples a distal end 650b of the first biasing member with a
proximal end 652a of the second biasing member 652, the sleeve 656 having a length
generally equal to the length of overlap between the first and second biasing members 650,
652. In one embodiment, the sleeve 656 has a body 656a, a first flanged end 656c and a
second flanged end 656b. The first flanged end 656c may extend radially outwardly from the
body 656a of the sleeve 656 to engage the distal end 650b of the first biasing member 650.
The second flanged end 656b of the sleeve 656 may extend radially inwardly from the body
656a of the sleeve 656 to engage a proximal end 652a of the second biasing member 652.
The body 656a of the sleeve 656 may be generally hollow to allow the second biasing member
652 to extend through the sleeve 656 and engage the second fianged end 656b. In one
embodiment, the first and second biasing members 650, 652 have substantially equal spring
rates such that the sleeve 656 "floats" between the first and second biasing members 650, 652
as they both expand. If one biasing member were stronger than the other, the stronger biasing
member may dominate, preventing the other biasing member from expanding and negating the
benefit of the multi-biasing member configuration. In one embodiment, the difference in spring
rate between the first and second biasing members 650, 652 is no greater than approximately
10%. In one embodiment, the difference in spring rate between the first and second biasing
members 650, 652 is no greater than approximately 3%.
[0083]      The basal actuator 320 may include a plunger 658 extending through the first and
second biasing members 650, 652. In one embodiment, the distal end 658a of the plunger 658
has a radially outwardly extending flange 658b. The flange 658b of the plunger 658 may
engage the first moveable barrier 230 and the distal end 652b of the second biasing member
652. A proximal end 658c of the plunger 658 may be releaseably coupled with the stop 654.
The plunger 658 may extend through the stop 654 and be releaseably coupled to the housing
with a pin 660. In one embodiment, the pin 660 extends through the housing 546 and at least
partially through the plunger 658 and abuts against the stop 654 such that the pin 660 prevents
the plunger 658 from extending further into the hydraulic basal chamber 314 due to the force of
the first and second biasing members 650, 652 and can be removed from outside of the
housing 546. In one embodiment, the pin 660 is tapered to facilitate easier removal of the pin
660. The pin 660 may be coupled with a button cover 662 such that removal of the button
cover 662 releases the plunger 658 in one step by the user as described further below. Figs.
6A-6C illustrate the basal actuator 320 in the initial position (Fig. 6A), immediately after
removing the pin 660 to activate or initiate the basal actuator 320 (Fig. 6B) and the basal

                                                -19
actuator 320 in use after a period of delivering the fluid (Fig. 6C).
[0084]     Referring to Fig. 7, in one embodiment the configuration of the first and second
biasing members 650, 652 reduces the drop in force applied to the hydraulic basal chamber
314 due to the expansion of the first and second biasing members 650, 652. For example, a
single compression spring Si compressed to a height of 0.75 inches will apply a force of 5.7
pounds. When this single spring Si extends to a height of 0.935 inches, the force applied drops
to 5.34 pounds. This 6.3% drop in force would result in a proportional drop in hydraulic flow
rate and in turn basal delivery rate of fluid from the fluid delivery device 1 10. To increase the
volume of the fluid displaced by the fluid delivery device 1 10 without increasing the drop in
force, the basal actuator 320 would need to be lengthened proportional to the volume increase
required. In one exemplary embodiment,             a dual overlapped     spring configuration S2
compressed to a height of 0.945 inches will apply a force of 5.7 pounds. When the dual springs
S2  extend to a height of 1.283 inches, the force drops to 5.34 pounds. This 6.3% drop in force
would be proportional to the drop in flow rate; however, unlike the single spring Si the
displacement volume is 83% greater while the length of the spring assembly is only 25%
greater. The dual spring assembly S2 provides an additional 83% increase in spring extension
for a given loss of 0.36 pounds in spring force. This provides additional basal capacity without
increasing losses due to spring extension. Conversely, the dual spring S2 could be used to
deliver an equivalent volume (as compared with a single spring embodiment Si), with far less
losses due to spring extension over an equivalent extension length (approximately a 45%
decrease in the force drop over an equivalent extension length). It is understood that a dual
spring arrangement as shown is but one embodiment, and that three or more springs may also
be utilized.
[0085]     In one embodiment, the basal actuator 320 has less than a 10% drop in force
applied to the hydraulic basal chamber 314 from beginning of delivery to end of delivery. In one
embodiment, the basal actuator 320 has less than an 8% drop in force applied to the hydraulic
basal chamber 314 from beginning of delivery to end of delivery. In one embodiment, the basal
actuator 320 has less than a 6% drop in force applied to the hydraulic basal chamber 314 from
beginning of delivery to end of delivery. In one embodiment, the basal actuator 320 has less
than a 5% drop in force applied to the hydraulic basal chamber 314 from beginning of delivery
to end of delivery. In one embodiment, the basal actuator 320 has less than a 4% drop in force
applied to the hydraulic basal chamber 314 from beginning of delivery to end of delivery. In one
embodiment, the basal actuator 320 has less than a 3% drop in force applied to the hydraulic
basal chamber 314 from beginning of delivery to end of delivery.

                                               - 20
[0086]     In one embodiment, the basal actuator 320 has less than a predetermined drop in
force applied to the hydraulic basal chamber 314 from beginning of delivery to end of delivery
as described above and has a length less than approximately 2 inches. In one embodiment,
the basal actuator 320 has less than a predetermined drop in force applied to the hydraulic
basal chamber 314 from beginning of delivery to end of delivery as described above and has a
length less than approximately 1.5 inches. In one embodiment, the basal actuator 320 has less
than a predetermined drop in force applied to the hydraulic basal chamber 314 from beginning
of delivery to end of delivery as described above and has a length less than approximately 1
inch. In one embodiment, the basal actuator 320 has less than a predetermined drop in force
applied to the hydraulic basal chamber 314 from beginning of delivery to end of delivery as
described above and has a length less than approximately 0.8 inches.
[0087]     Referring to Fig. 4A, in one embodiment, delivery consistency of the fluid is improved
by reducing the amount of variation in force required to displace the third moveable barrier
234. In preferred embodiments, the force required to displace the third moveable barrier 234 is
reduced or controlled by limiting or controlling one or more of the contact area, contact force
and coefficient of friction between the moveable barriers 230, 232, 234 and their chamber walls
and the compressibility of the hydraulic fluid and the first moveable barrier 230.
[0088]     Referring to Fig. 6A, the first moveable barrier 230 may have a thickness t that is the
minimum thickness to create a seal. In one embodiment, the first moveable barrier has a
thickness t of approximately 0.05 inches. In one embodiment, the first moveable barrier 230
has a projection 230a that extends into the distal end 658a of the plunger 658. In one
embodiment, the first moveable barrier 230 includes a rounded outer periphery 230b for
contacting the inside surface of the manifold 226. In one embodiment, the outer periphery
230b of the first moveable barrier 230 is integral with the remainder of the first moveable
barrier 230. In one embodiment, the first moveable barrier 230 is comprised of Bromo- Butyl
Rubber. In one embodiment, the first moveable barrier 230 has a durometer of 40 shore A.
[0089]     Referring to Figs. 8-9B, in one embodiment, the fluid delivery device 110 is capable
of dispensing fluid continuously or near continuously at a basal rate, as well as dispensing a
supplementary amount of fluid or bolus on demand or under patient control. The fluid delivery
device 110 may allow for the user to deliver multiple discrete bolus amounts without the user
having to look at the fluid delivery device 110 or set the bolus amount for delivery under and
through the user's shirt (not shown). Each bolus dose may require two distinct motions to
deliver the bolus dose. In one embodiment, a multiple button sequence to be performed by the

                                                 - 21
user to improve deliberate and correct bolus dosing. In a preferred embodiment, the bolus
delivery is operated by a cyclic (i.e., common, consistent, routine) mechanical system in which
the user executes the same action one or multiple times to achieve one or multiple bolus
doses per cycle.
[0090]      The number of bolus increments as well as the volume or dose per bolus increment
may be preset at the time of manufacture based on the selection of component parameters as
described further below. The fluid delivery device 110 can be preconfigured in a number of
ways (fast/slow basal rate, large/small bolus volume, many/few bolus increments) to facilitate a
variety of therapeutic needs.
[0091]      Referring to Figs. 9A and 9B, in one embodiment, each bolus delivery is individually
and deliberately activated by the user. For example, in one embodiment each bolus delivery
requires multiple (two or more) independent actions by the user, such as button actuations (via
a bolus release button 964 and a bolus button 966), to insure that each bolus increment (dose)
is delivered by deliberate and intentional means and not accidentally, incorrectly, or
inadvertently delivered. The bolus button 966 and bolus release button 964 may be located on
different sides of the fluid delivery device 110. The user may slide his or her finger along a first
side of the fluid delivery device 110 until the bolus release button 964 is depressed and
continue sliding their finger up a second side of the fluid delivery device 110 until the bolus
button 966 is depressed. The user may slide their finger along the sides of the fluid delivery
device 110 in order to find the bolus and bolus release buttons 964, 966 and the direction of
movement of the user's finger or orientation of side of the fluid delivery device 110 and/or the
configuration of the bolus and bolus release buttons 964, 966 help to indicate to the user which
button is being depressed without having to look at the fiuid delivery device 110. In one
embodiment, the bolus button 966 and the bolus release button 964 are on two different sides
of the fluid delivery device 110. In one embodiment, the different sides of the fluid delivery
device 110 have different length to facilitate tactile feedback when administering a bolus dose,
allowing operation without direct line of sight (e.g., operating the fluid delivery device 110 under
one or more articles of clothing). In one embodiment, the bolus button 966 and the bolus
release button 964 are located on the same side of the fluid delivery device 1 10. In addition,
an audible "click" feedback provided by depression of either button 964, 966 may further
facilitate predictable operation. In one embodiment, the bolus and bolus release buttons 964,
966 each have a distinct sound.
[0092]      As illustrated in Figs. 9A and 9B, the bolus release button 964 is depressed (Fig. 9A)

                                                - 22
prior to depressing the bolus button 966 (Fig. 9B). In one embodiment, the bolus release
button 964 enables the bolus actuator 322 for actuation by the bolus button 966 such that the
bolus button 966 cannot be activated absent enablement by the bolus release button 964.
When the user is ready to deliver a bolus dose of fluid, he or she depresses the bolus release
button 964. When depressed, the bolus release button 964 enables the bolus button 966 and
after depressing the bolus button 966 causes the bolus actuator 322 to advance one bolus
increment.
[0093]     In some embodiments, the fluid delivery device 110 delivers a discrete dosage unit
per actuation; the appropriate dosage unit will vary depending on the fiuid to be delivered. In
particular embodiments, for example for delivery of insulin, the fluid delivery device 110
delivers from 1 to 4 units of insulin (e.g., 0.01 to 0.04 mL) per bolus increment (per "click"). In
certain embodiments, the fluid delivery device 110 is capable of delivering 36 bolus units (e.g.,
of insulin) in 2 unit increments, i.e., 36 units delivered over the course of 18 "clicks." At the
same time, the fluid delivery device 110 may delivering an additional amount (e.g., 20, 30, 40,
etc. units) at the basal rate over the entire delivery period. The total fluid capacity of the fluid
delivery device 110 is the sum of the basal and bolus capacities. In some embodiments, the
fluid delivery device 110 has a total fluid capacity of 56, 66 or 76 units. In other embodiments,
the fluid delivery device has a total fiuid capacity of about 1200, 1500, or 2000 units.
[0094]     Referring to Fig. 10A, the bolus actuator 322 may include a position lock or rack
1068 that couples the bolus button 966 and the second moveable barrier 232. In one
embodiment, the rack 1068 engages a housing pawl 1170 (see Figs. 11A and 2) fixed relative
to the manifold 226 that prevents the rack 1068 and second moveable barrier 232 from moving
outwardly toward the bolus button 966. In one embodiment, the bolus button 966 is spring
biased away from the second moveable barrier 232 and includes a pawl 966a that engages
with the rack 1068 to advance the rack 1068 one or more predetermined one way ratchets or
teeth and resets once permitted.
[0095]     Referring to Fig. 10B, the bolus release button 964 may engage with the bolus
button 966 to control when the bolus button 966 is reset. In one embodiment, the bolus release
button 964 includes a projection 964a that engages the bolus button 966 by selectively sliding
through and being positioned within aperture 966b of the bolus button 966 (shown best in Fig.
2). In one embodiment, when the projection 964a of the bolus release button 964 is within the
aperture 966b (as shown in Figs. 10B, 12B and 13B) bolus button 966 on either end of the
aperture 966b abuts against the projection 964a and prevents movement of the bolus button

                                               - 23
966 in either direction. In one embodiment, depressing the bolus button 966 moves the
projection 964a out of the aperture 966b and allows the bolus button 966 to be reset by the
spring bias (as shown in Fig. 1 IB). In one embodiment, the bolus release button 966 is spring
biased such that releasing the bolus release button 966 after depressing the bolus release
button 966 biases the projection 964a against the side of the bolus release button 964
adjacent to the aperture 966b and such that once the aperture aligns with the projection 964a
upon depressing the bolus button 966 the projection 964a immediately mates with the aperture
966b. In one embodiment, the bolus button 966 is spring biased with a torsion spring 1072. In
one embodiment, the same torsion spring 1072 that biases the bolus button 966 spring biases
the bolus release button 964.
[0096]     Figs. 10A-13B depict an exemplary sequence of events in bolus dosing. Figs. 10A
and 1OB depict the position of the bolus button 966 and bolus release button 964 prior to bolus
dosing; the bolus release button 964 is in the enabled position, and the bolus button 966 is
locked in the depressed position. Figs. 11 A-1 IB depict the enabling step; the user depresses
the bolus release button 964 to its stop position, causing the bolus button 966 to move to the
extended position. The bolus button 966 is now enabled for one incremental dose. Figs. 12A
12B illustrate delivery of a bolus dose; the user depresses the bolus button 966 to the stop
position, causing the bolus actuator 322 to advance one increment, displacing the second
moveable barrier 232 and dispensing one bolus dose. The bolus release button 964 is
returned to the enabled position. Figs. 13A-13B illustrate delivery of the last bolus dose of the
device; the user depresses the bolus button 966 to its stop position, causing the bolus actuator
322 to advance one increment, displacing the second moveable barrier 232 and dispensing
the final bolus dose. This activates a lock-out feature of the fluid delivery device 110, causing
the bolus release button 964 to slide through an aperture 1068a (see Fig. 8) in the rack 1068
to the lock-out position. In one embodiment, once the bolus release button 964 extends
outwardly through aperture 1068a, the torsion spring 1072 slides off a ledge 546b of the
housing 546 and extends between the bolus release button 964 and the ledge 546b to retain
the bolus release button 964 in the lock-out position (See Fig. 13B). The bolus release button
964 may be locked in place to prevent subsequent operation and to indicate to the user that all
of the bolus doses have been delivered.
[0097]     In one embodiment, the bolus button 966 remains in the depressed position slightly
proud of (i.e. raised, projecting or extending from) the outer device surface of the housing 546.
As a result of the user's pressing the bolus release button 964, the bolus actuator 322 may
engage one bolus increment as the bolus button 966 extends further from the housing 546.

                                               - 24
When the user then depresses the bolus button 966 back to its original position (i.e., slightly
proud of the housing 546), the bolus actuator 322 advances the second moveable barrier 232
a fixed amount or increment. The resulting movement of the second moveable barrier 232
displaces the hydraulic fluid and in turn displaces the third movable barrier 234 by essentially
the same volume increment, dispensing a bolus dose of fluid from the fluid delivery device 110.
[0098]     The second moveable barrier 232 may be capable of maintaining a seal as it
translates within the hydraulic bolus chamber 316. In one embodiment, the second moveable
barrier 232 is displaced by the rack 1068 by the distance equal to one ratchet spacing at a time
per activation of the bolus button 966.
[0099]     Referring to Fig. 14, in one embodiment, the fluid reservoir 324 initially is filled with a
quantity of the fluid to be delivered to the user. In another embodiment, the fluid reservoir 324
may be filled by the user prior to use. In one embodiment, the fluid cartridge 228 of the fluid
reservoir 324 is comprised of a rigid material. In one embodiment, the fluid cartridge 228 is
comprised of Topas 6017 S-04. In some embodiments, the fluid cartridge 228 may be
comprised of a polymer due to the reduce length of time of exposure of the fluid to the fluid
cartridge 228 (for example, 24 hours after the user fills the fluid cartridge 228 and uses it)
where previous fluid cartridges had to be comprised of a glass or other material having lower
leachable and extractible properties for storage of the fluid over an extended period of time.
Additionally, because known delivery devices include electronics, such devices are not
practical for one day disposable use as is a purely mechanical device as disclosed in certain
embodiments of the fluid delivery device 110 herein.
[00100]    In the case of a medicament, the quantity of fluid may be pre-determined by a
medical professional in order to provide the necessary dosing over a pre-determined period of
time. The volume of the fluid reservoir 324 may be about 100 p1, 500 p1, 1 ml, 3 ml, 5 ml, 10
ml, 30 ml, 50 ml, 100 ml or more. The fluid cartridge 228 may include a septum 1474 within the
distal end of the fluid cartridge 228. In one embodiment, the septum 1474 acts as a stopper. In
other embodiments, the septum 1474 may be at least portion of the sidewall (not shown). In
one embodiment, the fluid cartridge 228 includes a spacer 1476 on the hydraulic fluid side of
the third moveable barrier 234 such that the size of the fluid cartridge 228 may adapt to a
range of fluid volumes by varying the size of the spacer 1476. In one embodiment, the space
1476 may be brightly colored to help indicate the level of fluid within the fluid cartridge 228.
The fluid cartridge 228 may include a seal 1478 that has an opening 1478a (see Fig. 2) such
that the seal 1478 seals the fluid cartridge 228 to the manifold 226 while allowing the hydraulic

                                                - 25
fluid to pass through to either the spacer 1476 and/or the third moveable barrier 234.
[00101]    In one embodiment, the septum 1474 is composed of a flexible material such as
rubber and fits within fluid cartridge 228, forming a seal on the end opposite the third moveable
barrier 234. The septum 1474 may be a hollow cylinder open only at the end that is installed in
the fluid cartridge 228. The septum may remain stationary and is positioned to align with the
needle 312. When the needle 312 pierces the side the septum 1474, the fluid path between
the fluid delivery device 110 and the outside environment is opened, allowing the fiuid to flow
from the fiuid delivery device 110. In one embodiment, the septum 1474 is exposed through a
side of the housing 546 to allow for the user to fill the fluid reservoir 324. The septum 1474
may have a hardness sufficient to allow the needle 312 to move relative to the remainder of the
fluid delivery device 110 as described in further detail below. In one embodiment, the septum
1474 has a hardness of 50 shore A.
[00102]    Referring to Fig. 15, the third moveable barrier 234 may be a plunger that slides
within the fluid cartridge 228. Typically, pistons may have imprecise sizing and compressibility
characteristics because the impact on the delivery rate is not critical. In one embodiment, the
third moveable barrier 234 of the fluid delivery device 110 however, is configured to minimize
any impact on the fluid delivery rate. In one embodiment, the third moveable barrier 234 is
comprised of a flexible material to form a seal between the hydraulic fluid and the fluid to be
delivered to the user. In one embodiment, the third moveable barrier 234 has a similar
configuration to the second moveable barrier 232. In one embodiment, the axial compressibility
is minimized. In one embodiment, the axial compressibility of the second and third moveable
barriers 232, 234 may be greater than the axial compressibility of the first moveable barrier
230 due to the lower pressure differentials acting on the second and third moveable barriers
232, 234. In such an embodiment, the lower axial compressibility allows for a thickness or
length L that is greater than the thickness t of the first moveable barrier 230 and allows two
points of contact. In one embodiment, the third moveable barrier 234 is comprised of a single
material having a durometer between approximately 35 and approximately 65 shore A. In one
embodiment, the durometer of the third moveable barrier 234 is between approximately 35 and
approximately 65 shore A for a fluid cartridge 228 comprised of a polymer. In another
embodiment, the durometer of the third moveable barrier 234 is between approximately 35 and
approximately 45 shore A for a fluid cartridge 228 comprised of glass. In one embodiment, the
durometer of the third moveable barrier 234 is 55 shore A with a fluid cartridge 228 comprised
of a polymer. In one embodiment, the third moveable barrier 234 is comprised of Butyl Rubber.
In one embodiment, the third moveable barrier 234 is coated with 0.0001 inch parylene C. In

                                                 - 26
one embodiment, the third moveable barrier 234 has a minor diameter of approximately 0.2425
inches and a major diameter of approximately 0.2615 inches  0.002 inches.
[00103]     In one embodiment, the third moveable barrier 234 includes a body 234a having a
first end 234b and a second end 234c. The third moveable barrier 234 may include a first
flange 234d and a second flange 234e. In one embodiment, the first and second flanges 234d,
234e are integral with the body 234a and extend radially outwardly from the body 234a
proximate the first end and second ends 234b, 234c respectively, in an uncompressed state.
The first and second flanges 234d, 234e may be configured such that contact with the fluid
cartridge 228 is minimized. Having the first and second flanges 234d, 234e be integral with the
body 234a may prevent roll over and flash points that occur with the use of separate o-rings. In
one embodiment, the first and second flanges 234d, 234e have a curved cross sectional
periphery in the uncompressed state. In one embodiment, the curve has a substantially
constant radius r in the uncompressed state. In one embodiment, the first and second flanges
234d, 234e are spaced from the first and second ends 234b, 234c respectively in order to
provide proper support for the first and second flanges 234d, 234e.
[00104]     In one embodiment, control of the contact area of third moveable barrier 234 to the
inner wall of the fiuid cartridge 228 is addressed by the structural design of the first and second
flanges 234d, 234e. In one embodiment, the first and second flanges 234d, 234e have a
circular side cross sectional profile. In this embodiment a circular profile on the outer surface of
a plunger constructed of an elastomeric material presents a small contact area that can be
deformed with a minimal change in force. Though individual pistons and cylinders vary in size
due to manufacturing tolerances, the contact area variation is reduced by the configurations
disclosed herein. Providing two flanges provides redundant sealing to insure the isolation of
the fluid from the hydraulic fluid.
[00105]     In additional embodiments, the coefficient of friction between the third moveable
barrier 234 and the fluid reservoir 324 is controlled by appropriate selection of contact
materials. In this embodiment, one or more suitable coating agents are applied to the outer
surface of the third moveable barrier 234 and/or the inner surface of the fluid reservoir 324 to
minimize both the coefficient of friction and the variation of the coefficient of friction from device
to device. In addition, a coating process using Parylene 'C material may be used. A film coating
with Parylene 'C material greater than about 0.0001 inch (2.5 microns) has proven to
contribute to controlling the movement of the third moveable barrier 234. The Parylene coating
is preferably conformal and of uniform thickness and is substantially free of any voids or

                                                - 27
pinholes. Parylene may be applied at the molecular level by a vacuum deposition process at
ambient temperature. Film coatings from about 0.100 to 76 microns are possible in a single
operation. In one embodiment, no catalysts or solvents are required, and no foreign
substances are introduced that could degrade the coated surface. Parylene 'C is a modified
version of Parylene which may provide a better combination of electrical and physical
properties including low moisture and gas permeability.
[00106]     Referring to Figs. 16A-16C, in one embodiment, the fluid delivery device 110 has
multiple operable states. In a first operable state or storage position (Fig. 16A), the needle 312
is not engaged or is separated from the fluid reservoir 324 and does not extend from the
housing 546 (i.e. not inserted into the body). In a second operable state or engageable position
(Fig. 16B), the needle 312 is able to be engaged with the fluid reservoir 324. In a third operable
state or engaged or activated position (Fig. 16C), the needle 312 is in fluid communication with
the fluid to be delivered and is inserted into the body or available for insertion into the body. In
a fourth operable state or disengaged or disposable position (not shown), the needle 312 is
again separated from the fluid to be delivered, is not inserted into the body, and is fixedly
retained (locked) within the housing 546.
[00107]     In one embodiment, the button cover 662 shrouds the needle 312 preventing
accidental depression of the needle 312 during handling and shipping of the fluid delivery
device 110. In one embodiment, the button cover 662 includes a flange 662a to facilitate
grasping and removing the button cover 662 by the user. In one embodiment, the button cover
662 has a projection 662b for coupling with the pin 660. The button cover 662 may include
indicia 662c such as the word "Remove" to indicate what the user should do with the button
cover 662 (See Fig. 2). In one embodiment, the button cover 662 includes a tab 662d for
providing leverage against the housing 546 as the button cover 662 is removed by holding the
flange 662a on the opposite side of the button cover 662. In one embodiment, when the button
cover 662 is removed, a needle button 1680 coupled to the needle 312 is exposed (Fig. 16B).
[00108]     In one embodiment, the needle 312 is fixed to the needle button 1680. In one
embodiment, the needle 312 is heat staked to the needle button 1680 at points 1680a as
shown in Fig. 19. In other embodiments, the needle 312 is moveable relative to the needle
button 1680. In one embodiment, removal of the button cover 662 simultaneously removes the
pin 660 from the basal actuator 320 to release or activate the basal actuator 320 such that it
acts on the hydraulic fluid. Thus, in preferred embodiments, the button cover 662 performs the
dual functions of shrouding and protecting the needle button 1680 to prevent unintentional

                                               - 28
activation of the needle 312 and simultaneously controls activation of the basal actuator 320.
[00109]    Referring to Figs. 17 and 18, in one embodiment, the needle button 1680 deploys
the needle 312 when depressed (Fig. 18). The needle button 1680 may be spring biased away
from the septum 1474. In one embodiment, the needle button 1680 is spring biased by a
compression spring 1784 as described further below. A first force may be required to move the
needle button 1680 from the initial position. In one embodiment, the first force is greater than a
second force that is required to move the needle button 1680 the remainder of way (i.e. at
least greater than the force from the spring 1784) to the engaged position to help users
overcome the fear of depressing the needle 312 into the skin surface 544. In one embodiment,
one or more breakable tabs 1682 extend from the housing 546 such that the tabs 1682 break
upon providing the first force in the first direction d such that the user completes the
deployment or insertion of the needle 312 quickly and fully after the tabs 1682 release the
needle button 1680 and helps to prevent failed or partial insertion or engagement attempts. In
the deployable position, the needle 312 may be moveable nearly exclusively in the
engagement direction (i.e. toward the septum 1474) such that the needle 312 enters the
septum and the user with little to no movement in the transverse direction to help ensure
proper engagement. Once the needle 312 is in the engaged position, the needle 312 may then
move relative to the remainder of the fluid delivery device 110 to reduce pain caused by
movement of the needle 312 relative to the user as described below. In one embodiment, the
needle 312 is flexible and restraining movement of the needle 312 during engagement aids in
proper engagement of the needle 312.
[00110]    In one embodiment, the needle 312 extends from the fluid reservoir 324, through the
pierceable member or septum 1474 at a connection point 1474a and out of the housing 546.
The needle 312 may be moveable relative to the septum 1474 or the fluid delivery device 110
may move relative to the needle 312 such that when the needle 312 extends into the skin
surface 544 in the engaged position, movement of the needle 312 relative to the user caused
by movement of the fluid delivery device 110 is reduced. Minimizing the movement of the
needle 312 relative to the user may help to reduce pain or "pinching" caused by the needle
312.
[00111]    In one embodiment, the needle 312 is configured to translate in a direction
perpendicular to the septum 1474, e.g. direction d in Fig. 18, and pivot about the connection
point 1474a in all directions. In one embodiment, the pivot of the needle 312 about the
connection point 1474a is within the boundaries of an imaginary hour glass shaped path (not

                                              - 29
shown) proximate the septum 1474. In one embodiment, the entire needle 312 is configured to
pivot about the connection point 1474a due to the flexibility of the septum 1474 and is limited
by the connection between the needle button 1680 and the housing 546. In one embodiment,
the needle 312 is configured to be entirely within or at least shrouded by the housing 546 and
disengaged from the fluid reservoir 324 in an initial position (Fig. 17) and fluidly coupled with
the fluid reservoir 324 and extending from the housing 546 in an engaged position (Fig. 18). In
one embodiment, the needle 312 is configured to pierce the pierceable member 1474 after
extending from the housing 546 when moving the needle 312 from the initial position to the
engaged position such that the fluid does not exit onto the skin surface 544 and interfere with
the adhesion of the adhesive patch 542. In one embodiment, the needle 312 is configured
such that the needle 312 pierces the skin surface 544 approximately simultaneously to when
the needle 312 pierces the pierceable member 1474.
[00112]    In one embodiment, the needle 312 is generally J-shaped such that its two ends are
pointing in the same direction but are axially and laterally spaced from one another. In one
embodiment, the needle 312 includes two generally perpendicular bends with one end of the
needle 312 being shorter than the other. In one embodiment, the septum 1474, or at least a
surface tangent to the connection point 1474a, is generally parallel to a bottom surface 110b of
the housing from which the needle 312 extends in the engaged position. In one embodiment,
the needle 312 is a microneedle. In one embodiment, the needle 312 is a fine gauge needle. In
one embodiment, the needle 312 is a 30 gauge needle. In one embodiment, both ends of the
needle 312 are beveled to help facilitate piercing of the septum 1474 and the skin surface 544.
In one embodiment, the needle 312 is configured to rotate about an imaginary axis A that
extends through the connection point 1474a perpendicular to the septum 1474 as shown in
Fig. 18 such that the fluid delivery device may rotate about the axis A without, or at least
reduces, the end of the needle 312 extending into the user moving in an arched path.
[00113]    In one embodiment, once the needle 312 is in the engaged position the needle
button 1680 is locked into place and the fluid in the fluid reservoir is in liquid communication
with the outside environment (e.g., the body) via the needle 312. The locking member 2088
may be configured to keep the first and second ends of the needle 312 disengaged from the
user and the fluid reservoir 324 and contained within the housing 546 in a locked position upon
moving the needle from the engaged position (Fig. 18) to the locked position (Fig. 23). In the
locked position, the needle 312 may be kept from redeployment or engagement such that the
housing 546 acts as its own sharps container. In one embodiment, the needle 312 is moved to
the locked position through use of a needle release or lock button 1886.

                                               - 30
[00114]    Referring to Fig. 20, in certain embodiments, the spring 1784 is located between the
needle button 1680 and the base 548 and surrounds a boss or sleeve 1680a of the needle
button 1680 extending partially over the needle 312. In one embodiment, the spring 1784
becomes compressed when needle button 1680 is locked in the depressed, engaged or
inserted position (Fig. 18) to bias the needle button 1680 away from the septum 1474. The
needle button 1680 may be retained in the inserted position by a locking member as described
further below. The locking member 2088 may be released when the user is finished with the
fluid delivery device 110. In one embodiment, prior to removing the fluid delivery device 110
from the body, the user activates the lock button 1886 to retract the needle 312 from the user
and into the housing 546. In other embodiments, the needle 312 is automatically retracted after
the fluid reservoir 324 is substantially empty or automatically upon removal of the fluid delivery
device 110 from the skin surface 544.
[00115]    In one embodiment, the locking member 2088 is a spring. In one embodiment, the
locking member 2088 is comprised of a helical torsion spring. In one embodiment, the locking
member 2088 biases the lock button 1886 and interacts with features of the needle button
1680 and the base 548 to releaseably retain the needle 312 in the depressed or inserted
position (Fig. 18) and unrealeaseably locked in the lock-out position (Fig. 22).
[00116]    In one embodiment, the locking member 2088 is coupled to or engageable with the
lock button 1886. In one embodiment, the lock button 1886 has a surface 1886a exposed
through the housing 546. In one embodiment, the surface 1886a of the lock button 1886 is
exposed through an aperture in the housing 546 on a first side of the housing 546 and the
housing 546 has a surface on a second side of the housing 546 opposed to the first side of the
housing and generally aligned with the lock button 1886 such that the user can grip the lock
button 1886 and the housing 546 between a thumb and a finger to activate the lock button
1886 within engaging the bolus release button 964 preventing accidental activation of the lock
button 1886 when using the bolus actuator 322. The lock button 1886 may include at last one
projection 1886b extending from the surface to help facilitate grip with the user's hand. In one
embodiment, the at least one projection 1886b is ramped (see Fig. 23 A) to further facilitate
grip and help indicate to the user by feel which direction the lock button 1886 should be urged.
[00117]    Referring to Fig. 20, in one embodiment, the sleeve 1680a surrounds the needle 312
and the locking member 2088 is spring biased toward the sleeve 1680a. In one embodiment,
the sleeve 1680a has at least one abutment surface configured to engage with the locking
member 2088 to prevent at least one of engaging and disengaging the needle 312. In one

                                             - 31
embodiment, the at least one abutment surface includes a first abutment surface 1680b and a
second abutment surface 1680b.
[00118]    In one embodiment, the first abutment surface 1680b is axially spaced along the
needle 312 from the second abutment surface 1680c. In one embodiment, the first abutment
surface 1680b is a radially inwardly extending groove. In one embodiment, the second
abutment surface 1680c is the distal end of the sleeve 1680. In other embodiments, the first
and second abutment surfaces 1680b, 1680c are any surface such as a projection or groove
that axially engages with the locking member 2088. In one embodiment, the base 548 includes
an upwardly extending boss or guide 2090 for receiving and guiding the sleeve 1680a and
engaging with the locking member 2088. In one embodiment, the guide 2090 loosely fits over
the sleeve 1680a to allow some non-axial movement or pivot of the needle button 1680 relative
to the base 2090 for the pivoting of the needle 312 as described above. The guide 2090 may
include a groove 2090a configured to receive the locking member 2088. In one embodiment,
the groove 2090a aligns with the first abutment surface 1680a in the engaged position (Fig. 18)
and aligns with the second abutment surface 1680b in the locked-out position (Fig. 22). In one
embodiment, the locking member 2088 engages with the first abutment surface 1680b to
releaseably retain the needle 312 in the engaged position (Fig. 18) and locking member 2088
engages with the second abutment surface 1680c to unreleaseably retain the needle 312 in
the locked position (Fig. 22). In one embodiment, the lock button 1886 is configured to position
the locking member 2088 into the locked position upon disengaging the needle 312 from the
user.
[00119]    Referring to Fig. 20, in one embodiment, the locking member 2088 is configured to
provide an audible feedback upon retaining the needle 312 in the engaged position so the user
is assured that the needle 312 has been fully deployed and in the engaged position. In one
embodiment, the guide 2090 includes a projection 2090b that facilitates creating an audible
"click" by sliding the locking member 2088 over and into the groove 2090a and first abutment
surface 1680a. In one embodiment, the projection 2090b is a ramped surface 1886c that is
selectably engageable with the locking member 2088. In one embodiment, the locking member
2088 is biased against the guide 2090 above the groove 2090a (see Fig. 21) and depressing
the needle button 1680 engages a surface 1680d with the locking member 2088 and slides the
locking member 2088 down the guide 2090 over the projection 2090b and into the aligned
groove 2090a and first abutment surface 1680a. In one embodiment, the needle button 1680
includes a cutout 1680e to fit over the septum 1474. In one embodiment, the cutout 1680e is
loosely sized to the contour of the septum 1474 to support the needle 312 relative to the

                                               - 32
housing 546 but allows for the movement of the needle 312 described above.
[00120]    In one embodiment, when the user depresses the needle button 1680, a free end or
first arm 2088a of the locking member 2088 is moved from its initial preloaded position against
the guide 2090 and into the aligned groove 2090a and first abutment surface 1680a. When the
lock button 1886 is depressed the ramped surface 1886c may force the first arm 2088a of the
locking member 2088 from the first abutment surface 1680a momentarily, allowing needle
button 1680 to retract to the upright or initial position as a result of the force from the spring
1784. As the user continues to press the lock button 1886, the end of the first arm 2088a may
abut a surface within the housing 546, preventing further rotation (similar to the position shown
in Fig. 21). The mid section of the first arm may then deflect over the ramped surface 1886c of
the lock button 1886 allowing the first arm 2088a to spring back into the groove 2090a (Fig.
22). The second abutment surface 1680c of the needle button 1680 may then be axially above
the first arm 2088a extending across the guide 2090 preventing the needle button 1680 and
needle 312 from further translation or re-depression/re-deployment (Fig. 22).
[00121]    Referring to Figs. 23A-23C, in one embodiment, the lock button 1886 is configured to
release the locking member 2088 only after completing two distinct motions to prevent
accidental release of the locking member 2088. In one embodiment, the lock button 1886 is
configured to move in a first direction Ii and move in a second direction    12 only after moving a
predetermined distance in the first direction. In one embodiment, the lock button 1886 includes
at least one projection 1886d and the housing or base 548 includes at least one slot 548a each
configured to receive one of the at least one projection 1886d. In one embodiment, each at
least one slot 548a is unaligned with one of the at least one projection 1886d in an initial
position (Fig. 23 A) and aligned with one of the at least one projection 1886d after moving the
lock button 1886 the predetermined distance in the first direction Ii (Fig. 23B) and each at least
one slot 548a receiving one of the at least one projection 1886d after moving the lock button
1886 a predetermined distance in the second direction       12. In one embodiment, the first and
second directions Ii and    12 are linear translations. In one embodiment, the first direction is
perpendicular to the second direction as shown in Figs. 23A-23C. In other embodiments, the
first and second directions are any directions such as curved and/or rotational. In one
embodiment, the lock button 1886 is spring biased in a direction opposite the first direction. In
one embodiment, the lock button 1886 is retained in the first direction by one or more
breakaway tabs (not shown). In other embodiments, the lock button 1886 is comprised of more
than one button.

                                                   - 33
[00122]      Referring to Fig. 2, in some embodiments, the fluid delivery device 110 may include
one or more view windows. View windows can be, for example, on the top side and/or the
bottom side of the fluid delivery device 110. These view windows allow light penetration to
facilitate point of care filling of the fluid reservoir 324, to increase viewability to determine level
and viability of fluid, and to enhance user confidence by allowing observation by allowing the
user to observe the relative position of the third moveable barrier 234 during delivery and/or
filling. In one embodiment, the housing 546 includes a window 546a generally aligned with the
fluid cartridge 228. In one embodiment, the adhesive patch 542 includes a window 542b. The
window 542b may be a translucent area or simply a gap in the material. In one embodiment,
the windows 542a and 542b are generally aligned. In one embodiment, the remainder of the
exposed housing 546 is opaque such that only the fluid cartridge 228 is visible through the
housing 546.
[00123]      In some embodiments, the fluid delivery device 110 includes an adhesive to facilitate
attachment of the fluid delivery device 110 to the skin surface 544 of the user (see e.g. Fig.
9A). The adhesive strength should preferably be sufficient to adhere the fluid delivery device
110 to the skin surface 544 of the user for the duration of treatment with the drug-filled fluid
delivery device 110. Thus, adhesive strength may vary depending on the duration of treatment
(e.g., 72 hours, 48 hours, 24 hours, 18 hours, 12 hours, etc.). Moreover, the adhesive should
be such that the fluid delivery device 110 is easily removable without undue discomfort or pain
or difficulty upon completion of use. In some embodiments, the adhesive may be relieved in
certain areas, e.g., in the area of the hydraulic basal chamber 314 (see e.g. area 542a in Fig.
2), the fluid reservoir 324 (see e.g. area 542b in Fig. 2) and/or proximate the needle 312 (see
e.g. area 542c in Fig. 2), to facilitate contact of the fluid delivery device 110 with the skin
surface 544 of the user.
[00124]      The adhesive may be combined with a pad to form an adhesive patch 542. In one
embodiment, the adhesive patch 542 is a non-woven foam pad. In one embodiment, the
adhesive patch 542 is comprised of a medical foam adhesive manufactured by 3M@. In one
embodiment, the adhesive patch 542 is comprised of 3M@ 9776 material. In one embodiment,
the outer dimension of the adhesive patch 542 extends beyond the outer dimensions of the
housing 546 to allow greater adhesive surface area and/or greater flexibility of the adhesive
patch 546 to contour to the user's body shape. In certain embodiments, extended area is, for
example, about 0.010 inches, 0.100 inches, 0.250 inches, 0.500 inches or more from the
housing 546. The adhesive patch 542 may be capable of movement (e.g. flexing, stretching) in
multiple orientations to improve comfort of wear and reduce pinching or tightness or the

                                                 - 34
wearer's perception of pinching or tightness. In one embodiment, the adhesive is initially
covered by a removable film 292 (see Fig. 2). In one embodiment, the film 292 includes a tab
292a extending outwardly from the adhesive patch 542 to facilitate removal from the adhesive
patch 542 just prior to applying the fluid delivery device 110 to the skin surface 544.
[00125]     Referring to Figs. 16A-16B, in exemplary use, the user removes the fluid delivery
device 110 from a storage package (not shown). The user may then fill the fluid cartridge 228
with the fluid. In one embodiment, the fluid cartridge 228 is pre-filled. Once the fluid cartridge
228 is filled, the user may remove the button cover 662 exposing the needle button 1680 and
simultaneously activating the basal actuator 320. Referring to Fig. 9A, the user may then
remove the film 292 from the adhesive patch 542 and place the fluid delivery device 110 on the
skin surface 544. In other embodiments, the fluid delivery device 110 is placed on the skin
surface 544 before removing the button cover 662. Once the fluid delivery device 110 is on the
skin surface 544 and the button cover 662 is removed, the user may then depress the needle
button 1680 to engage the needle 312 (see Fig. 18) and fluidly couple the user and the fluid
reservoir 324. Once the needle 312 is engaged and when appropriate, the user may then
activate the bolus release button 964 (Fig. 9A) and then activate the bolus button 966 (Fig. 9B)
to deliver a bolus dosage. Once the delivery period (e.g. 24 hours) is complete or the user
otherwise wants to remove the fluid delivery device 110, the user depresses the lock button
1886 (see Figs. 23 A-23C) to retract the needle 312 into the housing 546 (Fig. 22). Once the
needle 312 is shrouded by the housing 546, the user may then remove the fluid delivery device
110 from the skin surface 544, dispose the fluid delivery device 110 and repeat the above
steps to install a fresh fluid delivery device 110.
