                                           ABSTRACT
        The present invention relates to dimeric proteins comprising amino acids at three
different positions which are different from those present in a human IgG1. Six of said dimeric
proteins are capable of forming a hexameric structure in solution.

DIMERIC PROTEIN WITH TRIPLE MUTATIONS
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        The present invention relates to dimeric proteins, e.g. antibodies, comprising at least
three mutations as compared to a parent dimeric protein. More particularly, the present
invention relates to such dimeric proteins which are capable of forming oligomeric, e.g
hexameric structures in solution. The present invention also relates to uses of such dimeric
proteins and compositions comprising such dimeric proteins.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        The effector functions mediated by the Fc region of an antibody allow for the
destruction of foreign entities, such as the killing of pathogens and the clearance and
degradation     of antigens. Antibody-dependent       cell-mediated    cytotoxicity (ADCC)  and
antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) is initiated by binding of the Fc region
to Fc receptor (FcR)-bearing cells, whereas complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)           is
initiated by binding of the Fc region to C1q, which initiates the classical route of complement
activation.
         Each IgG antibody contains two binding sites for C1q, one in each heavy chain constant
(Fc) region. A single molecule of IgG in solution, however, does not activate complement as
the affinity of monomeric IgG for Clq is quite weak (Kd ~10-4 M) (Sledge et al., 1973 J. Biol.
Chem. 248,2818-13; Hughes-Jones et al., 1979 Mol. Immunol. 16,697-701). Antigen-driven
association of IgG can lead to much tighter binding of the multivalent C1q molecule (Kd ~10
8 M) and complement activation (Burton et al., 1990 Mol. Immunol. 22, 161-206). In contrast,
IgM exists naturally in covalently bound penta- or hexamers, and upon binding of cellular
expressed or immobilized antigen IgM pentamers and hexamers can efficiently elicit CDC.
Antigen-binding is a requirement to induce a conformational change in IgM to expose the Clq
binding sites (Feinstein et al., 1986, Immunology Today, 169-174).
         It has been suggested that also IgG can achieve complement activation by the
formation of hexameric ring structures, through interaction of the CH2/CH3 domains of the
Fc region (Burton et al., 1990 Trends in Biochem. Sci. 15, 64-69). Evidence supporting the
existence of such hexameric IgG structures has been found in two dimensional (Reidler et al.,
1986 I Handbook of Experimental Immunology           4 th edit. (Weir, D. M. ed.), ppl7.1-17.5.
Blackwell, Edinburgh; Pinteric et al., 1971 Immunochem. 8, 1041-5) and three dimensional
crystals, as well as for IgG1, IgG2a and IgG4 and human Fc in solution (Kuznetsov et al.,
2000 J Struct. Biol. 131, 108-115). A hexameric ring formation was also observed in the
crystal structure of the b12 human IgG1K antibody directed against HIV-1 gp120 (1HZH in
PDB) (Saphire et al., Science 2001 Aug 10;293(5532),1155-9). In the b12 hexamer ring, six
                                                    1

accessible C1q binding sites were presented at the hexamer surface, one from each of the six
antibodies, while the other six binding sites faced downwards.
        C1q resembles a bunch of tulips with six globular heads, containing the antibody
combining regions, tethered to six collagenous stalks [Perkins et al., 1985 Biochem J. 228,
13-26; Poon et al., 1983 J Mol Biol. 168, 563-77; Reid et al., 1983 Biochem Soc Trans 11, 1
12; Weiss et al., 1986 J. Mol. Biol. 189, 573-81]. C1q was found to fit onto the b12 hexameric
assembly of the 1HZH crystal structure, so that each of the six globular heads were in contact
with one of the six C1q binding sites (Parren,        FASEB Summer Research Conference,
Snowmass, Co., 5-10 July 2010; "Crystal Structure of an intact human IgG: implications for
HIV-1 neutralization and effector Function", Thesis by Erica Ollmann Saphire, for the Scripps
Research Institute, La Jolla, California. November 2000). Mutations in selected amino acids
in the Fc interfaces observed between symmetry-related b12 antibodies in the crystal
structure were observed to decrease the binding avidity of C1q, indicating the contribution of
these amino acids to the intermolecular Fc:Fc interaction.

residues, wherein six of said dimeric proteins are capable of forming non-covalent hexameric
forms in solution.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Definitions
        The term "immunoglobulin" refers to a class of structurally related glycoproteins
consisting of two pairs of polypeptide chains, one pair of light (L) low molecular weight chains
and one pair of heavy (H) chains, all four potentially inter-connected by disulfide bonds. The
structure of immunoglobulins has been well characterized. See for instance Fundamental
                                                   7

Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)). Briefly, each heavy
chain typically is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and
a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region typically is comprised of three
domains, CH1, CH2, and CH3. The heavy chains are inter-connected via disulfide bonds in the
so-called "hinge region". Each light chain typically is comprised of a light chain variable region
(abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region
typically is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions may be further subdivided
into regions of hypervariability (or hypervariable regions which may be hypervariable in
sequence     and/or form     of structurally defined    loops), also termed      complementarity
determining regions (CDRs),      interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed
framework regions (FRs). Each VH and VL is typically composed of three CDRs and four FRs,
arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2,
CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4 (see also Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196, 901 917 (1987)). Unless
otherwise stated or contradicted by context, the amino acids of the constant region sequences
are herein numbered according to the Eu-index or numbering (described in Kabat, E.A. et al.,
Sequences of proteins of immunological interest. 5th Edition - US Department of Health and
Human Services, NIH publication No. 91-3242, pp 662,680,689 (1991)).
        The term "hinge region" as used herein is intended to refer to the hinge region of an
immunoglobulin heavy chain. Thus, for example the hinge region of a human IgG1 antibody
corresponds to amino acids 216-230 according to the Eu numbering as set forth in Kabat.
        The term "CH2 region" or "CH2 domain" as used herein is intended to refer the CH2
region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. Thus, for example the CH2 region of a human IgG1
antibody corresponds to amino acids 231-340 according to the Eu numbering system.
However, the CH2 region may also be any of the other subtypes as described herein.
        The term "CH3 region" or "CH3 domain" as used herein is intended to refer the CH3
region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. Thus for example the CH3 region of a human IgG1
antibody corresponds to amino acids 341-447 according to the Eu numbering system.
However, the CH3 region may also be any of the other subtypes as described herein.
        "Fc region", "Fc fragment" or "Fc domain", which may be used interchangeably herein,
refers to an antibody region comprising, in the direction from the N- to C-terminal, at least a
hinge region, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain. An Fc region of an IgG1 antibody can, for
example, be generated by digestion of an IgG1 antibody with papain.
        The term "Fab fragment" in the context of the present invention, refers to a fragment
of an immunoglobulin molecule, which comprises the variable regions of the heavy chain and
light chain as well as the constant region of the light chain and the CH1 region of an
immunoglobulin. The "CH1 region" refers e.g. to the region of a human IgG1 antibody
corresponding to amino acids 118-215 according to the Eu numbering system. Thus, the Fab
fragment comprises the binding region of an immunoglobulin.
                                                    8

        The term "antibody" (Ab)      in the context of the present invention refers to an
immunoglobulin molecule, a fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule, or a derivative of
either thereof, which has the ability to specifically bind to an antigen under typical
physiological conditions with a half life of significant periods of time, such as at least about
30 minutes, at least about 45 minutes, at least about one hour, at least about two hours, at
least about four hours, at least about eight hours, at least about 12 hours, about 24 hours or
more, about 48 hours or more, about three, four, five, six, seven or more days, etc., or any
other relevant functionally-defined period (such as a time sufficient to induce, promote,
enhance, and/or modulate a physiological response associated with antibody binding to the
antigen and/or time sufficient for the antibody to recruit an effector activity). The antibody of
the present invention comprises an Fc-domain of an immunoglobulin and an antigen-binding
region. An antibody generally contains two CH2-CH3 regions and a connecting region, e.g. a
hinge region, e.g. at least an Fc-domain. Thus the antibody of the present invention may
comprise an Fc region and an antigen-binding region. The variable regions of the heavy and
light chains of the immunoglobulin molecule contain a binding domain that interacts with an
antigen. The constant or "Fc"    regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the
immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (such
as effector cells) and components of the complement system such as C1q, the first component
in the classical pathway of complement activation. An antibody may also be a multispecific
antibody, such as a bispecific antibody or similar molecule. The term "bispecific antibody"
refers to an antibody having specificities for at least two different, typically non-overlapping,
epitopes. Such epitopes may be on the same or different targets. If the epitopes are on
different targets, such targets may be on the same cell or different cells or cell types. As
indicated above, unless otherwise stated or clearly contradicted by the context, the term
antibody herein includes fragments of an antibody which comprise at least a portion of an Fc
region and which retain the ability to specifically bind to the antigen. Such fragments may be
provided by any known technique, such as enzymatic cleavage, peptide synthesis and
recombinant expression techniques. It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of
an antibody may be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of binding
fragments encompassed within the term "Ab" or "antibody" include, without limitation,
monovalent antibodies (described in W02007059782 by Genmab); heavy-chain antibodies,
consisting only of two heavy chains and naturally occurring in e.g. camelids (e.g., Hamers
Casterman (1993) Nature 363:446); ThioMabs (Roche, W02011069104), strand-exchange

(WO2008/003116), and dual scFv-fusions. It also should be understood that the term
antibody, unless specified otherwise, also includes polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal
antibodies (such as human monoclonal antibodies),                 antibody mixtures     (recombinant
polyclonals) for instance generated by technologies exploited by Symphogen and Merus
(Oligoclonics), and antibody-like polypeptides, such as chimeric antibodies and humanized
antibodies. An antibody as generated can potentially possess any isotype.
        The term "full-length antibody" when used herein, refers to an antibody (e.g., a parent
or variant antibody) which contains all heavy and light chain constant and variable domains
corresponding to those that are normally found in a wild-type antibody of that isotype.
        The term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having
variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The
human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human
germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations, insertions or deletions introduced by
random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, the
term "human antibody", as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR
sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have
been grafted onto human framework sequences.
        The   terms     "monoclonal      antibody",   "monoclonal      Ab",  "monoclonal     antibody
composition", "mAb", or the like, as used herein refer to a preparation of Ab molecules of
single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding
                                                       10

specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. Accordingly, the term "human monoclonal
antibody" refers to Abs displaying a single binding specificity which have variable and constant
regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human mAbs may be
generated     by a hybridoma       which includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic or
transchromosomal nonhuman animal, such as a transgenic mouse, having a genome
comprising a human heavy chain transgene repertoire and a light chain transgene repertoire,
rearranged to produce a functional human antibody and fused to an immortalized cell.
        As used herein, "isotype" refers to the immunoglobulin class (for instance IgG1, IgG2,
IgG3, IgG4, IgD, IgAl, IgGA2, IgE, or IgM or any allotypes thereof such as IgGlm(za) and
IgGlm(f)) that is encoded by heavy chain constant region genes. Further, each heavy chain
isotype can be combined with either a kappa (K) or lambda (k) light chain.
        The term "monovalent antibody" means in the context of the present invention that
an antibody molecule is only capable of binding with one binding domain of the antibody to
an antigen, e.g. has a single antigen-antibody interaction, and thus is not able of antigen
crosslinking.
         A "binding region" as used herein may be a polypeptide sequence, such as a protein,
protein ligand, receptor, an antigen-binding region, or a ligand-binding region capable of
binding to a target associated with a cell, bacterium, virion, or the like. A binding region may,
for example, comprise part of a receptor, receptor ligand or antigen-binding region of an
immunoglobulin or antibody.
        As used herein, the term "target" is in the context of the present invention to be
understood as a molecule to which the binding region of the polypeptide comprising a CH2,
CH3, and optionally a hinge region, and a binding region binds. When used in the context of
the binding of an antibody includes any antigen towards which the raised antibody is directed.
The term "antigen" and "target" may in relation to an antibody be used interchangeably and
constitute the same meaning and purpose with respect to any aspect or embodiment of the
present invention.
        As used herein, the term "binding" in the context of the binding of an antibody to a
predetermined antigen typically is a binding with an affinity corresponding to a       KD of about
10-6 M or less, e.g. 10-7 M or less, such as about 10-8 M or less, such as about 10- M or less,
about 10-10 M or less, or about 10-" M or even less when determined by for instance surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIAcore 3000 instrument using the antigen as the
ligand and the antibody as the analyte, and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity
corresponding to a      KD that is at least ten-fold lower, such as at least 100 fold lower, for
instance at least 1,000 fold lower, such as at least 10,000 fold lower, for instance at least
100,000 fold lower than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein)
other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. The amount with which
the affinity is lower is dependent on the  KD of the antibody, so that when the KD of the antibody
                                                      11

is very low (that is, the antibody is highly specific), then the amount with which the affinity
for the antigen is lower than the affinity for a non-specific antigen may be at least 10,000
fold. The term  "KD"  (M), as used herein, refers to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a
particular antibody-antigen interaction.
        A "variant" of the present invention denotes a molecule, e.g. dimeric protein or which
comprises one or more mutations as compared to a "parent molecule", e.g. "parent dimeric
protein", such as a "parent antibody". For an antibody variant, exemplary parent antibody
formats include, without limitation, a wild-type antibody, a full-length antibody or Fc
containing antibody fragment, a bispecific antibody, a human antibody, or any combination
thereof. Exemplary mutations include amino acid deletions, insertions, and substitutions of
amino acids in the parent amino acid sequence. Amino acid substitutions may exchange a
native amino acid for another naturally-occurring amino acid, or for a non-naturally-occurring
amino acid derivative. The amino acid substitution may be conservative or non-conservative.
In the context of the present invention, conservative substitutions may be defined by
substitutions within the classes of amino acids reflected in one or more of the following three
tables:

        In the context of the present invention, a substitution in a variant is indicated as:
        Original amino acid - position - substituted amino acid;
        Referring to the well-recognized nomenclature for amino acids, the three letter code,
or one letter code, are used, including the codes Xaa and X to indicate amino acid residue.
Accordingly, the notation "E345R"      or "Glu345Arg"    means, that the variant comprises a
substitution of Glutamic acid with Arginine in the variant amino acid position corresponding
to the amino acid in position 345 in the parent antibody, when the two are aligned as indicated
below.
        Where a position as such is not present in an antibody, but the variant comprises an
insertion of an amino acid, for example:
        Position - substituted amino acid; the notation, e.g., "448E" is used.
        Such notation is particular relevant in connection with modification(s) in a series of
homologous polypeptides or antibodies.
        Similarly when the identity of the substitution amino acid residues(s) is immaterial:
        Original amino acid - position; or "E345".
        For a modification where the original amino acid(s) and/or substituted amino acid(s)
may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s), the substitution of Glutamic acid for
Arginine, Lysine or Tryptophan in position 345:
        "Glu345Arg,Lys,Trp" or "E345R,K,W" or "E345R/K/W" or "E345 to R, K or W"
        may be used interchangeably in the context of the invention.
        Furthermore, the term "a substitution" embraces a substitution into any one of the
other nineteen natural amino acids, or into other amino acids, such as non-natural amino
acids. For example, a substitution of amino acid E in position 345 includes each of the following
substitutions: 345A, 345C, 345D, 345G, 345H, 345F, 3451, 345K, 345L, 345M, 345N, 345Q,
345R, 345S, 345T, 345V, 345W, 345P, and 345Y. This is, by the way, equivalent to the
designation 345X, wherein the X designates any amino acid other than the original amino
acid. These substitutions can also be designated E345A, E345C, etc, or E345A,C,etc, or
                                                   13

E345A/C/etc. The same applies by analogy to each and every position mentioned herein, to
specifically include herein any one of such substitutions.
        The terms "amino acid" and "amino acid residue" may be used interchangeably.
        The reference to "D/E356" refers in the present context to allotypic variants in the
sequence of human IgG1. In the IgG1m(za) allotype of human IgG1 the amino acid in position
356 is D, while in the IgGlm(f) allotype of human IgG1 the amino acid in position 356 is E.
        Unless otherwise stated or contradicted by the context, reference to an amino acid
position number refers to the amino acid position number in a human IgG1 heavy chain.
        An amino acid or segment in one sequence that "corresponds to" an amino acid or
segment in another sequence is one that (i) aligns with the other amino acid or segment using
a standard sequence alignment program such as ALIGN, ClustalW or similar, typically at
default settings and (ii) has a sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:1 of at least 50%, at least
80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%. For example, the sequence alignments shown in Figures
2 and 3 can be used to identify any amino acid in the shown immunoglobulin Fc sequences
that corresponds to a particular amino acid in the IgG1 Fc sequence.
        For purposes of the present invention, an amino acid at a position in an amino acid
sequence which corresponds to a specific position in another, reference amino acid sequence,
as well as the degree of identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences, can
determined by alignment of the two sequences. Herein, unless otherwise indicated or
contradicted by context, the reference amino acid sequence is the amino acid sequence of the
human IgG1 heavy chain. The program "Align" which is a Needleman-Wunsch alignment (i.e.
a global alignment) can be used for alignment of polypeptide, as well as nucleotide sequences.
The default scoring matrix BLOSUM50 or BLOSUM62 can be used for polypeptide alignments,
and the default identity matrix can be used for nucleotide alignments, the penalty of the first
residue of a gap is -12 for polypeptides and -16 for nucleotides. The penalties for further
residues of a gap are -2 for polypeptides, and -4 for nucleotides. "Align" is part of the FASTA
package version v20u6 (see W. R. Pearson and D. J. Lipman (1988), "Improved Tools for
Biological Sequence Analysis", PNAS 85:2444-2448, and W. R. Pearson (1990) "Rapid and
Sensitive Sequence Comparaison with FASTP and FASTA", Methods in Enzymology 183:63
98). FASTA protein alignments use the Smith-Waterman algorithm with no limitation on gap
size (see "Smith-Waterman algorithm", T. F. Smith and M. S. Waterman (1981) J. Mol. Biolo.
147:195-197). Representative alignments between Fc regions of immunoglobulin heavy
chains are shown in Figures 2 and 3.
        The term "vector," as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule
capable of inducing transcription of a nucleic acid segment ligated into the vector. One type
of vector is a "plasmid", which is in the form of a circular double stranded DNA loop. Another
type of vector is a viral vector, wherein the nucleic acid segment may be ligated into the viral
genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they
                                                   14

are introduced (for instance bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and
episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (such as non-episomal mammalian vectors)
may be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and
thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of
directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are
referred to herein as "recombinant expression vectors" (or simply, "expression vectors"). In
general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of
plasmids. In the present specification, "plasmid" and "vector" may be used interchangeably
as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, the present invention is
intended to include such other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (such as
replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve
equivalent functions.
        The term "recombinant host cell" (or simply "host cell"), as used herein, is intended
to refer to a cell into which an expression vector has been introduced. It should be understood
that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell, but also to the
progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations
due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical
to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term "host cell" as used herein.
Recombinant host cells include, for example, transfectomas, such as CHO cells, HEK-293 cells,
PER.C6, NSO cells, and lymphocytic cells, and prokaryotic cells such as E. coli and other
eukaryotic hosts such as plant cells and fungi.
        The term "transfectoma", as used herein, includes recombinant eukaryotic host cells
expressing the Ab or a target antigen, such as CHO cells, PER.C6, NSO cells, HEK-293 cells,
plant cells, or fungi, including yeast cells.
        As used herein, the term "effector cell" refers to an immune cell which is involved in
the effector phase of an immune response, as opposed to the cognitive and activation phases
of an immune response. Exemplary immune cells include a cell of a myeloid or lymphoid
origin, for instance lymphocytes (such as B cells and T cells including cytolytic T cells (CTLs)),
killer cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, monocytes, eosinophils, polymorphonuclear
cells, such as neutrophils, granulocytes, mast cells, and basophils. Some effector cells express
Fc receptors (FcRs) or complement receptors and carry out specific immune functions. In
some embodiments, an effector cell such as, e.g., a natural killer cell, is capable of inducing
ADCC. For example, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells and Kupffer cells
which express FcRs, are involved in specific killing of target cells and presenting antigens to
other components of the immune system, or binding to cells that present antigens. In some
embodiments the ADCC can be further enhanced by antibody driven classical complement
activation resulting in the deposition of activated C3 fragments on the target cell. C3 cleavage
products are ligands to complement receptors (CRs), such as CR3, expressoid on myeloid
                                                      15

cells. The recognition of complement fragments by CRs on effector cells may promote
enhanced Fc receptor-mediated ADCC. In some embodiments antibody driven classical
complement activation leads to C3 fragments on the target cell. These C3 cleavage products
may    promote     direct      complement-dependent     cellular cytotoxicity   (CDCC).   In    some
embodiments, an effector cell may phagocytose a target antigen, target particle or target cell.
The expression of a particular FcR or complement receptor on an effector cell may be
regulated by humoral factors such as cytokines. For example, expression of FcyRI has been
found to be up-regulated by interferon y (IFN y) and/or G-CSF. This enhanced expression
increases the cytotoxic activity of FcyRI-bearing cells against targets. An effector cell can
phagocytose a target antigen or phagocytose or lyse a target cell. In some embodiments
antibody driven classical complement activation leads to C3 fragments on the target cell.
These C3 cleavage products may promote direct phagocytosis by effector cells or indirectly
by enhancing antibody mediated phagocytosis.
        As used herein, the term "effector functions" refers to functions that are a consequence
of binding a dimeric protein, such as an antibody, to its target, such as an antigen, optionally
on a cell, on a cell membrane, on a virion, or on another particle. Examples of effector
functions include (i) Clq-binding, (ii) complement activation, (iii) complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC),     (iv) oligomer formation, (v) oligomer stability, (vi) antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxity (ADCC), (vii) FcRn-binding, (viii) Fc-gamma receptor-binding, (ix)

downmodulation,       (xv)      induction of apoptosis,  (xvi)    opsonisation,  (xvii) proliferation
modulation, such as proliferation reduction, inhibition or stimulation, and (xii) a combination
of any of (i) to (xvi).
        As used herein, the term "affinity" is the strength of binding of one molecule, e.g. an
antibody, to another, e.g. a target or antigen, at a single site, such as the monovalent binding
of an individual antigen binding site of an antibody to an antigen.
        As used herein, the term "avidity" refers to the combined strength of multiple binding
sites between two structures, such as between multiple antigen binding sites of antibodies
simultaneously interacting with a target or e.g. between antibody and C1q. When more than
one binding interactions are present, the two structures will only dissociate when all binding
sites dissociate, and thus, the dissociation rate will be slower than for the individual binding
sites, and thereby providing a greater effective total binding strength (avidity) compared to
the strength of binding of the individual binding sites (affinity).
        As used herein, the term "oligomer" refers to a structure that consists of more than
one but a limited number of units of a specific type of molecule (such as, e.g., antibody or
other dimeric protein molecules according to the invention) in contrast to a polymer which,
                                                      16

at least in principle, consists of an unlimited number of units. Thus, an oligomer according to
the invention consists of a limited number of dimeric proteins according to any aspect or
embodiment of the present invention. Exemplary oligomers are dimers, trimers, tetramers,
pentamers, hexamers, and dodecamers. Greek prefixes are often used to designate the
number of monomer units in the oligomer, for example a tetramer being composed of four
units and a hexamer of six units. Likewise, the term "oligomerization", as used herein, is
intended to refer to a process that converts molecules to a finite degree of polymerization.
Herein, it is observed, that antibodies and/or other dimeric proteins according to the invention
can form oligomers, such as hexamers, via non-covalent association of Fc-domains in solution
under certain pH conditions, as described in Example 31, or, in the case of dimeric proteins
comprising target-binding regions, after target binding, e.g., at a cell surface. Oligomerization
in solution can be evaluated, e.g., as described in Example 20. In a particular embodiment,
the oligomerization in solution may be determined by performing HP-SEC (high pressure size
exclusion chromatography) fractionation using a suitable size exclusion chromatography resin
with a porse size capable of separating molecules in the range of 50 kDa to 1000 kDa,
connected to an absorbance detector; separating into 50 pL samples containing 1.25 pg/mL
protein at 1 mL/min in 0.1 M Na2SO4/0.1 M sodium phosphate buffered at pH 6.8; using a
suitable software to process results; and expressing per peak as percentage of total peak
area. The oligomerization of antibodies after antigen-binding can be evaluated (e.g. using a
complement dependent cytotoxicity as described in Examples 3, 6, and 21). In a particular
embodiment, CDC may be determined by pre-incubating suspension cells at a concentration
of 1 x 106 cells/ mL in round-bottom 96-well plates with an antibody at a final concentration
ranging from 0.0003 to 30.0 pg/mL in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min on a shaker at
room temperature; adding normal human serum at a final concentration of 20%, 30% or
50%; incubating at 37 0 C for 45 min; putting the plates on ice; adding 10 pL propidium iodide;
and determining cell lysis by FACS analysis.
         The term "C1q binding", as used herein, is intended to refer to the binding of C1q in
the context of the binding of Clq to an antibody bound to its antigen. The antibody bound to
its antigen is to be understood as happening both in vivo and in vitro in the context described
herein. Clq binding can be evaluated for example by using immobilized antibody on artificial
surface (e.g. plastic in plates for ELISA, as described in example 21). In a particular
embodiment, Clq binding may be determined by coating 96-well ELISA plates overnight at
4*C with antibody in PBS at a concentration ranging from 0.007 to 25.0 pg/mL; washing the
plates; blocking with 0.5x PBS/0.025% Tween 20/0.1% gelatin; sequentially incubating for 1
h at 37 0 C plates with 3% pooled human serum, rabbit anti-human C1q, swine anti-rabbit
IgG-HRP, by in-between washing; developing the plates for about 30 min with 1 mg/mL 2,2'
azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid; adding 100 pL 2%              oxalic acid; and
measuring the absorbance at 405 nm in a microplate reader. The binding of Clq to an
                                                   17

antibody oligomer is to be understood herein as a multivalent interaction resulting in high
avidity binding.
        As used herein, the term "complement activation" refers to the activation of the
classical complement pathway, which is triggered by the binding of complement component
Clq to an antibody bound to its antigen. Clq is the first protein in the early events of the
classical complement cascade that involves a series of cleavage reactions that culminate in
the formation of an enzymatic activity called C3 convertase, which cleaves complement
component C3 into C3b and C3a. C3b binds covalently to C5 on the membrane to form C5b
that in turn triggers the late events of complement activation in which terminal complement
components C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9 assemble into the membrane attack complex (MAC).
The complement cascade results in the creation of pores due to which causes cell lysis, also
known as CDC. Complement activation can be evaluated by using, CDC kinetics (as described
in example 14, 15 and 16), CDC assays (as described in examples 3 and 21) or by the method
Cellular deposition of C3b and C4b described in Beurskens et al April 1, 2012 vol. 188 no.
7 3532-3541.
        The term "complement-dependent cytotoxicity" ("CDC"), as used herein, is intended
to refer to the process of antibody-mediated complement activation leading to lysis of a cell
or virion as a result of pores in the membrane that are created by MAC assembly, when the
antibody is bound to its target on said cell or virion.. CDC can be evaluated by in vitro assays
such as a CDC assay in which normal human serum is used as a complement source, as
described above, e.g. in example 3 and 21.
        The term "antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity" ("ADCC") as used herein, is
intended to refer to a mechanism of killing of antibody-coated target cells or virions by cells
expressing Fc receptors that recognize the constant region of the bound antibody. ADCC can
be determined using methods such as, e.g., the ADCC assay described in example 21. In a
particular embodiment, ADCC may be determined by incubating cells with antibody at a
concentration ranging from 0.5 to 250 ng/mL; and quantifying ADCC activity with a ADCC
bioluminescent reporter assay kit.
        The term "antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis" ("ADCP") as used herein is
intended to refer to a mechanism of elimination of antibody-coated target cells or virions by
internalization by phagocytes. The internalized antibody-coated target cell or virion is
contained in a vesicle called a phagosome, which then fuses with one or more lysosomes to
form a phagolysosome. ADCP may be evaluated by using an in vitro cytotoxicity assay with
marcophages as effector cells and video microscopy as described by van Bij et al. in Journal
of Hepatology Volume 53, Issue 4, October 2010, Pages 677-685 or as described in example
24 for e.g. S. aureus phagocytos by PMN.
        The term "complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity" ("CDCC") as used herein is
intended to refer to a mechanism of killing of target cells or virions by cells expressing
                                                     18

complement receptors that recognize complement 3 (C3)              cleavage products that are
covalently bound to the target cells or virions as a result of antibody-mediated complement
activation. CDCC may be evaluated in a similar manner as described for ADCC, but in the
presence of complement C5 depleted normal human serum.
        The term "downmodulation", as used herein, is intended to refer to a process that
decreases the number of molecules, such as antigens or receptors, on a cellular surface, e.g.
by binding of an antibody to a receptor.
        The term "internalization", as used herein, is intended to refer to any mechanism by
which a dimeric protein of the present invention,          e.g.  an antibody or Fc-containing
polypeptide, is internalized into a target-expressing cell from the cell-surface and/or from
surrounding medium, e.g., via endocytosis. The internalization of an antibody can be
evaluated using a direct assay measuring the amount of internalized antibody (such as, e.g.,
the lysosomal co-localization assay described in Example 12).
        The term "programmed cell-death" or "PCD", as used herein refers to the death of a
cell in any form mediated by an intracellular signalling. Three forms of PCD are found;
apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis/oncosis. In a particular embodiment, any of the three
forms of programmed cell death may be determined by culturing 1.Ox 105 cells for 24 hours
in 96-well U-bottom plates in the presence of antibody at a concentration ranging from 0.0025
to 10 pg/mL; staining dead cells with annexin V-FITC using a suitable annexin binding assay
kit according to the manufacturer's instructions; and determining the amount of annexin V
FITC-positive cells using by FACS analysis.
        The term "apoptosis", as used herein, refers to the best-characterized type of
programmed cell death because of its importance in development and homeostasis, and in
the pathogenesis of different diseases, such as cancer. Apoptotic cells die in a controlled
fashion in response to a variety of extrinsic or intrinsic signals (e.g., activation of tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, DNA damage, mitochondrial pathways). Biochemical events
lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. The hallmarks of apoptotic cell
death include blebbing, exposure of phosphatidylserine on the extracellular face of the plasma
membrane, activation of caspases, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, cell
shrinkage, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and DNA condensation. Binding of an
antibody to a certain receptor may induce apoptosis.
        The term "autophagy", as used herein, refers to a selective degradation of intracellular
molecules or structures, such as misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, and is an
important    homeostatic function.   Autophagy    performs     in concert  with the  Ubiquitin
Proteasome System (UPS) to degrade aggregated/misfolded proteins that are ubiquitinated,
labelling them for degradation by autophagy. The ubiquitinated cargo is carried to the
phagophore and surrounds its cargo forming a double membrane vesicle, the autophagosome.
                                                  19

The lyososome fuses to the autophagosome and the cargo is degraded inside the
autolysosome.
        The term "necrosis" or "oncosis", as used herein, refers to an uncontrolled cell death
characterized by cell swelling, as well as destruction of the plasma membrane and subcellular
organelles, without nuclear fragmentation and condensation. Necrotic cell death is considered
a heterogeneous phenomenon including both programmed and accidental cell death.
        The term "proliferation", as used herein refers to an increase in the number of cells as
a result of cell growth and cell division.
        The term "antibody-drug conjugate", as used herein refers to a dimeric protein of the
present invention, e.g. an antibody or Fc-containing polypeptide, having specificity for at
least one type of malignant cell, a drug, and a linker coupling the drug to e.g. the antibody.
The linker is cleavable or non-cleavable in the presence of the malignant cell; wherein the
antibody-drug conjugate kills the malignant cell.
        The term "antibody-drug conjugate uptake", as used herein refers to the process in
which antibody-drug conjugates are bound to a target on a cell followed by uptake/engulfment
by the cell membrane and thereby is drawn into the cell. Antibody-drug conjugate uptake
may be evaluated as "antibody-mediated internalization and cell killing by anti-TF ADC in an
in vitro killing assay" as described in WO 2011/157741.
        The term "FcRn", as used herein is intended to refer to neonatal Fc receptor which is
an Fc receptor. It was first discovered in rodents as a unique receptor capable of transporting
IgG from mother's milk across the epithelium of newborn rodent's gut into the newborn's
bloodstream. Further studies revealed a similar receptor in humans. In humans, however, it
is found in the placenta to help facilitate transport of mother's IgG to the growing fetus and
it has also been shown to play a role in monitoring IgG turnover. FcRn binds IgG at acidic pH
of 6.0-6.5 but not at neutral or higher pH. Therefore, FcRn can bind IgG from the intestinal
lumen (the inside of the gut) at a slightly acidic pH and ensure efficient unidirectional transport
to the basolateral side (inside the body) where the pH is neutral to basic (pH 7.0-7.5). This
receptor also plays a role in adult salvage of IgG through its occurrence in the pathway of
endocytosis in endothelial cells. FcRn receptors in the acidic endosomes bind to IgG
internalized through pinocytosis, recycling it to the cell surface, releasing it at the basic pH of
blood, thereby preventing it from undergoing lysosomal degradation. This mechanism may
provide an explanation for the greater half-life of IgG in the blood compared to other isotypes.
        The term "Protein A", as used herein is intended to refer to a 56 kDa MSCRAMM surface
protein originally found in the cell wall of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. It is encoded
by the spa gene and its regulation is controlled by DNA topology, cellular osmolarity, and a
two-component system called ArIS-ArIR. It has found use in biochemical research because of
its ability to bind immunoglobulins. It is composed of five homologous Ig-binding domains
that fold into a three-helix bundle. Each domain is able to bind proteins from many
                                                     20

mammalian species, most notably IgGs. It binds the heavy chain Fc region of most
immunoglobulins (overlapping the conserved binding site of FcRn receptors) and also interacts
with the Fab region of the human VH3 family. Through these interactions in serum, IgG
molecules bind the bacteria via their Fc region instead of solely via their Fab regions, by which
the bacteria disrupts opsonization, complement activation and phagocytosis.
        The term "Protein G", as used herein is intended to refer to an immunoglobulin-binding
protein expressed in group C and G Streptococcal bacteria much like Protein A but with
differing specificities. It is a 65-kDa (G148 protein G) and a 58 kDa (C40 protein G) cell
surface protein that has found application in purifying antibodies through its binding to the Fc
region.
Dimeric protein
        The present invention relates in one aspect to a dimeric protein comprising a first and
a second polypeptide, each polypeptide comprising at least          CH 2 and  CH 3 regions of an
immunoglobulin heavy chain, wherein in said first and/or second polypeptide
        the amino acids in the positions corresponding to E345 and E430 in a human IgG1
heavy chain are not E, and
        the amino acid in at least one position selected from the group consisting of S440,
Y436, D/E356, T359, E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254 is Y, K, R or W; not Y; not D or E;
not T; not E; not N; not Q; not I; and not S, for each position, respectively. Each of positions
S440, Y436, D/E356, T359, E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254 corresponds to the position in
a human IgG1 heavy chain.
         In one embodiment, in each of said first and second polypeptides
        the amino acids in the positions corresponding to E345 and E430 in a human IgG1
heavy chain are not E, and
        the amino acid in at least one position selected from the group consisting of S440,
Y436, D/E356, T359, E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254 is Y, K, R or W; not Y; not D or E;
not T; not E; not N; not Q; not I; and not S, for each position, respectively. Each of positions
S440, Y436, D/E356, T359, E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254 corresponds to the position in
a human IgG1 heavy chain.
        The first and second polypeptides of the dimeric protein according to the invention
dimerize by forming covalent or non-covalent interaction. Such an interaction may be found
in any region of the polypeptides. Examples of covalent interaction are any CxxC peptide
interaction, wherein the "x" represents any amino acid and the "C" represents cysteine
residues. Another example is a TCRalpha chain constant domain and a TCRbeta chain constant
domain. Examples on non-covalent interaction may be a leucine zipper such as described in
Moll et al, Prot.Science, 2001, 10:649-655. In one embodiment, said first and/or second
polypeptide may further comprise a region capable of covalent binding between said first and
second polypeptide.
                                                    21

        In one embodiment, the first and/or second polypeptides further comprise a hinge
region.
        For certain purposes of the present invention a part of the hinge region, such as amino
acid positions corresponding to 226-230, suffices. Thus, in one embodiment, the first and/or
second polypeptide may further comprise amino acids at positions corresponding to positions
226-230 in a human IgG1 heavy chain.
        In one embodiment, in said first and second polypeptide the amino acid in the positions
corresponding to E345 and E430 in a human IgG1 heavy chain, are not E, and the amino acid
in at least one position selected from the group consisting of S440, Y436, D/E356, T359,
E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254 is Y or W; not Y; not D or E; not T; not E; not N; not Q;
not I; and not S, for each position, respectively.
        In one embodiment, in said first and second polypeptide the amino acid in the positions
corresponding to E345 and E430 in a human IgG1 heavy chain, are not E, and the amino acid
in at least one position selected from the group consisting of S440, Y436, E356, T359, E382,
N434, Q438, 1253 and S254 is Y, K, R or W; not Y; not E; not T; not E; not N; not Q; not I;
and not S, for each position, respectively.
        Thus, one embodiment the present invention relates to the dimeric protein comprising
a first and a second polypeptide, each polypeptide comprising at least      CH2,  CH3 and hinge
regions of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, wherein
        the amino acids in the positions corresponding to E345 and E430 in a human IgG1
heavy chain are not E and
        the amino acid in at least one position selected from the group consisting of S440,
Y436, E356, T359, E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254 is Y or W; not Y; not E; not T; not E;
not N; not Q; not I; and not S, for each position, respectively.
        In one embodiment, the first and second polypeptides are interconnected via hinge
region disulphide binds.
        Unless otherwise stated or contradicted by context, the amino acid positions
mentioned refer to an amino acid position in a human IgG1 heavy chain in any aspect or
embodiment of the present invention.
        Furthermore, unless otherwise stated or contradicted by context, the amino acid
numbering is according to Eu numbering as set forth in Kabat, as described above.
        The dimeric protein may be prepared from a parent dimeric protein, and thereby be
regarded as a variant dimeric protein, by introducing mutations in the positions corresponding
to E345 and E430 in a human IgG1 heavy chain, and in at least one position selected from
the group consisting of the positions corresponding to S440, Y436, D/E356, T359, E382,
N434, Q438, 1253 and S254 in a human IgG1 heavy chain, wherein the amino acid introduced
in the position corresponding to S440 is Y, K, R or W. At the other amino acid positions any
amino acid may be introduced, e.g. any naturally occurring amino acid.

        In one embodiment, at least one of the polypeptides of the dimeric protein comprises
a binding region which specifically binds to a target.
        In a further embodiment, both the first and second polypeptide comprises a binding

such as an antigen-binding region, of the first and second polypeptide may bind to the same
target, optionally to different epitopes of the same target, or they may bind to different
targets.
        The binding regions of the first and/or second polypeptide may be antigen binding
regions.
        Said binding region may bind any target, wherein the target may e.g. be a molecule
present on a cell, bacterium, parasite or virion.
        In a particular embodiment the target may be an antigen.
        In a further embodiment said antigen may be expressed on the surface of a cell, such
as a human tumor cell.

        In a further embodiment, the antigens may be selected from CD20, EGFr and CD38,
optionally, the dimeric protein of the present invention may be selected from 7D8, 2F8, 003
and 005 as described herein comprising the amino acid positions as defined by the present
invention. Thus, 7D8, 2F8, 003, and 005, may be used as a parent dimeric protein according
to the present invention.
        In one embodiment, at least one of the polypeptides, of the dimeric protein, comprises
an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region.
        In one embodiment, the dimeric protein of the present invention is an antibody.
        In a further embodiment, wherein the dimeric protein is an antibody, one or both, such
as each, of the first and second polypeptides comprises immunoglobulin heavy and light chain
variable regions to form a first and a second antigen-binding region, optionally binding the
same antigen.
        In another embodiment, wherein the dimeric protein is an antibody, one or both, such
as each, of the first and second polypeptides comprises an immunoglobulin heavy-chain
variable region associated with an immunoglobulin light chain sequence comprising light chain
variable and constant regions to form a first and a second antigen-binding region, optionally
binding the same antigen. In such an embodiment, it is understood that said first and second
polypeptides comprising immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable and constant regions are
associated with an immunoglobulin light chain sequence comprising light chain variable and
constant regions by interchain disulfide bonds between the constant domains of said heavy
                                                  27

chain and said light chain, and thereby forming a first and a second antigen-binding region,
optionally binding the same antigen.
        In a further embodiment, wherein the dimeric protein is an antibody, one or both
polypeptides comprise a full-length heavy chain constant region, such as a full-length human
IgG1 heavy chain constant region.
       The CH2 and CH3 regions of the first and/or second polypeptides may except for the
amino acid positions defined by the present invention, comprise amino acids 114-223 and
224-330, respectively, of SEQ ID NO:1; amino acids 111-219 and 220-326, respectively, of
SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 161-270 and 271-377, respectively, of SEQ ID NO:3; amino acids
111-220 and 221-327, respectively, of SEQ ID NO:4; or amino acids 114-223 and 224-330,
respectively, of SEQ ID NO:5.
        Said first and/or second polypeptides may further comprise a hinge region, wherein
said hinge region comprise amino acids 99-113 of SEQ ID NO:1; amino acids 99-110 of SEQ
ID NO:2; amino acids 99-160 of SEQ ID NO:3; amino acids 99-110 of SEQ ID NO:4; or amino
acids 99-113 of SEQ ID NO:5.
       The first and/or second polypeptide may except for the amino acid positions defined
by the present invention comprise a sequence according to any of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5.
       The dimeric protein of the present invention may in a particular embodiment as
described above be an antibody. Furthermore, the dimeric protein, e.g. an antibody, may also
be prepared by introducing mutations into a parent dimeric protein, e.g. a parent antibody,
in the amino acids in the positions corresponding to E345 and E430 in a human IgG1 heavy
chain, and an amino acid in at least one position selected from the group consisting of S440,
Y436, D/E356, T359, E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254. The examples of antibodies may
thus refer to "an antibody of the present invention" or "a variant antibody of the present
invention", and a "parent antibody".

specified otherwise, also includes polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies (such as
human monoclonal antibodies), antibody mixtures (recombinant polyclonals) for instance
generated by technologies exploited by Symphogen and Merus (Oligoclonics), and antibody
like polypeptides, such as chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies. An antibody as
generated can potentially possess any isotype.
        The parent antibody or an antibody of the present invention may be prepared from
wild-type antibodies or non-naturally occurring antibody formats as any of those described
herein, e.g. heterodimeric proteins, which are used as starting material into which the
relevant modifications according to the present invention are introduced. The antibodies of
the present invention may e.g. be produced by the hybridoma method first described by
Kohler et al., Nature 256, 495 (1975), or may be produced by recombinant DNA methods.
Monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques
described in, for example, Clackson et al., Nature 352, 624 628 (1991) and Marks et al., J.
Mol. Biol. 222, 581 597 (1991). Monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from any suitable
source. Thus, for example, monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from hybridomas prepared
from murine splenic B cells obtained from mice immunized with an antigen of interest, for
instance in form of cells expressing the antigen on the surface, or a nucleic acid encoding an
antigen of interest. Monoclonal antibodies may also be obtained from hybridomas derived
from antibody-expressing cells of immunized humans or non-human mammals such as
rabbits, rats, dogs, primates, etc.
        The antibody may be e.g. a chimeric or humanized antibody. In another embodiment,
the antibody is a human antibody. Human monoclonal antibodies may be generated using
                                                    29

transgenic or transchromosomal mice, e.g. HuMAb mice, carrying parts of the human immune
system rather than the mouse system. The HuMAb mouse contains a human immunoglobulin
gene minilocus that encodes unrearranged human heavy (p and y) and                  K light chain
immunoglobulin sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous
p and   K chain loci (Lonberg, N. et al., Nature 368, 856 859 (1994)). Accordingly, the mice
exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or      K and in response to immunization, the introduced
human heavy and light chain transgenes, undergo class switching and somatic mutation to
generate high affinity human IgG,K monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg, N. et al. (1994), supra;
reviewed in Lonberg, N. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 113, 49 101 (1994) ,
Lonberg, N. and Huszar, D., Intern. Rev. Immunol. Vol. 13 65 93 (1995) and Harding, F. and
Lonberg, N. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci 764 536 546 (1995)). The preparation of HuMAb mice is
described in detail in Taylor, L. et al., Nucleic Acids Research 20, 6287 6295 (1992), Chen, J.
et al., International Immunology 5, 647 656 (1993), Tuaillon et al., J. Immunol. 152, 2912

used to generate hybridomas that secrete human monoclonal antibodies according to well
known techniques.

invention from other species may be identified through display-type technologies, including,
without limitation, phage display, retroviral display, ribosomal display, mammalian display,
yeast display and other techniques known in the art, and the resulting molecules may be
subjected to additional maturation, such as affinity maturation, as such techniques are well
known in the art.
        The antibody is not limited to antibodies which have a natural, e.g. a human Fc domain
but it may also be an antibody having other mutations than those of the present invention,
such as e.g. mutations that affect glycosylation, Clq binding, Fc receptor binding, or enables
the antibody to be a bispecific antibody. By the term "natural antibody" is meant any antibody
which does not comprise any genetically introduced mutations. An antibody which comprises
naturally occurring variations, e.g. different allotypes, is thus to be understood as a "natural
antibody" in the sense of the present invention. Such antibodies may serve as a template or
starting material, e.g. parent antibody, for introducing the mutations according to the present
invention, and thereby providing the antibodies of the invention. An example of an antibody
comprising other mutations than those of the present invention is a bispecific antibody as
described in W02011/131746 (Genmab),              utilizing reducing conditions to promote half
molecule exchange of two antibodies comprising IgG4-like matched CH3 regions, thus forming
                                                        30

bispecific antibodies without concomitant formation of aggregates. Other examples of
antibodies include but are not limited to bispecific antibodies such as heterodimeric
bispecifics:   Triomabs    (Fresenius);   bispecific  IgG1   and    IgG2    (Rinat   Neurosciences
Corporation); FcAAdp (Regeneron); Knobs-into-holes (Genentech); Electrostatic steering
(Amgen, Chugai, Oncomed); SEEDbodies (Merck); Azymetric scaffold (Zymeworks); mAb-Fv
(Xencor); and LUZ-Y (Genentch). Other exemplary antibody formats include, without
limitation, a wild-type antibody, a full-length antibody or Fc-containing antibody fragment, a
human antibody, or any combination thereof.
         Monoclonal antibodies for use in the present invention, may be produced, e.g., by the
hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature 256, 495 (1975), or may be
produced by recombinant DNA methods. Monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from
phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in, for example, Clackson et al.,
Nature 352, 624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222, 581-597 (1991). Monoclonal
antibodies may be obtained from any suitable source. Thus, for example, monoclonal
antibodies may be obtained from hybridomas prepared from murine splenic B cells obtained
from mice immunized with an antigen of interest, for instance in form of cells expressing the
antigen on the surface, or a nucleic acid encoding an antigen of interest. Monoclonal
antibodies may also be obtained from hybridomas derived from antibody-expressing cells of
immunized humans or non-human mammals such as rats, dogs, primates, etc.
         In one embodiment, the antibody is a human antibody. Human monoclonal antibodies
directed against any antigen may be generated using transgenic or transchromosomal mice
carrying parts of the human immune system rather than the mouse system. Such transgenic
and transchromosomic mice include mice referred to herein as HuMAb@ mice and KM mice,
respectively, and are collectively referred to herein as "transgenic mice".
        The HuMAb@ mouse contains a human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that encodes
unrearranged human heavy (p and y) and        K light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together
with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous p and      K  chain loci (Lonberg, N. et al.,
Nature 368, 856-859 (1994)). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM
or  K  and in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy and light chain
transgenes, undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human
IgG,K monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg, N. et al. (1994), supra; reviewed in Lonberg, N.
Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 113, 49-101 (1994) , Lonberg, N. and Huszar, D.,

        The HCo7, HCo12, HCo17 and HCo20 mice have a JKD disruption in their endogenous
light chain (kappa) genes (as described in Chen et al., EMBO J. 12, 821-830 (1993)), a CMD
disruption in their endogenous heavy chain genes (as described in Example 1 of WO
01/14424), and a KCo5 human kappa light chain transgene (as described in Fishwild et al.,
Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-851 (1996)). Additionally, the Hco7 mice have a HCo7 human
heavy chain transgene (as described in US 5,770,429), the HCo12 mice have a HCo12 human
heavy chain transgene (as described in Example 2 of WO 01/14424), the HCo17 mice have a
HCo17 human heavy chain transgene (as described in Example 2 of WO 01/09187) and the
HCo20 mice have a HCo20 human heavy chain transgene. The resulting mice express human
immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain transgenes in a background homozygous for
disruption of the endogenous mouse heavy and kappa light chain loci.
        In the KM mouse strain, the endogenous mouse kappa light chain gene has been
homozygously disrupted as described in Chen et al., EMBO J. 12, 811-820 (1993) and the
endogenous mouse heavy chain gene has been homozygously disrupted as described in
Example 1 of WO 01/09187. This mouse strain carries a human kappa light chain transgene,
KCo5, as described in Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-851 (1996). This mouse
strain also carries a human heavy chain transchromosome composed of chromosome 14
fragment hCF (SC20) as described in WO 02/43478. HCo12-Balb/C mice can be generated by
crossing HCo12 to KCo5[J/K](Balb) as described in WO/2009/097006.
        Splenocytes from these transgenic mice may be used to generate hybridomas that
secrete human monoclonal antibodies according to well-known techniques.
        Further, any antigen-binding regions of the present invention may be obtained from
human     antibodies or antibodies from     other species   identified through  display-type
technologies, including, without limitation, phage display, retroviral display, ribosomal
display, and other techniques, using techniques well known in the art and the resulting
molecules may be subjected to additional maturation, such as affinity maturation, as such
techniques are well known in the art (see for instance Hoogenboom et al., J. Mol. Biol. 227,

within that isotype.
                                                   35

        In one embodiment, the antibody is a human IgG2 antibody, optionally wherein the
first and/or second polypeptide, e.g. both polypeptides, comprises SEQ ID NO:2.
        In one embodiment, the antibody is a human IgG3 antibody, optionally wherein the
first and/or second polypeptide, e.g. both polypeptides, comprises SEQ ID NO:3.
        In one embodiment, the antibody is a human IgG4 antibody, optionally wherein the
first and/or second polypeptide, e.g. both polypeptides, comprises SEQ ID NO:4.
        In particular embodiments of any dimeric protein of the present invention, the first
and/or second polypeptide, e.g. both polypeptides, of the dimeric protein comprises an amino
acid sequence which has a degree of identity to amino acids P247 to K447, e.g. 1253 to K447,
of SEQ ID Nos: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of at least 70%, 72%, 74%, 76%, 78%, 80%, 81%, 82%,
83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%,
98%, or of at least about 99%, except for the amino acid positions defined by the present
invention.
        Thus, the first and/or second polypeptide, e.g. both polypeptides, of the dimeric
protein may comprise a sequence according to SEQ ID No:1, SEQ ID No:2, SEQ ID No:3, SEQ
ID No: 4, or SEQ ID No:5 except for any amino acid residues of the present invention and
defined herein.
        The inventors of the present invention have found that six antibodies in which the
amino acids E, E and S at the positions corresponding to E345, E430 and S440 of a human
IgG1 heavy chain, have been substituted with the amino acids R, G and Y, respectively, are
capable of forming non-covalent hexameric structures in solution.
        Hence, in one embodiment, the dimeric protein of the present invention is
predominantly in oligomeric form, such as hexameric form, in a phosphate buffer at a pH of
about 6.8.
        Hence, in one embodiment a dimeric protein of the present invention is capable of
forming a non-covalent hexameric structure under the conditions described in Example 20 or
23, e.g. in a solution of 12.6 mM sodium phosphate, 140 mM NaCl at pH 7.4, or in a solution
of 0.1 M Na2SO4, 0.1 M sodium phosphate at pH 6.8, or in a solution of 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1M
citrate buffer at pH 6.8. In the context of the present invention the term "capable of forming
non-covalent hexameric structure" means that more than 30%, such as more than 40%, or
more than 50%, or more than 60%, or more than 70%, or more than 80%, or more than
85%, or more than 90%, or more than 95% of the dimeric proteins, e.g. antibodies are in a
non-covalent hexameric structure when determined as described in Example 20. In a further
embodiment the dimeric protein of the present invention is not capable of forming non
covalent structure in a solution of 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1M citrate buffer at pH 5.0. The term "is not
able to form non-covalent hexameric structure" means in the context of the present invention
that less than 10%, such as less than 8%, or less than 7%, or less than 6%, or less than 5%,
or less than 4%, or less than 3%, or less than 2%, or less than 1%, or less than 0.5% of the
                                                   36

dimeric proteins, e.g. antibodies, are in a non-covalent hexameric structure when determined
as described in Example 20. Thus, in one embodiment, the hexameric structure may be
determined     by   performing   HP-SEC    (high   pressure  size exclusion    chromatography)
fractionation using a suitable size exclusion chromatography resin with a pore size capable of
separating molecules in the range of 50 kDa to 1000 kDa, connected to an absorbance
detector; separating in 50 pL samples containing 1.25 pg/mL protein at 1 mL/min in 0.1 M
Na2SO4 /0.1 M sodium phosphate buffered at pH 6.8; using suitable software to process
results; and expressing per peak as percentage of total peak area.
        The ability of a dimeric protein of the present invention of forming an oligomeric, e.g.
a hexameric structure makes the dimeric protein suitable for binding targets not only present
on a cell but also soluble targets. Thus, the dimeric protein of the present invention may e.g.
be used to remove soluble factors, e.g. bacterial toxins, or other unwanted factors, from the
blood stream, such as complement components, e.g. C1q.
        Phenotyping of erythrocytes, such as determination of the Rhesus D status, is
important in case of blood transfusions and to determine the risk of hemolytic disease of a
newborn. For the phenotyping of erythrocytes currently monoclonal human IgG antibodies
are used in a laboratory test, e.g. Coombs test. However, many of the IgGs used in these
assays induce poor agglutination. In stead of IgG, oligomeric structures, e.g. hexameric
structures, of the dimeric proteins of the present invention may be used as reagent in
phenotyping assays. Using a stable oligomeric, such as a hexameric, structure of the dimeric
proteins of the present invention for erythrocyte phenotyping may have several advantages,
such as the oligomeric structure could by itself induce crosslinking of cells bypassing need for
a secondary antibody, could improve the sensitivity of the assay, and two or more dimeric
proteins having different binding regions could be used for phenotyping multiple erythrocyte
antigens simultaneously. Thus, in one embodiment, the dimeric protein of the present
invention may be used for phenotyping erythrocytes. In one embodiment, two or more, such
as three, four, five or six, dimeric proteins of the present invention having different binding
regions may be used for phenotyping of multiple erythrocyte antigens.
        In a further embodiment the dimeric protein of the present invention has an increased
effector function compared to a parent dimeric protein. The dimeric protein of the present
invention may be regarded as a variant of a parent dimeric protein wherein the variant
comprises amino acid mutations in the positions 345, 430, and an amino acid mutation in at
least one position selected from the group consisting of S440, Y436, D/E356, T359, E382,
N434, Q438, 1253 and S254, compared to the parent dimeric protein. A parent dimeric protein
is in this context a dimeric protein in which the amino acids of said first and/or second
polypeptides correspond to those of a human IgG1 heavy chain at positions E345, E430 and
amino acid in at least one position selected from the group consisting of S440, Y436, D/E356,
T359, E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254, wherein the amino acid position selected from the
                                                    37

group consisting of S440, Y436, E356, T359, E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254, corresponds
to those of a human IgG1 heavy chain at that position. As described above, the parent dimeric
protein may be any isotype.
         For an antibody, typically, the efficacy of the antibody may be expressed by the EC50
value, which is the concentration of the antibody necessary to obtain 50% of the maximal
effect. This similarly applies to a dimeric protein of the present invention.
         Maximal effect is the effect obtained when a saturating amount of the antibody is used,
in which saturating is intended to refer to the amount of antibody at which all antigens for
the antibody are bound by the antibody. This similarly applies to a dimeric protein of the
present invention.
        The term "increasing an effector funtion" or "improving an effector function" refers in
the context of the present invention to a decrease in the EC50 value of the dimeric protein of
the present invention compared to the parent dimeric protein. The decrease in the EC50 value
may e.g. be at least or about 2-fold, such as at least or about 3-fold, or at least or about 5
fold, or at least or about 10-fold. Alternatively, "increasing an effector funtion" or "improving
an effector function" means that there is an increase in the maximal amount of cells lysed
(where the total amount of cells is set at 100%) by e.g. from 10% to 100% of all cells, such
as by about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%,
about 80%, about 90%, and about 100% under conditions where the parent dimeric protein
lyses less than 100% of all cells.
        A dimeric protein could be tested for increased or improved effector function by cloning
the variable domain of the IgG1-005 or IgG1-7D8 heavy chain into the dimeric protein and
test its efficacy in CDC assays, such as described for Daudi (Example 3) and Wien (Example
6). In one embodiment, CDC efficacy may be determined by pre-incubating suspension cells
at a concentration of 1 x   106 cells/mL in round-bottom 96-well plates with an antibody in the
range from 0.0003 to 30.0 pg/mL final concentration in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min
on a shaker at room temperature, adding normal human serum at a concentration of 20%,
30% or 50 % final concentration, incubating at 37 0 C for 45 min, putting the plates on ice,
adding 10 pL propidium iodide, and determining cell lysis by FACS analysis.
         Using an IgG1-7D8 HC variable domain and Daudi cells, an increase would be defined
by a more than 2 fold lower EC50 than the EC50 of IgG1-7D8 under the studied condition,
such as about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 5-fold, about 10-fold or a more than 10-fold lower
EC50 value, the concentration at which half-maximal lysis is observed. Using an IgG1-005 HC
variable domain and Daudi cells, an increase would be defined by a more than 2 fold lower
EC50 than the EC50 of IgG1-005 under the studied condition, such as about 2-fold, about 3
fold, about 5-fold, about 10-fold or a more than 10-fold lower EC50 value, the concentration
at which half-maximal lysis is observed. Using an IgG1-7D8 HC variable domain and Wien133
cells, an increase would be defined by a more than 2 fold lower EC50 than the EC50 of IgG1
                                                      38

7D8 under the studied condition, such as about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 5-fold, about 10
fold or a more than 10-fold lower EC50 value, the concentration at which half-maximal lysis
is observed. Using an IgG1-005 HC variable domain and Wien133 cells, an increase would be
defined by an increase in the maximal lysis ranging from 10% to 100% of all cells, such as
by about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%,
about 80%, about 90%, and about 100%. An increase in CDC efficacy could also be defined
by a more than 2-fold lower EC50 than the EC50 of IgG1-005 under the studied condition,
such as about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 5-fold, about 10-fold or a more than 10-fold lower
EC50 value, the concentration at which half-maximal lysis is observed under conditions where
lysis of Wien133 cells is detectable.
        The inventors of the present invention have found that an antibody wherein the amino
acids in postions corresponding to E345, E430 and S440 in a human IgG1 heavy chain are
not E, E and S, respectively have a lower EC50 value for binding to C1q and a lower EC50
value for CDC (see example 21) compared to the same antibody wherein the amino acids at
said positions are E, E and S, respectively.
         In a further embodiment, an effector function, such as CDC, of the dimeric protein of
the present invention may be increased when the dimeric protein is bound to its target on a
cell or virion where the target is present on the virion or cell membrane, as compared to the
parent dimeric protein.
Other amino acid position(s)
        The first and/or second polypeptide of the dimeric protein of the present invention may
further comprise other specific amino acids at indicated position(s). As described herein, a
dimeric protein of the present invention, e.g. an antibody, may be prepared by introducing
mutations at the amino acid positions as specified by the present invention.
         Examples of such further other amino acids positions, or mutations, include amino
acids positions where the specific amino acid affects one or more effector functions of the
dimeric protein. Examples of such amino acids include amino acid residues which are capable
of enhancing CDC, C1q binding, Fc-gamma receptor binding or FcRn-binding and/or improving
Fc-gamma receptor-mediated effector functions.
         Examples of effector functions include (i) Clq-binding, (ii) complement activation, (iii)
CDC, (iv) oligomer formation, (v) oligomer stability, (vi) antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxity (ADCC), (vii) FcRn-binding, (viii) Fc-gamma receptor-binding,          (ix) antibody
dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP),       (x) complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(CDCC), (xi) complement-enhanced cytotoxicity, (xii) binding to complement receptor of an
opsonized antibody mediated by the antibody, (xiii) internalization, (xiv) downmodulation,
(xv) induction of apoptosis, (xvi) opsonisation, (xvii) proliferation modulation, such as
proliferation reduction, inhibition, and stimulation, and (xvii) a combination of any of (i) to
                                                    39

(xvi), of a dimeric protein, such as an antibody when e.g. bound to its antigen on a cell, on a
cell membrane, on a virion, or on another particle.
        In one embodiment, a dimeric protein according to the invention further comprises an
amino acid residue, or a modification of an amino acid residue, which is known as enhancing
CDC e.g., an exchange of segments between IgG isotypes to generate chimeric IgG molecules
(Natsume et al., 2008 Cancer Res 68(10), 3863-72); one or more amino acid substitutions
in the hinge region (Dall'Acqua et al., 2006 J Immunol 177, 1129-1138), and/or one or more
amino acid substitutions in or near the C1q-binding site in the CH2 domain, centered around
residues D270, K322, P329, and P331 (Idusogie et al., 2001 J Immunol 166, 2571-2575;
Michaelsen et al., 2009 Scand J Immunol 70, 553-564; WO 99/51642; Moore et al., 2010
mAbs 2(2), 181-189). For example, in one embodiment, a dimeric protein according to the
invention further comprises a combination of any of the amino acid substitutions S267E,
H268F, S324T, S239D, G236A and 1332E, providing enhanced effector function via CDC or
ADCC (Moore et al., 2010 mAbs 2(2), 181-189 and WO 2011/091078 A2). Other Fc mutations
affecting binding to Fc-receptors (described in WO 2006/105062, WO 00/42072, U.S. Patent
6,737,056 and U.S. Patent 7,083,784) or physical properties of the antibodies (described in
WO 2007/005612 Al) can also be used in the variants of the invention.
        Hence, in one embodiment, the amino acid in at least one position corresponding to
S267, H268, S324, S239, G236 and 1332, may be E, F, T, D, A and E, respectively.
        In one embodiment, a dimeric protein according to the invention further comprises
modifications enhancing Fc-gamma receptor binding and/or Fc-gamma receptor-mediated
effector function. Such modifications include (i) reducing the amount of fucose in the CH2
attached glycosylation (glyco-engineering) (Umana P, et al., Nat Biotechnol 1999; 17: 176
80; Niwa R, et al., Clin Cancer Res 2004; 10: 6248-55.)), and (ii) site-directed mutagenesis
of amino acids in the hinge or CH2 regions of antibodies (protein-engineering) (Lazar GA, et
al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2006; 103: 4005-10).
        In another embodiment such further mutations may be mutations which inhibit or
reduce the effector functions of the dimeric protein. In clinical applications where engagement
of the immune system is not required and may even cause unwanted side-effects the first
and/or second polypeptide of the dimeric protein may then be further mutated in the CH2
domain to abolish Clq and/or FcGammaReceptor interactions.
        Some amino acid residues in the Fc-domain that play a dominant role in the
interactions with Clq and the FcGammaReceptors have been identified. Positions 234 and
235 were shown to have a strong modulating effect on human Fc binding to human CD64
(Canfield & Morrison, 1991; Chappel et al., 1991; Hezareh et al., 2001), CD32A (Hezareh et
al., 2001; Armour et al., 2003), CD16 (Hezareh et al., 2001) and Clq (Xu et al., 2000;Hezareh
et al., 2001). The CH2 position 331 was shown to be a major determinant for human IgG
binding to human CD64 (Canfield & Morrison, 1991, J Exp Med.;173 :1483-91) and Clq (Tao
                                                   40

et al., 1993; Idusogie et al., 2000) and a triple mutation L234F/L235E/P331S causes a
profound decrease in binding to human CD64, CD32A, CD16 and C1q.
        Based on this knowledge several variants were described to make Fc-domain inactive
for interactions with Fcgamma receptors and C1q for therapeutic antibody development.
        For IgG1 mutating L234A and L235A and P331S were described (Hezareh M, et al.,. J
Virol 2001, 75:12161-12168, Xu D et al. Cell Immunol 2000, 200:16-26, Shields RL, et al. J
Biol Chem 2001, 276:6591-6604) and L234A combined with L235A was used in the clinic
(Herold KC, et al.. Diabetes 2005, 54:1763-1769). Hence, in one embodiment, the amino acid
in at least one position corresponding to L234, L235 and P331, may be A, A and S,
respectively.
        Also mutating these same positions to L234F and L235E was described to result in Fc
domains with abrogated interactions with FcGammaReceptors and C1q (Oganesyan Acta
Cryst. (2008). D64, 700-704, Canfield & Morrison, 1991 J Exp Med.;173 :1483-91., Duncan,
1988 Nature 332:738-40). Hence, in one embodiment, the amino acids in the positions
corresponding to L234 and L235, may be F and E, respectively.
        Mutating position D265A showed decreased binding to all FcyReceptors and prevented
ADCC (Shields RL et al. I Biol Chem 2001, 276:6591-6604). Hence, in one embodiment, the
amino acid in a position corresponding to D265, may be A.
        Binding to C1q could be abrogated by mutating positions D270, K322, P329, and P331
(Idusogie et al., J Immunol 2000, 164:4178-4184). Mutating these positions to either D270A
or K322A or P329A or P331A made the antibody deficient in CDC activity. Hence, in one
embodiment, the amino acids in at least one position corresponding to D270, K322, P329 and
P331, may be A, A, A, and A, respectively.
        An   alternative  approach  to   minimize  the  interaction  of the      Fc-domain  with
FcgammaReceptors and C1q is by removal of the glycosylation site of an antibody. Mutating
position N297 to eg Q, A, and E removes a glycosylation site which is critical for IgG-Fcgamma
receptor interactions (Tao and Morrison, J Immunol. 1989 Oct 15;143(8):2595-601, Bolt S et
al., Eur I Immunol 1993, 23:403-411). Hence, in one embodiment, the amino acid in a
position corresponding to N297, may be Q, A or E.
        Alternatively, human IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses are naturally compromised in their
interactions   with   C1q   and  FcgammaReceptors.     However,    residual    interactions with
FcyReceptors (FcgammaReceptors) have been described (Parren et al., J Clin Invest 1992,
90:1537-1546.).      Mutations abrogating these residual interactions have been described for
both isotypes and result in reduction of unwanted side-effects associated with FcR binding.
For IgG2 mutating L234A and G237A was described (Cole MS et al. J Immunol 1997,
159:3613-3621 and for IgG4 L235E was described (Reddy MP et al., J Immunol 2000,
164:1925-1933). Hence, in one embodiment, the amino acid in a position corresponding to
L234 and G237 in a human IgG2 heavy chain, may be A and A, respectively. In one
                                                  41

embodiment, the amino acid in a position corresponding to L235 in a human IgG4 heavy
chain, may be E.
        Other approaches to further minimize the interaction with FcgammaReceptors and C1q
IgG2 antibodies were described in WO 2011/066501 Al (PCT/US2010/058188) and Lightle,
S., et al.; Protein Science (19):753-62 (2010).
        Alternatively, the hinge region of the antibody is of importance with respect of
interactions with FcgammaReceptors and complement. Mutations in the hinge region have
been described to influence effector functions of an antibody (Brekke et al., J Immunol 2006,
177:1129-1138, Dall'Acqua WF, et al. J Immunol 2006, 177:1129-1138. Either mutating or
deleting the hinge region will affect Fc effector functions of an antibody.
        Hence, in one embodiment the first and/or second polypeptide of the dimeric protein
of the present invention may further comprise any of the above mentioned mutations which
inhibit or reduce one or more effector functions of the dimeric protein.
        Combining sets of mutations described above may result in an even more inert Fc
domain, for instance combining mutations L234F, L235E, D265A; or L234F, L235E, N297Q
and D265A in an IgG1 Fc-domain or other variations generated by the information described
above. Hence, in one embodiment, the amino acids in at least one or a combination of
positions corresponding to L234, L235, D265; or L234, L235, N297 and D265, may be F, E,
A, F, E, Q and A, respectively.
        In one embodiment the first and/or second polypeptide, e.g. both polypeptides of the
dimeric protein of the present invention may further comprise any combination of the above
mentioned mutations which inhibit or reduce one or more effector functions of the dimeric
protein.
        Typically, the effect of an antibody on an effector function may be measured by the
EC50 value, which is the concentration of the antibody necessary to obtain half the value of
the maximal lysis. This similarly applies to a dimeric protein of the present invention.
        Maximal lysis is the effect obtained when a saturating amount of the antibody is used
in which saturating is intended to refer to the amount of antibody at which all antigens for
the antibody are bound by the antibody. This similarly applies to a dimeric protein of the
present invention.
        Thus, in one embodiment, the first and/or second polypeptides of the dimeric protein
may further comprise amino acid substitutions in the amino acid positions corresponding to
L234, L235 and D265 in a human IgG1 heavy chain, which are F, E, and A, respectively.
        The term "decreasing an effector function" refers in the context of the present
invention that there is an increase in the EC50 value of the dimeric protein compared to the
parent dimeric protein, wherein parent dimeric protein has the meaning as described above.
The increase in the EC50 value may e.g. be at least or about 2-fold, such as at least or about
3-fold, or at least or about 5-fold, or at least or about 10-fold. Alternatively, "decreasing an
                                                    42

effector funtion" means that there is an decrease in the maximal amount of cells lysed by e.g.
from 10% to 100% of all cells, such as about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about
50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, and about 100% under conditions
where the parent dimeric protein lyses less than 100% of all cells.
        A dimeric protein could be tested for decreased effector function by cloning the variable
domain of the IgG1-005 or IgG1-7D8 heavy chain into the dimeric protein and test its efficacy
in CDC assays, such as described for Daudi (Example 3) and Wien (Example 6). Using an
IgG1-7D8 HC variable domain and Daudi cells, an decrease would be defined by a more than
2 fold higher EC50 than the EC50 of IgG1-7D8 under the studied condition, such as about 2
fold, about 3-fold, about 5-fold, about 10-fold or a more than 10-fold higher EC50 value, the
concentration at which half-maximal lysis is observed. Using an IgG1-005 HC variable domain
and Daudi cells, a decrease would be defined by a more than 2-fold higher EC50 than the
EC50 of IgG1-005 under the studied condition, such as about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 5
fold, about 10-fold or a more than 10-fold higher EC50 value, the concentration at which half
maximal lysis is observed. Using an IgG1-7D8 HC variable domain and Wien133 cells, an
decrease would be defined by a more than 2 fold higher EC50 than the EC50 of IgG1-7D8
under the studied condition, such as about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 5-fold, about 10-fold
or a more than 10-fold higher EC50 value, the concentration at which half-maximal lysis is
observed. Using an IgG1-005 HC variable domain and Wien133 cells, a decrease would be
defined by a decrease in the maximal lysis ranging from 10% to 100% of all cells, such as by
about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about
80%, about 90%, and about 100%. A decrease in CDC efficacy could also be defined by a
more than 2-fold higher EC50 than the EC50 of IgG1-005 under the studied condition, such
as about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 5-fold, about 10-fold or a more than 10-fold higher EC50
value, the concentration at which half-maximal lysis is observed under conditions where lysis
of Wien133 cells is detectable.
        FcRn is a major histocompatibility complex class I-related receptor and plays a role in
the passive delivery of immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs from mother to young and in the regulation of
serum IgG levels by protecting IgG from intracellular degradation (Ghetie V et al., Annu Rev
Immunol. 18, 739-66 (2000)). As FcRn is responsible for the extended persistence of IgG and
other Fc-conjugated proteins in the serum, modulating the FcRn-Fc interaction will allow the
deliberate control of the half-life of these agents in the circulation to various ends.
        In one embodiment, the dimeric protein may comprise other amino acid residues or
further, such as amino acid substitutions, which affect the pharmacokinetic profile, e.g. by
affecting binding to FcRn.
        In one embodiment, the plasma clearance of hexameric forms of dimeric proteins
according to the present invention is decreased, for example to allow lower dosing and
minimize adverse reactions caused by high doses, decrease frequency of injection, maximize
                                                    43

transcytosis to specific tissue sites, enhance efficiency of trans-placental delivery, or decrease
production costs.
         In a further embodiment, the first and/or second polypeptide, e.g. both polypeptides,
of the dimeric protein according to the present invention have been further modified e.g. in
the CH2 and/or CH3 region, for example, to improve the pharmacokinetic profile, e.g. via
improving the binding to FcRn, e.g. at pH 6.0. These modifications include, but are not limited
to, mutations at any one or more of amino acid positions P238, T250, M252, 1253, S254,

the residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index as in Kabat (Shields, R.L., et al, J Biol

680, 689 (1991)). Hence, in one embodiment, in the first and/or second, such as both,
polypeptides of the dimeric protein, an amino acid in at least one position corresponding to a
position selected from the group consisting of P238, T250, M252, 1253, S254, R255, T256,

         In an even further embodiment, the first and/or second polypeptide, e.g. both
polypeptides, of the dimeric protein according to the present invention have been further
modified to improve the pharmacokinetic profile, via improving the binding to FcRn by the
specific mutations N434A (Shields,         R.L., et al, J Biol Chem.      9, 6591-604 (2001)),

et al, J Immunol. 9, 5171-80 (2002)), wherein the numbering of the residues in the Fc region
is that of the EU index as in Kabat (Kabat, E.A. in US Department of Health and Human
Services, NIH publication n* 91-3242, 5th edition 662, 680, 689 (1991).            Hence, in one
embodiment, an amino acid in position corresponding to N434 may be A. In another
embodiment, amino acids in positions corresponding to T307, E380 and N434 may be A, A

positions T250 and M428 may be       Q and L, respectively. In another embodiment, amino acids
                                                     44

in positions in positions corresponding to M252, S254 and T256 may be Y, T and E,
respectively. Thus, in one embodiment, said first and/or second polypeptides of the dimeric
protein, may comprise amino acid substitutions in the amino acid positions corresponding to
E345, E430, N434, and S440 in a human IgG1 heavy chain, which are not E; not E; A; and Y
or W, respectively.
        In one embodiment the dimeric protein may comprise a substitution of one or more of
P238, T256, T307, Q311, D312, E380, E382, and N434 into an alanine residue improving
FcRn   binding (Shields RL, et    al. J. Biol.   Chem. 2001;276:6591);      or an  amino  acid
substitution or combination of amino acid substitutions selected from M252Y/S254T/T256E,

G385R/Q386T/P387R/N389P in IgG1, increasing the affinity for FcRn (Dall'Acqua et al.,
supra). Hence, in one embodiment, one or more amino acids in position(s) corresponding to
positions to those selected from the group consisting of P238, T256, T307, Q311, D312, E380,
E382 and N434 may, for each polypeptide of the dimeric protein, be an A for each position,
respectively. In another embodiment the amino acids in a positions corresponding to M252,
S254 and T256, may be Y, T and E, respectively; or in position corresponding to M252 may
be W; or in a position corresponding to M252 may be Y; or in positions corresponding to M252
and T256 may be Y and     Q, respectively; or in positions corresponding to M252 and T256 may
be F and D, respectively; or in positions corresponding to V308, L309 and Q311 may be T, P
and S, respectively; or in positions corresponding to G385, Q386 and N389 may be D, P and

or in positions corresponding to H433, N434 and Y436 may be R, Y and H, respectively; or in
positions corresponding to M252, S254, T256, H433, N434 and Y436 may be Y, T, E, K, F and

N389 may be Y, T, E, R, T, R and P, respectively.
        In one embodiment, the half-life of hexameric forms of the dimeric proteins according
to the present invention is shortened, for example to ensure rapid clearance of dimeric
proteins used for imaging and/or radioimmunotherapy, or promote clearance of pathogenic
target molecules.
        In a further embodiment, the first and/or second polypeptide, e.g. both polypeptides,
of the dimeric protein according to the present invention have been further modified e.g. in
the CH2 and/or CH3 region, for example, to modulate the pharmacokinetic profile, e.g. via
reducing or abrogating the binding to FcRn. These modifications include, but are not limited
to, mutations at any one or more of amino acid positions P238, T250, M252, 1253, S254,

corresponding to a position selected from the group consisting of P238, T250, M252, 1253,

        In an even further embodiment, the first and/or second polypeptide, e.g. both
polypeptides, of the dimeric protein according to the present invention have been further
modified to improve the pharmacokinetic profile, via reducing or abrogating the binding to
FcRn    by   the   specific mutations  1253A,   H310A,    H433A,   H435A,   Y436A,    mutations
I253A/H31OA/H435A (Kim, J. K. et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 29, 2819-2825 (1999), Shields, R.L.,
et al, J Biol Chem. 9, 6591-604 (2001)), wherein the numbering of the residues in the Fc
region is that of the EU index as in Kabat (Kabat, E.A. in US Department of Health and Human
Services, NIH publication n* 91-3242, 5th edition 662, 680, 689 (1991)).         Hence, in one
embodiment, an amino acid in at least one position corresponding to a position selected from
the group consisting of 1253, H310, H433, H435 and Y436, may be A for each position,
respectively. In another embodiment, the amino acids in positions corresponding to 1253,
H310A and H435A may each be A.
        Another example of other amino acid positions where the specific amino acid may be
relevant, e.g. where a parent dimeric protein is mutated to change the amino acid, may be
amino acids which affect the interaction in the Fc-region between dimeric proteins, e.g.
antibodies. Such mutations may be used to minimize the interaction of a therapeutic dimeric
protein, e.g. therapeutic antibody, with antibodies naturally present in a patient to whom the
therapeutic dimeric protein, e.g. therapeutic antibody, is administered.
        Such amino acid       residues or mutations      have  previously  been described     in
PCT/EP12/063339, and include combinations of two amino acid residues or mutations which
individually decrease an effector function but when used together, e.g. by combining two
                                                   46

dimeric proteins each comprising one of said amino acid residues or mutations the effector
function is similar to a parent dimeric protein where said amino acid residue is not mutated,
thus it corresponds to that of a human IgG1 heavy chain. When such two dimeric proteins,
each comprising one of such a pair of mutations, are used together, the specificity for
interaction between said two dimeric proteins may be increased compared to the interaction
between two dimeric proteins comprising only one of the mutations of such a pair of
mutations. Similarly, the interaction between two dimeric proteins each comprising one of
such a pair of mutations, may also be stronger than the interaction between a dimeric protein
comprising only one of the mutations of such a pair with a dimeric protein not comprising any
of the mutations of the pair.
        Hence, in one embodiment the first and/or second polypeptide of the dimeric protein
of the present invention may further comprise a mutation or amino acid residue according to
this aspect.
        Thus, without being bound by any theory, it is foreseen that by including such two
mutations in a therapeutic dimeric protein, the induction of C1q binding in a patient will be
limited to oligomeric complexes containing therapeutic dimeric protein, e.g. antibodies,
comprising such a combination or pair of amino acids. This may allow a reduction of any
potential side-effects caused by interaction of the therapeutic dimeric protein with the patients
own antibodies which do not comprise such mutations.
        In a particular embodiment, a dimeric protein may be used in combination with another
dimeric protein, wherein each of the dimeric proteins comprises one of the amino acids of
such a "pair" of amino acids. Thus, in one embodiment the present invention relates to a
dimeric protein comprising one of the amino acids of such a "pair" in the first and/or second
polypeptides. Such a dimeric protein, e.g. first dimeric protein, comprising one amino acid of
such a "pair" may be used together with a second dimeric protein comprising in the first
and/or second polypeptide the other amino acid of such a "pair". Examples of such amino
acids include those of Table 1. Thus, in a further embodiment, an amino acid in a position
corresponding to K439, S440, K447, 448 and 449 may be, for each polypeptide of the dimeric
protein of the present invention, as described in Table 1.

         In a further embodiment of the present invention at least one amino acid in a position
selected from the group consisting of Y436, D/E356, T359, E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254

     E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254 is not Y; D or E; T; E; N; Q; I; and S, for each position,

     one or both, such as each, polypeptides in the dimeric protein, K.
              As described in the Examples 3-5, antibody variants comprising only one of the K439E
     and S440K mutations had a drastically increased           KD  for C1q,  reflecting a decreased
     complement activation and/or CDC capability. Surprisingly, it was found that antibody
     variants of HuMAb 7D8 or 005 comprising both mutations had a restored or increased C1q
     binding or CDC. Without being bound by any specific theory, the underlying mechanism could
     perhaps be explained by the respective mutations sterically compensating for each other, as
     illustrated in Figure 4.

the same or identical amino acid substitutions according to any aspect or embodiment of the
present invention.

        In another embodiment, the dimeric protein of the present invention is a heterodimer.
        In a further embodiment, at least one of the polypeptides comprises a binding region
that specifically binds to a target. In a further embodiment, each polypeptide of the
heterodimeric protein comprises a binding region specifically binding to a target, optionally
the same target.
        The target may be any of those described herein.
        In a further embodiment the binding regions of the first and second polypeptide of the
heterodimeric protein may bind to different epitopes on the same target. In another
embodiment the binding regions of the first and second polypeptide of the heterodimeric
protein may bind to different targets.
        In another embodiment, the binding regions of the first and second polypeptide of the
heterodimeric protein may bind to different targets on different cells.
        In a particular embodiment, the heterodimeric protein may be a bispecific antibody.
        In a further embodiment the binding regions of the first and second polypeptide of
said heterodimeric antibody may bind to different epitopes on the same target. In another
embodiment the binding regions of the first and second polypeptide of said heterodimeric
antibody may bind to different targets.
        In another embodiment, the binding regions of the first and second polypeptide of the
heterodimeric protein may bind to different targets on different cells.
        If the dimeric protein is a heterodimeric protein, the amino acids at the positions
corresponding to E345, E430 and at least one position selected from the group consisting of
S440, Y436, D/E356, T359, E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254 in a human IgG1 heavy chain,
may in one embodiment be different in the first and second polypeptide, however, they may
also in another embodiment be the same.
        Said amino acids may for example be different if the heterodimeric protein is produced
as described in W02011/131746.
        The bispecific antibody of the present invention is not limited to a particular format
and it may be any of those described herein.

         Exemplary bispecific antibody molecules which may be used in the present invention
comprise (i) a single antibody that has two arms comprising different antigen-binding regions,
(ii) a single chain antibody that has specificity to two different epitopes, e.g., via two scFvs
linked in tandem by an extra peptide linker; (iii) a dual-variable-domain antibody (DVD-Ig),
where each light chain and heavy chain contains two variable domains in tandem through a
short peptide linkage (Wu et al., Generation and Characterization of a Dual Variable Domain
Immunoglobulin (DVD-Ig TM ) Molecule, In: Antibody Engineering, Springer Berlin Heidelberg
(2010)); (iv) a chemically-linked bispecific (Fab')2 fragment; (v) a Tandab, which is a fusion
of two single chain diabodies resulting in a tetravalent bispecific antibody that has two binding
sites for each of the target antigens; (vi) a flexibody, which is a combination of scFvs with a
diabody resulting in a multivalent molecule; (vii) a so called "dock and lock" molecule, based
on the "dimerization and docking domain" in Protein Kinase A, which, when applied to Fabs,
can yield a trivalent bispecific binding protein consisting of two identical Fab fragments linked
to a different Fab fragment; (viii) a so-called Scorpion molecule, comprising, e.g., two scFvs
fused to both termini of a human Fab-arm; and (ix) a diabody.
         In one embodiment, the bispecific antibody of the present invention is a diabody, a
cross-body, or a bispecific antibody obtained via a controlled Fab arm exchange (such as
described in WO 11/131746) as those described in the present invention.
         Examples of different classes of bispecific antibodies include but are not limited to

binding region of the first and second polypeptide may bind to different targets.
        In another embodiment, the binding region of the first and second polypeptide may

each of the polypeptides of the heterodimeric protein. In another particular embodiment, the

human IgG1 heavy chain, is not E, the amino acid in at least one position corresponding to a
position selected from the group consisting of S440, Y436, D/E356, T359, E382, N434, Q438,

Fc-fusion proteins
        In one aspect of the present invention, the dimeric protein according to any aspect or
embodiment of the invention is part of a fusion protein. A fusion protein according to the
invention may refer to a protein consisting of two or more covalently linked protein fragments
which are not naturally expressed as a single protein. Fusion proteins may e.g. be produced
by recombinant cloning and expression technologies commonly known in the art, or the
method of creating fusion proteins may be post-production. Examples of such processes are
intein, protein ligase, or other enzymatic processes commonly known in the art. Thus, a fusion
protein according to the present invention is understood to be said dimeric protein comprising
a first and a second polypeptide, each comprise at least a CH2 and CH3 region of an
immunoglobulin heavy chain, wherein said first and/or second polypeptide may further
comprise a binding region.
        Thus, the first and/or second polypeptides of the dimeric protein according to the
invention may further comprise a binding region. A binding region according to the invention
is understood to be a polypeptide sequence which is capable of binding to a target. Thus, the
binding region may be a protein, protein ligand, receptor, an antigen-binding region, or a
                                                   58

ligand-binding region capable of binding to a target associated with a cell, bacterium, virion,
or the like. A binding region may, for example, comprise part of a receptor, receptor ligand,
ligand, cytokine, hormone, or antigen-binding region of an immunoglobulin or antibody.
        In one embodiment, the binding region is a cytokine which is selected from the group
consisting of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-18, IL-23, IL-24, IL-27,
IL-28a, IL-28b, IL-29, KGF, IFNa, IFNS, IFNy, GM-CSF, CD40L, Flt3 ligand, stem cell factor,
ancestim, and TNFa.
        In one embodiment, the binding region is an antigen-binding region. In some
embodiments, said first and/or second polypeptides of said dimeric protein comprise, in
addition to the Fc region, one or more or all of the other regions of an antibody, i.e. a CH1
region, a VH region, a CL region and/or a VL region. Thus, in one embodiment, said first
polypeptide is a full-length antibody. In another embodiment, said second polypeptide is a
full-length antibody.
        In another embodiment, the binding region is a toxin, such as a naturally occurring
toxin.

        In one aspect, the dimeric protein the present invention, further comprises a drug,
toxin, radiolabel, radioopaque agent, paramagnetic agent, fluorescent agent, phosphorescent
agent, ultrasound enhancing agent, sialylation, or polyethyleneglycol (PEG),         optionally
conjugated to at least one of the polypeptides via a linker.
        In one embodiment said dimeric protein is part of a fusion protein.
        In one embodiment, the dimeric protein of the invention comprises a radiolabel.
        In one embodiment, the dimeric protein of the invention comprises a radiopaque
agent.

        In another aspect, the dimeric protein of the invention is not conjugated at the C
terminus to another molecule, such as a toxin or label. In one embodiment, the dimeric
protein is conjugated to another molecule at another site, typically at a site which does not
interfere with oligomer formation. For example, the dimeric protein may, at the other site, be
                                                  59

linked to a compound selected from the group consisting of a toxin (including a radioisotope)
a prodrug or a drug. Such a compound may make killing of target cells more effective, e.g.
in cancer therapy. The resulting dimeric protein is thus an immunoconjugate.
        Thus, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a dimeric protein, such as an
antibody linked or conjugated to one or more therapeutic moieties, such as a cytotoxin, a
chemotherapeutic drug, a cytokine, an immunosuppressant, and/or a radioisotope. Such
conjugates    are   referred  to    herein  as "immunoconjugates"       or   "drug   conjugates".
Immunoconjugates which include one or more cytotoxins are referred to as "immunotoxins".

Pastan et al., Cell 47, 641 (1986) and Goldenberg, Calif. A Cancer Journal for Clinicians 44,
43 (1994). Therapeutic agents that may be administered in combination with a dimeric protein
of the present invention as described elsewhere herein, such as, e.g., anti-cancer cytokines
or chemokines, are also candidates for therapeutic moieties useful for conjugation to a dimeric
protein of the present invention.
        In one embodiment, the drug conjugates of the present invention comprise a dimeric
protein as disclosed herein conjugated to auristatins or auristatin peptide analogs and
derivates (US5635483;         US5780588).     Auristatins   have  been  shown to interfere  with
microtubule dynamics, GTP hydrolysis and nuclear and cellular division (Woyke et al (2001)
Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45(12): 3580-3584) and have anti-cancer (US5663149)
and anti-fungal activity (Pettit et al., (1998) Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 42:2961
2965. The auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the dimeric protein via a linker, through
the N (amino) terminus or the C (carboxy) terminus of the peptidic drug moiety.
        Exemplary      auristatin embodiments       include   the N-terminus-linked monomethyl
auristatin drug moieties DE and DF, disclosed in Senter et al., Proceedings of the American
Association for Cancer Research. Volume 45, abstract number 623, presented March 28, 2004
and described in US 2005/0238649).
        An exemplary auristatin embodiment is MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E). Another
exemplary auristatin embodiment is MMAF (monomethyl auristatin F).
        In one embodiment, a dimeric protein of the present invention comprises a conjugated
nucleic acid or nucleic acid-associated molecule. In one such embodiment, the conjugated
nucleic acid is a cytotoxic ribonuclease, an antisense nucleic acid, an inhibitory RNA molecule
(e.g., a siRNA molecule) or an immunostimulatory nucleic acid (e.g., an immunostimulatory
CpG motif-containing DNA molecule). In another embodiment, a dimeric protein of the
present invention is conjugated to an aptamer or a ribozyme.
        In one embodiment, dimeric proteins comprising one or more radiolabeled amino acids
are provided. A radiolabeled dimeric protein may be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic
purposes (conjugation to radiolabeled molecules is another possible feature). Non-limiting
examples of labels for polypeptides include 3H, 14C, 15N, 35S, 90Y, 99Tc, and 1251, 1311,
and 186Re. Methods for preparing radiolabeled amino acids and related peptide derivatives
are known in the art, (see, for instance Junghans et al., in Cancer Chemotherapy and
Biotherapy 655-686 ( 2 "d Ed., Chafner and Longo, eds., Lippincott Raven (1996)) and U.S.
4,681,581; U.S. 4,735,210; U.S. 5,101,827; U.S. 5,102,990 (US RE35,500), U.S. 5,648,471

and U.S. 5,697,902. For example, a radioisotope may be conjugated by the chloramine-T
method.
         In one embodiment, the dimeric protein of the present invention is conjugated to a
radioisotope or to a radioisotope-containing chelate. For example, the dimeric protein can be
conjugated to a chelator linker, e.g. DOTA, DTPA or tiuxetan, which allows for the dimeric
protein to be complexed with a radioisotope. The dimeric protein may also or alternatively
comprise or be conjugated to one or more radiolabeled amino acids or other radiolabeled
molecule. A radiolabeled dimeric protein may be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic
purposes. In one embodiment the dimeric protein of the present invention is conjugated to
an alpha-emitter. Non-limiting examples of radioisotopes include 3 H,     14 C, 15N, 35S, 90Y, 99Tc,

         In one embodiment the dimeric protein of the present invention may be conjugated to
a cytokine selected from the group consisting of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13,
IL-15, IL-18, IL-23, IL-24, IL-27, IL-28a, IL-28b, IL-29, KGF, IFNa, IFNS, IFNy, GM-CSF,
CD40L, Flt3 ligand, stem cell factor, ancestim, and TNFa.
         Dimeric proteins of the present invention may also be chemically modified by covalent
conjugation to a polymer to for instance increase their circulating half-life. Exemplary
polymers, and methods to attach them to peptides, are illustrated in for instance US
4,766,106; US 4,179,337; US 4,495,285 and US 4,609,546. Additional polymers include
polyoxyethylated polyols and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (e.g., a PEG with a molecular weight
of between about 1,000 and about 40,000, such as between about 2,000 and about 20,000).
         Any method known in the art for conjugating the dimeric protein of the present
invention to the conjugated molecule(s), such as those described above, may be employed,
including the methods described by Hunter et al., Nature 144, 945 (1962), David et al.,
Biochemistry 13, 1014 (1974), Pain et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 40, 219 (1981) and Nygren, J.
Histochem. and Cytochem. 30, 407 (1982). Such dimeric proteins may be produced by
chemically conjugating the other moiety to the N-terminal side or C-terminal side of the
dimeric protein or fragment thereof (e.g., an antibody H or L chain) (see, e.g., Antibody
Engineering Handbook, edited by Osamu Kanemitsu, published by Chijin Shokan (1994)).
Such conjugated dimeric protein derivatives may also be generated by conjugation at internal
residues or sugars, where appropriate.
         The agents may be coupled either directly or indirectly to a dimeric protein of the
present invention. One example of indirect coupling of a second agent is coupling via a spacer
or linker moiety to cysteine or lysine residues in a bispecific antibody. In one embodiment, a
dimeric protein is conjugated to a prodrug molecule that can be activated in vivo to a
therapeutic drug via a spacer or linker. In some embodiments, the linker is cleavable under
intracellular conditions, such that the cleavage of the linker releases the drug unit from the
dimeric protein in the intracellular environment. In some embodiments, the linker is cleavable
                                                       62

by a cleavable agent that is present in the intracellular environment (e. g. within a lysosome
or endosome or caveola). For example, the spacers or linkers may be cleavable by tumor-cell
associated enzymes or other tumor-specific conditions, by which the active drug is formed.
Examples of such prodrug         techologies and      linkers are described     in W002083180,
W02004043493, W02007018431, W02007089149, W02009017394 and W0201062171 by
Syntarga BV, et al. Suitable antibody-prodrug technology and duocarmycin analogs can also
be found in U.S. Patent No. 6,989,452 (Medarex), incorporated herein by reference. The linker
can also or alternatively be, e.g. a peptidyl linker that is cleaved by an intracellular peptidase
or protease enzyme, including but not limited to, a lysosomal or endosomal protease. In some
embodiments, the peptidyl linker is at least two amino acids long or at least three amino acids
long. Cleaving agents can include cathepsins B and D and plasmin, all of which are known to
hydrolyze dipeptide drug derivatives resulting in the release of active drug inside the target
cells (see e. g. Dubowchik and Walker, 1999, Pharm. Therapeutics 83:67-123). In a specific
embodiment, the peptidyl linker cleavable by an intracellular protease is a Val-Cit (valine
citrulline) linker or a Phe-Lys (phenylalanine-lysine) linker (see e.g. US6214345, which
describes the synthesis of doxorubicin with the Val-Cit linker and different examples of Phe
Lys linkers). Examples of the structures of a Val-Cit and a Phe-Lys linker include but are not
limited to MC-vc-PAB described below, MC-vc-GABA, MC-Phe-Lys-PAB or MC-Phe-Lys-GABA,
wherein MC is an abbreviation for maleimido caproyl, vc is an abbreviation for Val-Cit, PAB is
an abbreviation for p-aminobenzylcarbamate and GABA is an abbreviation for y-aminobutyric
acid. An advantage of using intracellular proteolytic release of the therapeutic agent is that
the agent is typically attenuated when conjugated and the serum stabilities of the conjugates
are typically high.
         In yet another embodiment, the linker unit is not cleavable and the drug is released
by dimeric protein or antibody degradation (see US 2005/0238649). Typically, such a linker
is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment. As used herein, "not
substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment" in the context of a linker means that
no more than 20%, typically no more than about 15%, more typically no more than about
10%, and even more typically no more than about 5%, no more than about 3%, or no more
than about 1% of the linkers, in a sample of dimeric protein drug conjugate compound, are
cleaved when the dimeric protein drug conjugate compound is present in an extracellular
environment (e.g. plasma). Whether a linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular
environment can be determined for example by incubating the dimeric protein drug conjugate
compound with plasma for a predetermined time period (e.g. 2, 4, 8, 16 or 24 hours) and
then quantitating the amount of free drug present in the plasma. Exemplary embodiments
comprising MMAE or MMAF and various linker components have the following structures
(wherein Ab means antibody and p, representing the drug-loading (or average number of
                                                    63

        In one embodiment, the dimeric protein of the present invention is attached to a
chelator linker, e.g. tiuxetan, which allows for e.g. a bispecific antibody to be conjugated to
a radioisotope.
        In one embodiment, the dimeric protein is conjugated to toxins or payloads, such as
drugs, which have optimal function at a lower pH than neutral pH.
        In one embodiment, both the first and second polypeptide of the dimeric protein is
coupled directly or indirectly to the same one or more therapeutic moieties.
        In one embodiment, only the first or second polypeptide        of the dimeric protein is
coupled directly or indirectly to one or more therapeutic moieties.
        In one embodiment, the first and second polypeptide of the dimeric protein is coupled
directly or indirectly to different therapeutic moieties. For example, in embodiments where
the dimeric protein is a bispecific antibody and is prepared by controlled Fab-arm exchange
of two different monospecific antibodies, e.g. a first and second antibody such bispecific
antibodies can be obtained by using monospecific antibodies which are conjugated or
associated with different therapeutic moieties.
Oligomer
        The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery that dimeric proteins
comprising    at least the CH2 and CH3           regions, and  optionally a hinge region, of
immunoglobulin heavy chains can form oligomers such as hexamers not only when bound to
a target molecule but also in solution. The oligomerization occurs via non-covalent association
of adjacent Fc-regions, and has in particular been observed for antibodies having mutations
in E345, E430 and S440, as described in the Examples.
        In one aspect the present invention relates to an oligomer comprising at least two
non-covalently associated dimeric proteins, each according to any aspect or embodiment
herein described.
        In one embodiment, the invention provides a hexamer comprising six non-covalently
associated dimeric proteins, each according to any one of the preceding aspects or
embodiments. In one embodiment, at least one, such as at least two, at least three, at least
four, at least five or six dimeric proteins of the hexamer are antibodies.
        In one embodiment, the invention provides an oligomer comprising six non-covalently
associated dimeric proteins, at least one of which is a dimeric protein according to any aspect
or embodiment of the invention and at least one of which is an antibody comprising an Fc
domain comprising at least CH2 and CH3 regions and optionally a hinge region.

comprising an Fc domain comprising at least CH2, CH3 and hinge regions in which at least
one of the positions corresponding to E345, E430 and S440 in a human IgG1 heavy chain, is
                                                     65

antibody, the monoclonal antibody optionally selected from the known antibodies denoted
"second antibodies" in the section below.

and the chosen mode of administration. Suitability for carriers and other components of
pharmaceutical compositions is determined based on the lack of significant negative impact
on the desired biological properties of the dimeric protein or pharmaceutical composition of
the present invention (e.g., less than a substantial impact (10%        or less relative inhibition,
5% or less relative inhibition, etc.)) on antigen binding.
         A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may also include diluents,
fillers, salts, buffers, detergents (e.g., a nonionic detergent, such as Tween-20 or Tween-80),
stabilizers (e.g., sugars, sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and mannitol, or protein-free amino
acids), preservatives, tissue fixatives, solubilizers, and/or other materials suitable for
inclusion in a pharmaceutical composition.
          Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include any and all suitable solvents, dispersion
media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonicity agents, antioxidants and
absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible with a dimeric
protein of the present invention.
          Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include water, saline, phosphate
buffered saline, ethanol, dextrose, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene
                                                      66

glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, corn oil,
peanut oil, cottonseed oil, and sesame oil, carboxymethyl cellulose colloidal solutions,
tragacanth gum and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate, and/or various buffers.
Other carriers are well known in the pharmaceutical arts.
        Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions
and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or
dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known
in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the dimeric
protein, use thereof in the pharmaceutical          compositions of the present invention is
contemplated.
        Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such
as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by
the use of surfactants.
        Pharmaceutical     compositions    of  the    present  invention   may    also  comprise
pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants for instance (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as
ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite
and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole
(BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the
like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
(EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.
        Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also comprise isotonicity
agents, such as sugars, polyalcohols, such as mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol or sodium chloride
in the compositions.
        The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also contain one or
more adjuvants appropriate for the chosen route of administration such as preservatives,
wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, preservatives or buffers, which may
enhance the shelf life or effectiveness of the pharmaceutical composition. The dimeric protein
of the present invention may be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against
rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal
patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Such carriers may include gelatin, glyceryl
monostearate, glyceryl distearate, biodegradable, biocompatible polymers such as ethylene
vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid
alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in the art. Methods for the preparation of
such formulations are generally known to those skilled in the art. See e.g., Sustained and
Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J.R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York,
1978.
        In one embodiment, the dimeric protein of the present invention may be formulated
to ensure proper distribution in vivo. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for parenteral
                                                     67

administration include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the
extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The use of such
media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art. Except insofar
as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the dimeric protein, use thereof in
the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is contemplated. Supplementary
active compounds may also be incorporated into the compositions.
         Pharmaceutical compositions for injection must typically be sterile and stable under
the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition may be formulated as a solution,
microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The
carrier may be an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent or dispersion medium containing for
instance water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and
the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic
esters, such as ethyl oleate. The proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use
of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of
dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic
agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium
chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions may be
brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example,
monostearate salts and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions may be prepared by incorporating
the dimeric protein in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination
of ingredients e.g. as enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration.
Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the dimeric protein into a sterile vehicle
that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients e.g. from those
enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable
solutions, examples of methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying
lyophilizationn) that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired
ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.

pH
         The compositions of the invention may comprise a suitable buffer system to control
the pH and thereby the oligomerization state of the dimeric protein(s) present. For example,
at a pH of 6.4 or below, such as at pH 5.0, a dimeric protein according to the invention is
typically predominantly in monomeric form, i.e. a single dimeric protein, whereas at above
pH 6.4, such as at pH 6.8, a dimeric protein is predominantly in oligomeric form, such as
hexamer form. The hexameric form of the dimeric protein, is composed of six dimeric proteins
which non-covalently associate with each other to form a hexameric form. The term
"monomeric form" in the context of dimeric protein according to the present invention refers
to a single, individual dimeric protein, which is composed of dimeric proteins that do not
associate non-covalently with each other. Example 31 describes how this can be observed by
adjusting pH.
         In one embodiment, the composition comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
which is an aqueous buffered solution.
         In one embodiment, the pH of the aqueous buffered solution is at least about 6.5, such
as from 6.5 to about 9.0, such as from about 7.0 to about 8.0, such as about 7.4. Buffer
systems suitable for maintaining a pH in this range and/or near physiological pH include
phosphate buffer systems. Thus, in one embodiment, the aqueous buffered solution is a
phosphate buffer system. In one embodiment, the dimeric protein is predominantly in
oligomeric form, such as hexameric form, in a phosphate buffer at a pH of about 6.8.
         In one embodiment, the pH of the aqueous buffered solution is less than pH 6.5, such
as from about 4.0 to 6.4, such as from about 5.0 to about 6.0. Buffer systems suitable for
maintaining a pH in this range include citrate, acetate, histidine and/or glycine-based buffer
systems. Thus, in one embodiment, the buffer system is an acetate, histidine, glycine, citrate,
nicotinate, lactate, and/or succinate based buffer system. Such buffer systems may also be a
combination of buffer systems.In one embodiment, the dimeric protein is predominantly in
monomeric form, i.e. single dimeric protein, at a pH of less than 6.0, such as about 5.0.
         As shown in Example 31, the oligomerization of the dimeric protein according to the
invention is a reversible process which may be controlled by pH. This could be useful for
application in processing during manufacturing of the dimeric protein, such as the purification
steps wherein clotting of e.g. purification columns, translaminar flow filtration, dead-end
filtration and/or nanofiltration devices can be avoided by lowering the pH without
compromising the efficacy of the final product, such as an antibody. Furthermore, lowering
the pH below 6.8, e.g. 5.0 and 5.5, during purification can improve purification yields as the
dimeric protein is predominantly in monomeric form and thereby less likely to clot than the
hexameric form of the dimeric protein, as demonstrated by Example 32. Furthermore,
lowering the pH below 6.8 during purification can enable removal of non-specific aggregates
by chromatography, such as using weak cation exchange resins. Thus, once the dimeric
                                                  69

protein has been purified at a pH below 6.8, the oligomeric, e.g. hexameric, form may be
restored by increasing the pH of the solution to a pH around 6.8.
Mixtures
         In some aspects, the invention provides compositions comprising a dimeric protein
and a second molecule, wherein the second molecule also comprises a first and a second
polypeptide, each comprising at least CH2, CH3 and hinge regions of an immunoglobulin
heavy chain. Thus, the dimeric protein is to be understood as the dimeric protein according
to any aspect or embodiment of the present invention, such as dimeric protein of a parent
dimeric protein, such as a variant dimeric protein of a parent dimeric protein.
        Advantageously, the relative amounts of the dimeric protein(s) and the second
molecule in the compositions can be adjusted to modulate the average number of units of
each different dimeric protein in the oligomers/hexamers formed. This, in turn, provides a
means for optimizing effector function and/or target-binding properties, when one or more of
the dimeric protein(s) and the second molecules bind(s) a target.
         Specific aspects and embodiments of compositions comprising mixtures of a dimeric
protein and a second molecule are described below. While applicable to all types of dimeric
proteins according to the invention and all types of Fc-containing second molecules, including,
e.g., Fc-fusion proteins with ligand-binding regions, antibody molecules are particularly
contemplated for both components.
         In one aspect, the composition of the invention comprises a first dimeric protein
according to any aspect or embodiment of the invention, a second dimeric protein according
to any aspect or embodiment of the invention, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
         In one aspect, the second molecule is one in which at least one of the amino acids at
the positions corresponding to E345, E430 and S440 in a human IgG1 heavy chain is the one
normally present at this position in a native IgG1 heavy chain. For example, the heavy-chain
polypeptides of the second molecule may comprise E, E and S at each of the positions
corresponding to E345, E430 and S440, respectively. According to this aspect, the second
molecule may thus comprise, e.g., the native Fc region sequences of a human IgG1, IgG2,
IgG3, IgG4, IgAl, IgA2, IgD, IgE or IgM antibody, or in particular at least IgG1, IgG2, IgG3,
or IgG4 Fc sequences without amino acid substitutions in all three of E345, E430 and S440.
         In one embodiment, the second molecule is an antibody, in particular a well-known
antibody already in clinical or pre-clinical use, such as an antibody which has a suitable safety
profile. In a further embodiment, said second antibody may have a suitable safety profile but
may not be sufficiently efficacious.
         In one embodiment, also the dimeric protein is an antibody, so that the composition
comprises a first antibody and a second antibody, wherein only the first antibody is a dimeric
protein of the invention. The combination of a first antibody which comprises mutations
                                                     70

capable of increasing an effector function and a second antibody which does not comprise
such a mutation may, as shown in Example 17 provide an increased effector function. Thus,
without being bound by theory, it is believed that e.g. this method may be used to combine
a therapeutic antibody, as a second antibody, which has been proven to be safe but not
efficient enough on its own for a specific application, with a dimeric protein according to the
invention, thereby resulting in a combination which is efficacous.

        In one embodiment, both said first and second dimeric proteins comprise the indicated
amino acids in both said first and second polypeptides.
        In some embodiments, the amino acids at certain positions in the heavy chain
polypeptides differ between the first and second dimeric proteins to adjust the strength or
specificity of the non-covalent association of the two dimeric proteins. This can be achieved,
e.g., by using first and/or second dimeric proteins having specific amino acids at the positions
corresponding to K439, S440, K447, K448, and/or K449, as described above.
        In one embodiment, the polypeptides of the first dimeric protein comprise an amino
acid in the position corresponding to K439 which is not K, and the polypeptides of the second
dimeric protein comprise an amino acid in the position corresponding to S440 which is not S,
with the proviso that the amino acid in S440 is not Y or W. For example, in the first dimeric
protein, the amino acid in the position corresponding to K439 can be D or E, and in the second
dimeric protein, the amino acid in the position corresponding to S440 can be K, H or R, such
as K or R. A similar strategy can be used for combinations of amino acids in the positions
corresponding to K447, 448 and 449. Table 2 shows exemplary amino acids for these positions
in the first dimeric protein and second dimeric protein to be used together, separated by a
"+"-sign. In any one of these aspects and embodiments, one or both of the first and second
dimeric proteins can be an antibody (e.g., Ab1 and Ab2, respectively).

at a pH below 6.8, such as between 5.0 and 6.5, e.g. between 5.0 and 6.0, e.g. between 5.0
to 5.5, and subsequently raising the pH above 6.8 or above pH 7.0. Buffers for adjusting the
pH may be any of those described herein.
Kit-of-parts
         The present invention also relates to a kit-of-parts comprising a first dimeric protein
according to any aspect or embodiment described herein, and a second dimeric protein
according to any aspect or embodiment described herein, for simultaneous, separate or
sequential use in imaging, diagnostic or therapy.
Uses
         As described herein the dimeric protein of the present invention forms hexameric
structures in solution, thereby resembling IgM molecules. Furthermore, as described above
combinations of a first and second dimeric protein of the present invention, or optionally a
second molecule which is not a dimeric protein according to the invention, wherein the
different components of the combination bind to different epitopes on the same target is
foreseen to create compositions which resemble polyclonal antibody compositions. These
features and other features of the dimeric protein of the present invention make it particularly
suitable for certain applications.
                                                   82

IgM like feature
  *     IgM has a major role in immune response to infectious organisms. It is a potent
        activator of the classical complement pathway.
  *     Antibodies against carbohydrates are often of IgM isotype. Carbohydrates are potential
        targets for treatment of bacterial, fungal or viral infections, cancer and autoimmune
        diseases.
  *     IgM antibodies are described to have immune regulatory properties and to be
        protective in a number of autoimmune diseases, like lupus (SLE)             and multiple
        sclerosis. IgM would also have a protective role in atherosclerosis, myocardial
        infarction and stroke, cerebral small      vessel disease and Alzheimer's         disease.
        (Groenwall et al 2012, Frontiers in Immunology 3, 1-10)
  *     Naturally occurring antibodies to cancer cells are often of IgM isotype.
  *     IgM (and polymeric IgA) has a function in immune exclusion on the luminal side of
        mucosal surfaces. For passive immunization, protective levels of IgM (and polymeric
        IgA) can be delivered directly to mucosal surfaces.
  *     IgM based products are being developed for autoimmune, cancer and infection
        indications.
        The dimeric protein of the present invention could mimick the IgM-like features of
listed above when in a pH adjusted, such as pH 6.5 to 7.0, solution, and it is therefore foreseen
that the dimeric protein of the invention can be used for treatment of any of said indications.
        In addition, by adjusting the pH of the solution, the dimeric proteins of the invention
can be in monomeric, i.e. as a single dimeric protein, or hexameric form (as described in
Example 32). The term "monomeric form" in the context of dimeric protein according to the
present invention refers to a single, individual dimeric protein, which is composed of dimeric
proteins that do not associate non-covalently with each other. When referring to a "hexameric
form" it is to be understood as a complex of six non-covalently associated single dimeric
proteins. It is foreseen that standard production and purification methods used for IgG
molecules can be used for the dimeric proteins of the invention when they are in monomeric
form, such as, but not limited to, the use of protein A resins and protein A variant resins for
purification, and the use of protein A and protein A variant based immunoglobulin domain
detection assays for example applied in process control, and the use of cation exchange
chromatography for concomitant aggregate removal during protein purification, and the use
of nanofiltration for viral clearance, thus avoiding problems often encountered when
producing or purifying IgM proteins.
Fast clearance
                                                   83

  *     The hexameric form of dimeric proteins of the present invention is rapidly cleared
        unless when combined with technologies preventing rapid clearance as described
        herein. Fab fragment products, also being cleared rapidly, are being developed/used
        for treatment of poisoning, poison intoxication, and to deplete excess or abundant
        ligands and/or soluble factors.
  *     Dimeric proteins of the present invention could have similar applications.
  *     Dimeric    proteins  of the    present    invention  could    also   be  used  to  deplete
        soluble/shedded forms of membrane proteins that would form a sink for cell-targeted
        therapy.
Polyclonal aspects
  *     Polyclonal antibody products have the potential of synergistic action (better efficacy),
        and could overcome acquired therapy resistance.
  *     Polyclonal antibody products are developed/being used for treatment of viral or
        bacterial infections, envenomation, (immune thrombocytopenic purpura),             Digoxin
        toxicity, renal transplant acute rejection and cancer.
        The dimeric protein of the present invention, thus, has similar applications and is
therefore suitable for use in the treatment of any of said indications.
        Thus, in one embodiment the dimeric proteins of the present invention may be used
for treatment of any of the following indications: Autoimmune diseases, including systemic
lupus erythematodes (SLE), multiple sclerosis, Neuromyelitis optica, Sjogrens syndrome,

granulomatosis,      Microscopic    polyangiitis,    Churg-Strauss      syndrome,     Polymyositis,
Scleromyositis, Myasthenia gravis,        Lambert-Eaton     myasthenic syndrome,       Hashimoto's

mellitus type 1, ataxia, Epilepsia partialis continua, Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,
Pernicious anemia, Addison's anemia, Autoimmune gonadal failure, Autoimmune hemolytic

Goodpasture's syndrome, Myocarditis, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, Crohn's disease and
ulcerative colitis, cancer, bacterial infections, viral and fungal infections, poisoning and
envenomation, or vascular or other diseases.
                                                     84

        Examples of cancer, include but are not limited to various cancer types such as: tumors
of the central nervous system, head and neck cancer, lung cancer (such as non-small cell
lung cancer), breast cancer cancer (such as triple-negative breast cancer), esophageal
cancer, stomach cancer, liver and biliary cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder
cancer, kidney cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, malignant
melanoma, sarcoma (soft tissue eg. bone and muscle), tumors of unknown primary origin
(i.e. unknown primaries), leukemia, bone marrow cancer (such as multiple myeloma) acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), skin cancer, glioma, cancer of the brain, uterus, and rectum.
        Thus, in one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for preventing or
treating a disease, such as cancer, auto-immune diseases, infections, diabetes mellitus, organ
transplant rejections, ophthalmological diseases and C1q depletion in the humeral system,
comprising administration of a dimeric protein, oligomer, hexamer, composition, kit-of-parts
according to any aspect or embodiment of the present invention.
        In one embodiment, the cancer is a tumor, such as a brain tumor. The dimeric protein
according to the invention may be used to mechanically obstruct blood flow in tumor blood
vessels by injection directly into the tumor, such as brain tumors. The dimeric protein
according to any aspect or embodiment of the present invention, may be particularly useful
to induce mechanical obstruction in tumors due to its capability to form oligomers, such as
dimer, trimers, and hexamers. When the dimeric protein, such as an antibody, according to
the present invention is used in the treatment of cancer it is particularly useful in overcoming
suppression of effector mechanisms due to the low pH of the tumor microenvironment.
        In one embodiment, the dimeric protein, oligomer, hexamer, composition or kit-of
parts according to any aspect or embodiment of the present invention, is for use in the
treatment of tumors by making use of pH-dependent delivery of toxins or payloads/drugs. In
such uses the lower pH at the tumor site can be exploited when the dimeric protein, such as
an antibody, of the present invention is fused to a toxin or drug that has optimal function at
the lower pH at the tumor site.
        In one embodiment, the method comprises the steps of administering to the
bloodstream a first dimeric protein according to any aspect or embodiment of the invention
linked to a first pro-drug, and a second dimeric protein according to any aspect or embodiment
of the invention linked to a second pro-drug.
        In one aspect, the        present invention   relates to a method       of inducing   an
immunomodulatory effector function, such as mediated through CD32b and KIR, wherein the
method comprises administration of the dimeric protein, oligomer, hexamer, composition or
kit-of-parts according to any aspect or embodiment of the present invention, optionally
combined with sialylation of the dimeric protein. In such a method, the dimeric protein of the
invention    will  induce clustering   of the target     molecules and     thereby    induce the
                                                   85

immunomodulatory effector function. Thus, the dimeric protein according to the invention
may be used as an alternative to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
         In one embodiment, the dimeric protein, such as an antibody or Fc-fusion protein,
according to any aspect or embodiment of the present invention, may be used to enhance
clearance of a target molecule from the bloodstream, such as a ligand, a receptor, a toxin,
C1q, IgE, an anti-graft antibodie, human anti-human antibodies (HAHA), antidrug antibodies
(ADA), human anti murine antibodies (HAMA),             human anti chimeric antibodies (HACA),
pharmaceutical compounds, and immunomodulatory compounds.
         The dimeric protein according to the invention, such as an Fc fragment fused to an
antigen, may have improved immunostimulatory effect when in oligomeric form, such as a
hexameric molecule, as the oligomer provides antigen complexes that for example stimulate
clustering of B-cell receptors directed against said antigen, and facilitate affinity maturation
of initial low affinity B-cell receptors by presenting the antigen in a multivalent form. This may
be obtained both when the dimeric protein according to the invention is in solution or is
presented on the surface of a cell, virion, virus-like particle, embedded in a liposome or in
other forms supporting presentation of transmembrane proteins commonly known in the art.
Thus, in one embodiment, the dimeric protein, such as an Fc-fragment, according to any
aspect or embodiment of the present invention, is for use in vaccination, immunization and
immune response stimulation. Thus, in one embodiment the present invention also relates to
a method for vaccination, immunization and immune response stimulation comprising
administration of the dimeric protein as described herein.
         The dimeric protein according to the invention, may be used to create supramolecular
structures, that optionally may be assembled in a pH-dependent fashion, both in solution, as
well as on a surface, such as, but not limited to, the surface of a cell, virion, virus-like particle,
liposome, microchip, solid surface, porous scaffold, or other methods for protein presentation
commonly known in the art.
         In one embodiment, said first and/or second polypeptide of the dimeric protein may
comprise a protein binding domain, such as a Fab domain, specifically binding a Fab domain
in a different Fc domain containing polypeptide. The dimeric protein and its target molecule
may be used for the formation of supramolecular structures, that may optionally be assembled
in a pH controlled fashion.
         In one embodiment, the dimeric protein according to any aspect or embodiment of the
present invention is for use in protein crystallization. The dimeric protein may be particularly
useful due to its capability to form oligomeric structures in a pH controlled fashion.
         In one embodiment the present invention relates to a method of using the dimeric
protein according any aspect or embodiment herein described for immune complex formation
in diagnostical kits, such as an agglutination assay. An example of an agglutination assay is
Coombs test.
                                                      86

envenomation include but are not limited to digoxin, Colchicine, venom from reptiles such as
snake venom, venom from insects such as bee, wasp and caterpillar venom, spider venom,
Microbial endotoxins and       exotoxins, such      as botelinum    neurotoxins, tetanus toxin,

         Examples of vascular and other diseases may be e.g. atherosclerosis, myocardial
infarction and stroke, cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, and depletion of C1q
in high-fat diet induced hepatic insulin resistance and systemic glucose tolerance, and the
clearance of anti-graft antibodies before or after organ transplantation.
         In one aspect, the present invention relates to the dimeric protein, oligomer, hexamer,
composition or kit-of-parts according to any aspect or embodiments described herein, for use
in the treatment of a disease, such as a bacterial, viral or parasitic infection, autoimmune
disease, cancer, inflammation, and/or reducing the risk for septic shock caused by a bacterial
infection.
         For the treatment of bacterial infections and/or reducing the risk of septic shock, the
dimeric protein of the invention may, for example, comprise a binding region specifically
binding to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS),       a lipooligosaccharide (LOS),     a delta endotoxin,
Botulinum toxin, Corynebacterium diphtheriae exotoxin, a bacterial superantigen, a heat
stable enterotoxin, cytolysin, a channel-forming toxin, an enzymatically active toxin or a

least a part of the body of a human or other mammal. In one aspect, the present invention

EXAMPLES
Example 1
Design and generation of CD38 antibody 005 mutants
        The human monoclonal antibody HuMab 005 is a fully human IgG1,K antibody
described in WO/2006/099875, that is directed against human CD38. Here, it was used as a
model antibody to test the capability of Fc mutations to enhance CDC activity. The tested
mutations are listed in Table 3.
        DNA constructs for the different mutants were prepared and transiently transfected
using the heavy chain of HuMab 005 with IgGlm(f) allotype as a template for mutagenesis
reactions. Briefly, mutants were prepared using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Stratagene, US). A forward and a reverse primer encoding the desired mutation were used
to replicate full length plasmid DNA template encoding the 005 heavy chain with IgGlm(f)
allotype. The resulting DNA mixture was digested using DpnI to remove source plasmid DNA
and used to transform E. coli. Mutant plasmid DNA isolated from resulting colonies was
checked by DNA sequencing (Agowa, Germany). Plasmid DNA mixtures encoding both heavy
and light chain of antibodies were transiently transfected to Freestyle HEK293F cells
(Invitrogen,   US)    using  293fectin  (Invitrogen,  US)  essentially as described      by the
manufacturer.
        To test the functional relevance of oligomeric Fc-Fc interactions in complement
activation and CDC, amino acids in the hydrophobic patch at the Fc:Fc interface were mutated
to potentially disrupt the Fc-Fc side-on interaction and CDC efficacy of 005. Mutations 1253D
and H433A were introduced to change the charge at positions that were chosen based on the
1HZH crystal structure and described to be exposed in hydrophobic patches in the CH2-CH3
domain (Burton Mol Immunol 1985 Mar;22(3):161-206)).
        The 1HZH crystal structure shows that 1253 and H433 bind two different pockets on
the opposing Fc positions of the partnering antibody. To exclude the possibility that disruption
of direct binding sites for Clq were the cause of the observed effects on CDC, mutants K439E
and S440K were generated. As shown in Figure 4, K439 and S440 face each other on
opposite sides at the Fc:Fc interface, so K439E and S440K were designed to induce loss of
                                                   88

CDC as single mutant by inhibiting the Fc:Fc interaction, but were expected to restore CDC
when interacting with each other, due to restored Fc:Fc interactions in the antibody mixture.

Example 2
CD38 binding on cells by HuMab-005 mutants
       Binding of unpurified antibody samples to CD38-positive Daudi and Raji cells was
analyzed by FACS analysis. 109 cells were incubated in 100 pL in polystyrene 96-well round
bottom plates with serial dilutions of antibody preparations (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0,
10.0, 30.0 pg/mL) in RPMI1640/0.1%         BSA at 4*C for 30 min. After washing twice in
RPMI1640/0.1% BSA, cells were incubated in 50 pL with FITC-conjugated rabbit F(ab')2 anti
human IgG (cat.no. F0056; DAKO; 1:150) at 41C for 30 min. Next, cells were washed twice
in PBS/0.1% BSA/0.02% azide, resuspended in 100 pL PBS/0.1% BSA/0.02% azide and
analyzed on a FACS Cantoll (BD Biosciences). Binding curves were analyzed using GraphPad
Prism V5.01 software. As a negative control, supernatant of mock-transfected cells was used.
       Binding of HuMab 005 to Daudi cells was not much affected by the introduction of point
mutations in the CH2-CH3 domain. All tested antibodies bound Daudi cells in a dose
dependent manner. Binding was similar to wild type HuMab-005 for all tested mutants, with
the exception of 005-E345R, which showed slightly decreased binding. However, without
being bound by any theory, the lower binding might be a result of decreased binding by the
secondary antibody. The actual binding avidity by 005-E345R might be similar or even
increased compared 005-WT, however we could not confirm this because of lack of directly
labeled antibodies.
       Binding of HuMab-005 to Raji cells was also not much affected by the introduction of
point mutations in the CH2-CH3 domain. All tested antibodies bound Raji cells in a dose
dependent manner. Maximal binding was similar to that of wild type 005 for the 005-I253D
                                                 89

and   H433A mutants and       lower for the 005-E435R,      K439E,    S440K mutants and the
combination of 005-K439E + 005-S440K. However, without being bound by any theory, the
lower binding might be a result of decreased binding by the secondary antibody (shielding of
the epitope).
Example 3
CDC assay on CD38-positive cells by mutants of the CD38 antibody 005
        0.1 x 106  Daudi or Raji cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with
a concentration series of unpurified antibodies (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10.0, 30.0
pg/mL) in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min on a shaker at RT. Next, 25 pL normal human
serum was added as a source of C1q (20% final concentration) and incubated in a 37 0 C
incubator for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium
iodide was added and cell lysis was determined by FACS.
        The impact of the E435R mutation on CDC was further analyzed on Wien133 cells with
different concentration normal human serum (NHS).         0.1  x 106   Wien133 cells were pre
incubated for 15 min on a shaker at RT in round-bottom 96-well plates with a concentration
series of unpurified antibodies (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10.0, 30.0 pg/mL)
in a total volume of 50 pL. Next, NHS was added as a source of C1q to reach a final
concentration of either 20% or 50% NHS in a total volume of 100 pL. The reaction mixture
was incubated in a 370 C incubator for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by putting the plates
on ice. 10 pL propidium iodide was added and cell lysis was determined by FACS.
        Figure 5 shows that 005-I253D, H443A, K439E and S440K showed complete loss of
CDC activity on both Daudi (Figure 5A) and Raji (Figure 5B) cells, whereas the 005-E345R
mutant showed strongly enhanced CDC activity on both cell lines. Comparable to 7D8 data,
a combination of 005-K439E + 005-S440K, which both result in loss of CDC as a single
mutant, resulted in restored CDC. Surprisingly, 005-E435R even strongly induced CDC on
Wien133 cells, for which wild type 005 is not capable to induce killing by CDC (Figure 5C).
CDC killing by 005-E345R on Wien133 cells was observed with both 20% and 50% serum
concentrations (Figure 5C). On Raji cells, both 7D8-E345R and 005-E345R showed enhanced
CDC in vitro in 50% serum, with similar efficacy as in 20% serum (Figure 5D).
        As the E345R mutation in the CH2-CH3 region resulted in enhanced CDC activity in
both the tested CD20 antibody 7D8 and CD38 antibody 005, the E345R mutation is considered
to be a general antibody modification that can be applied to induce or enhance CDC.
                                                   90

Example 4
IgG1 antibodies containing the CDC-enhancing mutation E345R are less sensitive
to inhibition of CDC by Fc binding peptide DCAWHLGELVWCT than wild type
antibodies
        By mutating amino acid positions in the hydrophobic patch at the Fc:Fc interface of
IgG, CDC efficacy was found to be either disturbed or enhanced. The involvement of the
interactions at the Fc-Fc interface, and thus possibly the formation of an oligomeric (e.g.,
hexameric ring) structure as observed in the b12 crystal structure, in CDC efficacy was further
explored. Therefore, a 13-residue peptide (DCAWHLGELVWCT (SEQ ID NO:7)) was used that
targets a consensus binding site in the hydrophobic patch region on the surface of wild type
IgG Fc (Delano et al., Science 2000 Feb 18;287(5456):1279-83). Indeed, the identification
of the consensus binding site on the surface of IgG Fc as an adaptive region that is primed
for interaction with a variety of distinct molecules (Delano et al., Science 2000 Feb
18;287(5456):1279-83), is consistent with the identification of the core amino acids in the
hydrophobic patch that are involved in the Fc-Fc interaction in the IgG1 b12 crystal structure
(Saphire et al., Science 2001 Aug 10;293(5532):1155-9). Interactions that are present in all
of the binding interfaces are mediated by a shared set of six amino acids (Met-252, Ile-253,
Ser-254, Asn-434,His-435, and Tyr-436), as well as shared backbone contacts (Delano et al.,
Science 2000 Feb 18;287(5456):1279-83). Accordingly, the Fc binding peptide is expected
to affect the Fc-Fc interaction and consequently CDC efficacy.
        0.1 x 106 Daudi cells were pre-incubated in 75 pL with 1.0 pg/mL unpurified antibody
in round-bottom 96-well plates for 10 min at room temperature on a shaker. 25 pL of a
concentration series (range 0.06-60 pg/mL final concentration) of the Fc binding peptide
DCAWHLGELVWCT was added to the opsonized cells and incubated for 10 min on a shaker at
RT. Next, 25 pL NHS was added as a source of complement (20% final concentration) and
incubated in a 370 C incubator for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 pL ice cold
RPMI medium, supplemented with 0.1% BSA. 15 pL propidium iodide was added and cell lysis
was determined by FACS analysis.
        CDC mediated by wild type 005 (Figure 6) was found to be inhibited by the Fc-binding
peptide DCAWHLGELVWCT in a dose-dependent manner. These competition data suggest
again the involvement of the Fc-Fc interactions at the hydrophobic patch of IgG in CDC
efficacy. The CDC-enhanced IgG1-005-E345R mutant was less sensitive for competition by
the Fc-binding peptide compared to the corresponding wild type antibodies, suggesting that
the E345R mutation results in increased stability of the Fc-Fc interaction, and consequently
increased CDC.
                                                 91

Example 5
Increased specificity of enhanced CDC by combining E345R with complementary
inhibiting mutations K439E and S440K in a mixture of two different monoclonal
antibodies
        As described in Example 3, CD38 antibody 005 mutations K439E and S440K decreased
the CDC efficacy as monoclonal antibodies. Mixing 005 antibodies containing these mutations
restored CDC. Efficient CDC was thus restricted to cells bound by both mutant antibodies
simultaneously. Similar, data have been found for the CD20 antibody 7D8 described in WO
2004/035607 (data not shown).
         It can be advantageous to restrict the enhancement of CDC induction to target cells
that express two specific antigens simultaneously, exploiting their combined expression to
improve selectivity of enhanced CDC induction. It can also be advantageous to restrict the
enhancement of CDC induction to target cells that are bound by mixtures of at least two
different antibodies simultaneously, said antibodies binding an identical cell surface antigen
at two different epitopes simultaneously, or at two cross-competing, similar, or identical
epitopes.
        Therefore, to restrict enhanced CDC induction to cells bound by both CD20 and CD38
antibodies simultaneously, the CDC enhancing mutation E345R was combined with CDC
inhibiting    mutations   in the  antibodies  7D8-E345R/K439E,      7D8-E345R/S440K,      005
E345R/S440K and 005-E345R/K439E. These antibodies were added separately or mixed 1:1
in CDC experiments as follows. 0.1 x 106 Wien133 cells (other cell types such as Daudi or Raji
cells may also be used) were pre-incubated in round-bottom             96-well plates with a
concentration series of unpurified antibodies (final concentration 0.056-10,000 ng/mL in 3
fold   dilutions  for  7D8-E345R/K439E,     7D8-E345R/S440K,     005-E345R/S440K      or  005
E345R/K439E) or antibody mixtures (final concentrations 0.01 pg/mL CD20 antibody mixed
with 0-333 ng/mL in 3-fold dilutions CD38 antibody; or 3.3 pg/mL CD38 antibody mixed with
0.0056-1,000 ng/mL in 3-fold dilutions CD20 antibody) in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min
on a shaker at RT. Next, 25 pL normal human serum was added as a source of complement
(20% final concentration) and incubated in a 37 0 C incubator for 45 min. The reaction was
stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium iodide was added and cell lysis was
determined by FACS.
        A concentration series of 005-E345R/K439E or 005-E345R/S440K antibody was mixed
with a fixed concentration of 0.01 pg/mL 7D8 double mutant antibody (maximal concentration
with minimal CDC on Wien133 cells as a single agent as determined from Figure 7A) to make
the   complementary      combinations   005-E345R/K439E      +   7D8-E345R/S440K      or  005
E345R/S440K + 7D8-E345R/K439E. Figure 7C shows that the 005 double mutant CD38
antibodies induced CDC dose-dependently in the presence of fixed concentration of the
complementary 7D8-E345R/K439E or 7D8-E345R/S440K CD20 antibody, respectively. The
                                                  92

CDC efficacy by these complementary combinations (Figure 7C) was comparable to the 005
E345R single mutant (enhancer) antibody as a single agent (Figure 7B). In contrast, in the
presence of irrelevant antibody b12, both 005-E345R/K439E and 005-E345R/S440K showed
hardly any CDC in the concentration series tested (comparable to 005-E345R/K439E or 005
E345R/S440K as single agents shown in Figure 7B).
        A concentration series of 7D8-E345R/K439E or 7D8-E345R/S440K antibody was mixed
with a fixed concentration of 3.3 pg/mL 005 double mutant antibody (showing a little but
limited CDC on Wien133 cells as a single agent as determined from Figure 7B) to make the
complementary combinations 7D8-E345R/K439E + 005-E345R/S440K or 7D8-E345R/S440K
+ 005-E345R/K439E. Figure 7D shows that the 7D8 double mutant CD20 antibodies induced
CDC very efficiently in the presence of the complementary 005-E345R/K439E or 005
E345R/S440K CD38 antibody respectively, even at the lowest concentrations tested,
resembling not more than a few 7D8 double mutant antibody molecules per cell. To eliminate
the contribution of increased Fc-tail density on the cell membrane to the observed enhanced
CDC by the mixture of 7D8 and 005 antibodies with complementary K439E and S440K
mutations, also antibody combinations with non-complementary mutations were tested.
Figure 7D shows that non-complementary combinations showed much lower CDC efficacy
than complementary combinations, as a result of less efficient Fc-Fc interaction than the
complementary combinations.
        These data suggest that the induction of (enhanced) CDC by therapeutic antibodies
can be limited to cells that bind simultaneous a mixture of two complementary antibodies, in
this case with different antigen specificities, thereby increasing target cell specificity by
requiring co-expression of both antigens.
        As can be seen in Figure 7A and 7B, 7D8-E345R/K439E, 005-E345R/S440K, 7D8
E345R/S440K and 005-E345R/K439E displayed limited CDC efficiency in comparison to 7D8
E345R alone. It is further seen, that the mixture of 7D8-E345R/K439E and 7D8-E345R/S440K
enabled CDC with enhanced efficiency compared to wildtype 7D8 antibody as single agent.
Likewise, it was observed that the mixture of 005-E345R/K439E and 005-E345R/S440K
enabled CDC with enhanced efficiency compared to wildtype 005 antibody as single agent
(data not shown).
Example 6
Use of a mutant screening approach to identify mutations stimulating Fc:Fc
interaction mediated antibody oligomerization detected by a CDC assay
        As described in Example 3, amino acid mutations were identified that stimulated CDC
for an antibody recognizing the      target antigens, CD38, on multiple cell lines expressing
variable levels of said antigens. Surprisingly, the single point mutation E345R proved
                                                   93

sufficient to endow CDC-dependent cell lysis of Wien133 cells to the anti-CD38 antibody 005,
which failed to lyse these cells by CDC in wild type IgG1 format.
         Other mutations on or at the periphery of the Fc:Fc interface could stimulate
oligomerization and CDC in an analogous fashion. Alternatively, mutations could indirectly
stimulate oligomerization, for example by allosterically inducing Fc:Fc interactions.
         To determine if other amino acid mutations could stimulate Fc-mediated antibody
oligomerization, a library of anti-CD38 IgG1-005 mutants was screened using CDC assays,
both individually and mixed in a pairwise fashion to select for example amino acid pairs
interacting across the Fc:Fc interface. However, the same strategy can be applied to other
antibodies, such as another IgG1 or an IgG3 antibody.
         A focused library of mutations at the positions indicated in Table 4 was generated.
Mutations were introduced into the IgG1-005 Fc region using the Quikchange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, US). Briefly, for each desired mutation position, a forward and
a reverse primer encoding a degenerate codon at the desired location were used to replicate
full length plasmid DNA template of the 005 heavy chain with IgGlm(f) allotype. The resulting
DNA mixtures were digested using DpnI to remove source plasmid DNA and used to transform
E. coli. Resulting colonies were pooled and cultured and plasmid DNA was isolated from these
pools and retransformed into E. coli to obtain clonal colonies. Mutant plasmid DNA isolated
from resulting colonies was checked by DNA sequencing (LGC genomics, Berlin, Germany).
Expression cassettes were amplified from plasmid DNA by PCR and DNA mixes containing
both a mutant heavy and a wildtype light chain of IgG1-005 were transiently transfected to
Freestyle HEK293F cells (Invitrogen, US) using 293fectin (Invitrogen, US) essentially as
described by the manufacturer. Supernatants of transfected cells containing antibody mutants
were collected. Mutant antibody supernatants were screened in CDC assays both individually
and in pairwise mixtures as follows.
         0.1 x 106 Daudi or Wien-133 cells (other cells types such as Raji cells may be used)
were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with 1.0 ug/ml of unpurified antibodies in
a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min on a shaker at RT. Next, 30 pL normal human serum was
added as a source of complement (30% final concentration) and incubated in a 37 0 C incubator
for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pl propidium iodide was
added and cell lysis was determined by FACS.
         Mutations described in Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6 were selected for their ability to
enhance oligomerization as detected by CDC efficiency, either as a single mutant or when
mixed with other mutants for example facing the mutation across the Fc:Fc interface.
Mutations can optionally be further screened for their ability to not compromise FcRn, Protein
A or Protein-G binding, ADCC, ADCP or other effector functions mediated by the Fc domain.
Combining such stimulating point mutations into one Fc domain can stimulate oligomerization
and CDC efficiency even further.
                                                   94

         Mutations in the CH2-CH3 region incorporated in the CD38 antibody 005 were tested
for their ability to inhibit oligomerization as determined by CDC on Daudi cells. Lysis of the
mutant antibody was compared to wild type 005, for which lysis was set to 100%. The cut
off for inhibition was set to 5 66% lysis. Measured in this way, most of the tested mutations
inhibited CDC (see Table 4).
         Mutations in the CH2-CH3 region incorporated in the CD38 antibody 005 were tested
for their ability to enhance oligomerization as determined by CDC on Wien 133 cells (Table 5).
Wild type CD38 antibody 005 is not able to induce CDC on Wien133 cells. Mutants displaying
 39% cell lysis were scored as enhancing. Completely unexpectedly, virtually all obtained
substitutions of amino acids E345 and E430 stimulated cell lysis by CDC. To verify this result,
amino acids E345, E430 and S440 were substituted with each possible mutation by site
directed mutagenesis and tested for their ability to enhance oligomerization as determined
by CDC of Wien133 cells using a new human serum batch, yielding slightly more efficient lysis
(Table 6). Again, all substitutions of E345 and E430 induced efficient CDC of Wien133 cells.

subcutaneous model with Raji-luc #2D1 cells. These cells show -150,000 CD38 molecules
per cell (determined by QIFIKIT analysis, data not shown) and high complement defense
receptor expression. The protocol for tumor inoculation and measurement is basically the
same as described in Example 20. At day 0, 5x10 6 Raji-luc #2D1 cells in 200 pL PBS were
s.c. injected in the right flank of SCID mice. When average tumor volume was 100 mm           3
(around day 7), the mice were sorted into groups (n=7) and treated by i.p. injection of a
single dose of 500 pg antibody per mouse (25 mg/kg). Treatment groups are shown in Table
                                                                             3
7. Tumors were measured until an endpoint tumor volume of 1500 mm              or until tumors
showed ulcerations or serious clinical signs were observed to avoid major discomfort.
         Figure 8A shows mean tumor growth on day 21, when all groups were still complete.
Wild type antibody IgG1-005 slightly inhibited tumor growth, although this was not
statistically significant. Only IgG1-005-E345R significantly inhibited tumor growth compared
to the irrelevant antibody control at day 21 (One-way ANOVA p< 0.05).
         Figure 8B shows a Kaplan-Meier plot of the percentage mice with tumor sizes smaller
than 500 mm 3 . Tumor formation was significantly delayed in mice treated with IgG1-005
E345R antibody compared to mice treated with negative control antibody IgG1-b12 (Mantel
Cox analysis p<0.001) or wild type IgG1-005 (p<0.05).
         These data show that introduction of the E345R mutation in the CD38 antibody 005
resulted in enhanced in vivo anti-tumor activity.

Example 8
Monovalent target binding further enhances the CDC efficacy of E345R antibodies
         A molecular surface of the IgG1 hexameric ring observed in the b12 crystal structure
demonstrates that for each IgG in the hexameric ring, one of the two C1q binding sites is
facing upwards and the other site is facing downwards of the ring structure, and also one Fab
arm of each antibody is oriented up and one is oriented down, resulting in only one Fab-arm
per antibody to take part in antigen binding, suggesting monovalent binding per antibody
molecule in the hexameric antibody ring. Monovalency might bring antibodies upon antigen
                                                  100

binding in a hexamerization compatible orientation. To test this hypothesis, the CDC efficacy
of a bispecific CD38/EGFR antibody with the E345R mutation was tested on CD38-positive,
EGFR-negative Wien133 cells, to which this bispecific antibody can only bind monovalently
via CD38, and compared to the CDC efficacy of the bivalent binding CD38 antibody, also with
the E345R mutation. The human monoclonal antibody HuMax-EGFr (2F8, described in WO
2004/056847) was used as a basis for the EGFR antibodies described in this example.
         Bispecific antibodies were generated in vitro according to the DuoBodyTM platform, i.e.
2-MEA-induced Fab-arm exchange as described in WO 2011/147986. The basis for this
method is the use of complementary CH3 domains, which promote the formation of
heterodimers under specific assay conditions. To enable the production of bispecific antibodies
by this method, IgG1 molecules carrying certain mutations in the CH3 domain were
generated: in one of the parental IgG1 antibody the F405L mutation, in the other parental
IgG1 antibody the K409R mutation. To generate bispecific antibodies, these two parental
antibodies, each antibody at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, were incubated with 25 mM
2-mercaptoethylamine-HCI (2-MEA) in a total volume of 100 pL TE at 37*C for 90 min. The
reduction reaction is stopped when the reducing agent 2-MEA is removed by using spin
columns (Microcon centrifugal filters, 30k, Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
         For the CDC assay, 0.1 x 106 Wien133 cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96
well plates with a concentration series of antibodies (0.01 to 10.0 pg/mL) in a total volume
of 100 pL for 15 min on a shaker at RT. Next, 25 pL normal human serum was added as a
source of complement (20% final concentration) and incubated in a 37*C incubator for 45
min. The reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium iodide was added
and cell lysis was determined by FACS.
         Figure 9 shows that, as expected, CD38 antibodies without the E345R mutation (wild
type IgG1-005 and IgG-b12-K409R x IgGl-005-F405L) did not induce killing of Wien133 cells.
Also the EGFR antibody IgG1-2F8-E345R/F405L, that did not bind the EGFR-negative Wien133
cells (data not shown), did not induce CDC, as expected. The introduction of the K409R
mutation did not influence the capacity of the IgGl-005-E345R antibody to induce ~60%
killing on Wien133 cells (described in Example 10). Interestingly, the bispecific CD38/EGFR
antibody     IgGl-005-E345R/K409R       x   IgG1-2F8-E345R/F405L,       which  can   only   bind
monovalently to the CD38-positive, EGFR-negative Wien133 cells, showed increased maximal
CDC killing (from ~60% to ~100% killing).
        These data show that monovalent targeting can further enhance the maximal killing
capacity of antibodies containing the CDC enhancing E345R mutation. Furthermore, these
data show that the E345R oligomerization enhancing mutation, as measured by enhancing
CDC activity, can be applied to other antibody formats, such as DuoBody.
                                                    101

Example 9
The oligomerization enhancing E345R mutation can be applied to other antibody
formats such as DuoBodyTM
        The effect of the E345R mutation was tested in a bispecific antibody of the DuoBody
format. CDC assays were performed with CD20/CD38 bispecific antibodies on CD20-positive,
CD38-positive Wien133 and Raji cells.
        Bispecific antibodies were generated as described in Example 8. For the CDC assay,
0.1 x 106 Wien133 or Raji cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with a
concentration series of antibodies (0.01 to 30.Opg/mL) in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min
on a shaker at RT. Next, 25 pL normal human serum was added as a source of complement
(20% final concentration) and incubated in a 37*C incubator for 45 min. The reaction was
stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium iodide was added and cell lysis was
determined by FACS.
        Figure 10 shows that introduction of the E345R mutation enhanced CDC of the
bispecific IgG1-005-F405L x IgG1-7D8-K409R antibody on Wien 133 (Figure 10A) and Raji
(Figure 10B) cells. These data show that the E345R oligomerization enhancing mutation can
be applied to other antibody formats to enhance CDC activity.
Example 10
E345R rescues CDC by EGFR antibody 2F8, which can be further enhanced by
monovalent target binding
        As described in Examples 3 and 12, E345R enhanced or rescued CDC for antibodies
recognizing different hematological tumor targets (CD20 and CD38). To extend the analysis
to a solid tumor antigen, the effect of E345R on the CDC capacity of the EGFR antibody 2F8
was tested on A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the effect of monovalent EGFR
targeting on E345R-mediated CDC induction was tested using a bispecific EGFRxCD20
antibody (IgG1-2F8-E345R/F405L        x IgG1-7D8-E345R/K409R)       on   EGFR-positive, CD20
negative A431 cells.
        Bispecific antibodies were generated as described in Example 8. For the CDC assay, 5
x 106  A431 cells/mL were labeled with 100 pCi 5"Cr for 1h at 37 0 C. Cells were washed three
times with PBS and resuspended in medium at a concentration of 1 x 10- cells/mL. 25,000
labeled cells were incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with a concentration series of
unpurified antibodies (0-30 pg/mL in 3-fold dilutions) in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min
at RT. Next, 50 pL normal human serum dilution was added as a source of complement (25%
final concentration) and incubated in a 37*C incubator for 1h. Cells were spun down (3 min
at 300xg) and 25 pL supernatant was added to 100 pL microscint in a white 96 well optiplate
                                                                  5
(PerkinElmer) for incubation on a shaker (750 rpm) for 15 min.     1Cr release was determined
as counts per minute (cpm) on a scintillation counter. Maximum lysis (100%) was determined
                                                 102

by the 51Cr level measured in the supernatant of Triton X-100-treated cells. Spontaneous lysis
was determined by the 51Cr level measured in the supernatant of cells incubated without
antibody. Specific cell lysis was calculated according to the formula: Specific lysis = 100 x
(cpm sample - cpm spont) / (cpm max - cpm spont).
        Figure 11 shows that IgG1-2F8-E345R/F405L is able to lyse A431 cells by CDC,
whereas wild type 2F8 is not capable of killing A431 cells. These data show that CDC activity
can be rescued in the EGFR antibody 2F8 by introduction of the E345R mutation. This
potentially extends the applicability of the CDC enhancing E345R mutation to antibodies
targeting solid tumor antigens.
        Bispecific EGFRxCD20 antibody IgG-2F8-E345R/F405L x IgG1-7D8-E345R/K409R,
showed further enhancement of CDC on the EGFR-positive, CD20-negative A431 cells.
        These data further support the hypothesis that monovalency facilitates the formation
of Fc-Fc interactions and subsequent CDC induction as postulated for a CD38 binding antibody
described in Example 8.
Example 11
E345R enhances or rescues CDC by CD38 antibody 003 and CD20 antibodies 11B8
and rituximab
        As described in Examples 3 and 12, E345R enhances or induces CDC activity of several
antibodies with different target specificities (CD20, CD38 and EGFR), as was tested on
multiple cell lines expressing variable levels of said antigens. Therefore, introduction of the
E345R mutation was considered to be a general mechanism to enhance or rescues CDC for
existing antibodies. To further support this, the effect of the E345R mutation on CDC was
tested for more antibodies with variable intrinsic CDC efficacy on Daudi and Wien133 cells:
CD38 antibody 003, described in WO 2006/099875 and CD20 antibodies rituximab (type I)
and 11B8 (type II), described in WO 2005/103081. CD20 antibodies can be divided in two
subgroups (Beers et al. Seminars in Hematology 47, (2) 2010, 107-114). Type I CD20
antibodies display a remarkable ability to activate complement and elicit CDC by redistributing
the CD20 molecules in the plasma membrane into lipid rafts, which cluster the antibody Fc
regions and enabling improved C1q binding. Type II CD20 antibodies do not appreciably
change CD20 distribution and without concomitant clustering, they are relatively ineffective
in CDC.
        0.1 x 106  Daudi or Raji cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with
a concentration series of unpurified antibodies (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0,
10.0 pg/mL) in a total volume of 70 pL for 15 min on a shaker at RT. Next, 30 pL normal
human serum was added as a source of Clq (30% final concentration) and incubated in a
37*C incubator for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL
propidium iodide was added and cell lysis was determined by FACS.
                                                   103

        Figure 12 shows that the E345R mutation enhanced CDC for all tested antibodies on
both (A) Daudi and (B) Wien133 cells. Interestingly, at the used concentrations all antibodies
that did not induce CDC in the wild type format, induced CDC efficiently after introduction of
the E345R mutation: CD38 mAb 003 and CD20 type II mAb 11B8 on Daudi cells, and CD38
mAbs 005 and 003 and CD20 type II mAb 11B8 on Wien133 cells. These data suggest that
enhancement of antibody oligomerization, more specifically by introduction of an E345R
mutation, is a general mechanism to enhance or rescue CDC by existing antibodies.
Example 12
E345R enhances internalization of Tissue Factor antibodies
        To test if enhanced oligomerization can induce increased antibody internalization,
colocalization studies of wild type and E345R mutated Tissue Factor (TF) antibodies with the
lysosomal marker LAMP1 were performed by confocal microscopy.
        SK-OV-3 cells were grown on glass coverslips (thickness 1.5 micron, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Braunschweig, Germany) in standard tissue culture medium at 37*C for 1 day. Cells
were pre-incubated for 1 hour with 50 pg/mL leupeptin (Sigma) to block lysosomal activity,
after which 10 pg/mL Tissue Factor (TF) antibody (WO 2010/066803) was added. The cells
were incubated for an additional 1, 3 or 16 hours at 371C. Hereafter, cells were washed with
PBS and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT) with 4% formaldehyde
(Klinipath). Slides were washed with blocking buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin
[Roche] and 2% BSA [Roche]) and incubated for 20 minutes with blocking buffer containing
20 mM NH4CI to quench formaldehyde. Slides were washed again with blocking buffer and
incubated for 45 minutes at RT with a cocktail of mouse-anti-human CD107a-APC (BD
Pharmingen) to identify lysosomal LAMP1 and goat-anti-human IgG-FITC (Jackson) to identify
TF antibodies. Slides were washed again with blocking buffer and mounted overnight on
microscope slides using 20 pL mounting medium (6 gram Glycerol [Sigma] and 2.4 gram
Mowiol 4-88 [Omnilabo] was dissolved in 6 mL distilled water to which 12 mL 0.2M Tris
[Sigma] pH8.5 was added followed by incubation for 10 min at 50-60*C; mounting medium
was aliquoted and stored at -20 0 C). Slides were imaged with a Leica SPE-II confocal
microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a 63x 1.32-0.6 oil immersion objective lens
and LAS-AF software.
        12-bit grayscale TIFF images were analyzed for colocalization using MetaMorph@
software (version Meta Series 6.1, Molecular Devices Inc, Sunnyvale California, USA). Images
were imported as stacks and background was subtracted. Identical thresholds settings were
used (manually set) for all FITC images and all APC images. Colocalization was depicted as
the pixel intensity of FITC in the region of interest (ROI), were the ROI is composed of all APC
positive regions. To compare different slides stained with different TF antibodies, the images
were normalized using the pixel intensity of APC. Mouse-anti-human CD107a-APC was used
                                                    104

to stain the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (CD107a). The pixel intensity of LAMP1 should not differ
between various TF antibodies imaged.
        Normalized values for colocalization of FITC and APC are expressed as arbitrary units
according to the formula [(TPI FITC x percentage colocalization)/100] x [1/TPI APC]
        Percentage colocalization = TPI FITC that colocalizes with an APC pixel / TPI APC
        TPI, total pixel Intensity
        Figure 13 depicts the amount of FITC pixel intensity of wild type and E345R mutated
TF antibodies that overlap with APC-labeled lysosomal marker. For each antibody or condition
tested, three different images were analyzed from one slide containing ~ 1, 3 or >5 cells.
Variation was observed between the different images within each slide. Still, it was evident
that the E345R mutation for antibodies 011 and 098 resulted in increased lysosomal
colocalization after 1 hour incubation, when compared with wild type 011 and 098. These
results indicate that mutation E345R induces more rapid internalization and lysosomal
colocalization and could therefore potentiate antibody drug conjugates.
Example 13
Enhanced CDC by E345R mutation in rituximab in different B cell lines with similar
CD20 expression but different levels of membrane-bound complement regulatory
proteins
        Examples 11 and 14 show that the CDC efficacy of wild type rituximab on Daudi and
Wien133 cells was enhanced by introducing the E345R mutation. This enhanced CDC efficacy
results from the E345R-mediated stabilization of Fc-Fc interactions. The concomitantly formed
hexameric antibody ring structure on the target cell membrane can then promote efficient
generation of the membrane attack complex by facilitating the capture and concentration of
activated complement components close to the cell membrane. As a result of this efficient
complement activation, the inhibiting effects of membrane-bound complement regulatory
proteins (mCRP) could be partly overcome. Overexpression of mCRPs, such as CD55, CD46
and CD59, is considered as a barrier for successful immunotherapy with monoclonal anti
tumor antibodies (Jurianz et al., Mol Immunol 1999 36:929-39; Fishelson et al. Mol Immunol
2003 40:109-23, Gorter et al., Immunol Today 1999 20:576-82, Zell et al., Clin Exp
Immunol. 2007 Dec 150(3):576-84). Therefore, the efficacy of rituximab-E345R was
compared to that of wild type rituximab on a series of B cell lines with different levels of the
mCRPs CD46, CD55 and CD59, but comparable levels of the CD20 target expression.
        The B cell lines Daudi, WIL2-S, WSU-NHL, MEC-2 and ARH-77 express comparable
amounts of CD20 molecules (~250.000          specific antibody-binding capacity - sABC) as
determined by QIFIKIT analysis (data not shown). To compare the expression levels of
complement regulatory proteins between these cell lines, QIFIKIT analysis was performed to
determine the levels of CD46 (mouse anti-human CD46, CBL488, clone J4.48 Chemicon),
                                                  105

CD55 (mouse anti-human CD55, CBL511, Clone BRIC216, Chemicon), and CD59 (mouse anti
human CD59, MCA1054x, clone MEM-43, Serotec).
         For the CDC assay, 0.1 x 106 of cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well
plates with a saturating antibody concentration series (0.002-40.0 pg/mL in 4-fold dilutions)
in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min on a shaker at RT. Next, 25 pL normal human serum
was added as a source of complement (20% final concentration) and incubated in a 37*C
incubator for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium
iodide was added and cell lysis was determined by FACS. The maximal CDC-mediated killing
was calculated from two independent experiments using the top of best-fit values of a non
linear fit in GraphPad PRISM 5.
         Figure 14A-D shows that introduction of E345R in wild type rituximab resulted in
enhanced CDC efficacy as observed by an increased maximal lysis and decreased ECso for all
tested B cell lines.
         Figure 14E shows that the maximal CDC-mediated killing induced by the rituximab
E345R mutant was always higher than by wild type rituximab, independent of the expression
levels of the membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins. These data indicate that
introduction of E345R enhances the therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies as the
tumor cells are less effective in evading antibody-mediated complement attack by the E345R
containing antibodies.
Example 14
Comparison of CDC kinetics for wild type and E345R antibodies
         Introduction of the Fc:Fc interaction stabilizing E345R mutation has been shown to
enhance or rescue CDC as observed by decreased ECso values and increased maximal lysis
for different antibodies on different cell lines described in Example 3 (CD38 antibody 005 on
Daudi, Raji and Wien133) and Example 11 (CD38 antibody 003 and CD20 antibodies rituximab
and 11B8 on Daudi and Wien133). Next, the kinetics of the CDC reactions were analyzed to
further unravel the difference in CDC efficacy between wild type and E345R antibodies.
         0.1  x 106 Raji cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with antibody
at a saturating concentration (10.0 pg/mL) in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min on a shaker
at RT. Next, 25 pL normal human serum was added as a source of complement (20% final
concentration) and incubated in a 37*C incubator for different periods of time, varying
between 0 and 60 min. The reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium
iodide was added and cell lysis was determined by FACS.
         Figure 15A shows that wild type CD20 antibody IgG1-7D8 showed a maximal CDC
mediated killing of 80% of the Raji cells, which was already reached after 5 min under the
tested conditions. However, for IgG-7D8-E345R, 80% killing of Raji cells was observed even
faster, after 3 min. Maximal lysis by IgG-7D8-E345R (95%) was also reached after 5 minutes.
                                                    106

        Figure 15B shows that also for wild type CD20 antibody rituximab, which is less
potent than 7D8 to induce CDC on the used Raji cells, introduction of the E345R mutation
resulted in faster killing of the target cells. Wild type rituximab showed a maximal CDC
mediated killing of 32%, which was reached after 20 minutes. Rituximab-E345R reached 32%
killing already after approximately 3 minutes and remarkably, maximal lysis by rituximab
E345R (85%) was also reached after 20 minutes.
        Figure 15C+D shows that the used Raji cells, which are resistant for CDC-mediated
killing by wild type CD38 antibodies IgG1-003 and IgG1-005, could be killed fast by
introducing the E345R mutation. IgG1-003-E345R and IgG1-005-E345R showed maximal
CDC (50% and 60%, respectively) already after 5 min.
        In summary, E345R antibodies are more potent than their wild type counterparts,
which results from a combination of higher efficacy (lower ECso), increased maximal lysis and
a faster kinetics of the CDC reaction.
Example 15
Comparison of CDC kinetics for bispecific antibodies with or without the E345R
mutation
        In example 9 it is described that the E345R mutation can be applied to the CD38xCD20
bispecific antibody IgG1-005-F405L x IgG1-7D8-K409R that was generated by the DuoBody
platform, resulting in an enhanced killing capacity as observed by a decreased ECso in CDC
assays on Raji and Wien133 cells. Next, the kinetics of the CDC reaction was analyzed to
further unravel the difference in CDC efficacy between the CD38xCD20 bispecific antibodies
with and without E345R.
        0.1  x 106 Raji cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with antibody
at a saturating concentration (10.0 pg/mL) in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min on a shaker
at RT. Next, 25 pL normal human serum was added as a source of complement ( 2 0% final
concentration) and incubated in a 370 C incubator for different periods of time, varying
between 0 and 60 min. The reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium
iodide was added and cell lysis was determined by FACS.
        Figure 16 shows that the bispecific antibody IgG1-005-F405L x IgG1-7D8-K409R
induced a maximal CDC-mediated killing of 83%, which was reached after 10 minutes.
Introduction of E345R resulted in an increased maximal killing by IgG1-005-E345R-F405L x
IgG1-7D8-E345R-K409R ( 9 8 %), which was already reached after 2 minutes. These data
indicate that introducing the Fc-Fc stabilizing E345R mutation in the bispecific antibody results
in an accelerated CDC-mediated killing of the target cells.

Comparison of CDC kinetics for monovalent binding antibodies with and without
E345R
        Example 8 shows that monovalent target binding further enhanced the CDC efficacy
of E345R antibodies as observed by increased maximal lysis with a CD38xEGFR bispecifc
antibody on the CD38-positive, EGFR-negative Wien133 cells. Next, the kinetics of the CDC
reaction was analyzed to further unravel the difference in CDC-mediated killing capacity
between monovalently binding antibodies with and without E345R.
        Bispecific CD38xEGFR and        CD20xEGFR antibodies, with    or without the E345R
mutation, were generated in vitro according to the DuoBody platform as described in Example
8. CDC efficacy of the CD38xEGFR bispecific antibodies was tested on the CD38-positive,
EGFR-negative Raji cells, to which the bispecific antibodies can only bind monovalently via
CD38. 0.1   x 106  Raji cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with antibody
at a saturating concentration (10.0 pg/mL) in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min on a shaker
at RT. Next, 25 pL normal human serum was added as a source of complement (20% final
concentration) and incubated in a 370 C incubator for different periods of time, varying
between 0 and 60 min. The reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium
iodide was added and cell lysis was determined by FACS.
        Figure 17 shows that bispecific antibody CD38xEGFR (IgG1-005-K409R x IgG1-2F8
F405L) induced a maximal CDC-mediated            killing of 55%,   which was reached after
approximately 10 minutes. Introduction of E345R resulted in an increased maximal killing
(96%), which was already reached within 5 minutes.
        Figure 17 shows that bispecific antibody CD20xEGFR (IgG1-7D8-K409R x IgG1-2F8
F405L) induced a maximal CDC-mediated            killing of 85%,   which was reached after
approximately 5 minutes. However, with the CD20xEGFR antibody with introduced E345R,
85% lysis was observed faster, after 2 minutes. Maximal lysis by the E345R CD20xEGFR
antibody (97%) was also reached after 5 minutes.
        In summary,      introduction of the E345R mutation     in these monovalent binding
antibodies resulted in more potent antibodies, which results from a combination of increased
maximal lysis and a faster kinetics of the CDC reaction.
Example 17
CDC by a combination of therapeutic and E345R/Q386K antibodies
        As described in Example 6, mutant CD38 antibodies derived from IgG1-005 could
induce efficient CDC on Wien133 cells when the E345 position of the wild type antibody was
substituted to any amino acid other than Glutamate (E). This suggests that oligomerization,
as a prerequisite of CDC, is hindered by the presence of the Glutamate side chain at position
345 of the antibody. Since E345 on one Fc is in close proximity to Q386 on the facing second
                                                   108

Fc moiety in the hexameric antibody ring structure, the E345-mediated hindrance of
oligomerization in a first antibody could possibly be removed by substitutions at the Q386
position of a second antibody. This would then enable E345 in the first antibody to interact
better with the mutated 386 position in the second antibody in case both antibodies are
combined. To test this hypothesis, CDC assays were performed on Wien133, in which wild
type   antibodies   (IgGl-003,   IgG1-005     or   IgG1-11B8)   were  mixed    with  IgG1-005
E345R/Q386K or IgG1-005-E345R/Q386K/E430G as an example.
        0.1 x 106  Wien133 cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with a
concentration series of unpurified IgG1-005-E345R/Q386K, IgG1-005-E345R/Q386K/E430G
or control antibody (0.0001-20.0 pg/mL in 3.33-fold dilutions) in the presence or absence of
1.0 or 10.0 pg/mL wild type IgG1-003, IgG1-005 or IgG1-11B8 antibody in a total volume of
100 pL for 15 min on a shaker at RT. Next, 25 pL normal human serum was added as a source
of complement (20% final concentration) and incubated in a 37*C incubator for 45 min. The
reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium iodide was added and cell
lysis was determined by FACS.
        Figure 18A/B/C shows that CD38 antibody IgG1-005-E345R/Q386K induced CDC
mediated lysis of Wien133 cells in a dose-dependent fashion (dashed line). Combining IgG1
005-E345R/Q386K with 1 or 10 pg/mL wild type CD38 antibody IgGl-003 (Figure 18A) or
wild type CD20 antibody IgG1-11B8 (Figure 18B) resulted in an increased maximal cell lysis.
Combining IgGl-005-E345R/Q386K with wild type IgG1-005 inhibited CDC in a dose
dependent fashion, possibly by competing for the binding site (Figure 18C).
        Figure    18D/E/F      shows     similar    results for  CD38     antibody   IgG1-005
E345R/Q386K/E430G.
        These data indicate that wild type antibodies IgGl-003 and IgG1-11B8 participated in
antibody oligomerization and CDC activation when combined with IgGl-005-E345R/Q386K or
IgG1-005-E345R/Q386K/E430G. In such combinations, the hindrance of oligomerization by
the E345-position that is present in the wild type antibody could be, at least partly, removed
by the Q386K substitution in the mutant antibody. This application is in particular interesting
to improve therapies with antibodies that are wild type in the E345 position, such as rituximab,
ofatumumab, daratumumab or trastuzumab. Also, such oligomerization-inducing antibodies
might promote formation of cell-bound complexes with patient-own antibodies directed
against target cells like tumor cells or bacteria.
        Example 6 describes multiple amino acids in addition to E345 that enhance CDC upon
mutation, for example E430 and S440, of which specific mutations induced efficient CDC on
Wien133 cells when incorporated in CD38 antibody IgG1-005. With the exception of 1253 and
Y436 mutants, the identified oligomerization-enhancing mutations contact unmutated amino
acids on the facing second Fc moiety in the hexameric ring structure. Therefore, the identified
oligomerization-enhancing mutations, both alone or combined, can be expected to also
                                                     109

promote oligomerization with unmutated antibodies, and further optimization of such mutants
could be achieved by a selection strategy similar to that applied in example 6.
Example 18
E345R induced CDC in IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 antibody isotypes
        To test if the introduction of oligomerization-promoting mutations can stimulate the
CDC activity of non-IgG1 antibody isotypes, isotypic variants of the CD38 antibody IgG1-005
were generated with constant domains of human IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 yielding IgG2-005,
IgG3-005 and IgG4-005 by methods known in the art. Furthermore, the oligomerization
enhancing E345R mutation was introduced in all these antibodies, yielding IgG2-005-E345R,
IgG3-005-E345R and IgG4-005-E345R. In a similar way, also IgG2-003 and IgG2-003-E345R
were generated from CD38 antibody IgG1-003. CDC efficacy of the different isotypes was
compared in an in vitro CDC assay.
        0.1  x 106 Wien133 cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with 10
pg/mL unpurified antibodies in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min on a shaker at RT. IgG1
005-E345R was added at 3.0 pg/mL. Next, 25 pL normal human serum was added as a source
of complement (20% final concentration) and incubated in a 37*C incubator for 45 min. The
reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium iodide was added and cell
lysis was determined by FACS.
        Figure 19 shows that IgG2-005, IgG2-003, IgG3-005 and IgG4-005 were unable to
lyse either (A) Daudi or (B) Wien133 cells efficiently under the tested conditions (the observed
 ~20% lysis was considered as background). Introduction of the E345R mutation enabled
potent CDC on Daudi cells by all IgG isotypes tested. These results were confirmed using CDC
on Wien133 cells, albeit that IgG3-005-E345R displayed limited CDC activity relative to the
other isotypic variants. These data indicate that besides IgG1, an oligomerization enhancing
mutation such as E345R can also be applied to promote CDC activity of IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4
antibodies.
Example 19
CDC by IgG1-005 and IgG1-005-E345R in an ex vivo CDC assay on patient-derived
CD38-positive B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells.
        Cryopreserved primary cells from CLL patient samples were obtained from the
hematopathology       biobank    from   CDB-IDIBAPS-Hospital       Clinic  (Dr.   Elias  Campo,
Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions
Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain), or
from clinical studies by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (Dr. Adrian
Wiestner, NHLBI, Hematology Branch of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda).
Informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with the Institutional Ethics
                                                   110

Committee of the Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, Spain) or the Institutional Review Board of the
NIH and the Declaration of Helsinki. All samples were genetically and immunophenotypically
characterized.
         The CLL samples were categorized into two groups according to their CD38 expression
as determined by FACS: five samples were included in the CD38 high group (between 50%
and 98% of the CD38 expression on Daudi cells) and four samples were included in the CD38
low group (between 0.5% and 3% of the CD38 expression on Daudi cells).
         Fluorescently labeled CLL cells (labeling with 5 pM Calcein AM) were incubated with a
concentration series of antibody (0.01-10 pg/mL in 10-fold dilutions). Next, normal human
serum was added to the antibody-opsonized cells (100,000 cells/well) as a source of
complement (10% final concentration) and incubated for 45 min at 37 0 C. Supernatants were
recovered and fluorescence was read in a SynergyTm HT fluorometer as a measure for cell
lysis. Cell killing was calculated as follows:
         Specific lysis = 100 x (sample-spontaneous lysis)/(max lysis - spontaneous lysis)
where max lysis is determined by a sample of cells treated with 1% Triton, and spontaneous
lysis is determined from a sample where cells were incubated in the presence of 10% NHS
without antibody.
         Figure 20 shows that IgG1-005-E345R strongly enhanced CDC efficacy compared to
wild type IgG1-005 on both CLL primary cells with high CD38 expression and CLL primary
cells with low CD38 expression.
Example 20
IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y forms non-covalent, hexameric complexes in
solution
         The IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y triple mutant was prepared using the Quikchange
site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, US). Briefly, forward and reverse primers encoding
the desired mutation E345R were used to replicate full length plasmid DNA template encoding
the IgG1-005 heavy chain with IgG1m(f) allotype. The resulting DNA mixture was digested
using DpnI to remove source plasmid DNA and used to transform E. coli. Mutant plasmid DNA
isolated from resulting colonies was checked by DNA sequencing (Agowa, Germany). The
E430G mutation was introduced into the IgG1-005-E345R backbone using the same strategy.
The S440Y mutation was introduced into the IgG1-005-E345R/E430G backbone using the
same strategy. Plasmid DNA mixtures encoding both heavy and light chain of antibodies were
transiently    transfected  to   Freestyle  HEK293F    cells (Invitrogen, US) using  293fectin
(Invitrogen, US) essentially as described by the manufacturer. The resulting antibody is a
homodimer containing the E345R/E430G/S440Y triple mutation in both heavy chains.
         IgG1-005 and IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y antibodies were purified by protein A
affinity chromatography. The cell culture supernatants were filtered over a 0.20 pM dead-end
                                                    111

filter, followed by loading on a 5 mL Protein A column (rProtein A FF, GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden) and elution of the IgG with 0.1 M citric acid-NaOH, pH 3. The eluate was immediately
neutralized with 2 M Tris-HCI, pH 9 and dialyzed overnight to 12.6 mM sodium phosphate,
140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (B. Braun, Oss, The Netherlands). After dialysis, samples were sterile
filtered over a 0.20 pM dead-end filter. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, native
PAGE, HP-SEC, multiple angle light scattering (MALS), and dynamic light scattering (DLS).
          SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing and non-reducing conditions on 4-12%
NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) using a modified Laemmli method
(Laemmli 1970 Nature 227(5259): 680-5), where the samples were run at neutral pH. The
SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Coomassie and digitally imaged using the GeneGenius
(Synoptics, Cambridge, UK). Figure 21 shows that IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y displayed
behavior typical of IgG1 antibodies with disulfide bridged heavy and light chains. A single
molecular species with apparent MW of approximately 150 kDa wass visible under non
reducing conditions, while under reducing conditions a heavy chain with apparent MW of 50
kDa and light chain of 26 kDa were visible. We concluded that, under denaturing conditions,
a monomeric molecule is formed displaying behavior highly similar to wild type IgG1
antibodies.
          Native PAGE was performed under non-reducing conditions using a Sebia Hydragel
15/30 protein gel (Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands), acid violet-staining and run on a
Hydrasys instrument       (Sebia, Vilvoorde,    Belgium). Figure 21 shows that IgG1-005
E345R/E430G/S440Y ran at a height similar to that of the unrelated IgG1-b12 control
antibody, albeit slightly more diffuse. The observed diffuse staining could be caused by
formation     of unstable complexes,     but under these PAGE conditions, the IgG1-005
E345R/E430G/S440Y behaved predominantly like a monomeric IgG1 molecule.
          HP-SEC fractionation was performed using a Waters Alliance 2975 separation unit
(Waters, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands) connected to a TSK HP-SEC column (G3000SWxl; Toso
Biosciences, via Omnilabo, Breda, The Netherlands), a Waters 2487 dual A absorbance
detector (Waters), and a Mini Dawn Treos MALS detection unit (Wyatt). 50 pL samples
containing 1.25 pg/mL protein were separated at 1 mL/min in 0.1 M Na2SO4 /0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffered at pH 6.8. Results were processed using Empower software version 2002
and expressed per peak as percentage of total peak area. Figure 22 shows that >99% of
wild type IgG1-005 consisted of intact monomeric IgG, with practically no aggregates formed.
          Figure 23 shows that the triple mutant IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y shows a large
fraction oligomer which was estimated at 79%, while 21% of the population eluted in a peak
observed at the expected elution time for a monomeric species.
         An    overlay of the HP-SEC       profiles of wild  type  IgG1-005   and IgG1-005
E345R/E430G/S440Y is shown in Figure 24 and further illustrates the difference in behavior
between the two antibodies. IgGl-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y clearly formed                high MW
                                                    112

complexes, though these complexes seemed to be sensitive to HP-SEC separation, as
indicated by the significant amount of protein eluting between the two peaks. Possibly the
shear caused by HP-SEC separation may destabilize the non-covalent complexes formed by
assembly of IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y monomers.
        To assess the size of the observed           oligomeric complex   in the IgG1-005
E345R/E430G/S440Y sample, the average molecular weight of the HP-SEC eluate was
determined by multiple angle light scattering (MALS). While the minor monomeric peak eluted
with an apparent average MW of 143 kDa (145.4 kDa expected), the multimeric peak eluted
with an apparent average MW of 772 kDa, or approximately 5.4 monomeric subunits. The
MW of the complex is probably underestimated due to the instability of the complex under
these conditions. For example, a co-eluting mixture of 88% hexameric species and 12%
monomeric species would result in an observed average complex size of 5.4 monomer units.
        To assess the apparent molecular weight in solution, in the absence of the shear
possibly induced by interactions with the HP-SEC matrix, dynamic light scattering (DLS)
analysis was performed. 45 pL of 0.2 pM filtered IgG1-005 (3.80 mg/mL) or IgG1-005
E345R/E430G/S440Y (2.86 mg/mL) in PBS pH 7.4 was analyzed using a DynaPro-801
instrument (Protein Solutions Inc/Wyatt, Dernbach, Germany) in a 100 pL quartz cuvette,
recording   twenty   consecutive  measurements      per experiment,   in three  independent
experiments. Calibrated using the MW of BSA as a reference, the apparent MW of IgG1-005
was 141.7 kDa (145.4 expected), while IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y displayed a MW of
approximately 875.6 kDa, or 6.17 monomeric subunits. No indication of oligomerization was
observed for the IgG1-005 antibody, while IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y suggested highly
efficient complex formation.
        In summary, the biophysical data indicate that mutant IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y
forms disulfide-bridged IgG1-like molecules that are monomeric, i.e. single dimeric protein,
under denaturing conditions as observed by SDS-PAGE and form hexameric complexes in
solution as observed by DLS. The shear imposed by native PAGE was sufficient to fully
dissociate the complexes, while HP-SEC partially destabilized predominantly hexameric
complexes, as indicated by the presence of a minor fraction of monomers.

        Clq binding by wild-type IgG1-005, triple mutant IgG1-005-E345R-E430G-S440Y and

the plastic surface, bringing about random antibody multimerization. Pooled human serum
was used as a source of C1q.
         96-well Microlon ELISA plates (Greiner, Germany) were coated overnight at 41C with
a dilution series of the antibodies in PBS (range 0.007-25.0 pg/mL in 2.5-fold dilutions). Plates
were washed and blocked with 200 pL/well 0.5x PBS supplemented with 0.025% Tween 20
and 0.1% gelatine. With washings in between incubations, plates were sequentially incubated
with 3% pooled human serum (Sanquin, product# M0008) for 1 h at 37 0 C, with 100 pL/well
rabbit anti-human Clq (DAKO, product# A0136, 1/4.000) for 1 h at RT, and with 100 pL/well
swine anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (DAKO, P0399, 1:10.000) as detecting antibody for 1 h at RT.
Development      was    performed    for circa  30   min  with  1 mg/mL      2,2'-azino-bis (3
ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 100 pL 2% oxalic acid. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm in a
microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT). Log transformed data were analyzed by fitting
sigmoidal dose-response curves with variable slope using GraphPad Prism software. From the
sigmoidal dose response curves the EC50 values were calculated.
         Figure 25 and Table 8 show that IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y showed more
efficient C1q binding than WT IgG1-005 and IgG1-005-E345R as measured by ELISA (lower
EC50 value). Coating efficacy was tested for the three antibodies and was found to be similar
(not shown).

CDC assay on CD38-positive Ramos cells
         0.1 x 106 Ramos cells were pre-incubated in round-bottom 96-well plates with a
concentration series of purified antibodies (10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.005, 0.0025,
0.0013, 0.0006 and 0.0003 pg/mL) in a total volume of 100 pL for 15 min on a shaker at RT.
Next, 25 pL normal human serum was added as a source of complement ( 2 0% final
concentration) and incubated in a 37 0 C incubator for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by
putting the plates on ice. 10 pL propidium iodide was added and cell lysis was determined by
FACS.
         A three-phase model was used to fit the IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y data and the
medium EC50 value was calculated (Table 9). IgGl-005-WT and IgGl-005-E345R could be
                                                    114

fitted by fitting sigmoidal dose-response curves with variable slope. From the sigmoidal dose
response curve the EC50 value was calculated (Table 9). GraphPad Prism software was used
to fit the data (Figure 26). IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y showed enhanced CDC activity
compared to wild type IgG1-005 and IgG1-005-E345R antibodies on Ramos cells. The three
phase model of IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y can be explained by the fact that at low
concentrations (between 0.0003 and 0.03 pg/mL) the antibodies within a stable hexamer do
not all have to bind a target to induce efficient CDC. Effectively, cell surface C1q binding sites
are    created     by  IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y         binding   already    at  low   antibody
concentrations, because clustering of antigens is not needed for antibody hexamerization.

ADCC Reporter assay using CD38-positive Raji cells
        ADCC activity of anti-CD38 antibodies opsonized on Raji target cell was measured
using an ADCC bioluminescent reporter assay (Promega Madison, WI, USA) in which biological
pathway activation in the effector cells is quantified.
        The reporter assay uses as effector cells Jurkat cells stably transfected with the gene
for FcyRIIIa receptor, V158 (high affinity) variant, and the firefly luciferase reported gene
cloned after an NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) response element driving luciferase
expression. Antibody binding to the FcyRIIIa receptor on the effector cells induces NFAT
mediated gene transcription and thus           luciferase expression which      is quantified by
luminescence readout. Raji cells were incubated with a concentration series of purified
antibodies (250, 71.4, 20.4, 5.8, 1.7 and 0.5 ng/mL). See for further description of the
materials      and   methods  the   technical    manual   provided    by   Promega.    IgG1-005
E345R/E430G/S440Y induced NFAT pathway activation after FcyRIIIa receptor engagement.
Figure 27 shows that Raji cells opsonized with IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y induced
FcgRIIIa-mediated activation of effector cells as measured in the reported assay. The EC50
value for IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y was higher than for wild type IgG1-005 and IgG1
005-E345R (Table 10). However, the maximal signal for IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y was
higher than for wild type IgG1-005 and IgG1-005-E345R (Table 10).

Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y compared to
wild type IgGl-005
        The mice in this study were housed in a barrier unit of the Central Laboratory Animal
Facility (Utrecht, The Netherlands) and kept in filter-top cages with water and food provided
ad libitum. All experiments were approved by the Utrecht University animal ethics committee.
SCID mice (C.B-17/IcrCrl-scid-BR, Charles-River) were injected intravenously with 500 pg
antibody (wild type IgG1-005 or IgG1-005-E345/E430G/S440Y) using 3 mice per group.
         50 pL blood samples were collected from the saphenous vein at 10 minutes, 4 hours,
1 day, 2 days, 7 days, 14 days and 21 days after antibody administration. Blood was collected
into heparin containing vials and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 10,000 g. Plasma was stored at
-20*C until determination of antibody concentrations.
         Specific human IgG concentrations were determined using a total hIgG and CD38
specific sandwich ELISA. For the total hIgG ELISA, mouse mAb anti-human IgG-kappa clone
MH16 (#M1268, CLB Sanquin, The Netherlands), coated to 96-well Microlon ELISA plates
(Greiner, Germany) at a concentration of 2 pg/mL was used as capturing antibody. After
blocking plates with PBS supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, samples were
added, serially diluted ELISA buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.2%
bovine serum albumin), and incubated on a plate shaker for 1 h at room temperature (RT).
Plates were subsequently incubated with goat anti-human IgG immunoglobulin (#109-035
098, Jackson, West Grace, PA) and developed with 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6
sulfonic acid) (ABTS; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Absorbance was measured in a microplate
reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT) at 405 nm. For the specific CD38 ELISA, His-tagged CD38
extracellular domain was coated to 96-well Microlon ELISA plates (Greiner, Germany) at a
concentration of 2 pg/mL. After blocking plates with ELISA buffer,samples serially diluted with
ELISA buffer were added, and incubated on a plate shaker for 1 h at room temperature (RT).
Plates were subsequently incubated with 30 ng/ml mouse anti human IgG1-HRP, (Sanquin
M1328, clone MH161-1) and developed with 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) (ABTS; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Absorbance was measured in a microplate reader
(Biotek, Winooski, VT) at 405 nm.

        Figure 28 shows that the plasma human IgG concentrations were considerably lower
for mutant IgGl-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y than for IgG1-005 wild type at all tested
timepoints. Figure 29 shows that the clearance rate of IgGl-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y was
approximately 50x higher than that of WT IgG1-005.
Example 23
The oligomeric state of IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y can be controlled by
buffer composition
        HP-SEC fractionation of IgG1-005 and IgGl-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y antibodies was
performed    using   a  Waters  Alliance   2975  separation  unit (Waters,     Etten-Leur, The
Netherlands) connected to a TSK HP-SEC column (G3000SWxi; Toso Biosciences, via
Omnilabo, Breda, The Netherlands), a Waters 2487 dual A absorbance detector (Waters), and
a Mini Dawn Treos MALS detection unit (Wyatt). 50 pL samples containing 1.0 pg/mL protein
were separated at 1 mL/min under different buffer conditions. Results were processed using
Empower software version 2002 and expressed per peak as percentage of total peak area.
        Figure 30 shows the HP-SEC elution profiles recorded in 0.1 M Na2SO4/0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffered at pH 6.8. At pH 6.8, >99% of wild type IgG1-005 antibodies eluted as
monomeric species. In contrast, the HP-SEC profile of IgGl-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y in this
buffer shown in Figure 31 shows a fraction oligomer of 77%, while 23% of the population
eluted as a monomeric species. As described in Example 19, the remaining minor fraction of
monomer might be caused by column-induced dissociation, since no trace of IgG1-005
E345R/E430G/S440Y monomer was observed during batch-mode analysis using dynamic light
scattering under these conditions.
        Figure 32 shows an overlay of the HP-SEC elution profiles of IgG1-005 recorded in
0.15 M NaCl/ 0.1 M citrate buffered at pH 6.8 (dashed line) and pH 5.0 (solid line). The HP
SEC profile of IgG1-005 in citrate buffer both at pH 6.8 and pH 5.0 was highly comparable to
the behavior in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8, with >99% of the protein eluting as monomeric
species.
        Figure 33      shows an   overlay   of the HP-SEC     elution  profiles of IgG1-005
E345R/E430G/S440Y recorded in 0.15 M NaCl/ 0.1 M citrate buffered at pH 6.8 (dashed line)
and pH 5.0 (solid line). Consistent with the behavior in phosphate at pH 6.8, in citrate pH 6.8
the antibody displayed 84% oligomerization. In stark contrast, lowering the pH to 5.0
dramatically reversed the oligomerization of IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y. The fraction
multimer dropped to less than 1%, with >99% of the protein eluting as a monomeric species.
The disassembly of oligomers was specific to low pH conditions and not caused by using citrate
as a buffer component, as shown by the efficient oligomerization in citrate buffered at pH 6.8.
        In summary, lowering the pH from 6.8 to 5.0 suffices to completely disassemble
solution-phase antibody hexamers, an effect that might be explained by the charge
                                                  117

modification of histidine amino acids present at the Fc:Fc interface crucial for hexameric
antibody assembly. In addition, this behavior was specific to antibody variants containing
mutations that induced Fc mediated self assembly, like IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y, while
wild type antibodies remained monomeric at both pH levels.
Example 24
Introduction of the Fc-Fc stable hexamer mutations E345R/E430G/S440Y will
result in increased bactericidal activity of IgG antibodies against bacteria that
express Fc-binding surface proteins.
        The complement cascade system is an important host defense mechanism against
pathogens and can be divided in three different activation routes to recognize pathogens: i)
the antibody-mediated classical pathway, which is activated upon Clq binding to the
pathogen-bound antibody, ii)     the lectin and iii) the alternative pathway, in which the
complement system directly recognizes and is triggered by the pathogen in the absence of
antibody. The three pathways converge at the step of C3 cleavage and C3b deposition.
Microorganisms have developed multiple mechanisms of complement evasion, one of which
is mediated by Protein A [Joiner Ann. Rev. Microbiol. (1988) 42:201-30; Foster Nat Rev
Microbiol (2005)   Dec;3(12):948-58].     Protein A was first identified in the cell wall of
Staphylococcus aureus and is well known for its binding to the Fc region of IgG (Deisenhofer
et al., Biochem (1981) 20, 2361-70; Uhlen et al., J. Biol. Chem (1984) 259,1695-1702). So
far, the antiphagocytotic effect of Protein A and its role in the pathogenesis of S. aureus was
explained by the interaction between Protein A and IgG, which results in an incorrect antibody
orientation to be recognized by the neutrophil Fc receptor (Foster Nat Rev Microbiol (2005)
Dec;3(12):948-58). In example 4, it was shown that CDC mediated by B cell-specific IgG1
antibodies was inhibited by the competing Fc-binding peptide DCAWHLGELVWCT. The peptide
targets the consensus binding site on IgG Fc that coincides with the binding site for Protein
A, Protein G and rheumatoid factor (Delano et al., Science 2000 Feb 18;287(5456):1279-83).
Based on these data, it was speculated that the Protein A-mediated bacterial complement
evasion mechanism could work by competing for Fc binding, resulting in destabilization of the
Fc-Fc interaction of a microbe-specific antibody, and consequently inhibition of antibody
mediated complement activation. Moreover, in example 4,           it was also shown that B cell
specific IgG1 antibodies containing the CDC-enhancing E345R mutation were less sensitive to
inhibition of CDC by the competing Fc-binding peptide DCAWHLGELVWCT than the parent wild
type antibodies. By extrapolating these results to Fc binding proteins expressed on microbes,
increased stabilization of the IgG1 Fc-Fc interactions by the E345R mutation would make
microbe-specific antibodies less prone to complement inhibition by an escape strategy of the
pathogen via Fc binding competition by microbial surface proteins, such as Protein A.
Consequently, introduction of the E345R mutation in IgG antibodies directed against a
bacterium would result in increased C3b deposition on bacteria and increased bactericidal
                                                  118

activity compared to the parent wild type antibodies. It is expected, that a stabilized hexamer
(IgG-E345R/E430G/S440Y) that is already oligomerized before binding to a microbe target
would be even more resilient to e.g. Protein A binding than IgG antibodies containing the
single E345R mutation. Consequently, introduction of the E345R/E430G/S440Y mutations in
IgG antibodies directed against microbes would result in increased C3b deposition on microbes
and increased microbial activity compared to the parent wild type antibodies.
        To test if IgG1-005-E345R/E430/S440Y oligomerization can inhibit binding to protein
A, purified protein preparations of IgG1-005 and IgG1-005-E345R/E430/S440Y were
analyzed by two orthogonal methods:
1) IgG concentration determination by measuring absorbance at 280 nm wavelength using a
Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Isogen Life Science, Maarssen, The Netherlands).
2) IgG concentration determination using an Octet QK instrument (Fortebio, Menlo Park,
USA), in Octet Sample Diluent and using ready-to-use protein A sensortips (Fortebio, Menlo
Park, USA) in direct comparison with an IgG standard (Siemens) reference curve.
        By determining the ratio between the concentration determined by A280 over the
concentration    determined   using   Octet-Protein    A, it  was  observed    that   IgG1-005
E345R/E430/S440Y is indeed less prone to bind Protein A than IgG1-005 (table 11).

        As an in vitro measure for complement-mediated bacterial killing, both phagocytosis
by neutrophils and the generation of C3a in the plasma, which coincides with C3b deposition
on the bacteria, can be determined. Indeed, it has been described that C3b deposition on S.
aureus results in enhanced phagocytosis and correlates with bacterial killing (Rooijakkers et.
al., Nature Immunology 2005: 6,920-927).
        S. aureus will be labelled with FITC by incubating an exponentially growing bacterial
culture with 100 pg/mL FITC for 1h at 37*C in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Human
polymorph nuclear cells (PMN) will be isolated using a Ficoll gradient. FITC-labelled bacteria
will be opsonized with a concentration series of specific antibodies with or without the
mutation E345R/E430G/S440Y. Phagocytosis will be performed in vitro by incubating 1x108
opsonized FITC-labelled bacteria with human PMN in the presence of 25% IgG-depleted serum
as complement source for 25 min at 37*C in a total volume of 200 pL under vigorous shaking.
The cells will be fixed and erythrocytes lyzed by incubation with BD FACS lysing solution for
                                                   119

15 min at room temperature. After washing, phagocytosis will be measured by FACS. The
neutrophil population will be selected through forward and side scatter gating              and
phagocytosis will be expressed as the mean fluorescence in the neutrophil population.
Alternatively, C3a generation will be measured in the samples by ELISA as a measure for
complement activation and C3b deposition.
        It  is  expected     that    the    S.  aureus-specific   antibodies   containing   the
E345R/E430G/S440Y mutation will induce more complement activation and phagocytosis by
neutrophils than the parent wild type antibodies. An example of an antibody that could be
used in such experiments is the chimeric monoclonal IgG1 pagibaximab (BSYX-A110;
Biosynexus), targeting Lipoteichoic acid (LTA)        that is embedded in the cell wall of
staphylococci (Baker,    Nat   Biotechnol.   2006 Dec;24(12):1491-3;      Weisman   et al.,  Int
Immunopharmacol. 2009 May;9(5):639-44).
Example 25
The formation of non-covalent hexameric IgG complexes by introducing the
E345R/E430G/S440Y triple mutation occurs irrespective of the Fab domain.
        The formation in solution of non-covalently bound, hexameric antibody complexes by
introducing the E345R/E430G/S440Y (RGY) triple mutation was demonstrated for CD38
antibody 005 in Example 20. In this experiment formation of non-covalent hexameric IgG
complexes of other human IgG1 antibodies that differ in their Fab domains: CD20 antibodies
7D8 and rituximab, EGFR antibody 2F8 and C. albicans mannan antibody M1g1. The
generation and purification of the triple mutant antibodies and HP-SEC analyses were
performed essentially as described in Example 20.
        Figure 34 shows that all triple mutant antibodies showed a large fraction oligomer:
IgG1-7D8-RGY (67.2%) (Figure 34A), IgGl-ritux-RGY (83.6%) (Figure 34B), IgGl-2F8-RGY
(74.5%) (Figure 34C), and IgG1-M1-RGY (74.5%) (Figure 34D). These data indicate that the
concept of E345R/E430G/S440Y for inducing self-assembly of antibodies into hexamers in
solution can be generally applied to IgG1 sequences, irrespective of Fab domain primary
structure.
Example 26
CDC by CD20 antibodies containing the E345R/E430G/S440Y triple mutation in an
ex vivo CDC assay on patient-derived CD20-positive CLL cells.
        Frozen CLL PB CD19+/CD5+           B cells (Relapsed/   Refractory) isolated from CLL
peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purchased from Allcells, Emeryville, CA. CDC was
performed as described in Example 21, with the exception that 20,000 cells per 96-well plate
were used. CD20 expression was determined as 39,000 Specific Antibody-Binding Capacity
(sABC)   by QIFIKIT, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark. Figure 35 shows that CD20 antibodies
                                                   120

containing the E345R/E430G/S440Y triple mutation showed functional CDC activity on CD20
positive primary CLL cells. Introduction of the E345R/E430G/S440Y mutation resulted in more
efficient CDC-mediated killing (lower EC50) of primary CLL cells by 7D8 (Figure 35A) and
enabled potent CDC by rituximab, which did not show any killing activity in the WT format
(Figure 35B).
Example 27
Introduction of E345R/E430G/S440Y triple mutation for induction of
hexamerization and increased CDC can be applied to different antibody isotypes.
        Isotypic variants of the CD38 antibody IgG1-005 were generated with constant
domains of human IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 yielding IgG2-005, IgG3-005 and IgG4-005 by
methods known in the art. Furthermore,          the triple mutation E345R/E430G/S440Y was
introduced in all these antibodies, yielding IgG2-005-RGY, IgG3-005-RGY and IgG4-005-RGY.
        HP-SEC analysis of the different isotypes was performed as described in Example 20.
        Figure 36 shows that the tested isoforms containing the E345R/E430G/S440Y triple
mutation formed      hexameric complexes in solution:       IgG1-005-RGY (79.2%        multimeric)
(Figure   36A),  IgG2-005-RGY (46.1%       multimeric)   (Figure   36B), IgG3-005-RGY (37.8%
multimeric) (Figure 36C), and IgG4-005-RGY (84.4% multimeric) (Figure 36D).
        CDC efficacy of the different isotypes was compared by testing unpurified antibody
concentration series (0.0003-10 pg/mL in 2-fold dilutions) in an in vitro CDC assay as
described in Example 18. Figure 37 shows that introduction of the RGY triple mutation
enabled potent CDC on Daudi cells (Figure 37A) by all IgG isotypes tested. These results were
confirmed using CDC on Wien133 cells (Figure 37B), albeit that IgG3-005-RGY displayed
limited CDC activity relative to other isotypic variants. These data for the RGY triple mutants
are similar as shown for E345R mutants in Example 18, Figure 19.
Example 28
Combinations of mutations for inducing the formation of non-covalent oligomeric
complexes in solution
        Example 20 describes that antibody IgG1-005 containing the three mutations E345R,
E430G, and S440Y (RGY) forms oligomeric complexes in solution. Antibodies containing
variants of this triple mutation with an amino acid substitution at either one of these three
positions were tested for their capacity to form oligomeric complexes in solution. As an
example     of  the    class  of  possible   E345R    substitutions,    consisting  of   E345   to
A/C/D/F/G/H/I/K/L/M/N/P/Q/R/S/T/V/W/Y,           E345K    was    tested   in    combination   with
E430G/S440Y. As an example of the class of possible E430G substitutions, consisting of E430
to A/C/D/F/G/H/I/K/L/M/N/P/Q/R/S/T/V/W/Y,           E430S    was tested     in combination    with
E345R/S440Y. The class of possible S440Y substitutions consists of proteins with an amino
                                                   121

acid in at least one position selected from the group consisting of S440, Y436, D/E356, T359,
E382, N434, Q438, 1253 and S254, that is Y or W; not Y; not D or E; not T; not E; not N; not
Q; not I; and not S, for each position, respectively. As an example of this class of S440Y
substitutions, Y4361 and S440W were tested in combination with E345R/E430G. Mutation
combinations E345K/E430G/S440Y          (denoted RGY),  E345R/E430S/S440Y (denoted RSY),
E345R/E430G/S440W (denoted RGW), or E345R/E430G/Y436I (denoted RGI)were introduced
in the CD38 antibody IgG1-005 by methods known in the art, yielding IgGl-005-KGY, IgG1
005-RSY, IgGl-005-RGW, and IgGl-005-RGI, respectively.
        HP-SEC analysis was performed as described in Example 20. Figure 38 shows that
similar to IgGl-005-RGY (Example 20, Figure 23), IgGl-005-KGY (Figure 38A), IgG1-005
RSY (Figure 38B), and IgGl-005-RGW (Figure 38C) formed oligomeric complexes in solution
with varying efficiency. For mutants IgGl-005-KGY and IgGl-005-RGW, the observed A280
signal migrating in between the oligomer and monomer peaks suggested that the HP-SEC
method may contribute to destabilization of oligomeric complexes, as described in Example
20.
        CDC    efficacy of the antibodies was compared by testing unpurified antibody
concentration series (0.0003-10 pg/mL in 3-fold dilutions) in an in vitro CDC assay as
described in Example 18. Figure 39A shows that all tested triple mutation combinations
endowed IgG-005 with the capacity to kill Wien133 cells in an in vitro CDC assay, where wild
type IgG-005 does not show any killing. Figure 39B shows that also Ramos cells were killed
more efficiently by the tested triple mutant antibodies as compared to wild type IgG1-005.
        These data show that oligomerization in solution and/or induction of CDC can be
induced by IgGl-005-KGY, IgGl-005-RSY, IgGl-005-RGW and IgGl-005-RGI, suggesting
that mutations selected from any possible naturally occurring amino acid E345R substitutions,
any possible naturally occurring amino acid E430G substitutions, or the amino acids
tryptophan or tyrosine may be possible amino acid substitutions for S440, can substitute for
E345R, E430G, and S440Y, respectively. Furthermore, the HP-SEC data suggest that such
substitutions can modulate the interaction strength between the Fc-containing polypeptide
subunits of the oligomeric complex.
Example 29
Antibodies containing E345R/E430G/S440Y triple mutations can be assembled
into hetero-oligomeric rings
        Example 5, Figure 7 demonstrates that antibodies containing one of the two
complementary mutations K439E or S440K, illustrated in Figure 4, are inhibited in their CDC
activity, whereas they could form complexes capable of CDC activation when mixed. Example
20 describes the construction of antibody IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y (here referred to
as IgGl-005-RGY), which formed oligomeric, most likely hexameric, complexes in solution,
                                                   122

that also showed enhanced CDC activity compared to wild type IgGl-005 (Example 21, Figure
26). Example 28 describes that also IgGl-005-KGY, IgGl-005-RSY, IgGl-005-RGW and IgG
005-RGI showed       enhanced CDC       compared   to IgGl-005.     To test if solution-phase
oligomerization could be restricted to mixtures of non-self-interacting antibodies, antibody
variants of IgGl-005-RGY were generated that each contained one of the two complementary
mutations K439E or S440K that prohibited self-oligomerization.
        Mutation K439E was introduced into IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y by methods
known in the art, yielding IgGl-005-E345R/E430G/K439E/S440Y (IgGl-005-RGEY). Mutation
S440K was introduced into IgGl-005-E345R/E430G by methods known in the art, yielding
IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440K          (IgGl-005-RGK).     Mutations   Y4361   and  S440K   were
introduced into IgGl-005-E345R/E430G by methods known in the art, yielding IgGl-005
E345R/E430G/Y436I/S440K (IgGl-005-RGIK). The rationale to include Y4361 in IgGl-005
RGIK was to compensate for the absence of the oligomerization enhancing mutation S440Y.
        HP-SEC analysis of the different antibody variants and equimolar antibody mixtures
was performed as described in Example 20, but using PBS (12.6 mM sodium phosphate, 140
mM NaCl, pH 7.4; B. Braun, Oss, The Netherlands) as the mobile phase. Figure 40 shows
that the introduction of K439E in IgGl-005-RGY prohibited self-oligomerization of IgGl-005
RGEY (2.7% multimers). Likewise, substituting S440Y in IgGl-005-RGY with mutation S440K
prohibited self-oligomerization of IgGl-005-RGK (2.2% multimers). Remarkably, a mixture
of the solution-phase monomeric (i.e. single dimeric antibodies) IgGl-005-RGEY plus IgG1
005-RGK formed oligomeric species with equivalent HP-SEC mobility as IgGl-005-RGY (65%
multimers), albeit with lower efficiency than IgGl-005-RGY (84% multimers).
        Figure 41 shows that the introduction of Y4361            plus S440K into IgGl-005
E345R/E430G prohibited self-oligomerization of IgGl-005-RGIK (1.8% multimers). Again, a
mixture of the solution-phase monomeric IgGl-005-RGEY plus IgGl-005-RGIK formed
oligomeric species with equivalent HP-SEC mobility as IgGl-005-RGY, but now with high
efficiency (93% multimers).
        Figure 42 shows a direct comparison of mixture IgGl-005-RGEY plus IgGl-005-RGK
with mixture IgGl-005-RGEY plus IgGl-005-RGIK, demonstrating that IgGl-005-RGIK (65%
multimers) could induce heteromeric oligomerization with IgGl-005-RGEY more efficiently
than IgGl-005-RGK (93% multimers). The presence of the extra oligomerization and CDC
enhancing    mutation   Y4361   in  IgGl-005-RGIK     apparently stabilized  the formation of
complexes with IgGl-005-E345R/E430G/K439E/S440Y.
        In summary,     IgGl-005 antibodies containing mutations        E345R/E430G and the
additional self-oligomerization inhibiting mutations K439E/S440Y, or S440K, or Y4361/S440K,
could be reassembled into multimeric complexes, by mixing antibody molecules with
complementary mutations (K439E in one, S440K in the other antibody).
                                                   123

Example 30
Fc fragments can be recruited to the cell surface by cell binding antibodies, if both
components contain the E345R/E430G/S440Y triple mutations
        The three mutations E345R, E430G and S440Y were introduced in a IgG1m(f) Fc
fragment by methods known in the art, creating Fc-RGY. Protein was expressed and purified
as described in Example 20. HP-SEC analysis of the Fc-RGY sample was performed as
described in Example 20. Figure 43 shows that under the used HP-SEC conditions, Fc-RGY
showed approximately 28% monomers and 72% oligomers distributed over multiple states,
as measured by fraction of peak area to total area.
        Next it was tested whether Fc-RGY fragments could be recruited in oligomeric
complexes with IgG1-RGY antibodies in solution. Therefore, 6 pg/mL Alexa-647-labeled Fc
RGY (Fc-RGY-A647),) was mixed 1:1 with a concentration series (0.001-3 pg/mL in 3-fold
dilutions) of an EGFR-specific or CD20-specific antibody. Immediately after mixing, the
samples were added to 0.1 x 106 EGFR-positive A431 or CD20-positive Daudi cells and
incubated for 45 minutes at 40C. After washing the cells twice with RPMI1640/0.1% BSA (3
minutes, 1200 rpm), the cells were resuspended in PBS/0.1% BSA/0.02% azide and analyzed
on a FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences).
        Figure 44A shows that mixing         Fc-RGY-A647 with EGFR-specific IgGl-2F8-RGY
antibody resulted in a dose-dependent fluorescent signal on EGFR-positive A431 cells. In
contrast, the CD20-specific IgG1-7D8-RGY was not able to recruit Fc-RGY-A647 to the CD20
negative A431 cells. None of the other tested control combinations of Fc-RGY-A647 mixed
with either IgG1-2F8 or IgG1-2F8-E345R resulted in a fluorescent signal. Also, neither of the
control combinations of CD20-specific IgG1-RTX-A647 mixed with IgG1-2F8 nor IgG1-2F8
RGY induced a fluorescent signal on A431 cells.
        These data indicate that the labeled Fc-RGY fragment was specifically recruited to the
A431 cells by incorporation into oligomeric complexes with IgG1-2F8-RGY antibodies that bind
EGFR on A431 cells.
        Similarly, figure 44B shows that the CD20-specific antibodies IgG1-7D8-RGY and
IgG1-RTX-RGY were able to recruit Fc-RGY-A647 fragments to CD20-positive Daudi cells. In
contrast, the EGFR-specific IgG1-2F8-RGY was not able to recruit Fc-RGY-A647 to the EGFR
negative Daudi cells. Negative control samples of either Fc-RGY-A647 alone, or Fc-RGY-A647
mixed with IgG1-7D8 or IgG1-RTX, did not yield a fluorescent signal on Daudi cells.
        In summary, these data show that Fc-RGY molecules can form complexes in solution,
and can be recruited to cells by RGY-containing antibodies that specifically bind the cells.
Example 31
Reversable oligomerization of antibody molecules with Fc-Fc interaction
enhancing mutations can be controlled by pH.
                                                  124

        Example 23 showed that antibody IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y, here abbreviated
to IgGl-005-RGY, was capable of hexamerization at pH 6.8, while lowering the pH to 5.0
dissolved the hexameric complex in individual monomeric subunits. To characterize this
property in detail, 50 mM citric acid and 100 mM Na2HPO4 were mixed in different ratios to
generate mobile phase buffers at pH 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 and 7.0. IgGl-005-RGY samples were
exchanged into these buffers and separated by HP-SEC using the matching mobile phase.
Figure 45A shows that lowering the pH resulted in disassembly of multimeric complexes into
monomeric subunits; that a pH of approximately 5.0 was needed to eliminate multimers from
the mixture; and that at pH 6.0, approximately half of the complexes had disassembled.
        The ability to control the antibody oligomeric state by lowering and raising the pH in a
reversible fashion could be useful for applications in upstream or downstream processing
during manufacturing. To test if pH-mediated disassembly was reversible, a sample with
antibody hexamers was brought to pH 5.0 and split into two samples, one of which was
brought back to pH 7.0. Figure 45B shows that the sample that was exposed to pH 5.0 and
subsequently brought back to pH 7.0 (pH 7.0 rev), formed antibody complexes with an
efficiency highly similar to the reference sample kept at pH7.0.
Example 32
IgGl-RGY protein purification and downstream processing efficiency can be
controlled by choice of buffer pH condition
        Protein A purification is a cornerstone of antibody downstream processing and
implemented in a large number of antibody manufacturing processes. Because the protein A
binding site partially overlaps with the Fc:Fc interaction interface mediating hexamerization
of IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y, here abbreviated to IgGl-005-RGY, loading of protein A
columns was attempted at pH 7.4, permissive of hexamerization and at pH 5.0, which blocks
hexamerization as demonstrated in Example 23.
        In example 20, the cloning of antibody IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y,                 here
abbreviated to IgGl-005-RGY, was described. IgGl-005-RGY was expressed in EXPI293F cells
essentially as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen), after which the supernatant was
collected by centrifugation at 300 g for 10 min. Supernatant was concentrated 4-fold using a
MiniKros M15S-260-01P Hollow Fiber Tangential Flow Filtration device with a 50 kDa cutoff
membrane (SpectrumLabs, Rancho Dominguez CA, USA), yielding supernatant with a protein
concentration of 1.1 g/L. The supernatant was split in two parts, one of which was kept at the
original pH of 7.5, while the other batch was pH adjusted to pH 5.0 by dropwise addition of
1.0 M citric acid-NaOH pH 3.0. Both batches were filtered over a 0.20 pM dead-end filter.
        The supernatant batch kept at pH 7.5 was loaded at a low flow rate of 109 cm/h to
mimic downstream processing conditions at manufacturing scale, on a 1.0 mL Protein A
column (HiTrap MabSelectSuRe, GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), which was consecutively
                                                   125

washed with PBS (12.6 mM sodium phosphate, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4; B. Braun, Oss, The
Netherlands), after which bound IgG protein was eluted using 0.1 M citric acid-NaOH, pH 3.0.
The eluate was immediately neutralized with 2 M Tris-HCI, pH 9.0 and dialyzed overnight to
PBS. After dialysis, the sample was sterile filtered over a 0.20 pM dead-end filter.
        The batch brought to pH 5.0 was loaded at a flow rate of 109 cm/h on the same 1.0
mL Protein A column (HiTrap MabSelectSuRe), which was consecutively washed with 20 mM
citric acid/citrate pH 5.0, after which bound IgG protein was eluted using 0.1 M citric acid
NaOH, pH 3.0. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 2 M Tris-HCI, pH 9.0 and dialyzed
overnight to PBS. After dialysis, the sample was sterile filtered over a 0.20 pM dead-end filter.
        Flow-throughs of both protein purifications were collected and purified using a 5.0 mL
MabSelect SuRe column yielding approximately 50 mg of protein, demonstrating that the 1.0
mL MabSelectSuRe column had been saturated effectively.
        The yields of IgGl-005-RGY were determined by measuring A280 of the dialyzed
elution samples using a Nanodrop device (ThermoScientific, Wilmington DE, USA). Protein A
purification at 1.0 mL scale at pH 7.0 yielded 21.45 mg of IgG1-005-RGY, while purification
at pH 5.0 yielded 29.14 mg of IgG1-005-RGY. In conclusion, the protein yield was increased
approximately 36% by performing the binding of antibody to protein A under conditions
keeping IgG1-005-RGY monomeric.
Example 33
Programmed cell death (PDC) by stable hexameric IgG2-005
        To test if different isotypic variants of IgG antibodies containing the triple mutation
E345R/E430G/S440Y could induce programmed cell death (PCD),                 antibody IgG2-005
E345R/E430G/S440Y (IgG2-005-RGY) was generated by methods known in the art. 1.Ox 105
Ramos cells expressing CD38 were cultured for 24 hours in 96-well, U-bottom plates (Nalgene
Nunc) in the presence of a dilution series (10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.005, and 0.0025
pg/mL) of wild type IgG2-005, IgG2-005-RGY, hexameric IgM-005 or human control
antibodies IgG1-2F8 and IgGl-2F8-RGY, recognizing EGFR, which is not expressed on Ramos
cells. PCD was quantified after these 24 hours by staining with annexin V-FITC (Annexin
binding assay; BD Biosciences, San Diego, California, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The amount of annexin V-FITC-positive cells was determined using a FACS (BD).
        Figure 46 shows that IgG2-005-RGY demonstrated enhanced programmed cell death
capacity compared to wild type IgG2-005 and control antibodies IgG1-2F8 and IgGl-2F8
RGY. Hexameric IgM did not induce PCD under the conditions tested.
Example 34
IgG-005-RGY against CD38 out performs hexameric IgM-005 in a CDC assay on B
cells
                                                    126

         To compare the CDC efficacy of IgG1-005-RGY to that of IgM, the VH domain of IgG1
005 was cloned into an IgM backbone by methods know in the art, and expressed in the
absence of J-chain to produce IgM hexamers against CD38. The construction of IgG1-005
E345R/E430G/S440Y (here referred to IgG1-005-RGY) was described in Example 20.
         HP-SEC analysis of the different antibodies was performed as described in Example
20, but using PBS (12.6 mM sodium phosphate, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4; B. Braun, Oss, The
Netherlands) as the mobile phase. Figure 47 shows that IgM-005 expressed in the absence
of J-chain yielded a molecule with slightly higher mobility in HP-SEC than IgG1-005-RGY, as
could be expected due to the higher molecular weight of hexameric IgM compared to
hexameric IgG1-005-RGY.
         CDC efficacy of IgG1-005-RGY was compared to wild type IgG1-005 and hexameric
IgM-005 by testing antibody concentration series (0.0003-10 pg/mL in 2-fold dilutions) in an
in vitro CDC assay as described in Example 18. Figure 48 shows that IgG1-005-RGY showed
more potent CDC activity on Daudi and Wien133 cells than hexameric IgM-005. Wild-type
IgG1-005 showed lower CDC efficacy than IgG1-005-RGY and IgM-005 on Daudi cells, and
no killing activity on Wien133 cells. IgG1-b12 was used as a non-cell binding negative control
antibody. Monomeric (i.e. single dimeric protein) IgG1-005, hexameric IgG1-005-RGY and
hexameric IgM-005 concentrations are indicated as C1q binding equivalents to enable
comparison of non-covalent IgG and covalent IgM complexes with different molecular weight.
         In summary, IgG1-005-RGY could induce complement-mediated lysis of target cells
more efficiently than IgM-005 at antibody concentrations binding equivalent amounts of C1q.
Example 35
Introduction of the triple mutations E345R/E430G/S440Y into anti-EGFR antibody
IgG1-2F8 enhances efficacy of CDC-mediated lysis of EGFR-positive solid tumor
cell lines.
         To test if introduction of the triple mutations E345R/E430G/S440Y into a solid tumor
target antibody could        lead to activation    of complement-mediated     lysis, IgG1-2F8
E345R/E430G/S440Y (here referred to as IgG1-2F8-RGY) was generated by methods known
in the art.
         CDC efficacy by IgG1-2F8-RGY was tested on EGFR-positive A431 and Difi tumor cell
lines and was compared to wild type IgG1-2F8 and the control antibodies IgG1-005 and IgG1
005-RGY. The control antibodies recognize CD38, which is expressed on neither A431 nor Difi
cells.
         After the solid tumor cells were detached by using trypsin-EDTA in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), the cells were washed and passed through a 40 pm nylon cell strainer (DB
Falcon TM) and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1.0x10 6 cells/mL. Cells were stained
for 30 minutes at 37 0 C using SYBR Green (SYBR Green 57563 in DMSO, Invitrogen, 25000x
                                                     127

diluted). After centrifugation (1200    rpm,  5 minutes at RT),   cells were resuspended in
RPMI1640/0.1 0/     BSA at a concentration of 3.0x10 5 cells/mL. Antibody serial dilutions
(0.0003-10 pg/mL) were prepared in RPMI/0.1% BSA supplemented with TOPRO-3 (TOPRO
3 iodide T3605, diluted 1600x). Cells were seeded at 30,000 cells per well into flat bottom 96
wells plates (black 96-Well ABI T m 4315480 FMAT Plates); after addition of the antibody serial
dilutions, plates were incubated for 15' on a shaker (300 rpm, RT). Normal Human Serum
(NHS, Sanquin) was added at 20% final concentration. Plates were incubated for 45 minutes
at 37 0 C. The amounts of dead cells (TOPRO-3 positive) and total cells (SYBR Green positive)
were determined using a Celigo@ imaging cytometer (Brooks Life Science Systems). Results
were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.04.
         Figure 49 shows that the efficacy to induce complement-mediated lysis of EGFR
positive solid tumor cells   was considerably higher for IgG1-2F8-RGY than wild type IgG1
2F8.
Example 36
IgGl-005-RGY shows target-independent complement activation in contrast to
wild type IgGl-005.
         In example 20, the cloning of antibody IgG1-005-E345R/E430G/S440Y,                here
abbreviated to IgG1-005-RGY, was described. To test if IgG1-005-RGY could activate
complement in solution in the absence of target cells, the formation of C4d, a marker for
classical complement     pathway activation,    was analyzed. Complement activation was
determined by measuring C4d concentrations after incubating 100 pg/mL antibody in 90%
normal human serum for 1 hour at 37 0 C in low protein binding 96 wells polypropylene
microplates (U-shaped and sterile; Greiner 650261). C4d concentrations were measured in
an ELISA (MicroVue C4d EIA kit, Quidel Corporation) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. A heat aggregated IgG (HAG)         sample was used as positive control for
complement activation in solution. Figure 50 shows that HAG induced efficient C4d
production, while wild type IgG-005 did not show complement activation under these
conditions. In contrast, IgG1-005-RGY induced elevated C4d levels, indicative of complement
activation in solution.
