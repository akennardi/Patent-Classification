to the lifting axis.

   LIFTING STRUCTURE, WORK BOAT, AND METHOD FOR INSTALLING
                         PIVOT ANCHOR
RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     This application claims priority from Taiwanese
Patent Application No.  105143774 filed on 29 December 2016
and Japanese Patent Application No. 2017-035339 filed on 27
February 2017,  the contents of both of these applications
are incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]     The present invention relates to a lifting
structure which is provided with a lifting apparatus, a
work boat which is provided with the lifting structure, and
a method for installing a pivot anchor based on the use of
the lifting structure.
BACKGROUND ART
[0003]     In recent years, the aquatic mega-solar   (the
floating mega-solar power plant),   in which solar panels are
arranged on the water surface, is progressively installed.
In the case of the aquatic mega-solar, the solar panels,
which float on the water surface, are connected by wires to
anchors which are installed at the bottom of water    (also
referred to herein as the water floor),   and the solar
panels are retained at constant positions on the water
surface.   A pivot anchor is  also used as the anchor which
is  installed at the bottom of water.
[0003a]    A person skilled in the art would understand that
                               1

the reference to the bottom of water in the present
specification to mean land underlying water   (also referred
to herein as a water floor) and may include the bottom of
any body of water, such as a seabed, a lakebed, a riverbed,
the floor of a pond and the like.
[0004]    An example of the pivot anchor   (the pivoting
anchor) is as depicted in Fig.  8 (a). The pivot anchor has
                             la

such a structure that an anchor portion 91 and a rod
portion 92 are pivotably connected to one another at a
connecting portion 91P.
[0005]     When the pivot anchor 90 is     installed, one end of
a hammering rod    (a drive rod) 93 is   inserted into a hole
91h formed in the anchor portion 91.       A pressing force is
applied from the other end of the hammering rod 93,       and the
anchor portion 91 and a part of the rod portion 92 are
hammered into    (driven into) the earth or ground    (Fig.
8 (b)).  Subsequently, the hammering rod 93 is drawn out
 (Fig. 8(c)),  and the part of the rod portion 92,     which
remains on the ground, is pulled upwardly by using, for
example, a hydraulic jack.     The tensile force allows the
anchor portion 91 to pivot with respect to the rod portion
92,  and the anchor portion 91 is     arranged so that the
anchor portion 91 has the    largest projected area in the
direction perpendicular to the direction in which the rod
portion 92   is pulled  (Fig. 8 (d)).   Accordingly, the rod
portion 92   is fixed to the ground g in a state in which the
rod portion 92 has a high withdrawal resistance.        Note that
further details about the pivot anchor are described, for
example, in Patent Document 1.
[0006]     A method, which is described in Patent Document 2
issued for the present applicant, is used as the method for
efficiently installing a pivot anchor at the bottom of
water.   According to the method described in Patent
                                 2

Document 2, a reaction force plate, which can be easily
moved by a barge, can be used to perform, at high operation
efficiencies, the hammering of the anchor portion into the
bottom of water by using, for example, a hydraulic hand
breaker and the upward pulling of the rod portion by using,
for example, a hollow hydraulic jack.

EMBODIMENTS   FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
[0027]      <Embodiments>
     An explanation will be made about a lifting structure
2, a work boat    100 provided with the lifting structure 2,
and a method for installing a pivot anchor based on the use
of the work boat 100 according to embodiments of the
present invention, as exemplified by a case in which the
pivot anchor is    installed at an inclined bottom of water by
using them.    Note that for example, MANTA RAY   (trade name)
produced by Foresight Products can be used as the pivot
anchor.    However, there is no limitation thereto.
[0028]      As depicted in Fig.   1, the work boat 100 of this
                                9

embodiment principally has a barge    1 which includes an
outboard motor   (an outboard engine)  14,  and the lifting
structure 2 which is connected to the barge 1 by the aid of
a wire W.   In Fig. 1, the barge 1 floats on the water
surface, and the lifting structure 2 is grounded on the
bottom of water.
[0029]     In the following explanation, the direction, in
which the outboard motor 14 is positioned in Fig.     1, is
designated as the back side of the work boat     100 and the
barge  1, and the side opposite thereto    (lower-left side in
Fig.  1) is designated as the front side of the work boat
100 and the barge 1.    Further, the horizontal direction
which is orthogonal to the front-back direction, is
designated as the widthwise direction of the work boat      100
and the barge 1.
[0030]     The barge  1 principally has  an upper board   (upper
deck) 11,  a pair of floats  12 which are arranged under the
upper board 11,   a mast 13 which extends upwardly from a
substantially central portion of the upper board 11,     and
the outboard motor 14 which is attached to a side surface
of the upper board 11.
[0031]     The upper board 11 is a substantially U-shaped
flat plate.   The upper board 11 has a cutout 1S which is
disposed at a central portion in the widthwise direction
and which is directed backwardly from the front end.
[0032]     Each of the pair of floats   12 is  a hollow
                               10

floating member having a substantially rectangular
parallelepiped shape.   The floats 12 are attached to the
lower surface of the upper board 11   so that the cutout 1S
is interposed in the widthwise direction, while directing
the longitudinal direction in the front-back direction.
One float 12 is attached to the upper board 11 along one
edge in the widthwise direction of the upper board 11,    and
the other float 12 is attached to the upper board 11 along
the other edge in the widthwise direction of the upper
board 11.
[0033]    The mast 13  includes a pair of poles 13a which
are fixed perpendicularly to the upper surface of the upper
board 11, and a beam 13b which extends in parallel to the
upper board 11 while connecting upper end portions of the
pair of poles 13a.   The mast 13  strides across the cutout
1S in the widthwise direction.    A hydraulic gauge G is
attached to one pole 13a of the mast 13.    A winch  (moving
mechanism) 15 is attached to the center in the widthwise
direction of the beam 13b.
[0034]    The outboard motor 14   is attached to the back
edge of the upper board 11.    The outboard motor 14 may be
any engine for the small ship or boat.
[0035]    Other than the above, the barge 1 is provided
with a hydraulic power unit 40 which is installed on the
upper board 11.  The hydraulic power unit 40 is used as a
hydraulic pressure  (oil pressure) source for a hollow
                              11

hydraulic jack 23 and a hydraulic breaker 50 described
later on.
[0036]     The lifting structure 2 principally includes a
reaction force plate 21,   a connecting portion 22 which is
provided on the upper surface of the reaction   force plate
21,  and the hollow hydraulic jack 23 which is rotatably
 (swingably, pivotally) connected to the connecting portion
22.
[0037]     The reaction force plate 21  is a plate member
having a bottom surface 211 which is to be brought in tight
contact with the bottom of water during the lifting
operation based on the use of the hollow hydraulic jack 23.
In this embodiment, the reaction force plate 21   is a flat
plate which is formed of a metal such as iron, stainless
steel or the like.    The reaction force plate 21 is
substantially U-shaped, and the reaction   force plate 21 has
a cutout 2S which extends   in a predetermined direction.
[0038]     The connecting portion 22  includes four legs
221a, 221b, 221c,  221d which extend upstandingly from the
reaction force plate 21,   a horizontal plate portion 222
which is retained horizontally by the four legs 221a to
221d, and a pair of vertical plate portions 223 which
extend upstandingly from the upper surface of the
horizontal plate portion 222.
[0039]     Two of the  legs 221a to 221d are provided on each
of the both sides of the cutout 2S.    The legs 221a, 221b
                               12

are connected to the reaction force plate 21,  on one side
of the cutout 2S,  along the direction in which the cutout
2S extends.   The legs 221c, 221d are connected to the
reaction force plate 21,  on the other side of the cutout
2S, along the direction in which the cutout 2S extends.
[0040]     The horizontal plate portion 222 is a square or a
rectangle.   The horizontal plate portion 222 is integrally
connected at four corners thereof to the respective upper
ends of the four legs 221a to 221d.   Accordingly, the
horizontal plate portion 222 is retained in parallel to the
reaction force plate 21  over or above the cutout 2S of the
reaction force plate 21.   A through-hole H, which
penetrates through the horizontal plate portion 222 in the
thickness direction, is provided at a central portion of
the horizontal plate portion 222.   Note that, although the
shape of the through-hole H is rectangular in Fig.  1, the
through-hole H may be any shape including, for example,
squares and circles.
[0041]     A rectangular parallelepiped-shaped guide space
GS is defined by the  four legs 221a to 221d, the upper
surface of the reaction force plate 21,  and the lower
surface of the horizontal plate portion 222.   The guide
space GS is communicated with the outside of the guide
space GS via the cutout 2S,  the through-hole H, and the
gaps formed between the adjoining two of the legs 221a to
221d.
                              13

 [0042]    The cutout 2S of the reaction force plate 21,  the
guide space GS,  and the through-hole H are overlapped with
each other, as viewed in the direction orthogonal to the
reaction force plate 21.   Details of the dimension of the
guide space GS will be described later on.    However, it is
desirable that the outer shape of the guide space GS is
larger than the outer shape of the hollow hydraulic jack 23
in the plane parallel to the reaction force plate 21.    It
is desirable that size of the outer shape of the guide
space GS is the  same as that of the cutout 2S, or the
cutout 2S is  larger than the outer shape of the guide space
GS.
 [0043]    The pair of vertical plate portions 223 are
opposed to one another while interposing the through-hole H
of the horizontal plate portion 222  in the direction
orthogonal to the direction in which the cutout 2S extends.
A  slit S is provided for each of the pair of vertical plate
portions 223.   Each of the slits S is  circular arc-shaped.
In this embodiment, the center So of the circular arc is
positioned in the plane including the bottom surface 211 of
the reaction force plate 21.
 [0044]    The hollow hydraulic jack 23 is a lifting
apparatus for performing the lifting for the pivot anchor
or the like.   As depicted in Fig. 2(a),  the hollow
hydraulic jack 23 has a cylindrical hollow cylinder 231 and
a socket 232 which is provided on one end side of the
                              14

hollow cylinder 231.
[0045]      A hole 231h, which extends along the central axis
 (lifting axis) A,   is defined at a central portion in the
radial direction of the hollow cylinder 231.      A ring-shaped
piston   (not depicted) is accommodated in the hollow
cylinder 231.
[0046]      The socket 232 has a cup-shaped form which is
open on the side opposite to the side on which the hollow
cylinder 231 is positioned.      The socket 232 has,  at a
bottom portion thereof, a circular small hole 232h having
the center of the central axis A.      The cross-sectional
shape of the inner surface 232i     (Fig. 2(b)) of the  socket
232 is a circular shape having the center of the central
axis A.    The diameter thereof is   small at lower positions
 (positions near to the hollow cylinder 231),    and the
diameter is    increased gradually upwardly as separating far
from the hollow cylinder 231.      That is, the inner surface
232i of the socket 232 is    formed to have a tapered shape
 (Fig. 2(b)).
[0047]      The unillustrated piston disposed in the hollow
cylinder 231 is connected to the socket 232.      When the
piston is moved in the direction of the central axis A,      the
socket 232    is also moved in the direction of the central
axis A.
[0048]      A pair of bosses b, which mutually protrude
toward the opposite sides, are     fixed on the outer
                                15

circumferential surface of the hollow cylinder 231 disposed
in the vicinity of the end portion on the side opposite to
the side on which the socket 232 is positioned.           The hollow
hydraulic jack 23 is rotatably connected to the reaction
force plate 21   and the connecting portion 22 by inserting
the pair of bosses b   into the pair of slits S of the
vertical plate portions 223 of the connecting portion 22.
[0049]      The rotation of the hollow hydraulic jack 23 has
the following feature.
[0050]      Each of the slits S is circular arc-shaped.         Each
of the centers So of the circular arcs is positioned in the
plane which includes the bottom surface 211 of the reaction
force plate 21.    Therefore, the hollow hydraulic jack 23 is
rotated   (swang, pivoted) in the direction in which the
cutout 2S extends, about the axis of rotation X          (Fig. 1)
which connects the pair of centers So,        in accordance with
the sliding of the bosses b in the slits         S. Note that the
axis of rotation X is orthogonal   to the direction in which
the cutout 2S extends, in the plane which includes the
bottom surface 211 of the reaction force plate 21.
[0051]      The range of the rotation of the hollow hydraulic
jack 23 is arbitrary.    However, for example, the range is
about  5' to 30  on the both sides  respectively      on the basis
of the position at which the central axis A is
perpendicular to the reaction force plate 21.          It is
desirable that the central axis A passes through the guide
                               16

space GS and the cutout 2S in all of the range.   However,
there is no limitation thereto.
[0052]    The wire W, which extends from the winch 15
attached to the mast 13 of the barge 1, has the end portion
which is connected to the reaction force plate 21  of the
lifting structure 2.  The direction in which the cutout 2S
of the lifting structure 2 extends and the direction of
rotation of the hollow hydraulic jack 23 are coincident
with the front-back direction of the barge 1 in the state
in which the barge 1 and the lifting structure 2 are
connected to one another.  Further, the direction, in which
the axis of rotation X of the hollow hydraulic jack 23 of
the lifting structure 2 extends is coincident with the
widthwise direction of the barge 1.  The cutout 1S of the
upper board 1 of the barge 1 and the cutout 2S of the
reaction force plate 21 have the extending directions which
are coincident with each other, and the cutout 1S of the
upper board 1 of the barge 1 and the cutout 2S of the
reaction force plate 21 are overlapped with each other in
the upward-downward direction.
[0053]    Next, an explanation will be made about a method
for installing the pivot anchor of this embodiment with
reference to a flow chart of Fig. 3, and Figs.  4(a) to 4(c)
and Figs. 5(d) to 5(f).
[0054]    As depicted in Fig. 3, the method for installing
the pivot anchor of this embodiment includes a mark
                             17

arranging step Si  of arranging a mark to indicate the
position of installation of the pivot anchor at the bottom
of water, a pivot anchor hammering step    (a pivot anchor
driving step) S2 of hammering    (driving) the pivot anchor at
the mark position, a lifting structure arranging step S3 of
arranging the lifting structure 2 at the bottom of water, a
rod portion lifting step S4  of lifting the rod portion of
the pivot anchor by the lifting structure 2,     and a
withdrawal resistance measuring step S5 of measuring the
withdrawal resistance of the pivot anchor.
 [0055]    In the mark arranging step S1,   the mark M,  which
indicates the position of installation of the pivot anchor
90,  is arranged at the bottom of water B.    As  for the mark
M,  for example, it is possible to use a bamboo pole in
which a flag is attached to one end and a reinforcing steel
 (steel rod, steed bar) is combined to the other end.     The
reinforcing steels of the marks M are successively inserted
into the places of the bottom of water B at each of which
the pivot anchor 90 is  to be hammered, while leading a
diver by using a GPS  surveying instrument and an optical
surveying instrument.   When the marks M are arranged, the
positions of the bottom of water B,    at each of which the
pivot anchor 90  is to be installed, can be thereby grasped
with ease by visually recognizing the flags on the water
surfaces.
 [0056]    In the pivot anchor hammering   (driving) step S2,
                              18

the pivot anchor 90 is hammered at      (driven into) the
position of the bottom of water B indicated by the mark M.
An example of the specified procedure is as follows.
[0057]     At first, the work boat 100     is moved to the
position of the mark M,   and the work boat 100    is stopped in
a state in which the mark M is positioned at the inside of
the cutout 1S of the barge 1 and the cutout 2S of the
lifting structure 2   (Fig. 4(a)).    In this  situation, the
front-back direction of the work boat 100      is allowed to
coincide with the inclination direction of the bottom of
water B.
[0058]     Subsequently, as depicted in Fig. 4(b),      the upper
end portion of a hammering rod     (a drive rod) 93 is retained
by a hydraulic hand breaker 50.      Further, the  lower end
portion of the hammering rod 93 is inserted into the hole
91h  (Fig. 8(a)) of the anchor portion 91 of the pivot
anchor 90,  and the anchor portion 91 is pushed into the
position of the bottom of water B indicated by the mark M.
In this situation, the direction of rotation of the rod
portion 92  is allowed to coincide with the front-back
direction of the work boat 100     (i.e.,  the direction in
which the cutout 2S of the lifting structure 2 extends and
the direction of rotation of the hollow hydraulic jack 23).
[0059]     After that, when the hydraulic hand breaker 50
and the hydraulic power unit 40 on the barge      1 are
connected by a hydraulic hose     (not depicted) to operate the
                               19

hydraulic hand breaker 50  so that the pressing force is
applied vertically in the downward direction, the hydraulic
hand breaker 50 hammers the anchor portion 91 of the pivot
anchor 90 vertically in the downward direction   (Fig. 4(c)).
After the hammering is  completed, the hydraulic hand
breaker 50 and the hammering rod 93 are removed.
[0060]     Note that in the method for installing the pivot
anchor of this embodiment, a ring portion 92c is provided
at the end portion of the rod portion 92 of the pivot
anchor 90,  and the lifting rod 94 made of metal is
detachably connected to the ring portion 92c.   The  lifting
rod 94 is connected to the rod portion 92 by, for example,
engaging a hook or the like with the ring portion 92c, the
hook being provided at one end of the lifting rod 94 and
being equipped with a lock.
[0061]     In the lifting structure arranging step S3,  the
lifting structure 2 is  arranged at the bottom of water B in
order to lift the pivot anchor 90 by using the hollow
hydraulic jack 23.
[0062]     Specifically, at first, the barge 1 is slightly
moved frontwardly to make the adjustment so that the
lifting rod 94,  which extends substantially vertically, is
disposed closely to the central axis A of the hollow
cylinder 231 of the hollow hydraulic jack 23.
Subsequently, the wire W is  let out by the winch 15 of the
barge  1 to move the lifting structure 2 downwardly.   The
                              20

lifting rod 94 is   allowed to pass through the hole 231h of
the hollow cylinder 231 of the hollow hydraulic jack 23
 (Fig. 5(d)),  and the reaction force plate 21   is grounded on
the bottom of water B    (Fig. 5(e)).
[0063]      In this situation, when the lifting rod 94 is
passed through the hole 231h of the hollow cylinder 231,
the upper end portion of the lifting rod 94 is     introduced
into the hole 231h via the cutout 2S,     the guide space GS,
and the through-hole H.
[0064]     The rod portion 92 of the pivot anchor    90 is
rotatable in the front-back direction of the work boat     100,
i.e.,  the direction in which the cutout 2S extends.     The
lifting rod 94,   which is connected to the rod portion 92 by
the aid of the ring portion 92c,     is also rotatable in the
same manner.    Therefore, the upper end of the   lifting rod
94 can be easily introduced into the cutout 2S by rotating
the lifting rod 94 in the direction in which the cutout 2S
extends.   After that, the upper end of the lifting rod 94
can be easily introduced into the guide space GS via the
space between the leg 221a and the leg 221c.
[0065]     Further, when the upper end of the lifting rod 94
is  introduced from the guide space GS into the hole 231h,
then the guide space GS is visually recognized from the
spaces between the legs 221a to 221d, the upper end of the
lifting rod 94 is easily guided into the through-hole H,
and then the upper end of the lifting rod 94 can be easily
                                21

guided to the hole 231h.
[0066]     As depicted in Figs.   5(d) and 5(e), if the bottom
of water B  is inclined so that the depth of water on the
back side of the work boat 100    is deeper than the depth of
water on the front side, the front end side of the reaction
force plate 21  is firstly brought in contact with the
bottom of water B when the reaction    force plate 21  is
grounded on the bottom of water B.     After that, the
reaction force plate 21  is  inclined as the back end side is
further moved downwardly, and the back end side is     finally
brought in contact with the bottom of water B.
Accordingly, the reaction   force plate 21  is grounded while
making tight contact with the inclined bottom of water B.
[0067]     The work boat 100  is arranged so that the front
back direction thereof is directed in the inclination
direction of the bottom of water B.     Therefore, the
direction of rotation of the hollow hydraulic jack 23 is
also coincident with the inclination direction of the
bottom of water B.   Therefore, the reaction force plate     21
can be grounded on the inclined bottom of water B,     while
vertically retaining the central axis A of the hollow
cylinder 231 of the hollow hydraulic jack 23 by rotating
the hollow hydraulic jack 23 in response to the inclination
of the reaction  force plate 21.
[0068]     In the rod portion lifting step S4,   the lifting
rod 94 is lifted by using the hollow hydraulic jack 23,      and
                               22

the pivot anchor 90 is  fixed to the bottom of water B.
[0069]     Specifically, at first, the hollow hydraulic jack
23 and the hydraulic power unit 40 on the barge 1 are
connected to one another by the hydraulic hose    (not
depicted).   Accordingly, it is possible to apply the
hydraulic pressure to the  inside of the hollow cylinder
231.   Further, the hollow hydraulic jack 23 and the
hydraulic gauge G arranged on the barge   1 are also
connected to one another by the hydraulic hose    (not
depicted).   Accordingly, the load, which is applied to the
piston in the hollow cylinder 231 as well as the socket
portion 232 can be read by the hydraulic gauge G arranged
on the barge 1.
[0070]     When the rod portion 92 of the pivot anchor   90 is
lifted, as depicted in Fig. 2(b),  two wedge-shaped
sandwitching members 233 are arranged in the socket 232    so
that the lifting rod 94,  which is connected to the rod
portion 92,  is sandwitched by the sandwitching members 233.
For example, the wedge-shaped sandwitching member 233 has
such a shape that a circular truncated cone is divided into
two along with the central axis.   In the  state in which the
wedge-shaped sandwitching members 233 are arranged in the
socket 232,  the outer surface 233o is brought in contact
with the inner surface 232i of the socket 232,   and the
inner flat surface 233i is brought in contact with the
lifting rod 94.
                              23

[0071]    In this arrangement, the inner flat surface 233i
of the wedge-shaped sandwitching member 233 is processed so
that the sliding movement is suppressed with respect to the
lifting rod 94.  Therefore, when the socket 232 is moved
upwardly in this state, then the two wedge-shaped
sandwitching members 233, which are arranged while
sandwitching the lifting rod 94,  are pressed inwardly in
the radial direction by the inner circumferential surface
232i of the socket 232 having diameters decreased gradually
downwardly, and the lifting rod 94 is  sandwitched more
rigidly or tightly.  The wedge-shaped sandwitching members
233 are also pressed upwardly simultaneously therewith.
Therefore, the lifting rod 94,  which is sandwitched by the
wedge-shaped sandwitching members 233,  is also  lifted
upwardly.  Accordingly, the rod portion 92,  which is
connected to the lifting rod 94,  is lifted, the anchor
portion 91 of the pivot anchor 90 is pivoted, and the pivot
anchor 90 is fixed to the bottom of water B   (Fig. 5(f)).
[0072]    When the rod portion 92 is  lifted, the rod
portion 92 and the lifting rod 94 are moved upwardly.     The
ring portion 92c of the rod portion 92 and the hook
equipped with the lock of the lifting rod 94 connected
thereto are moved upwardly in the cutout 2S and the guide
space GS.  In this way, the provision of the guide space GS
suppresses the collision between the hollow cylinder 231,
and the ring portion 92c and the hook equipped with the
lock.
                             24

[0073]    Note that when the rod portion 92 is   lifted, the
value of the load indicated by the hydraulic gauge G is
checked on the barge 1.   If the value of the load indicated
by the hydraulic gauge G suddenly rises,   it is possible to
estimate that the anchor portion 91 pivots, and the pivot
anchor 90 is fixed to the bottom of water B.    The
communication, which is made from an operator who confirms
the sudden rise of the value of the   load indicated by the
hydraulic gauge G on the barge   1 to a diver who operates
the hollow hydraulic jack 23 in the water, can be performed
by using, for example, the wireless communication in water.
It is possible to correctly grasp the value of the
hydraulic gauge G even when the visibility is not
satisfactory in the water, by arranging the hydraulic gauge
G on the barge 1 as described above.
[0074]    In the withdrawal resistance measuring step S5,
it is confirmed whether or not the pivot anchor 90    is
installed at the bottom of water B while having the
sufficient withdrawal resistance.
[0075]    In the withdrawal resistance measuring step S5,
the hollow hydraulic jack 23 and the wedge-shaped
sandwitching members 233,  which have been used in the rod
portion lifting step S4,  are used as they are.   For
example, if it is desired that   40 kN is possessed as the
withdrawal resistance, the hydraulic pressure of the hollow
hydraulic jack 23 is raised to confirm that the value of
                              25

the load indicated by the hydraulic gauge G arrives at 40
kN.   In this procedure, if the value of the load indicated
by the hydraulic gauge G arrives at 40 kN without
withdrawing or extracting the pivot anchor 90,   it is
possible to judge that the pivot anchor 90 is   installed at
the bottom of water B while having the sufficient
withdrawal resistance   (40 kN).  On the other hand, if the
anchor portion 91 is  lifted without allowing the value of
the load indicated by the hydraulic gauge G to arrive at 40
kN, it is possible to judge that the pivot anchor 90 does
not have the sufficient withdrawal resistance   (40 kN).
[0076]     If it is confirmed that the installed pivot
anchor 90 has the sufficient withdrawal resistance, the
arrangement of one pivot anchor 90 is   completed.   The
lifting structure 2 is moved upwardly by winding up the
wire W by means of the winch 15,   and the work boat 100 is
moved to the position indicated by the next mark M.      After
the work boat 100  is moved to the next mark M,  the  second
pivot anchor 90  is installed by repeating the  step S2 to
the step S5 described above.
[0077]     The effects of the lifting structure 2,   the work
boat  100, and the method for installing the pivot anchor of
this embodiment are summarized below.
[0078]     In the case of the lifting structure 2 of this
embodiment, the hollow hydraulic jack 23 is rotatably
connected with respect to the reaction force plate 21.
                               26

Therefore, it is possible to more reliably lift the rod
portion upwardly by using the hollow hydraulic jack
 (lifting apparatus) 23 at a high operation efficiency,
irrelevant to the state of the bottom of water.
[0079]     Specifically, for example, according to the
findings of the  inventor of the present invention, when the
anchor portion of the pivot anchor is hammered into the
bottom of water, then the rod portion not necessarily
extends perpendicularly to the bottom of water, but the    rod
portion may have various  angles other than 90  with respect
to the bottom of water.   In particular, when the rod
portion is  installed vertically at the bottom of water
which is an inclined surface, the rod portion is not
perpendicular to the bottom of water.
[0080]     In the case of the lifting structure 2 of this
embodiment, the hollow hydraulic jack 23 is connected
rotatably with respect to the reaction force plate 21.
Therefore, even in the case of the inclined bottom of
water, the hollow hydraulic jack 23 can be arranged
vertically, and the bottom surface of the reaction   force
plate 21  can be grounded while being brought in tight
contact with the bottom of water.   Further, the rod
portion, which is not perpendicular to the bottom of water,
can be easily pulled by the lifting structure 2 arranged as
described above.
[0081]     In the case of the lifting structure 2 of this
                              27

embodiment, the guide space GS    is defined under or below
the hole 231h of the hollow cylinder 231 of the hollow
hydraulic jack 23,   and the guide space GS and the cutout 2S
are communicated with each other.     Therefore, when the
lifting rod 94 is passed through the hole 231h, the cutout
2S and the guide space GS can be used as the guides.      The
end portion of the lifting rod 94 can be easily introduced
into the hole 231h even in the water in which the
visibility is unsatisfactory.
[0082]     Further, the lifting structure 2 of this
embodiment has the guide space GS between the reaction
force plate 21  and the lower end portion of the hole 231h
of the hollow cylinder 231 of the hollow hydraulic jack 23.
Therefore, even when the ground is soft or not    firm, and
the rod portion 92 is greatly moved upwardly upon the
lifting, then the ring portion 92c, which is provided at
the end portion of the rod portion 92,    hardly collides with
the hollow hydraulic jack 23.
[0083]     In the case of the lifting structure 2 of this
embodiment, the   lifting operation is performed for the rod
portion 92  in the state in which the hollow hydraulic jack
23 is  supported by the reaction force plate 21.    The
reaction force   (force to press the bottom of water B),
which is generated when the rod portion 92 is    lifted, is
applied to the bottom of water via the bottom surface of
the reaction force plate 21 having a large areal size.
                               28

Therefore, even when the force, which is required to lift
the rod portion 92,  is relatively large, the force, which
is applied per unit area of the bottom of water, is  small.
Even when the bottom of water is  soft and weak, it is
possible to stably receive the reaction force which is
generated when the rod portion 92 is  lifted.  In other
words,  it is possible to lift the rod portion 92 without
causing, for example, the penetration of the hollow
hydraulic jack 23 into the bottom of water.
[0084]     The lifting structure 2 of this embodiment is
constructed such that the hollow hydraulic jack 23 and the
reaction force plate 21  are integrally connected to one
another.   Therefore, no labor is required to arrange the
hollow hydraulic jack 23 on the reaction  force plate 21  in
the water.   Further, the reaction force plate 21 and the
hollow hydraulic jack 23 can be simultaneously moved and/or
arranged by using the barge 1.
[0085]     The lifting structure 2 of this embodiment makes
it possible to avoid the curling or rolling up of mud
and/or slime from an area of the bottom of water B around
the place of operation, by the reaction force plate 21.
Thus,  it is possible to secure the visibility of the diver.
[0086]     The work boat 100 of this embodiment also
provides the same effects as those of the lifting structure
2, because the work boat  100 is provided with the lifting
structure 2.   Further, the work boat 100 of this embodiment
                              29

uses the barge  1 which has a light weight and which has a
shallow draft.   Therefore, for example, the work boat 100
can also advance to a shoal having a depth of water of
about 70 centimeters.   It is possible to appropriately
perform the operation for hammering/withdrawing piles and
anchors at the shoal.
[0087]     The work boat 100 of this embodiment has the
barge  1 which has the cutout 1S and which has the
substantially U-shaped form as viewed in a plan view, and
the reaction force plate 21 which has  the cutout 2S and
which has the substantially U-shaped form as viewed in a
plan view.   The cutout 1S and the cutout 2S have the areas
overlapped with each other as viewed in a plan view.
Therefore, according to the work boat 100 of this
embodiment, the work boat 100 can be arranged just over the
mark M by positioning the mark M in the cutouts 1S,  2S.
The pivot anchor 90 can be correctly hammered at the
position of the bottom of water B indicated by the mark M.
[0088]     The method for installing the pivot anchor of
this embodiment also provides the same or equivalent
effects as those of the work boat 100,  because the work
boat  100 is used.
[0089]     Modified embodiments may be adopted as follows  in
relation to the  lifting structure 2, the work boat 100,  and
the method for installing the pivot anchor of this
embodiment.
                              30

[0090]     It is not necessarily indispensable that the
lifting structure 2 is  connected to the barge  1.  It is
also possible to use a lifting structure 2 having no barge
1, while moving the lifting structure 2 by a crane barge or
the like.
[0091]     In the lifting structure 2 of the embodiment
described above, the reaction force plate 21   has the
substantially U-shaped form having the cutout 2S.    However,
the shape of the reaction  force plate 21  is not limited
thereto.   The reaction force plate 21 may have a
substantially 0-shaped form in which an opening is provided
at a central portion of a rectangle or a square.    Other
than the above, it is possible to obtain a usable reaction
force plate by providing an opening or a cutout having any
shape  for a plate member having any shape.   Further, it is
not necessarily indispensable that one sheet of the
reaction force plate  is used.   It is also allowable to
provide a plurality of sheets of plate portions connected
to the connecting portion 22   or the hollow hydraulic jack
23.   That is, any number of reaction force plates may be
used, and the reaction force plate may have any shape,
provided that the reaction force can be provided for the
hollow hydraulic jack 23.
[0092]     In the lifting structure 2 of the embodiment
described above, the bottom surface 211 of the reaction
force plate 21 may be a flat surface.    However, there is no
                              31

limitation thereto.    For example, protrusions/recesses may
be provided on the bottom surface 211 as means       (structures)
for preventing slippage.    Further, a square pillar made of
wood or metal may be fixed, as means     (structures) for
preventing slippage, to a part    (for example, a part
disposed along the outer edge) of the bottom surface 211 of
the reaction force plate 21   so that the longitudinal
direction extends along the reaction force plate 21.
[0093]     In the lifting structure 2 of the embodiment
described above, the   slit S of the vertical plate portion
223 of the connecting portion 22    is circular arc-shaped,
and the center So of the circular arc is disposed in the
plane  including the bottom surface 211 of the reaction
force plate 21.   However, there is no limitation thereto.
Although any position can be adopted for the position of
the center So, it is more preferable that the position of
the center So is disposed on the side of the bottom surface
211 of the reaction force plate 21    opposite to the    side on
which the slit S   (and the hollow hydraulic jack 23)      is
positioned or located, that is,    on the side of the bottom
surface 211 on which the slit S and the hollow hydraulic
jack 23 are not positioned or located.      More specifically,
it is preferable that the   shape of the slit S is determined
so that the center So is disposed in the vicinity of the
center of rotation of the pivot anchor     90  (i.e.,  the
connecting portion 91P) during the use.
                               32

[0094]     In the lifting structure 2 of the embodiment
described above, the  legs 221a to 221d of the connecting
portion 22 extend upstandingly from the reaction force
plate 21.   However, there is no limitation thereto.   The
legs 221a to 221d may be inclined with respect to the
reaction force plate 21.   The lifting structure 2,  in which
the legs 221a to 221d of the connecting portion 22 are
inclined with respect to the reaction force plate 21,   can
be preferably used for the bottom of water having a larger
angle of inclination.
[0095]     Further, the lengths of the legs 221a to 221d
and/or the angles of the legs 221a to 221d with respect to
the reaction force plate 21 may be changeable.   If the
lengths  of the legs 221a to 221d are changeable, the
following situations arise.   That is, if the ground of the
bottom of water is soft, then the legs 221a to 221d are
lengthened so that the large upward movement of the ring
portion 92c of the rod portion 92 is allowed.   Further,
when the lifting structure 2 is not used, then the   legs
221a to 221d are shortened, and it is possible to realize a
compact size of the lifting structure 2.   If the angles of
the legs 221a to 221d are changeable, the angles can be
adjusted in response to the angle of inclination of the
bottom of water.   Therefore, the lifting structure 2 can be
used for the bottoms of water having various angles of

[0096]     The connecting portion 22 may be detachable with
respect to the reaction force plate 21.     Accordingly, it is
possible to exchange the reaction force plate 21    depending
on the firmness or hardness  of the ground of the bottom of
water.   If the ground of the bottom of water is   soft and
weak, the reaction force plate 21 having a large areal size
is used.   If the ground of the bottom of water is firm, the
reaction force plate 21 having a small areal size is used.
Note that a ring or the like, which is usable to engage a
hook of a crane or the like, may be provided for the
reaction force plate 21  so that the reaction force plate
21,  which is separated from the connecting portion 22,   can
be easily moved.
[0097]     The gaps between the  legs 221a to 221d of the
connecting portion 22 may be closed by plates or the like.
In this case, the gaps may be closed by using transparent
plates  so that the guide space GS can be visually
recognized from the outside.
[0098]     In the lifting structure 2 of the embodiment
described above, the connecting portion 22    is constructed
by the four legs 221a to 221d, the horizontal plate portion
222,  and the vertical plate portions 223.    However, there
is no  limitation thereto.  The connecting portion 22 may
have any structure which provides the predetermined guide
space between the reaction force plate 21 and the hollow
hydraulic jack 23 and which rotatably    (swingably,
                              34

pivotally) connects the reaction force plate 21  and the
hollow hydraulic jack 23.   Specifically, for example, the
horizontal plate portion 222 and the vertical plate
portions 223 may be supported by a cylindrical or conical
cylindrical stand portion in place of the four legs 221a to
221d.   In this case, the guide space is defined on the
inner side of the tubal stand portion.
[0099]     The dimension in the upward-downward direction
 (direction perpendicular to the reaction force plate 21)  of
the guide space defined by the connecting portion 22  is
desirably such a dimension that the ring portion 92c, which
is moved upwardly when the rod portion 92 is lifted, is not
brought in contact with the hollow hydraulic jack 23.
Specifically, the dimension may be,  for example, about 50
cm to 150 cm.
[00100]    The diameter in the plane parallel to the
reaction force plate 21,  of the guide space defined by the
connecting portion 22 desirably has  such a dimension that
the ring portion 92c, which is moved upwardly from the
lower position when the rod portion 92 is  lifted, can pass
through the interior of the guide space in a well-suited
manner.   Specifically, for example, as depicted in Fig.  6,
when the hollow hydraulic jack 23 is  inclined with respect
to the perpendicular direction of the reaction force plate
21,  if the guide space is a guide space GS1 having a
diameter dl which is approximately the same as the outer
                              35

diameter D of the hollow hydraulic jack 23,    then it is
feared that the ring portion 92c of the rod portion 92 may
collide with the outer circumferential wall     (for example,
the plates between the legs 221a to 221d or the cylindrical
or conical cylindrical stand portion) for defining the
guide space GS1,   and the upward movement may be inhibited.
[00101]    On the other hand, if the guide space is a guide
space GS2 having a diameter d2 which is larger than the
outer diameter D of the hollow hydraulic jack 23,     the ring
portion 92c of the rod portion 92 is moved upwardly in a
well-suited manner in the guide space GS2 without colliding
with the outer circumferential wall for defining the guide
space GS2.   Thus,  it is desirable that the diameter of the
guide space is larger than the outer diameter D of the
hollow hydraulic jack 23.    It is more desirable that the
diameter of the guide space is about 1.2 to 2 times the
diameter D of the hollow hydraulic jack 23.     Note that it
is enough that the relationship of magnitude between the
outer diameter D of the hollow hydraulic jack 23 and the
diameter of the guide space holds at least in the direction
of rotation of the hollow hydraulic jack 23.
[00102]    In the lifting structure 2 of the embodiment
described above, it is   also allowable that the connecting
portion 22 does not define the guide space GS.      For
example, as depicted in Fig. 7,    such a connecting portion
has the following structure.     That is, the legs 221a to
                               36

221d are not possessed, and the horizontal plate portion
222 is directly attached to the reaction    force plate 21.
Further, it is also allowable that the connecting portion
22 does not have the horizontal plate portion 222.     In this
case, the connecting portion 22 has    such a structure that
the vertical plate portions 223 are directly attached to
the reaction force plate 21.     Other than the above, in
place of the connecting portion 22,    a portion described
below may be used as the connecting portion.     That is,  a
portion having any structure in which the hollow hydraulic
jack 23 and the reaction force plate 21    are connected so
that the bottom surface of the reaction force plate 21     is
rotatable   (swingable, pivotal) with respect to the central
axis A.   A  lifting structure, in which the guide space is
not formed, may be preferably used, for example, for
lifting a rod portion 92 which does not have the ring
portion 92c.
[00103]     In the lifting structure 2 of the embodiment
described above, the hollow hydraulic jack 23 is connected
to the connecting portion 22    so that the hollow hydraulic
jack 23 is rotatable   in only one predetermined direction.
However, there is no   limitation thereto.   A ball joint or
the like may be used for the connection between the hollow
hydraulic jack 23 and the reaction force plate 21,    and the
hollow hydraulic jack 23 may be rotatable about an
arbitrary axis horizontal to the reaction force plate 21.
According to this construction, when the    lifting structure
                               37

2 is arranged at the bottom of water, it is unnecessary to
make the adjustment so that the direction of rotation of
the hollow hydraulic jack 23 is coincident with the
direction of inclination of the bottom of water.
[00104]    In the lifting structure 2 of the embodiment
described above, the hollow hydraulic jack 23 is used as
the lifting apparatus.   However, there is no limitation
thereto.   It is enough that the lifting apparatus is  an
apparatus capable of lifting any member such as the rod
portion 92 or the like installed at the bottom of water in
the direction directed to the water surface.   It is also
possible to use,  for example, a chain block or a winch in
place of the hollow hydraulic jack 23.
[00105]    In the work boat 100 of the embodiment described
above, the wire W is connected to the reaction force plate
21  at the position of the center of gravity of the lifting
structure 2.   Therefore, it is possible to stably perform
the floating and the downward movement of the  lifting
structure 2 by using one wire.   However, the connection
between the barge 1 and the lifting structure 2 may be
performed by using a plurality of wires W.   Further, as for
the moving mechanism, a mechanism such as Lever Brock
 (trade name) or the like, with which the wire W is wound
manually, may be used, in place of the winch 15.
[00106]    In the method for installing the pivot anchor of
the embodiment described above, the hammering of the pivot
                              38

anchor 90 is performed on the barge   1.  However, the
hammering of the pivot anchor 90 may be performed in the
water.   For example, the hammering of the pivot anchor 90
may be performed by using a work boat disclosed in Patent
Document 2.
[00107]    In the method for installing the pivot anchor of
the embodiment described above, the   lifting rod 94  is
connected to the rod portion 92 of the pivot anchor 90,   and
the rod portion 92 is  lifted by the aid of the lifting rod
94 by using the hollow hydraulic jack 23.    However, there
is no  limitation thereto.   A wire may be used in place of
the lifting rod 94.   Alternatively, the rod portion 92 may
be directly lifted by the hollow hydraulic jack 23 without
using the lifting rod 94.
[00108]    In the embodiment described above, the method for
installing the pivot anchor by using the work boat 100 has
been explained.   However, it is also possible to use the
lifting structure 2 or the work boat 100 when the pile, the
anchor or the like, which has been already installed, is
extracted or withdrawn.    In particular, the lifting
structure 2 or the work boat 100   can be preferably used to
extract or withdraw the pile or the anchor which is
installed while being inclined from the perpendicular state
with respect to the bottom of water.
[00109]    The present invention is not limited to the
embodiments described above as long as the feature of the
                               39

present invention is maintained.   Other modes or forms,
which are conceivable within the scope of the technical
concept of the present invention, are also included in the
scope of the present invention.
