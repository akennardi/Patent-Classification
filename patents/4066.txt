Abstract
The present disclosure provides compositions and methods useful for treating viral infections.
As described herein, the compositions and methods are based on the development of
immunogenic compositions that include an inactivated virus in combination with a non-ionic
surfactant vesicle (NISV). In certain embodiments at least a portion of the antigen present in
the composition is physically associated with the NISV. In certain embodiments the
compositions are lyophilized and subsequently rehydrated after a period of storage. In
certain embodiments the rehydrated compositions exhibit greater potency as compared to
otherwise equivalent compositions that lack the NISV. In certain embodiments the
lyophilized compositions are stored at temperatures in excess of 8C prior to rehydration. In
certain embodiments the rehydrated compositions exhibit greater potency as compared to
otherwise equivalent compositions that lack the NISV and that were also stored at
temperatures in excess of 80 C prior to rehydration. In certain embodiments the antigen is
taken from a licensed vaccine and the administered dose of antigen is less than the standard
human dose for the licensed vaccine.

      COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING VIRAL INFECTIONS
                            Cross Reference to Related Applications
[00011          The present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application
Serial No. 61/585,971, filed on January 12, 2012, the contents of which are herein
incorporated by reference in their entirety.
                                           Background
[0002]          Many viral infections cause severe health problems and may ultimately lead to
death of infected individuals. One strategy for vaccination against such viral infections
involves inactivating (or "killing") a previously virulent virus and administering it to the
individual. The immune system may then later recognize a virulent version of the infectious
agent and can respond by neutralizing the infectious agent or by destroying cells infected by
the agent. Several such inactivated vaccines have been developed e.g., for polio virus, rabies
virus, and hepatitis A.
[0003]          Polio virus infection can lead to minor illness which does not involve the
central nervous system. However, in major illness caused by polio infection, polio virus can
enter the central nervous system of an infected individual, where it infects and destroys motor
neurons and may lead to muscle weakness and acute flaccid paralysis. Infection with rabies
virus causes acute encephalitis in warm-blooded animals and is almost always fatal if
treatment is not administered prior to the onset of severe symptoms. Hepatitis A is a serious
liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV), a virus which is transmitted from person
to person, primarily by the focal-oral mute. Hepatitis A may cause symptoms including
fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, etc., which can last for as long as 6 months.
[0004]           Several inactivated polio, rabies, and hepatitis A vaccines are currently
licensed and have been successful in reducing the incidence of infection. However, all
vaccines, including inactivated antigen vaccines, lose potency over time and the rate of
potency loss is tempemture-dependent. Therefore, cold-chain systems have been established
to ensure that the potency of vaccines is maintained by storing them under refrigerated
conditions (in most cases between 2 and 8*C) until the point of use. Establishing a cold chain
for vaccine storage and distribution is a major undertaking and maintenance is difficult. It is
also apparent that, despite best efforts, cold chains do not always function as intended for

                                                2
many reasons, such as improperly maintained or outdated refrigeration equipment, power
outages resulting in equipment failure, poor compliance with cold-chain procedures and
inadequate monitoring. The result is that vaccines in the cold chain are often subjected to
temperature excursions (i.e., temperatures outside of the target range).
[0005]           While inactivated polio, rabies, and hepatitis A vaccines have been successful
in reducing the incidence of disease worldwide, there remains a need in the art for improved
vaccines that are stable and retain potency when exposed to high temperatures.
                                            Summary
[0006]           The present disclosure provides compositions and methods useful for treating
infections (e.g., those caused by polio virus, rabies virus, and/or hepatitis A virus). As
described herein, the compositions and methods are based on the development of
immunogenic compositions that include an inactivated virus in combination with a non-ionic
surfactant vesicle (NISV). In certain embodiments at least a portion of the antigen present in
the composition is physically associated with the NISV. In certain embodiments the
compositions are lyophilized and subsequently rehydrated after a period of storage. In certain
embodiments the rehydrated compositions exhibit greater potency as compared to otherwise
equivalent compositions that lack the NISV. In certain embodiments the lyophilized
compositions are stored at temperatures in excess of 8oC prior to rehydration. In certain
embodiments the rehydrated compositions exhibit greater potency as compared to otherwise
equivalent compositions that lack the NISV and that were also stored at temperatures in
excess of 8* C prior to rehydration. In certain embodiments the antigen is taken from a
licensed vaccine and the administered dose of antigen is less than the standard human dose
for the licensed vaccine.
                                            Definitions
[0007]           Throughout the present disclosure, several terms are employed that are defined
in the following paragraphs.
[0008]           As used herein, the term "antigen" or "viral antigen" refers to a substance
containing one or more epitopes that can be recognized by an antibody. In certain

                                                  3
embodiments, an antigen can be a virus. The term "antigen" encompasses inter alia killed,
but previously virulent viruses. In certain embodiments, an antigen may be an "immunogen."
100091        As used herein, the term "immune response" refers to a response elicited in an
animal. An immune response may refer to cellular immunity, humoral immunity or may
involve both. An immune response may also be limited to a part of the immune system. For
example, in certain embodiments, an immunogenic composition may induce an increased
IFNy response. In certain embodiments, an immunogenic composition may induce a mucosal
IgA response (e.g., as measured in nasal and/or rectal washes). In certain embodiments, an
immunogenic composition may induce a systemic IgG response (e.g., as measured in serum).
100101        As used herein, the term "immunogenic" means capable of producing an
immune response in a host animal against a non-host entity (e.g., a viral antigen). In certain
embodiments, this immune response forms the basis of the protective immunity elicited by a
vaccine against a specific infectious organism (e.g., a virus).
100111        As used herein, the terms "therapeutically effective amount" refer to the
amount sufficient to show a meaningful benefit in a subject being treated. The
therapeutically effective amount of an immunogenic composition may vary depending on
such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the nature of the composition, the route of
administration, the health, size and/or age of the subject being treated, etc.
100121        As used herein, the term "treat" (or "treating", "treated", "treatment", etc.)
refers to the administration of a composition to a subject who has a disease, a symptom of a
disease or a predisposition toward a disease, with the purpose to alleviate, relieve, alter,
ameliorate, improve or affect the disease, a symptom or symptoms of the disease, or the
predisposition toward the disease. In certain embodiments, the term "treating" refers to the
vaccination of a subject.
10012a]       It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such
reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common
general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.

                                                 3a
10012b]       In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention,
except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used
in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the
presence or addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
              Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments
100131        The present disclosure provides compositions and methods useful for treating
infections (e.g., infections by polio virus, rabies virus, and/or hepatits A virus). As described
herein, the compositions and methods are based on the development of immunogenic
compositions that include an inactivated virus in combination with a non-ionic surfactant
vesicle (NISV). In certain embodiments at least a portion of the antigen present in the
composition is physically associated with the NISV. In certain embodiments the

                                                4
compositions are lyophilized and subsequently rehydrated after a period of storage. In certain
embodiments the rehydrated compositions exhibit greater potency as compared to otherwise
equivalent compositions that lack the NISV. In certain embodiments the lyophilized
compositions are stored at temperatures in excess of 80 C prior to rehydration. In certain
embodiments the rehydrated compositions exhibit greater potency as compared to otherwise
equivalent compositions that lack the NISV and that were also stored at temperatures in
excess of 8 C prior to rehydration. In certain embodiments the antigen is taken from a
licensed vaccine and the administered dose of antigen is less than the standard human dose
for the licensed vaccine.
1. Inactivated Antigens
[0014]          In some embodiments, the compositions and methods of the present disclosure
may be used with one or more antigens included in a vaccine that is licensed or under
development. In certain embodiments, inactivated refers to a whole killed virus. Table I is a
non-limiting list of vaccines that are licensed or under development for polio, rabies, and
Hepatitis A infections.

[0015]          In the following sections we discuss these and other exemplary antigens that
could be used in compositions or methods of the present disclosure.
        Polio virus
[0016]          In one aspect, the present application provides immunogenic compositions that
include an inactivated poliomyelitis (also called "polio") virus. The first effective polio
vaccine was first tested by Jonas Salk and is an inactivated poliovirus vaccine based on three
wild virulent reference strains:
                    -   Mahoney (type I poliovirus)

                                                 5
                    " MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus)
                    *    Saukett (type 3 poliovirus)
[0017]          The reference poliovirus strains are generally cultured in Vero cells, purified
and then inactivated. It will be appreciated that any method may be used to prepare an
inactivated polio virus. In general however, these methods may involve propagating a polio
virus in a culture vessel containing appropriate cells (e.g., Vero cells), nutrient medium,
isolating and then inactivating the antigen. While heat and formalin are commonly used to
inactivate licensed polio vaccines it is to be understood that other techniques could be used,
e.g., treatment with chlorine, exposure to high temperatures, etc.
[0018]           Several poliovirus vaccines are currently licensed. For example, each 0.5 ml
dose of Imovax@ Polio contains a suspension of purified formaldehyde-inactivated polio
vaccine, including Mohoney (Type 1; 40 D antigen units), MEFl (Type 2; 8 D antigen units),
and Saukett (Type 3; 32 D antigen units). Primary immunization with Imovax@ Polio is
usually administered as three doses, the first two doses administered 4-8 weeks apart and the
third dose following 6-12 months later. A booster is currently recommended for adults and
adolescents who are at greater risk of exposure to poliovirus than the general population or if
more than 10 years have elapsed since the last dose of their complete vaccination series.
[0019]          It will be appreciated that any poliovirus strain may be used, e.g., without
limitation any of the strains described herein. In some embodiments, a single strain (e.g.,
subtype, serotype, and/or biotype) of poliovinus may be used in accordance with the present
disclosure. In some embodiments, more than one strain (e.g., subtype, serotype and/or
biotype) of poliovirus may be used in accordance with the present disclosure.
         Rabies virus
[0020]          In one aspect, the present application provides immunogenic compositions that
include an inactivated rabies virus. Several rabies virus vaccines are currently licensed. For
example, Imovax@ Rabies vaccine is a freeze-dried suspension of rabies virus prepared from
WISTAR Rabies PM.WI 38 1503-3M strain. The virus is harvested from infected MRC-5
human diploid cells, concentrated by ultracentrifugation and inactivated by treatment with
beta-propiolactone.
[0021]          It will be appreciated that any method may be used to prepare an inactivated
rabies virus. In general however, these methods may involve propagating a rabies virus in a

                                                   6
culture vessel containing appropriate cells, nutrient medium, isolating and then inactivating
the antigen. For example, heat, formalin, formaldehyde, treatment with chlorine, exposure to
high temperatures, etc. may be used to inactivate rabies virus.
[0022]          Each 1.0 ml dose of Imovax@ Rabies contains a >2.5 IU rabies virus
(WISTAR Rabies PM/WI 38 1503-3M strain). Primary immunization with Imovax@ Rabies
for individuals who have not been exposed to rabies is usually administered as three doses,
the first two doses administered 7 days apart and the third dose 21 days later. A booster is
currently recommended for individuals who may be repeatedly exposed to rabies virus (e.g.,
laboratory workers and veterinarians). Primary immunization with Imovax@ Rabies for
individuals who have been exposed to rabies is usually administered as five doses, one dose
right immediately after exposure, followed by additional doses on the 3 d, 7a, 14,        and 28's
days.
[0023]          It will be appreciated that any rabies virus strain may be used, e.g., without
limitation any of the strains described herein. In some embodiments, a single strain (e.g.,
subtype, serotype, and/or biotype) of rabies virus may be used in accordance with the present
disclosure. In some embodiments, more than one strain (e.g., subtype, serotype and/or
biotype) of rabies virus may be used in accordance with the present disclosure.
        Hepatitis A virus
[0024]          In one aspect, the present application provides immunogenic compositions that
include an inactivated hepatitis A virus (also called "hepatitis A antigen", "HAV antigen" or
"antigen" herein). All known hepatitis A vaccines include an inactivated hepatitis A virus.
[0025]          It will be appreciated that any method may be used to prepare an inactivated
hepatitis A virus. In general however, these methods may involve propagating a hepatitis A
virus in a host cell, lysing the host cell to release the virus, isolating and then inactivating the
antigen. For example, in preparing HAVRIX*, hepatitis A virus strain HM175 is propagated
in MRC-5 human diploid cells. After removal of the cell culture medium, the cells are lysed
to form a suspension. This suspension is purified through ultrafiltration and gel permeation
chromatography procedures. The purified lysate is then treated with formalin to ensure viral
inactivation (e.g., see Andre et al., Prog.Med. Virol 37:72-95, 1990).

                                                7
[0026]          In preparing AIMMUGEN*, hepatitis A virus strain KRM0003 (established
from a wild-type HAV, which had been isolated from the feces of a hepatitis A patient) is
propagated in GL37 cells (a cell strain established for vaccine production from a parent cell
strain of African green monkey kidney). The GL37 cells are inoculated with HAV strain
KRM0003 and antigen is harvested, extensively purified and inactivated with formaldehyde.
[0027]          Another example of an inactivated hepatitis A virus that is commercially
available but is not a licensed vaccine is hepatitis A antigen (HAV-ag) frm Meridian Life
Sciences. Like HAVRIX* the Meridian HAV-ag also derives from hepatitis A virus strain
HM175 but it is propagated in FRhK-4 (fetal rhesus kidney) cells. After removal of cell
culture medium, the cells are lysed to form a suspension and the suspension is partially
purified by gradient centrifugation and inactivated by treatment with formalin.
[0028]          It will be appreciated that any hepatitis A virus strain may be used, e.g.,
without limitation any of the following strains which have been described in the art (and
other non-human variants):
            " Human hepatitis A virus Hu/Arizona/HAS-15/1979
            " Human hepatitis A virus Hu/Australia/HM175/1976
            * Human hepatitis A virus Hu/China/H2/1982
            * Human hepatitis A virus Hu/Costa Rica/CR326/1960
            * Human hepatitis A virus Hu/France/CF-53/1979
            " Human hepatitis A virus Hu/Georgia/GA76/1976
            " Human hepatitis A virus Hu/Germany/GBM/1976
            " Human hepatitis A virus Hu/Japan/HAJ85-1/1985
            " Human hepatitis A virus Hu/Los Angeles/LA11975
            " Human hepatitis A virus Hu/Northern Africa/MBB/1978
            " Human hepatitis A virus Hu/Norway/NOR-21/1998
            * Human hepatitis A virus Hu/Sierra Leone/SLF88/1988
            * Human hepatitis A virus MSMl
            * Human hepatitis A virus Shanghai/LCDC-1/1984
[0029]          In addition, while formalin and formaldehyde are commonly used to inactivate
licensed hepatitis A vaccines it is to be understood that other techniques could be used, e.g.,
treatment with chlorine, exposure to high temperatures, etc.

                                                8
[0030]          In certain embodiments it may prove advantageous to add additional steps to
the traditional method for preparing an inactivated hepatitis A virus. For example, U.S.
Patent No. 6,991,929 describes including a protease treatment step (e.g., trypsin) after the
virus has been propagated. This step was found to improve the removal of host cell material
and yield a purer
[0031]          It is to be understood that any one of these licensed hepatitis A vaccines may
be combined with another antigen to produce an immunogenic composition.
II. Vesieles
[0032]          In general, immunogenic compositions of the present disclosure include a non
ionic surfactant vesicle (NISV). As is well known in the art, vesicles generally have an
aqueous compartment enclosed by one or more bilayers which include amphipathic
molecules. Any non-ionic surfactant with appropriate amphipathic properties may be used to
form such a vesicle. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the antigen present in the
composition is associated with the vesicle (i.e., encapsulated within an aqueous core of the
vesicle and/or associated with a vesicle bilayer). These embodiments are encompassed by the
term "antigen-containing vesicle." In certain embodiments an immunogenic composition
may also include amounts or components of the antigen that are not associated with a vesicle.
[0033]          Without limitation, examples of suitable surfactants include ester-linked
surfactants based on glycerol. Such glycerol esters may comprise one of two higher aliphatic
acyl groups, e.g., containing at least ten carbon atoms in each acyl moiety. Surfactants based
on such glycerol esters may comprise more than one glycerol unit, e.g., up to 5 glycerol units.
Glycerol monoesters may be used, e.g., those containing a Cia-C 2oalkanoyl or alkenoyl
moiety, for example caproyl, lauroyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, oleyl or stearoyl. An exemplary
surfactant is 1-monopalmitoyl glycerol.
[0034]          Ether-linked surfactants may also be used as the non-ionic surfactant. For
example, ether-linked surfactants based on glycerol or a glycol having a lower aliphatic
glycol of up to 4 carbon atoms, such as ethylene glycol, are suitable. Surfactants based on
such glycols may comprise more than one glycol unit, e.g., up to 5 glycol units (e.g.,
diglycolcetyl ether and/or polyoxyethylene-3-lauryl ether). Glycol or glycerol monoethers
may be used, including those containing a C, 2 -C2 oalkanyl or alkenyl moiety, for example

                                                  9
capryl, lauryl, myristyl, cetyl, oleyl or stearyl. Ethylene oxide condensation products that can
be used include those disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO8/06882 (e.g., polyoxyethylene
higher aliphatic ether and amine surfactants). Exemplary ether-linked surfactants include 1
monocetyl glycerol ether and diglycolcetyl ether.
[0035]           It is also to be understood that vesicles may also incorporate an ionic
amphiphile, e.g., to cause the vesicles to take on a negative charge. For example, this may
help to stabilize the vesicles and provide effective dispersion. Without limitation, acidic
materials such as higher alkanoic and alkenoic acids (e.g., palmitic acid, oleic acid) or other
compounds containing acidic groups including phosphates such as dialkyl phosphates (e.g.,
dicetylphospate, or phosphatidic acid or phosphatidyl serine) and sulphate monoesters such as
higher alkyl sulphates (e.g., cetylsulphate), may all be used for this purpose. The ionic
amphiphile, if present, will typically comprise, between 1 and 50%1/ by weight of the non
ionic surfactant (e.g., 1-5%, 1-10%, 1-15%, 1-20, 1-25%, 1-30%, 1-35%, 1-40%, 1-45%, 5
 10/, 5-15%, 5-20,        5-25%, 5-30%, 5-35%, 5-40%, 5-45%, 5-50%, 10-15%, 10-20%, 10
25%, 10-30%, 10-35%, 10-40%, 10-45%, 10-50%, 15-20%, 15-25%, 15-30%, 15-35%, 15
40/, 15-45%, 15-50%, 20-25%, 20-30%, 20-35%, 20-40%, 20-45%, 20-50%, 25-30%, 25
35%, 25-40%, 25-45%, 25-50%, 30-35%, 30-40%, 30-45%, 30-50%, 35-40%, 35-45%, 35
500/%, 40-45%, 40-50%, or 45-50%).
[0036]           To form vesicles, the components may be admixed with an appropriate
hydrophobic material of higher molecular mass capable of forming a bi-layer (such as a
steroid, e.g., a sterol such as cholesterol). The presence of the steroid assists in forming the
bi-layer on which the physical properties of the vesicle depend. The steroid, if present, will
typically comprise between 20 and 120% by weight of the non-ionic surfactant (e.g., 20-30%,
20-40%, 20-50%, 20-60%, 20-70%, 20-80%, 20-90%, 20-100%, 20-110%, 30-40%3 30-50%,
30-60%, 30-70%, 30-80%, 30-90%, 30-100%, 30-110%, 30-120%, 4 0- 5 0%, 40-60%, 40
70%, 40-80%, 40-90%, 40-100%, 40-110%, 40-120%, 50-60%, 50-70%, 50-8 0 %, 50-90%,
50-100%, 50-110%, 50-120%, 60-70%, 60-80%, 60-90%, 60-100%, 60-110%, 60-120%, 70
80%, 70-90%, 70-100%, 70-110%, 70-120%, 80-90%, 80-100%, 80-110%, 80-120%, 90
 100%, 90-110%, 90-120%, 100-110%, 100-120%, or 110-120%).
[0037]           In certain embodiments, the vesicles comprise a non-ionic surfactant, an ionic
amphiphile and a steroid. In certain embodiments, the vesicles comprise 1-monopalmitoyl
glycerol, dicetylphospate and cholesterol.

[0038]          In certain embodiments, the vesicles consist essentially of a non-ionic
surfactant, an ionic amphiphile and a steroid. In certain embodiments, the vesicles consist
essentially of 1-monopalmitoyl glycerol, dicetylphospate and cholesterol.
[0039]          In certain embodiments, the vesicles do not comprise a transport enhancing
molecule which facilitates the transport of lipid-like molecules across mucosal membranes.
In some embodiments, the vesicles do not comprise a "bile acid" such as cholic acid and
chenodeoxycholic acid, their conjugation products with glycine or taurine such as glycocholic
and taurocholic acid, derivatives including deoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acid, and salts
of each of these acids. In some embodiments, the vesicles do not comprise acyloxylated
amino acids, such as acylcarnitines and salts thereof, and palmitoylcamitines.
Methodsfor making vesicles
[0040]          It will be appreciated that there are known techniques for preparing vesicles
comprising non-ionic surfactants, such as those referred to in PCT Publication No.
W093/019781. An exemplary technique is the rotary film evaporation method, in which a
film of non-ionic surfactant is prepared by rotary evaporation from an organic solvent, e.g., a
hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent such as chloroform, e.g., see Russell and
Alexander, J Immunol. 140:1274, 1988. The resulting thin film is then rehydrated in
bicarbonate buffer optionally in the presence of antigen.
[0041]          Another method for the production of vesicles is that disclosed by Collins et
al., J Pharm. Pharmacol.42:53, 1990. This method involves melting a mixture of the non
ionic surfactant, steroid (if used) and ionic amphiphile (if used) and hydrating with vigorous
mixing in the presence of aqueous buffer.
[0042]          Another method involves hydration in the presence of shearing forces. An
apparatus that can be used to apply such shearing forces is a well-known, suitable equipment
(see, e.g., PCT Publication No. W088/06882). Sonication and ultra-sonication are also
effective means to form the vesicles or to alter their particle size.
[0043]          In certain embodiments, at least a portion of the viral antigen is associated
with lipid vesicles (where, as used herein, the term "association" encompasses any form of
physical interaction). In certain embodiments, at least a portion of the viral antigen is
entrapped within lipid vesicles. Association and entrapment may be achieved in any manner.

                                                11
For example, in the rotary film evaporation technique, this can be achieved by hydration of
the film in the presence of antigen. In other methods, the viral antigen may be associated
with preformed vesicles by a dehydration-rehydration method in which viral antigen present
in the aqueous phase is entrapped by flash freezing followed by lyophilization, e.g., see Kirby
and Gregoriadis,Biotechnology 2:979, 1984. Alternatively a freeze thaw technique may be
used in which vesicles are mixed with the viral antigen and repeatedly flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and warmed to a temperature of the order of, e.g., 60'C (i.e., above the transition
temperature of the relevant surfactant), e.g., see Pick, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 212:195,
 1981.
[0044]          In certain embodiments, vesicles for use in accordance with the present
invention are prepared by a method that includes: melting the non-ionic surfactant (optionally
with a steroid and/or an ionic amphiphile, collectively the "lipids") to produce a molten
mixture; combining the molten mixture with an aqueous solution that includes a viral antigen;
and homogenizing the resulting product. In certain embodiments, the molten mixture is are
added to the aqueous solution that includes the viral antigen. In certain embodiments,
aqueous solution that includes the viral antigen is added to the molten mixture.
[0045]          In certain embodiments, the molten mixture and aqueous solution are
combined in relative amounts and volumes that achieve a lipid concentration of at least about
2 mg/mI in the resulting product. Indeed, through experimentation and as described in the
Examples, we have found that when the lipids and viral antigen are homogenized with a lipid
concentration in excess of 5 mg/ml the resulting compositions tend to be more thermostable
than when a lower lipid concentration is used (see Examples). In some embodiments,
therefore, the present invention provides desirable compositions (specifically including
thermostable compositions) comprising a viral antigen and vesicles, which compositions
contain a specified lipid concentration established herein to impart particular characteristics
(e.g., improved thermostability) to the compositions.
[0046]          In certain embodiments, a lipid concentration of at least about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,25, 30, 35,40,45,50, 55, 60, 65,70,75, 80,
85, 90 or 95 mg/ml is achieved. In certain embodiments, the lipid concentration is in a range
of about 5 mg/ml to about 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or 25 mg/mlI. In certain
embodiments, the lipid concentration is in a range of about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
mg/mI to about 30 mg/ml. In certain embodiments, the lipid concentration is in a range of

                                               12
about 2 mg/ml to about 5 mg/ml, about 5 mg/nl to about 50 mg/ml, about 5 mg/ml to about
25 mg/ml, about 10 mg/mi to about 50 mg/ml, about 10 mg/ml to about 30 mg/ml, or about
 10 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml.
[0047]          In some embodiments, the non-ionic surfactant (optionally with other
components such as a steroid and/or an ionic amphiphile) is melted at a temperature range
between 120*C and 150'C (e.g., between 120*C and 125*C, between 120*C and 130*C,
between 120'C and 140 0 C, between 130 0 C and 140*C, between 135*C and 145*C, or
between 140*C and 145 0 C). In some embodiments, the non-ionic surfactant (optionally with
other components such as a steroid and/or an ionic amphiphile) is melted at about 1201C, at
about 125*C, at about 1301C, at about 135*C, at about 140*C, at about 145*C or at about
 150 0 C.
[0048]          In some embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising a viral antigen is
temperature controlled. In some embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising a viral
antigen is kept at a temperature of less than about 50*C during the step of adding (e.g., less
than about 45*C, less than about 40*C, less than about 35*C, less than about 30'C, less than
about 25*C, etc.). In some embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising a viral antigen is
kept at a temperature range between about 250 C and about 50*C. In some embodiments, the
aqueous solution comprising a viral antigen is kept at room temperature.
[0049]          In certain embodiments the vesicles are made by a process which includes
steps of providing a lyophilized non-ionic surfactant (optionally with other components such
as a steroid and/or an ionic amphiphile) and rehydrating the lyophilized non-ionic surfactant
with an aqueous solution comprising a antigen such that antigen-containing vesicles are
formed. The lyophilized non-ionic surfactant is prepared by melting the non-ionic surfactant
(optionally with other components such as a steroid and/or an ionic amphiphile) to produce a
molten mixture and then lyophilizing the molten mixture.
[0050]          As described in more detail herein, in some embodiments, an immunogenic
composition that includes a antigen formulated with vesicles may be lyophilized for future
use and subsequently hydrated prior to use.

                                                13
Vesicle size and processing
[0051]          It will be appreciated that a vesicle composition will typically include a
mixture of vesicles with a range of sizes. It is to be understood that the diameter values listed
below correspond to the most frequent diameter within the mixture. In some embodiments >
90% of the vesicles in a composition will have a diameter which lies within 50% of the most
frequent value (e.g., 1000 + 500 nm). In some embodiments the distribution may be
narrower, e.g., > 90% of the vesicles in a composition may have a diameter which lies within
40, 30, 20, 10 or 5% of the most frequent value. In some embodiments, sonication or ultra
sonication may be used to facilitate vesicle formation and/or to alter vesicle particle size. In
some embodiments, filtration, dialysis and/or centrifugation may be used to adjust the vesicle
size distribution.
[0052]          In general, vesicles produced in accordance with the methods of the present
disclosure may be of any size. In certain embodiments, the composition may include vesicles
with diameter in range of about 10 nm to about 10 pm. In certain embodiments, vesicles are
of diameters between about 100 nm to about 5 pIn. In certain embodiments, vesicles are of
diameters between about 500 nm to about 2 pum. In certain embodiments, vesicles are of
diameters between about 800 nm to about 1.5 pm. In some embodiments, the compositions
may include vesicles with a diameter in the range of about 150 nm to about 15 pm. In certain
embodiments, the vesicles may have a diameter which is greater than 10 Im, e.g., about 15
pum to about 25 pm. In certain embodiments, the vesicles may have a diameter in the range
of about 0.1 pi to about 20 Im, about 0.1 pm to about 15          about 0.1
                                                                mon,           m to about 10 pm,
about 0.5 pum to about 20 pm, about 0.5 pm to about 15 pum, about 0.5 pm to about 10 m,
about I Im to about 20 pum, about 1 pm to about 15 pm, or about 1 pm to about 10 pm. In
certain embodiments, the vesicles may have a diameter in the range of about 2 pim to about
10 pm, e.g., about I pom to about 4 Im. In certain embodiments, the vesicles may have a
diameter which is less than 150 nm, e.g., about 50 nm to about 100 nm.
Lyophilization
[0053]          Liquid formulation of vaccines has been the default presentation since the
introduction of vaccines. Most of the existing liquid vaccine compositions have been
developed for storage under refrigeration, but not at higher temperatures, with the result that

                                                14
their stability may not be optimal. In some cases, licensed vaccines are currently formulated
and stored as liquids. In the aqueous environment the antigens are subjected to physical and
chemical degradation that may lead to inactivation and loss of potency.
[0054]          As discussed above, the methods of the present disclosure may include a step
of lyophilizing a solution of a non-ionic surfactant (optionally with other components such as
a steroid and/or an ionic amphiphile). Lyophilization is an established method used to
enhance the long-term stability of products. Enhancement of physical and chemical stability
is thought to be accomplished by preventing degradation and hydrolysis. Lyophilization
involves freezing the preparation in question and then reducing the surrounding pressure (and
optionally heating the preparation) to allow the frozen solvent(s) to sublime directly from the
solid phase to gas (i.e., drying phase). In certain embodiments, the drying phase is divided
into primary and secondary drying phases.
[00551          The freezing phase can be done by placing the preparation in a container (e.g.,
a flask, eppendorf tube, etc.) and optionally rotating the container in a bath which is cooled
by mechanical refrigeration (e.g., using dry ice and methanol, liquid nitrogen, etc.). In some
embodiments, the freezing step involves cooling the preparation to a temperature that is
below the eutectic point of the preparation. Since the eutectic point occurs at the lowest
temperature where the solid and liquid phase of the preparation can coexist, maintaining the
material at a temperature below this point ensures that sublimation rather than evaporation
will occur in subsequent steps.
[0056]          The drying phase (or the primary drying phase when two drying phases are
used) involves reducing the pressure and optionally heating the preparation to a point where
the solvent(s) can sublimate. This drying phase typically removes the majority of the
solvent(s) from the preparation. It will be appreciated that the freezing and drying phases are
not necessarily distinct phases but can be combined in any manner. For example, in certain
embodiments, the freezing and drying phases may overlap.
[0057]          A secondary drying phase can optionally be used to remove residual solvent(s)
that was adsorbed during the freezing phase. Without wishing to be bound to any theory, this
phase involves raising the temperature to break any physico-chemical interactions that have
formed between the solvent molecules and the frozen preparation. Once the drying phase is

                                               15
complete, the vacuum can be broken with an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen or helium) before the
lyophilized product is optionally sealed.
[0058]          In some embodiments, the lyophilized product is substantially free of organic
solvent(s).
[0059]          Excipients such as sucrose, amino acids or proteins such as gelatin or serum
albumin may be used to protect the antigen during the drying process and storage. In some
embodiments, a lyoprotectant may be used to protect antigens during lyophilization.
Exemplary lyoprotectants include sucrose, trehalose, polyethylene glycol (PEG), dimethyl
succinate buffer (DMS), bovine serum albumin (BSA), mannitol, sorbitol, and dextran. Any
suitable amount and/or combination of lyoprotectant(s) may be used to protect the antigen.
For example, as demonstrated in U.S. Patent 6,290,967, the dual presence of a disaccharide
(e.g., sucrose) and a 6-carbon polyhydric alcohol (e.g., a sorbitol) enhanced the stability of a
vaccine composition compared to control compositions. Sucrose was added in an amount
ranging from 10 to 70 grams per liter of vaccine, and sorbitol was added in an amount
ranging from about 15 to 90 grams per liter of vaccine.
Rehydration
[0060]          Once a solution has been lyophilized, the methods of the present disclosure
may include a step of rehydrating the lyophilized product to form antigen-containing vesicles.
In some embodiments, this is achieved by mixing the lyophilized product with an aqueous
solution comprising a antigen. In some embodiments, this involves adding the aqueous
solution to the lyophilized product.
[0061]          In some embodiments, the antigen-containing vesicles contain at least about
 10% of the antigen added in the step of rehydrating. In some embodiments, the antigen
containing vesicles contain at least about 20% of the antigen added in the step of rehydrating.
In some embodiments, the antigen-containing vesicles contain at least about 30% of the
antigen added in the step of rehydrating. In some embodiments, the antigen-containing
vesicles contain at least about 4 0 of the antigen added in the step of rehydrating. In some
embodiments, the antigen-containing vesicles contain at least about 50% of the antigen added
in the step of rehydrating. In some embodiments, the antigen-containing vesicles contain at
least about 60% of the antigen added in the step of rehydrating. In some embodiments, the

                                               16
antigen-containing vesicles contain at least about 70% of the antigen added in the step of
rehydrating. In some embodiments, the antigen-containing vesicles contain at least about
80% of the antigen added in the step of rehydrating. In some embodiments, the antigen
containing vesicles contain at least about 90% of the antigen added in the step of rehydrating.
[0062]          In some embodiments, the aqueous solution includes a buffer. The buffer used
will typically depend on the nature of the antigen or antigens in the aqueous solution. For
example, without limitation, a PCB buffer, an Na 2HPO4/NaH 2PO 4 buffer, a PBS buffer, a
bicine buffer, a Tris buffer, a HEPES buffer, a MOPS buffer, etc. may be used. PCB buffer is
produced by mixing sodium propionate, sodium cacodylate, and bis-Tris propane in the molar
ratios 2:1:2. Varying the amount of HCI added enables buffering over a pH range from 4-9.
In some embodiments, a carbonate buffer may be used.
[0063]          In some embodiments, a composition of antigen-containing vesicles may be
lyophilized for future use and subsequently hydrated (e.g., with sterile water or an aqueous
buffer) prior to use. In some embodiments, a composition of antigen-containing vesicles may
be stored at -80T prior to lyophilization.
[0064]          In certain embodiments, the rehydrated immunogenic composition exhibits
substantially the same potency as the immunogenic composition prior to lyophilization.
[0065]          In some embodiments, the rehydrated immunogenic composition exhibits at
least about 50% of the potency as the immunogenic composition prior to lyophilization (e.g.,
at least about 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 99%). In some
embodiments, the level of potency is based on measurements obtained using an ELISA. In
some embodiments, the level of potency is based on a plaque assay measurement.
[0066]          In some embodiments, the rehydrated immunogenic composition exhibits at
least 1.5 fold greater potency as compared to an otherwise equivalent immunogenic
composition that was formulated without NISV (e.g., at least about 2 fold, 2.5 fold, 3 fold,
3.5 fold, 4 fold or 5 fold). In some embodiments, the level of potency is based on
measurements obtained using an ELISA. In some embodiments, the level of potency is based
on a plaque assay measurement.

                                                 17
Storage
[0067]           In certain embodiments, the lyophilized immunogenic composition may be
stored for a period of time (e.g., days, weeks or months) prior to rehydration and
administration to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments, the lyophilized
immunogenic composition is exposed to temperatures in excess of 8*C during storage (e.g.,
temperatures in excess of lOT, 15*C , 20C, 25*C , 30*C, 35*C, or 40*C, temperatures in the
range of l0C to 40*C, temperatures in the range of 20*C to 40C, temperatures in the range
of 30*C to 40C, temperatures in the range of 10*C to 30*C, temperatures in the range of 20CC
to 30"C, room temperature, etc.). In certain embodiments, the lyophilized immunogenic
composition is stored under conditions that are not temperature controlled.
[0068]           In certain embodiments, the lyophilized immunogenic compositions are
thermostable in that the potency of the immunogenic composition remains substantially
unchanged during storage despite being exposed to temperatures in excess of 8*C (e.g.,
temperatures in excess of 10*C, 15*C , 20'C , 25*C , 30*C, 35*C, or 40*C, temperatures in the
range of 10*C to 40C, temperatures in the range of 20*C to 40*C, temperatures in the range
of 30*C to 40"C, temperatures in the range of 10*C to 30*C, temperatures in the range of 20*C
to 30*C, room temperature, etc.) for a period of I to 36 months or longer (e.g., 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16,18, 20,22, 24, 28,36, or more months).
[0069]           In certain embodiments, storage of the lyophilized immunogenic composition
at these elevated temperatures destroys less than 20% of the potency of the antigen (e.g., less
than 15%, less than 10%, less than 5%, less than 1%) as measured in an ELISA and as
compared to an equivalent lyophilized immunogenic composition that was stored between 2
and 8"C for the same time period.
[0070]           In certain embodiments, the potency of the antigen post-storage is at least 1.5
fold greater than in an otherwise equivalent lyophilized immunogenic composition that was
stored under the same elevated temperatures but that was formulated without NISV (e.g., at
least about 2 fold, 2.5 fold, 3 fold, 3.5 fold, 4 fold or 5 fold). In some embodiments, the level
of potency is based on measurements obtained using an ELISA. In some embodiments, the
level of potency is based on plaque assay measurements.
[0071]           In some embodiments, one or more of these potency results are obtained when
the lyophilized immunogenic composition is stored at 25CC for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months. In

                                                18
some embodiments, these results are obtained when the lyophilized immunogenic
composition is stored at 15 *C, 20*C, 30"C, 35*C or 40 C for I month. In some
embodiments, these results are obtained when the lyophilized immunogenic composition is
stored at 15*C, 20'C, 30*C, 350 C or 40 C for 2 months. In some embodiments, these results
are obtained when the lyophilized immunogenic composition is stored at 15 *C,200 C, 30*C,
35*C or 40*C for 3 months. In some embodiments, these results are obtained when the
lyophilized immunogenic composition is stored at 15*C, 20'C, 30*C, 35*C or 40 C for 4
months. In some embodiments, these results are obtained when the lyophilized immunogenic
composition is stored at 150 C, 20 0C, 300 C, 35*C or 40*C for 5 months. hi some
embodiments, these results are obtained when the lyophilized immunogenic composition is
stored at 15'C, 20*C, 30'C, 35'C or 40*C for 6 months. In some embodiments, these results
are obtained when the lyophilized immunogenic composition is stored at 15*C, 20*C, 30*C,
350 C or 40*C for 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 12
months, 14 months, 16 months, 18 months, 20 months, 22 months, 24 months, 28 months, 36
months, or longer. In certain embodiments these temperatures may be allowed to vary within
a range, e.g., + 2*C.
IV. Dosage and administration
[0072]          The compositions and methods of this disclosure are useful for treating
infections in humans including adults and children. In general, however, compositions and
methods of the present disclosure may be used with any animal. In certain embodiments,
compositions and methods herein may be used for veterinary applications, e.g., canine and
feline applications. If desired, compositions and methods herein may also be used with farm
animals, such as ovine, avian, bovine, porcine and equine breeds.
[0073]          Compositions described herein will generally be administered in such amounts
and for such a time as is necessary or sufficient to induce an immune response. Dosing
regimens may consist of a single dose or a plurality of doses over a period of time. The exact
amount of an immunogenic composition to be administered may vary from subject to subject
and may depend on several factors. Thus, it will be appreciated that, in general, the precise
dose used will be as determined by the prescribing physician and will depend not only on the
weight of the subject and the route of administration, but also on the age of the subject and
the severity of the symptoms and/or the risk of infection.

                                                19
[0074]           In certain embodiments, the antigen is taken from a licensed human viral
vaccine and the immunogenic composition is administered to a human at a dose that is less
than the standard human dose (e.g., in the range of 10-90%, 10-80%, 10-70%, 10-60%, 10
50/, 10-40%, 10-30%, 10-20/, 20-90%, 20-80%, 20-70%, 20-60%, 20-50%, 20-40%, 20
3  0 , 30-90%, 30-80%, 30-70%, 30-60%, 30-50%, 30-40%, 40-90%, 40-80%, 40-70%, 40
6  0 , 40-50%, 50-90%, 50-80%, 50-70%, 50-60%, 60-90%, 60-80%, 60-70%, 70-90%, 70
80%, or 80-90% of the standard human dose).
[0075]           In certain embodiments the immunogenic composition is administered as a
single dose. In certain embodiments the immunogenic composition is administered as more
than one dose (e.g., 1-3 doses that are separated by 1-12 months).
[0076]           In certain embodiments, the compositions may be formulated for delivery
parenterally, e.g., by injection. In such embodiments, administration may be, for example,
intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, or subcutaneous, or via by infusion or needleless
injection techniques. In certain embodiments, the compositions may be formulated for
intramuscular delivery. In certain embodiments, the compositions may be formulated for
subcutaneous delivery. For such parenteral administration, the compositions may be
prepared and maintained in conventional lyophilized compositions and reconstituted prior to
administration with a pharmaceutically acceptable saline solution, such as a 0.9% saline
solution. The pH of the injectable composition can be adjusted, as is known in the art, with a
pharmaceutically acceptable acid, such as methanesulfonic acid. Other acceptable vehicles
and solvents that may be employed include Ringer's solution and U.S.P. In addition, sterile,
fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose
any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition,
fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. The injectable
compositions can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter,
or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be
dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.
[0077]           In some embodiments, compositions described herein (e.g., antigen-containing
vesicles described herein) elicit immune responses that are higher than immune responses
elicited by corresponding compositions comprising antigens but lacking vesicles. In some
embodiments, compositions comprising antigen-containing vesicles elicit immune responses
that are at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 125%,

 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 500%, 750%, 1000% or more, higher than immune responses
elicited by compositions comprising corresponding antigens but lacking vesicles. Immune
responses can be measured using known assays, such as, for example, an enzyme immune
assay (EIA) such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a radioimmune assay
(RIA), a Western blot assay, or a slot blot assay. These methods are described in, e.g.,

                                             Examples
[0078]          The following examples describe some exemplary modes of making and
practicing certain compositions that are described herein. It should be understood that these
examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to limit the scope of the
compositions and methods described herein.
Example 1: Inverted meltformulation methodfor preparing andgen-containing vesiles
[0079]          This example describes an inverted melt formulation method for preparing
antigen-containing non-ionic surfactant vesicles (NISV). In Step 1, a 5:4:1 molar ratio of the
following lipids: 1-monopalmitoyl glycerol (MPG), cholesterol (CHO) and dicetyl phosphate
(DCP) was placed in a flat bottom 50 ml glass beaker, ensuring none of the powder stuck to
the side of the glass beaker. The lipids were melted in a heated oil bath at about 120-125*C
for 10 minutes, with occasional swirling in the glass beaker covered with aluminum foil.
[0080]          At this stage, a stock solution of inactivated antigen vaccine (Imovax@ Rabies
vaccine reconstituted as per manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur's instructions) was pre-incubated
for 5-10 minutes at about 30-35 0 C in a heated water bath. In Step 2, the resulting vaccine
stock solution was homogenized at 8,000 rpm at 30-350 C, and the molten lipid mixture was
added into the homogenizing vaccine stock solution (to give either a 6.25 mg/ml - test article
 1 (TA 1), 12.5 mg/ml - test article 2 (TA 2) or 25 mg/ml - test article 3 (TA 3) total lipid
concentration homogenate) and homogenization was continued for a further 30 seconds at
about 30'C. The resulting liposomal suspension homogenate was transferred into a closed
bottle and shaken for 30 minutes at 22010 rpm and about 30-35*C. An equivalent volume
of a 400 mM sucrose solution in WFI water was added to the shaken homogenate and the
homogenate was further shaken for 5 minutes at 220+10 rpm at about 30-35'C. This

                                                  21
mixture was aliquoted (0.5ml aseptically transferred into sterile 2 cc vials sealed with a
rubber stopper) and frozen at -78 to -82*C, then lyophilized and reconstituted with sterile
water for injection (WFI) prior to use in thermostability studies or in vivo immunogenicity
studies in animals.
Example 2: Thermostability studies of inverted melt methodformulated antigen
containing Vesices
[0081]          To assess thermostability, NISVs were prepared as described in Example 1,
and lyophilized aliquots were stored (prior to reconstitution) at two different thermal storage
temperatures (53*C and 40&2*C). The freeze-dried Inovax@ Rabies vaccine, used in this
Study, is stable if stored in the refrigerator at 2*C to 8*C; while reconstituted vaccine is not
stable and should be used immediately. The Imovax@ Rabies vaccine is also not stable at
elevated temperatures in either lyophilized or reconstituted forms. At specified times,
stability samples were removed from the temperature chambers, reconstituted in WFI and
analyzed by appearance, pH, microscopy, Zeta Potential, nanosizing and ELISA (antigen
content). Vaccine controls (Test article 7 (TA 7) - unformulated lyophilized Imovax@
Rabies vaccine) were stored as above but without addition of NISVs and were also tested.
[0082]          Rabies antigen content in NISV formulations was determined by performing a
sandwich ELISA assay. Prior to the ELISA analysis, samples and standards were extracted
by adding an equal volume of 100 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5) with 0.5%
Triton X-100 and pipetting up and down 10 times. Briefly, each well of 96 well ELISA
plates was coated overnight at 4C with rabies virus monoclonal antibody (Ms Mab to Rabies
virus (4.2 mg/ml) abl002, Abcam) diluted 1/2000 in 25mM bicarbonate buffer pH 9.7. The
next day the coating solution was removed and the plates were blocked (1-3 hours at 370 C)
with 5% FBS in 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. After the incubation time, plates were washed six
times in wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS). Then four to eight 2-fold serial dilutions of
each extracted sample and standard were prepared using 5% FBS in 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS.
The extracted and diluted samples and standards were added to the 96 well ELISA plates and
were incubated for 1.5 h at 370 C. The plates were washed six times in wash buffer and
incubated for lh at 37*C with primary antibody (1/500 dilution of ferret sent in blocking
solution). The plates were washed six times in wash buffer and incubated for lh at 37*C with
a 1/10,000 dilution of a goat anti-ferret IgG-Fc HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Bethyl).

                                                22
The plates were washed six times and developed using TMB substrate for 10 min at room
temperature. Stop solution was added to each well and absorbance was read at 450 nm
within I hour using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad).
[0083]           In Table 2 in vitro antigen content results are shown for TA I (Imovax@
Rabies vaccine formulated in 6.25 mg/mI total lipid concentration NISVs), TA 2 (Imovax@
Rabies vaccine in 12.5 mg/ml total lipid concentration NISVs), TA 3 (Imovax@ Rabies
vaccine in 25 mg/ml total lipid concentration NISVs) and TA 7 (unformulated lyophilized
ImovaxR Rabies vaccine) stability samples stored at either 40 C or 40'C for 0, 5 or 9 months.
(Percent antigen content reflects the ratio of antigen detected in extracts from NISVs relative
to the initial amount of inactivated antigen vaccine used in the preparation of NISVs).

[0084]           As can be seen in Table 2 there is no difference in thermostability between
4*C and 40*C stored samples of the same test articles for up to 9 months but overall the
higher lipid concentration NISVs formulations stored at both temperatures were found to
have a lower in vitro antigen content.

                                              23
[0085]         In Table 3 is shown the in vitro antigen content loss between 4C and 40'C
stored samples for TA 1 (Imovax@ Rabies vaccine formulated in 6.25 mg/ml total lipid
concentration NISVs) and TA 7 (unformulated lyophilized Imovax@ Rabies vaccine)
stability samples stored at either 4CC or 40*C for 0, 5, 9 or 18 months.

[0086]         As can be seen in Table 3 no appreciable loss in antigen content occurred
between the 40 C and 40*C stored NTSVs formulated Rabies Imovax@ vaccine (TA I - 6.25
mg/ml total lipid concentration NISVs) for up to 18 months indicative of thermostability;
while TA 7 (unformulated Rabies vaccine) loses significant antigen content between the 40 C
and 400 C stored samples at the same time points which indicates lack of thermostability.
[0087]         In Table 4 is presented the physical-chemical data derived on testing NISVs
formulated Imovax@ Rabies vaccine (TA I - 6.25 mg/ml total lipid concentration NISVs
stored for 18 months at 4*C and 40*C) versus unformulated Inovax@ Rabies vaccine (TA 7
stored for 18 months at 4*C and 40'C).

[0088]           As expected the Z-average and zeta potential were different between the two
test articles as TA I was formulated to have lipid-based antigen-containing vesicles and TA 7
was the unformulated vaccine control that did not contain any vesicles. Also as expected the
Osmolality between TA 1 and TA 7 was different due to TA 1 containing sucrose whereas
TA 7 did not contain any sucrose. Test Articles stored at the two different temperatures did
not show any significant differences in physical-chemical parameters when compared to the
other similarly formulated test articles.
Example 3: In Vivo Animal Testing of inverted melt methodformulated antigen
containing vesicles
[0089]           Female Balb/C mice (6-8 weeks old; body weight 18 to 28 grams, Charles
River Canada Inc.) were immunized (n=8) intramuscularly once on day 0 (with 0.lml of
indicated vaccine samples). Pre-immunization and post-ist immunization blood samples
were collected to assess humoral immune responses to formulated and unformulated
Imovax@ Rabies Vaccine. Humoral immune responses were determined by performing an
IgG ELISA Serological Assay. An indirect ELISA was performed to assess anti-rabies
specific IgG titles in immune serum. Briefly, each well of 96 well ELISA plates was coated
overnight at 40 C with rabies antigen (Imovax@ Vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur) diluted 1/25 in
25mM bicarbonate buffer pH 9.7. The next day the plates were washed with PBS containing
0.05% Tween 20 and then blocked (lh at 37*C) with 10% goat sera in PBS. After the

                                               25
incubation time, plates were washed six times in wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS).
Then four to eight 2-fold serial dilutions of each serum sample were prepared using 10% goat
sera in PBS. The sample and the controls were added to the 96 well ELISA plates and were
incubated for 1.5 h at 370 C. The plates were washed six times in wash buffer and incubated
for th at 37*C with a 1/5000 dilution of a goat anti-mouse IgG-Fc HRP conjugated secondary
antibody (Bethyl). The plates were washed six times and developed using TMB substrate for
3 min at room temperature. Absorbance was read at 450 nm with an ELISA plate reader
(Bio-Rad). The inverted end point titre is considered the highest sera dilution for which the
OD450 reading is higher or equal with 0.1. Results on Geometric Mean (GM) of OD450
reading of 1/800 dilution of serum samples are presented in Table 5 for Imovax@ Rabies
Vaccine formulated with lipids as described previously versus unformulated Imovax@ Rabies
