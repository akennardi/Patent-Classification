[0001]     This application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of U.S. Patent
Application No. 13/657,711, filed October 22, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by
reference in its entirety for all purposes.
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]     This invention relates to systems and methods for delivering topical medications
in a metered dose.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]     Topical analgesics are available in many dosage forms, including solutions,
liquids, foams, gels, creams, ointments and the like. They are packaged in various
container closure systems, such as tubes, bottles, pouches, and canisters. One common
issue with many topical analgesic products is inaccurate unit dose dispensing from multi
dose containers, which may cause patient underdoses or overdoses.
[0004]     A dosing card is a known method to measure topical semi-solid drugs. The
commercially available Voltaren* antiphlogistics and antirheumatics in the form of gels is
an example that uses a dosing card as the primary dose measurement method. When the
medicine gel is squeezed out of a tube to cover a pre-specified area on the dosing card, it is
assumed that the correct dose is dispensed. Although the specified area serves as a guide,
it is not always easy for the users to cover the exact area every time, and its two
dimensional nature also limits the dispensing accuracy.
[0005]     What is needed in the art are new ways to deliver viscous transdermal medicines
administered topically. Methods are needed that will allow accurate and convenient
dosing of a viscous solution or gel for local topical analgesics. Methods for improving
dosing accuracy are desired to prevent wrong dose quantities. The present invention
satisfies these and other needs.

                          BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

  I.    Embodiments
[0016]     The present invention provides methods of and systems for administering topical
agents. In certain aspects, the methods and systems employ a non-pressurized system. In
one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for administering a
recommended dosage of a topical pain reliever in a viscous solution, the method
comprising:
                 actuating a hand pump, the actuating:
        a)       causing a tappet having a rod connected thereto to compress a spring and
        the rod to slide with respect to a piston and enter a metering chamber holding a first
        predetermined amount of topical pain reliever in the viscous solution;
        b)       causing an outlet valve of the metering chamber to open, which allows the
        first predetermined amount of topical pain reliever in the viscous solution to flow
        into a channel or opening of the rod; and then
        c)        causing the piston to stroke when a limit stop of the tappet connects with a
        limit stop of the piston, wherein the first predetermined amount of topical pain
        reliever in the viscous solution is evacuated through an output duct of the tappet,
        which rises back up by action of the spring; and then
                                                4

        d)       causing the outlet value of the metering chamber to close and create a
        vacuum inside the metering chamber and to fill the chamber;
        e)        optionally repeating steps a) through d) to deliver the recommended dose;
        and
        f)       spreading the viscous solution on skin.
[0017]     In certain aspects, the topical pain reliever comprises sodium diclofenac. In
certain aspects, the viscous solution or gel is about 1.5% to about 3%by weight of sodium
diclofenac such as about 2% by weight of sodium diclofenac.
[0018]     FIG. 1 is an illustration of a hand pump 100 suitable for use in the present
invention. The system is available from Rexam PLC (of England and Wales) as a pump
having SP943 as an identifier. A tappet 109 is activated by pressing the top 115 and
compressing a spring 119. The tappet 109 is connected to a rod 110 having a channel 145,
which slides along a piston 150 and enters a metering chamber 135. The metering
chamber 135 is filled with a viscous solution, gel, or formulation. In operation, an outlet
valve of the metering chamber opens, which allows the viscous solution, gel or formulation
to flow into the channel or opening 145 from inlet 120. When a limit stop comes into
contact with the piston 150, a venting hole allows the pressure inside the container to be
the same as the atmospheric pressure. Then, with the piston 150 continuing its stroke, the
viscous solution, gel or formulaion is evacuated through the tappet's output duct. Once the
product has been evacuated, the tappet is released and rises back up by action of the spring.
The outlet valve closes in this movement, since the rod returns to a water-tight position. A
vacuum is created inside the metering chamber, which makes a ball check valve 160 rise
and open the way for the viscous solution, gel, or formulation to be sucked up into the
dosage chamber. At the end of the piston rising stroke, the venting hole and the piston
chamber are no longer in communication, which restores the overall water-tightness of the
system.
[0019]     The metering chamber 135 communicates with a dip tube 170 by means of a ball
check valve 160. The piston 150 slides inside the pump body and, more particularly,
inside the metering chamber 135. In one embodiment, a pump as disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 7,243,820, issued July 17, 2007, hereby incorporated by reference, is suitable for use
in the present invention.
                                                 5

[0020]      In certain aspects, the method further comprises aspirating a second
predetermined amount of a topical pain reliever from a sealed bag holding the viscous
solution, thereby shrinking the bag. In certain instances, pump 100 is disposed above the
bag with dip tube 170 inserted in the bag. Preferably, the bag is metal lined or coated with
polyester or polyethylene. Preferably, the metal pouch is inert to the pain reliever
formulation. The metal can be made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy. In certain
instances, the hand pump is elongated and the actuating occurs when the elongated hand
pump is held at an angle with respect to a gravitational vector. In other instances, the hand
pump is elongated and the actuating occurs when the elongated hand pump is upside-down
with respect to a gravitational vector. An example of the liner is in the Rexam Sof Bag,
which is a foil laminate bag as an inner collapsible package.
[0021]      In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating
signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, the method comprising:
         depressing a hand pump to dispense 1/n of a dose of a topical pain reliever in a
         viscous solution from the hand pump, wherein n is a positive integer, wherein the
         hand pump is configured to dispense the 1/n of the dose within a tolerance specified
         by a corresponding label approved by a government regulatory agency (e.g. United
         States Food and Drug Administration (FDA); and then
         spreading the topical solution on skin.
[0022] In certain instances, the dose tolerance is about ±0-20 %, such as ± 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6,7,8,9,10, 11,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20%. In other instances, the dose
tolerance is about ±5-10%. The term "dose tolerance" includes the accuracy or precision
of the first dose compared to subsequent dose, or as otherwise known in the art. For
example, if the first dose is 1 g, a ±10% dose tolerance is between 0.9 to 1.1 g.
 [0023] In certain instances, the integer "n" has a value from about 1 to about 10 such as 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10. In one instance, n = 1 and the depressing the hand pump a single
time dispenses an entire dose of the viscous topical pain reliever in a viscous solution. In
other instances, n    = 2, wherein the depressing of the hand pump twice dispenses a half
daily dose of the viscous topical pain reliever in a viscous solution. A daily dose may be
two applications of 2 mL, or 4 actuations total.
                                                 6

[0024]      FIGS. 2A-2Z illustrate a sample label that can be approved by a government
regulatory agency. Such labels can include instructions for a pain reliever that are
provided or distributed with the pain reliever, to patients, doctors, pharmacists, etc. The
sample label in the figure is for diclofenac sodium topical solution in a pump in accordance
with an embodiment of the invention.
[0025]      In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a dispensing system
for a topical pain reliever in a viscous solution, the system comprising:
                  a topical pain reliever in a viscous solution comprising sodium diclofenac;
                  a sealed bag holding the viscous solution; and
                  a hand pump in fluid communication with the viscous solution, the hand
pump comprising:
                          a pump housing defining a metering chamber;
                          a tappet having a rod connected thereto to compress a spring and
         slide along a piston and enter a metering chamber holding a first predetermined
         amount of topical pain reliever in a viscous solution, wherein the metering chamber
         is sized for a throughput of 1/n dose of the sodium diclofenac, wherein n is a
         positive integer, wherein the first predetermined amount of topical pain reliever in a
         viscous solution is evacuated through an output duct of the tappet, which rises back
         up by action of the spring to dispense the 1/n of the dose within a tolerance
         specified by a corresponding label approved by a government regulatory agency.
[0026] In certain preferred aspects, the sealed bag holding the viscous solution excludes
air, thereby allowing the hand pump and sealed bag to dispense the viscous solution from
any orientation with respect to a gravity vector. Preferably, the system further comprises a
bottle, a can or other canister enclosing the bag.
[0027] A "gravity vector" includes a direction in which gravity exerts a force on matter or
as otherwise known in the art.

from cellulose polymers, carbomer polymers, a carbomer derivative, a cellulose derivative,
polyvinyl alcohol, poloxamers, polysaccharides, and mixtures thereof.
[0044]    In another aspect of the above embodiments, diclofenac sodium is present at
about 2% w/w; DMSO is present at about 45.5% w/w; ethanol is present at about 23-29%
w/w; propylene glycol is present at about 10-12% w/w; hydroxypropylcellulose (HY 119)
is present at about 0-6% w/w; glycerol is present at about 0-4%, and water is added to
make 100% w/w. In other aspects, there is no glycerol in the gel formulation and
hydroxypropylcellulose (HY 119) is present at about 1-6% w/w. In further aspects, the end
viscosity of the gel is about 500-5000 centipoise.
[0045]    A feature of the above gel formulations is that when such formulations are
applied to the skin, the drying rate is quicker and transdermal flux is higher than previously
described compositions, such as those in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,575,515 and 4,652,557.
Additional features of the preferred formulations include decreased degradation of
diclofenac sodium, which degrades by less than 0.04% over the course of 6 months and a
pH of 6.0-10.0, for example around pH 9.0. In one aspect, the topical formulation is
described in U.S. Application No. 12/134,121, incorporated herein by reference.
[0046]    In another embodiment, the topical formulation comprises, consists essentially of,
or consists of:
                (i) about 1-2% w/w diclofenac sodium;
                (ii) about 40-50% w/w DMSO;
                (iii) about 10-12 % w/w propylene glycol;
                (iv) about 1-30 % w/w ethanol;
                (v) optionally glycerine;
                (vi) water; and
                (vii) at least one thickening agent selected from the group consisting of a
                cellulose polymer, a carbomer polymer, a carbomer derivative, a
                cellulose derivative, hydroxypropyl cellulose and mixtures thereof.
                                               11

[0047]     Preferably the topical formulation has a viscosity of about 500 - 5000 cps, such as
a viscosity of at least 1000 cps. In other embodiments, the viscosity is about 1000-10,000
cps, or about 10,000-15,000 cps, or about 15,000-20,000 cps. In a preferred embodiment,
the viscous solution or formulations has a viscosity of about 800-5000 cps, such as about
800, 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 5000 cps and all numbers in between.
[0048]     In one non-limiting example, the commercially available PENNSAID* 1.5%
topical solution is packaged into a container with a metering pump. Instead of counting 40
drops for one dose with the current commercial container, one single actuation delivers the
claimed unit dose of 1.2 mL.
[0049]     In another non-limiting example, a viscous formulation, with 2% diclofenac
sodium and a thickening agent, is filled into containers with metering pumps. One
actuation accurately delivers 1 gram of the viscous formulation, which is half the claimed
dose.
II.     Methods of Use
[0050]     The topical pain reliever formulations are particularly suited for use in treating
pain-related diseases, disorders, or conditions, such as the treatment of the signs and
symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) chronically. It is also useful for the treatment of other
chronic joint diseases characterized by joint pain, degeneration of articular cartilage,
impaired movement, and stiffness. Suitable joints include the knee, elbow, hand, wrist and
hip. Preferably, the joint includes a knee.
[0051]     Due to the properties of higher flux and in vivo absorption, it is believed that the
formulations of the present invention can be administered at lower dosing than previously
described formulations. In particular, the compositions of the invention can be used at
twice a day dosing or once a day dosing in the treatment of OA. This is a significant
improvement as lower dosing is associated with better patient compliance, an important
factor in treating chronic conditions.
[0052] Suitable amounts per administration will generally depend on the size of the joint,
which varies per individual and per joint, however a suitable amount may range from 0.5
p1/cm 2 to 4.0 pI/cm 2 . Preferably the amount ranges from 2.0 to 3.0 pl/cm 2 . In a preferred
aspect, the dose is 1, 2, 3, or 4 times daily with each dose being between 0.1-4 mL. In a
preferred aspect, the dose is 2 times a day at 2 mL per dose (a total of 4 mL/daily.)

 IV.     Pharmacokinetic Properties
[0053] In vivo tools can demonstrate whether changes in a topical viscous solution affect
local delivery. The FDA has identified four potential technologies to investigate:
     (1) Pharmacokinetic studies may be used to demonstrate efficacy and/or to determine
         product performance of topical viscous solutions. Bioequivalence studies with
         pharmacokinetic or clinical endpoints may be conducted to demonstrate
         equivalence between two different topical viscous solutions. For many topical
         viscous solutions, the amount of drug reaching the systemic circulation can be
         detected in the plasma and compared between topical viscous solutions, although
         its relationship to local delivery is still unknown.
     (2) Skin Stripping removes the top layers of the skin for assay of drug concentration.
     (3) Microdialysis involves inserting a small semipermeable capillary tube into the
         dermis about 1000 mm under the skin. The capillary tube is permeable to the drug;
         therefore, as perfusion fluid flows through the capillary, it takes up drug from the
         extracellular fluid of the tissue.
     (4) Near Infrared Spectroscopy detects a unique signal that indicates the concentration
         of a particular drug and offers the possibility of a noninvasive assay of drug
         delivery to the skin.
[0054] See Critical Path Opportunities for Generic Drugs, Office of Generic Drugs, Office
of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, dated May 1, 2007
available on the FDA.gov website. A skin irritation and sensitization study may also assist
in determining bioequivalence between topical viscous solutions, especially if the
differences involve potential penetration enhancers. See FDA Draft Guidance on
Diclofenac Sodium, Revised June 2011.
[0055] The viscous solution, a topical diclofenac preparation, disclosed herein comprises a
therapeutically effective amount of diclofenac sodium such that the patient quickly attains
sufficient plasma concentrations of diclofenac (e.g., within about 4-12 hours such as about
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 hours) after administration of the solution and maintains pain
relief for about 12 hours after administration of the solution. Although systemic
circulation of diclofenac detected in plasma does not directly correlate to local delivery, the
FDA, in some instances, relies on pharmacokinetic data to determine bioequivalence
between two topical diclofenac solutions. If the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of
                                                  13

the geometric means (test: reference) of the AUC and Cmax fall between 80% and 125%,
the test is bioequivalent to the reference and is presumed to provide a similar therapeutic
effect as the reference. See FDA Draft Guidance on Diclofenac Sodium, Revised June
2011.

ng-hr/mL. Additionally, the mean AUCO- 2 4 for diclofenac sodium at steady state may
range from about 200 ng-hr/mL to about 450 ng-hr/mL, or from about 250 ng-hr/mL to
                                                14

about 405 ng-hr/mL. In another embodiment, the mean AUCO- 2 4 for diclofenac sodium at
steady state may be about 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316,

ng-hr/mL.
[0059] In a further embodiment, the topical diclofenac preparation, when topically
administered to a subject, may produce a plasma profile characterized by a median Tmax
(time to peak plasma concentration) for diclofenac sodium from about 4.0 hours to about
12.0 hours. In an alternate embodiment, the median Tmax for diclofenac sodium may be
from about 6.0 hours to about 10.0 hours. In another embodiment, the median Tmax for

3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 or 8.0 hours.
[0060] In certain aspects, the methods and systems of the present invention provide upon
application of the topical diclofenac preparation in a viscous solution to the knee of a

[0067]      In one aspect, patients are given the following instructions. 1) Remove the pump
cap. 2) To prime the pump, while holding the bottle in an upright but tilted position, press
the pump down firmly and fully several times into a paper towel or tissue until some study
drug comes out. 3) After priming the pump, the bottle is ready to use and does not need to
be primed again. 4) To dispense the drug, press the pump head down firmly and fully to
dispense the drug into the palm of the hand. Release the pump head. 5) Apply the drug
evenly over the entire application area.
  V.     Examples
[0068] Example 1 illustrates the performance evaluation of a 100 mL Rexam Sof'Bag
bottle with 1 mL dispensing pump for diclofenac sodium topical 2.0% w/w.
         1.       Summary
[0069]      The current study was performed to evaluate the dose delivery attributes of the
Rexam Sof Bag container with a metering pump for diclofenac sodium topical gel 2.0%
w/w. The study was conducted on 16 containers over a one month (16 business days)
period. Results show that the container, when filled to full capacity, is capable of
consistently delivering the required number of doses with high precision. The mean unit
                                                  16

dose weight delivered from each container varied from 0.97 to 0.99 g, which is well within
5% of the target dose (1.00 g). Unit dose weight standard deviations from each bottle were
stable at 0.01 g.
         2.       Introduction
[0070]      Diclofenac sodium topical gel 2.0% w/w is a drug under investigation for the
treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee(s).
[0071]      According to FDA guidance document "Container Closure Systems for
Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics," container performance includes "functionality
and/or drug delivery" studies. This study was conducted to evaluate the following
performance aspects: container priming parameters, delivery accuracy and precision,
number of conforming doses, percentage of restitution, residual volume, and waste
volume.
         3.       Materials, Equipment, Methods and Procedures
[0072]      The study was conducted with a Rexam bottle and pump head. The inner pouch
of the Rexam 100 mL bottle has a pressure rating of a half bar (7.2 psi). All instruments,
including pressure gauge and balance were within calibration during this study.
[0073]      Delivery attributes were studied over a total of sixteen (16) business days. The
containers were filled, pumps were primed, and the first two dispensing sessions were
performed. Containers were stored at room temperature during this period.
         4.       Results and Discussion
         4.1.     Container fill weight and deliverable
[0074]      Bottles were manually inflated at 6 psi prior to filling. Each container was filled
to full capacity: just below the bottom of bottle neck and top of the shoulder. The
container weights before and after filling, and before and after dispensing were recorded.
Container fill capacity and deliverable weights were calculated. The total collected sample
weight from each container was also calculated by summation of individual unit dose
weights. Key statistics are summarized below in Table 1.

[0075]      Under the filling conditions used in this study, the deliverable weight (total
delivered) results meet the requirements of USP <698> for multiple-unit containers. The
average deliverable weight is NLT 100% of 120 g minimum requirement, and no
individual is less than 95% of minimum.
          4.2.     Priming requirement
[0076]      The initial data collected at the beginning of bottle dispensing was used to assess
the number of actuations required to fully prime the pump. Data indicated that once
product is discharged, the next actuation always results in a full dose.
[0077]      FIGS. 3A-3B show a run chart (FIG. 3A) and a statistical summary of the first
conforming dose from all containers (FIG. 3B).
[0078]      The number of priming actuations depends on container fill level. In this study,
all containers were filled to full capacity, and two, three, four, or five actuations were
required to fully prime the pump, depending on how full the bottles are filled.
[0079]      Study results demonstrated that each bottle was capable of delivering more than
120 conforming doses. For consistency and comparison across all containers, only the first
120 consecutive doses after priming are analyzed in this session. Conforming doses during
priming and at the end are described in 4.4.
                                                        18

          4.3.1. Overall statistics
[0080]      Overall statistics are listed in Table 2 below. Across all 16 containers, dose
number 33 was consistently the lowest dose among the 120 unit doses. This was caused by
solvent evaporation through the pump head after standing for two weeks.

          4.3.2. Capability analysis
[0081]      The current proposed product specification requires the average dose weight to be
within 0.8-1.2 g. As shown in Table 2 above, mean unit dose weights are all well within
specification. To further examine container pump performance, a capability analysis was
performed on all unit doses sub-grouped by containers. Results demonstrated a high
capability to consistently deliver unit doses in the 0.8-1.2 g range. Even when the range is
set between 0.9-1.1 g, an overall Cpk of 2.89 and Ppk of 1.86 were obtained. The
capability numbers will be higher if a special event, i.e. dose number 33, is excluded from
the analysis.
[0082]      FIGS. 4A-4B summarize the capability analyses results.
[0083]      Table 2A (below) shows comparative, empirical data among other pump designs
that were tested. Three pumps were tested for priming requirements, accuracy and
                                                  19

precision of dispensed amounts, residual product left in the bottles, etc. Accuracy and
precision are reflected in the table.

           Actuation
  *  Calculations were based on the first 120 consecutive doses after priming sessions.
  ** Unit dose No. 33 was dispensed on January 3rd, 2011, two weeks after the previous
  dose was dispensed.
[0084]      As shown in the table, the design of Pump A dispensed product more accurately
(i.e., within 0.02 g of 1.00 g) than Pump B (i.e., within 0.03 g of 1.00 g) and Pump C (i.e.,
within 0.18 g of 1.00 g). Accuracy in dispensing is important so that a product does not
need to be re-formulated (e.g., diluted, made stronger) in order for the pump to dispense
the correct dose. Avoiding re-formulation saves time and effort in gaining regulatory
acceptance of the product for market. An accurate and precise dispensed dose, in an
inexpensive, reliable, and consumer-friendly dispenser, increases safety and effectiveness
of the pain reliever.
[0085]      Also as shown in the table, the design of Pump A dispensed product more
precisely (i.e., within a standard deviation of 0.01 g to its mean) than Pump B (i.e., within a
standard deviation of 0.03 g to its mean) and Pump C (i.e., within 0.06 g to its mean).
Precision in dispensing is important so that doses are repeatable. Similarly, the maximum
                                                20

and minimum single actuations of product should be close to the mean value so as to
minimize dose outliers.
[0086]     Pump A, which is in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, has thus
been shown to be superior to Pumps B and C.
        4.3.3. Process control analysis
[0087]     FIG. 5 is an X-bar/S chart that was used to evaluate the statistical control of the
dispensing study. Each point in the upper chart represents the mean unit dose weight for
all 16 containers, while the lower chart shows all corresponding standard deviations. The
graph confirms the overall mean of 0.98 g per unit dose, with a standard deviation of
0.01g. Although several data points fall outside the ±33 bands, the overall dispensing
appears to be in good statistical control. Dose number 33 is a special cause event due to
product evaporation after extended storage. Closer examination of the low doses before
the late stage of dispensing showed that many of them coincided with the first unit dose in
the morning, again attributed to slight evaporation. Average unit dose weight drop-off at
the end is caused by low product quantity in the containers. Overall, unit dose weight
remained stable and well within the 0.9-1.1 grange. FIG. 5 shows a statistical process
control chart for unit dose weight
        4.4.    Number of conforming doses
[0088]     All 120 doses analyzed above fall within product specification 0.8-1.2 g, they
also meet the following tighter limits proposed in the protocol: within any 20 consecutive
doses, no more than 2 doses out of the 0.9-1.1 g and none out of the 0.8-1.2 g range.
[0089]     Based on above criteria, additional conforming doses were obtained. According
to the protocol, three actuations were performed after the first product was discharged. As
discussed in 4.2., all three actuations were conforming doses. More conforming doses
were also obtained after the dispensing of the 120 unit doses. Overall, the total number of
conforming doses ranged from 126 to 132.
        4.5.    Total waste
[0090]     Total waste quantity includes the priming doses, nonconforming doses at the end,
and residual left in the container. The average total waste was 6.58 g, with a standard
deviation of 1.12 g.
                                               21

         4.6.     Inflation pressure and till capacity
[0091]     After inflation at 6 psi, all containers were filled to the same level. The average
fill weight was 134.06 g, with a standard deviation of 1.21 g. The values varied from
131.57 - 136.08 g.
[0092]     Separately from this protocol, a study was conducted to evaluate the impact of
inflation pressure on fill capacity. An ANOVA analysis was performed and the results are
summarized in below. A comparison of the mean capacity at each pressure was made
against capacities at all other pressures, using Fisher's pairwise test. Statistical differences
in fill capacities were seen between the following pressures: 3 and 5 & above, 4 and 5&
above, 5 and 7 psi.

The foregoing is an ANOVA summary of the pressure impact on fill capacity.
         4.7.    Recommended minimum fill weight
[0093]     The number of conforming doses is directly dependent on container fill weight
and unit dose weight. Based on a conservative total waste quantity of 8 g, the following
minimum fill weights are suggested at different unit dose weights.

         5.      Conclusion
[0094]      The Rexam Sof Bag 100 mL container with 1 mL dispensing pump is capable of
delivering NLT 120 unit doses of Pennsaid Gel with high precision and accuracy. The
mean unit dose weight delivered from all containers is 0.98 g, with a standard deviation of
0.01 g. Dose delivery attributes remained stable over 30 dispensing sessions & one month
study period.
         6.      Deviations
[0095]      The protocol specified a target fill weight of 132 g (range 131-133 g). However,
in order to evaluate fill capacity variability at set pressure of 6 psi, all containers were
filled to full capacity. The actual fill weights ranged from 131.57 - 136.08 g.
100961 Example 2: Clinical Pharmacokinetic Analysis of a Topical Viscous Solution
of 2.0 % w/w Diclofenac Sodium- Multiple Dose
[0097]      A 2.0% w/w diclofenac sodium topical viscous solution of the present invention
was applied to both knees (2 mL [40.4 mg] per knee), topically, every 12 ± 0.5 hours for
7.5 consecutive days in the fed condition. Subjects dispensed the solution from the hand
Pump A of Example 1 and applied the topical viscous solution to clean dry skin. To avoid
spillage, 2 mL (2 pumps) of the topical viscous solution was dispensed first into the hand
and then onto the knee. The topical viscous solution was spread evenly around front, back
and sides of knee. The procedure was repeated to the other knee allowing the application to
dry completely.

[0098]    The following pharmacokinetic parameters for diclofenac sodium were
determined:
        Day 1: The maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax)

[0100]     After the initial dosing with the topical viscous solution, the mean diclofenac
plasma concentrations increased rapidly within 6 hours and continued to rise until 24
hours. Steady-state measurements (before the morning dose on Days 2 through 8) showed
that diclofenac concentrations remained elevated at approximately 20 ng/mL from 24 to
168 hours. Measurements immediately after final dosing at 168 hours showed diclofenac
concentrations increased by approximately 10 fold with a gradual decline to 10 ng/mL at
192 hours (24 hours after the last dose).
101011 Example 3: Clinical Pharmacokinetic Analysis of a Topical Viscous Solution of
2.0 % w/w Diclofenac Sodium- Multiple Dose
[0102]     A 2.0% w/w diclofenac sodium topical viscous solution of the present invention
was applied to both knees (2 mL [40.4 mg] per knee), topically, twice a day for 7.5
consecutive days. Total daily dose was approximately 162 mg. The topical viscous solution
was supplied in metered-dose pump polypropylene bottles containing 120 mL each.
Approximately 1 mL of the topical viscous solution was dispensed per pump. Subjects
dispensed the solution from the hand Pump A of Example 1 and applied the topical viscous
solution to clean dry skin. To avoid spillage, 2 mL (2 pumps) of the topical viscous
solution was dispensed first into the hand and then onto the knee. The topical viscous
solution was spread evenly around the front, back, and sides of knee. The procedure was
repeated on the other knee, allowing the application to dry completely. Treatment was
administered BID (6:00AM and 6:00PM). The following PK parameters for diclofenac
were determined for both treatments:
         Day 1: area under the plasma concentration curve for the first dosing interval 0
         to 12 h (AUCo-12) and adjusted to time 0 to 24 h (AUCo- 2 4 ), maximum observed
         plasma concentration     (Cmax), and time of observed maximum plasma
                                                 25

         concentration (Tmax); Day 8: AUC for the last dosing interval adjusted to time 0
         to 24 h (AUC-2 4 ss), Cmax at steady state (Cmax ss), Tmax at steady state (Tmax ss).
[0103]     The AUCo- 12 and AUCo-12 ss were calculated for the topical viscous solution, over
the dosing interval of 0 through 12 h on Day 1 and Day 8. So that a comparison between
the exposure of each treatment could be assessed on a daily basis, AUCO- 2 4 and AUCO- 2 4 ss
were calculated as AUCo-12 and AUCo-12      ss x  2 for the 2% w/w diclofenac sodium topical
viscous solution.
[0104]     After the initial dosing with the topical viscous solution, the mean diclofenac
plasma concentration increased rapidly within 6 h and remained elevated until reaching a
mean (SD) of 14.65 ng/mL (12.38) at 24 h. Steady-state measurements (before the morning
dose on Days 2 through 8) showed that mean diclofenac concentrations remained between
12 and 16 ng/mL from 24 to 168 h. On Day 8, the topical viscous solution had an AUCo-2 4
 ss of 322.57 ng-h/mL (52% coefficient of variation [CV]) and a Cmax ss of 19.99 ng/mL
(51% CV). On Day 8, the topical viscous solution had an AUCo-2 4 SS of 251.24 ng-h/mL
(61% CV) and a Cmax ss of 14.61 ng/mL (63% CV).
101051 High inter-individual variability is characteristic of topical formulations. The
arithmetic mean and SD for the PK parameters for diclofenac calculated for the topical
viscous solution are presented in the following Table 5.
