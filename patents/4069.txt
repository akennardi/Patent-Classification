   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
15 having a game controller having components that enable a
   player to win a jackpot prize even though the initially
   selected symbols don't satisfy a jackpot awarding
   condition. In the embodiment, first symbols are changed to
   jackpot symbols by the game controller when a symbol
20 change condition is met. In an embodiment, the symbol
   change condition is that the first symbols occupy all
   display positions of a column of display positions.
   General construction of gaming system
25
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a standalone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
30
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
35 game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
                                            8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
 5 operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
10 envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
15 mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
   on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
   Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
20 Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
25 the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
30 Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
35 enable a player to input game play instructions            (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
                                             8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 8
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
 5 display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
10 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
15 stored in memory   and generating outputs  (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
20 integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
   A gaming system in the form of a standalone gaming machine
   10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
25 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
30 game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
35 card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
                                             8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 9
   value of the ticker.  A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
 5 device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
10 stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module that is accessed in response
   to insertion of the player tracking device.
15 A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
20 beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
   liquid crystal display.  The display 14 may any other
25 suitable video display unit, such as an OLED display.                       The
   top box 26 may also include a display, which may be of the
   same type as the display 14, or of a different type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
30 a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
35 Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.   Typically, the
                                             8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 10
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
 5
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
10 machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
15 random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
20 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
25 coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
30 player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
35 that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
                                              8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 11
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
 5 The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
10 embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.

   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
20 execution by the processor 102 and related data.                The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
25 the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
30 input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 200 includes a
35 network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
                                             8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
 5 implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
1o network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
15 promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
20 game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
25 gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.      A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
30
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
35 the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
                                            8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

   Further detail of gaming system
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
   a wager which will be evaluated for conduct by the gaming
 5 system of this play of the game and initiates a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that
   a player's wager can be varied from game to game dependent
   on player selections. In most spinning reel games, it is
   typical for the player's wager to be made up of a
10 selection as to how the game outcome will be evaluated by
   specifying what parts of the game outcome will qualify for
   winning outcomes and a multiplier that will apply to each
   winning outcome. For example, a player's wager may be based
   on how many lines they play in each game - e.g. a minimum
15 of one line up to the maximum number of lines allowed by
   the game (noting that not all permutations of win lines
   may be available for selection) and an amount per line
   e.g. one, two or five credits. Winning outcomes on an
   activated win line may be evaluated based on a pay table
20 that specifies the amount awarded for a one credit per
   line wager multiplied by the amount wagered per line.
   Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
   symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
25 display positions being located relative to one another
   such that they form a line.
   In many games, the gaming machine may award winning
   outcomes which are not strictly limited to the lines they
30 have selected, for example, "scatter" pays are awarded
   independently of a player's selection of pay lines.
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may selecting a number of reels to
35 play. Games of this type are marketed under the trade name
   "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd and
   are also known as "ways" to win games. The selection of
                                            8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 15
   the reel means that each displayed symbol of the reel can
   be substituted for a symbol at one or more designated
   display positions. In other words, all symbols displayed
   at symbol display positions corresponding to a selected
 5 reel can be used to form symbol combinations with symbols
   displayed at a designated, symbol display positions of the
   other reels. For example,  if there are five reels and
   three symbol display positions for each reel such that the
   symbol display positions comprise three rows of five
10 symbol display positions, the symbols displayed in the
   centre row are used for non-selected reels. As a result,
   the total number of ways to win is determined by
   multiplying the number of active display positions of each
   reels, the active display positions being all display
15 positions of each selected reel and the designated display
   position of the non-selected reels. As a result for five
   reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
   win.
20 In the embodiment described below, the display positions
   of the symbol display are arranged in a rectangular matrix
   comprising a plurality of columns and a plurality of rows.
   However, other arrangements are known in the gaming
   industry and could be employed in embodiments of the
25 invention. For example, in some arrangements there are
   more symbols in some columns than others, such as 3-4-3-4
   3 arrangement of seventeen display positions corresponding
   to respective ones of five reels. In such arrangements,
   the columns of four symbols can be arranged so that they
30 are off-set or staggered relative to the columns having
   three symbols so that the middle two symbols in the
   columns of four symbols share boundaries with two symbols
   of each neighbouring reel.
35 In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
                                             8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 16
    art will appreciate that one or more of the modules could
    be implemented in some other way, for example by a
    dedicated circuit.
  5 These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
    operates in response to the player's operation of game
    play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
    the game and generates a game outcome which will then be
    evaluated by award evaluator 623. The first part of
10  forming the game outcome is for a symbol selector 622A to
    select symbols from a set of reel strips specified by reel
    strip data 641 using random number generator 621. The
    selected symbols are advised to the display controller 624
    which causes them to be displayed on display 54 at a set
15  of display positions.
    The reel strips 641 specify a sequence of symbols for each
    reel. One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
    selector 622A to select the symbols for display by
20  selecting a stopping position in the sequence. In one
    example, three symbols of each of five reels are displayed
    in three columns of symbol display positions such that
    symbols are displayed at fifteen display positions on
    display 54. In another example, four symbols of each reel
25  are selected. It is known to use a probability table
    stored in memory 64 to vary the odds of a particular stop
    position being selected. Other techniques can be used to
    control the odds of particular outcomes occurring to
    thereby control the return to player of the game.
30
    In an embodiment, each of the reel strips has a group or
    "stack" of jackpot symbols. At least one stack of jackpot
    symbols is long enough to occupy all the display positions
    of the column of symbol display positions associated with
35  the respective reel strip. In the example below, the stack
    of jackpot symbols are four symbols long and there are
                                             8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 17
   five columns of symbol display positions, each            having
   four symbol display positions. In the embodiments, at
   least one reel strip has a stack of first symbols that can
   change into jackpot symbols if a symbol change condition
 5 is met. In an embodiment, one or more of the reels may
   have more than one stack of jackpot symbols. In an
   embodiment, one or more of the reels may have more than
   one stack of first symbols. In an embodiment, at least one
   reel strip has both one or more stacks of jackpot symbols
10 and one or more stacks of first symbols. The first symbol
   may be any symbol chosen by the game designer.
   After the symbol selector 622A has selected the symbols,
   symbol modification controller 622B determines whether a
15 symbol modification should be made.
   The symbol modification controller 622B determines whether
   the selected symbols include at least one column where all
   of the symbol display positions are occupied by jackpot
20 symbols of a stack of jackpot symbols.   This is termed as
   determining whether a stack of jackpot symbols has
   "landed".  The symbol modification controller 622B also
   determines whether a stack of first symbols has landed in
   all the symbol display positions of another one of the
25 columns of display positions.   In an embodiment, if both
   these conditions are met, a symbol change condition is met
   and the symbol modification controller 622B causes the
   first symbols to change to jackpot symbols. The change of
   the first symbols to jackpot symbols is displayed on
30 display 54 under control of display controller 624.
   In an embodiment, the symbol change condition is that the
   change in the first symbols to jackpot symbols would
   satisfy a jackpot award condition.
35
   In an embodiment, there may be a plurality of jackpot
                                             8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 18
   awarding conditions corresponding to respective ones of a
   plurality of jackpot awards.   For example, there may be a
   mini, minor, major, and grand jackpot corresponding
   respectively to two, three, four, or five columns of
 5 symbol display positions being entirely occupied by
   jackpot symbols.
   In an alternate embodiment, a random determination is
   conducted by the game controller using the random number
10 generator 621 to determine whether the symbol change
   condition is met.  Thus, in this embodiment, a probability
   is assigned to whether the symbols will change.              Depending
   on the embodiment, this condition may be additional or an
   alternative to the symbol modification condition outlined
15 above.
   As shown in Figure 6, the game controller 62 also
   implements an outcome evaluator 623 which evaluates
   selected symbols based on pay table 642.     As indicated in
20 Figure 6, the outcome evaluator 623 includes a jackpot
   awarder 623A which awards the relevant jackpot of jackpot
   642A if a jackpot awarding condition is met.          In this
   example, that two or more columns of symbol display
   positions are entirely occupied by jackpot symbols.                    In
25 another embodiment, it may be required that there are
   three or more columns occupied by jackpot symbols                (after
   any modification of first symbols) for the jackpot awarder
   623 to make an award of one of the jackpots 642A.                 Where
   the jackpots are awarded in the form of credits, the
30 jackpot awarder 623A awards the jackpot by updating a
   meter 643 stored in the memory 64 of the gaming controller
   60.  In an example, the award of the jackpot is added to a
   win meter.  In another example, the award of the jackpot
   may be added directly to a credit meter.
35
   Depending on the embodiment, the first symbols may change
   to jackpot symbols in a base game, a feature game or both.
                                             8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 19
   The base game is a part of the game which is carried out
   by the gaming system each time the player makes a wager,
   typically irrespective of the wager, whereas a feature
   game will only be carried out occasionally for example if
 5 a condition is met such as a trigger occurring.
   In some embodiments, an eligibility criterion may be
   applied by the gaming system in order for the player to be
   eligible for the groups of first symbols to change. For
10 example that the player has made a certain sized wager,
   made an ante bet, selected all win lines, played
   sufficient games, or the player is a member of a loyalty
   program.
15 Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a method 700 of an
   embodiment.  In an embodiment, the method 700 involves the
   gaming system receiving 705 a wager.  In response to
   receipt of the wager, the game controller 60 deducts the
   wager from the credit meter, and selects symbols 710 using
20 a process as described above.
   In an embodiment, the game controller 60 first determines
   715 whether the selected symbols include jackpot symbols
   that fill a defined number of columns, maybe one or more
25 columns.  If the jackpot symbols do not fill the defined
   number of columns, the process continues by completing the
   balance of the game 745, such as by evaluating the
   selected symbols relative to pay table in a conventional
   manner.  The game then ends 750. If, on the other hand,
30 jackpot symbols fill a defined number of columns, the game
   controller determines 720 whether first symbols fill at
   least one column, if not, the game controller proceeds to
   complete the balance of the game 745.  If the first
   symbols fill at least one column, the game controller
35 determines whether a symbol change condition is met 725.
   While this is shown as a separate step in Figure 7, in
                                            8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 20
   some embodiments, the symbol change condition being met
   725 can be satisfied by both the jackpot symbols filling a
   defined number of columns and the first symbols filling at
   least one column as determined at step 715 and 720.
 5 Assuming the symbol change condition is met, the symbol
   modification controller 622B changes 730 the first symbols
   to jackpot symbols.  The game controller then determines
   735 whether the jackpot condition is met and if it is, a
   jackpot is awarded 740 and the balance of the game 745 is
10 completed before the game ends 750.  Again, in one
   embodiment, there may not need to be a need to separately
   determine whether a jackpot condition as, in an embodiment
   the symbol change condition may only be met if changing
   the symbols would result in award of a jackpot. Put
15 another way, in this embodiment, the change condition
   being met results in the award of a jackpot.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
20 that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
25 out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
30 such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
   Example
35
   In this example, the gaming system is configured so that
   jackpots are triggered by landing stacks of Jacpot                ("JP")
                                            8155435_1 (GHMatters) P100579.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 21
   symbols. A stack is "landed" when all symbols of a column
   are occupied by symbols of a stack. In some examples, one
   or more stacks may be longer than the number of display
   positions in the column.
 5
   A "Mini" jackpot is awarded with any 2 stacks of JP.
   A "Minor" jackpot is awarded with any 3 stacks of JP.
   A "Major" jackpot is awarded with any 4 stacks of JP.
   A "Grand" jackpot is awarded with 5 stacks of JP.
10
   In an example, the initial outcome of the reel spin is
   shown in Table 1. This initial outcome would result in no
   jackpot being awarded. However, the outcome includes a
   first symbol, Pl.

    Pl   JP A    Pl  A
    A    JP  K   Pl  P2
    K    JP  P2  Pl  J
    J    JP  Q   Pl  K
   Table 1
   In example, there is a symbol change condition, that if
20 one or more stacks of the "Pl" symbol lands, then one or
   more of those stacks may change to JP after the reels
   stop.
   With the above reels of Table 1, all the P1 on reel 4
25 would change to JP and result in a Mini jackpot being won
   as shown in Table 2 below.

   In another example, the P1 symbols are only changed to JP
   symbols if a jackpot would not otherwise be awarded.

   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
10  (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
15 appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
20 departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.
