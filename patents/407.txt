   title of invention
    mobivisoR
   The mobivisoR was invented to provide a sun shield for mobile phone being
   used in a vehicle attached to a holder on the car dashboard for navigational
 5 purposes e.g. while using the GPS.
   It is made of polypropylene and is designed to fit in between the phone and
   the holder. The design, which covers the top and sides of the phone, allows the
   driver to have a better and clear view of the maps on the phone screen as the
   shade created by the mobivisoR reduces the amount of sun light that causes
.0 glare. This is also a safety feature ensuring the driver is not distracted by the
   phone screen for too long whilst driving. It can be used with any type of holder
   and fits all phone sizes. Drawings and pictures in accompanying attachments.
