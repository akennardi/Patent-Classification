                           AT SITE INUNDATION VISUALISATION
Technical Field
[0001] The present invention relates to the at site visualisation of water for floods,
storms surges, tides and other increases in water levels.
Background of the Invention
[0002] Increases in water flow and levels, such as are experienced in floods, have
profound effects upon structures, people and the environment. Hydrologic and
hydraulic modelling are established fields allowing engineers to calculate and simulate
flow utilising computers and algorithms. More particularly, specific flood and coastal
hydraulic computer models allow users to simulate a range of flood and coastal
scenarios including past events, probabilistic design events, land use changes, sea
level rise, pre and post mitigation options, and so forth etc. To apply this water surface
information gained from hydraulic models to actual structures in the real world requires
positional information of both the structure and hydraulic modelling outputs relative to
terrain datum of the model, to be determined. The water surface information such as
flood levels can be then measured at the location, for example using surveying
equipment, from that datum or ground level.
[0003] Whilst this allows for water surface information such as levels to be determined
at a location, it is not easy to gather all the information and understand exactly where
the inundation levels may lie, for example under different flooding conditions or for
compliance purposes, and more so it is difficult to visualise the modelled water heights,
movement and hazards this presents at the location, particularly by non-experts.
[0004] It is an object of the present invention to provide readily understandable
visualisation of water surface information, for example inundation levels, velocity,
hazard and other flood related controls and implications.
Summary of the Invention
[0005] In a first broad form, the present invention provides a system in which a mixed
reality representation of the water level is viewable by a user. Thus, the user can simply
walk around and see a virtual indication of the static or dynamic water surfaces under
the selected conditions at the physical site they are located.
[0006] According to one aspect, the present invention provides a system for facilitating
the visualisation of inundation water surfaces, including a mixed reality visualisation
device, a positioning device, wherein the positioning device determines the XYZ

location of the visualisation device, the visualisation device receives 3D water surface
information corresponding to an inundation event, and the visualisation device displays
a representation of the static or dynamic water surface superimposed at the real
environment in which located
[0007] According to another aspect, the present invention provides a method for
providing visualisation of inundation water surfaces, using a mixed reality visualisation
device, including at least the steps of using a positioning device to determine the XYZ
location of the visualisation device; applying the location to a set of 3D water surface
information corresponding to an inundation event at that location; and displaying a
representation of the static or dynamic water surface superimposed at the real
environment in which located.
[0008] Using suitable implementations of the present invention, readily
understandable visualisation of water surface information such as inundation levels,
velocity, hazard and other flood/coastal related controls and implications such as
visualising minimum flood floor levels, flood standard/ code compliance, may be carried
out on site.
[0009] The inundation event may be visualised in a very clear way by a non-expert, in
a way that is not possible from maps and similar [presentations of modelled data.

Detailed Description of the invention
[0021] The present invention will be described with reference to a specific
implementation, using components including commercially available mixed reality (MR)
hardware and software. It will be appreciated that the components described are only
one possible implementation, and that they are illustrative and not limitative of the scope
of the present invention. It is foreseen that alternative and yet to be developed MR and
related technology will be used to embody the present invention in other
implementations.
[0022] The term inundation is intended to be used in the broadest sense, of a rise in
water levels from some pre-existing state. This may be, for example, a flood from
rising rivers or other bodies of water; overflowing water from a dam or channel; tidal
inundation; sea level rise from climate change or other causes; storm surges; tsunami;
or intentional changes, for example filling of a catchment or irrigation system. Much of
the following discussion relates to an example for a conventional, rainfall triggered
flooding event. However, the principles of the present invention may be applied to any
form of inundation.
[0023] The inundation event modelled and visualised may be based on current,
historical or future circumstances.
[0024] Mixed reality technologies are an emerging technological field. They currently
include head mounted displays; and in future, may encompass implanted electrodes or
similar that allows user to see and engage with physical and digital objects concurrently
in real time.

                                              4
[0025] The implementation below will be described with reference to a mixed reality
device, such as the Microsoft HoloLens TM development edition 2016 developed by the
Microsoft Group however could apply to developing MR technology such as Magic Leap
TM and yet to be developed technology e.g. implanted electrodes.
[0026] In general terms, the examples discussed below facilitates the combination and
processing of location, hydraulic model outputs and other water surface and terrain
information, to allow a user to see and interact with in real time 3D static and dynamic
digital water surfaces in the physical environment they are located.
[0027] Hydraulic modelling outputs, geographic information system based models or
similar derived water surfaces are taken as a starting point for implementation of the
present invention.
[0028] Referring to figure 1, a user 1 wears a device 2 in this implementation. The
user is located on the ground 9, with structures 5 and hills and other terrain 6
surrounding. The user sees, in addition to the surroundings, a display of a dynamic or
static water surface information 4. This is visible in situ, and is updated in real time.
Hence, as the user looks around, and walks to different locations, a virtual water surface
4 is superimposed on the actual terrain 6 and structures 5. This function is also
operable inside buildings.
[0029] XYZ spatial location is determined using satellite positioning, for example GPS,
or any suitable enhanced satellite or alternative location determining system, e.g.
GBAS. The receiver for spatial information could be, for example, a mobile phone, a
positioning system within device 2, or GNSS RTK surveying equipment or similar that
allows trilateration.
[0030] Based on the relative or absolute XYZ position determined, the system retrieves
from a spatial database the desired water surface information for that location. This
water surface information could for example include static and dynamic hydraulic model
outputs e.g. depth, velocity, hazard in a range of formats e.g. h.dat, v.dat, .dt2, .ct2,
ASCII etc.; for all design events i.e. 50%, 10%, 1%, 2% annual exceedance probability,
climate change and mitigation scenarios etc. Historic flood events, 3D animations or
other water surface information captured and/or produced.
[0031] For example, hydraulic model analysis for calibration, design events, mitigation
design and failure events etc. are typically conducted within specialised flood and
coastal hydraulic models such as BMT WBMs TUFLOW Suite, US Army Corps
Engineers HEC RAS, DHIs Mike Suite and GIS equivalent models such as the US
Federal Emergency Management Agencys HAZUS or Worley Parson Groups

                                                  5
WaterRIDE , It will be understood by those skilled in the art that these are examples,
and any suitable model could be used to generate the requirement data.
[0032] Hydraulic analysis can be undertaken for past, present and future conditions
providing insight into water behaviour in consideration of changes such as landform
modification, increased rainfall intensity and ocean levels because of sea level rise etc.
This analysis produces a range of outputs such as water depth and velocity, and assists
in the production of further water surface information such as flood function, hazard,
base flood elevations/ minimum floor levels for land use planning and control, road
closures and critical evacuation for emergency management, and many other
applications. . Jurisdictional standards and practice exist for hydraulic analysis, for
example in Australia the design flood estimation process is contained in Australian
Rainfall and Runoff or in the UK the Flood Estimation Handbook and its updates. It will
be understood that the present invention may be applied to many different scenarios,
and that it is intended to extend to all such uses.
[0033] The water surface information may be retrieved from the cloud in real time or
can be stored in the mixed reality technology platform, for example loaded in advance
for a particular location and scenario. This static or dynamic water surface information
is then directly displayed to the user if it is in the correct required digital format, which
for this implementation is FBX. Alternatively, it may be processed and converted (using
publically available tools) to the correct required digital format; or rendered in pre
processing or real-time (using publically available tools) to create a more 'realistic' water
surface at which the user can see through the mixed reality technology, as shown in
surface 4, in figure 1 and later illustrations.
[0034] The user or an external operator can select the 3D water surface that the user
is seeing and interacting with by programmed voice activation commands; programmed
mobile/smartphone/tablet or computer application or other means such as gestures, for
example when utilising Microsoft Hololens, https://www.microsoft.com/en
au/store/d/microsoft-hololens-development-edition/8XF18PQZ17TS. The disclosure
therein is hereby incorporated by reference, and provides reference materials relevant
to the requirements and specifications of the device.
[0035] For example, this may be to see and interact with different flood and coastal
exceedance probability design events, different pre and post mitigation scenarios,
changes in landuse scenarios, water level land use planning development control levels
such as minimum flood levels associated with the base flood elevation/ flood planning
level etc..
[0036] The present invention may be used to facilitate 3D digital water surface mixed
reality visualisations for many different purposes at site. These could include for

                                               6
example: in floodplain management, a user walking around a building and seeing
moving digital floodwater at the simulated 1% theoretical annual exceedence probability
design event. Figure 3 illustrates a user 13 standing on a street, with surrounding
structures 15. For this to occur the system and method detailed above and contained in
figure 2 is required i.e. the XYZ location is determined, and then a water surface
visualisation is generated, as shown in figure 4. The user can see exactly where and
how high the water level is on the structures 15, as a result of surface 4.
[0037] Figure 5 illustrates a flood model output map, with the location of user 13
indicated by an arrow. It will be apparent that this does not replicate the experience and
level of understanding generated by the use of an implementation of the present
invention by a user, who need not be an expert, at the physical site where they are
located.
[0038] Figure 6 is a model of the same terrain as figure 5, but with dynamic flows
having been determined. Figure 7 illustrates that the mixed reality representation may
include visual indications of flow, for example with directional arrows, whose length may
correspond to estimated speeds.
[0039] Figure 8 illustrates a map of the same terrain as figure 5, for which risk to life
and property hazard in the water surface have been identified. Figure 9 illustrates a
mixed reality visualisation superimposition of figure 8 in which the different areas of
hazard are identified by different colours, with the more hazardous areas 19 a different
colour to less hazardous areas 20.
[0040] Figure 10 is a similar view to figure 4, but illustrates how the present invention
allows for a user to visualise water surfaces in situ, for example at their home 21, for
different events. It will be appreciated that this is qualitatively different than simply
looking at a map, tablet, computer, Virtual reality device generated by a model due to
the superimposition and immersion at site.
[0041] Other potential uses include in coastal management, for example a user
standing on a beach seeing digital waves breaking at asimulated 1 in a 100 year design
storm events; in tsunami emergency preparedness, a user standing on top of a building
and seeing simulated digital water level and damages for 11 m high waves; in a future
climate scenario representation, a user standing in coastal street seeing digital water
discharging from the drainage system and inundating assets simulating a 1m increase
in future sea level.
[0042] Figure 2 illustrates in overview the processing of data required to facilitate an
implementation of the present invention. First, it is essential to obtain XYZ location

                                              7
information, from a satellite or other system as detailed above. This may require
adjustment to the surface that the user is standing on, as the device and/or receiver
may be located at a different height, for example in the pocket or elsewhere on the
person using the device.
[0043] The device must also be able to access the 3D water surface information for
that location. This in one form is predetermined and stored in the device. This may in
fact be several different scenarios, which are separately selectable, or even a time
series for an event, for example in compressed time. In another form, this is accessed
via a remote network, for example a wireless network such as a satellite or cellular data
network. Preferably the data is received in a form compatible with device 2; in other
implementations, a conversion may need to be carried out to the appropriate format.
[0044] The device (or another processor) then generates, renders and displays the
digital water surface as a mixed reality overlay, in real time. Thus, the location
information and water surface information will need to be dynamically modified as the
user walks around, looks in different directions, or selects a different inundation
scenario.
[0045] It will be apparent that the visualisation device uses orientation information as
well as the positional information to display the water surface information, so that for
example the direction and angle of view of the user are relevant to the water surface
location information to be generated as the user moves around and looks around.
