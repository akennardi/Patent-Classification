                                     ABSTRACT
The invention belongs to the public safety field and provides a reminder method
regarding elevator technical information and an elevator. The method includes
recording the match relationship between the elevator leading to the underground
garage and the specific calling terminal; when the elevator receives the calling
signal, it will decide whether the calling signal comes from the specific calling
terminal; when the calling signal comes from the specific calling terminal, only the
elevator leading to the underground garage will be activated and the patent
information will be sent to the user; when the calling signal does not come from
the specific calling terminal, the nearest elevator closed to the calling terminal will
be activated. The invention enhances the efficiency of the operation of elevator
by activating different elevators according to the calling signal received from
different calling terminals and protects the patent holder's rights.

   TECHNICAL FIELD
 5         The invention belongs to the public safety field and provides a reminder
   method regarding elevator technical information and an elevator.
   BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY
            Intellectual Property Rights is more and more important nowadays, among
10 which includes copyrights, trademarks and patents, which can bring huge
   economic value to right holders.
           However, different from copyrights and trademarks, the ownership of the
   patent is relatively difficult for users to recognize and distinguish. For example, in
   a training materials or a movie, the wordings "copyrights belong to XXX" will be
15 specifically marked and the users can therefore clearly recognize and distinguish
   the right holders; Trademarks, also distinguished by their distinctive characters or
   figures, are distinguished from the other trademarks and represent trademark
   owners and the relevant products made/licensed by the trademark owners.
   Whereas patents are different, except for few patents such as "patent of sliding to
20 unlock ", the users are very difficult to recognize the patent holders when they use
   the patent.
           This will result in serious consequences which are set out as follows:
            1. It will be difficult for patent protection, when a good technology comes
   out, it will be copied immediately; and
25         2. The efficiency that patent owners/applicants highlight the characteristics
   of their products will be not good since the users cannot distinguish the
   relationship between the technology and patent owners.
            In summary, in order to protect my another patent application and
   maximize my another patent's value, a solution is hereby proposed.

   this invention;
           FIG.2 is the structure diagram of the elevator provided in the embodiment.
10 EMBODIMENTS
           In order to illustrate the purpose, technical scheme and advantages of the
   invention clearly, the invention is further described in details in combination with
   the drawings and embodiments. It should be understood that the specific
   embodiment described here is used for explaining the invention only instead of
15 limiting the invention.
           FIG.1 is a process diagram of the method for calling an elevator provided
   in the embodiment.         For explaining conveniently, the part related to the
   embodiment of the invention is shown only.
           In step S100, recording the matching relationship between the elevator
20 leading to the underground garage and the specific calling terminal.
           This step can be distinguished by pre-setting the signal band of a particular
   calling terminal, for example, setting the calling signal of the elevator to Signal A
   and Signal B, among which Signal A will correspond to normal calling method
   while Signal B will correspond to specific calling terminals.
25         In step S101, when elevator receives the calling signals, it will detect
   whether the signal is from the specific calling terminal.
           As shown in the last step, different calling terminals could be distinguished
   according to the type of calling signals.
           In step S102, when the calling signal is from the specific calling terminals,
30 only the elevator going to the underground will be activated; when the calling
   signal is not from specific calling device, the closest elevator nearby the floor
   which the calling device is located will be activated.

                                              5
           Specifically, the mentioned specific calling device has been set in the car
   keys and has recorded the specific floor, which can send messages to the calling
   terminals by putting the button on the keys. Simultaneously, the specific calling
   device could also be different buttons in the calling panel of the elevator.
