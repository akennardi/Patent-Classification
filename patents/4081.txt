                           "A TURBINE BLADE ASSEMBLY"
                              FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5                This invention relates to a turbine blade assembly.             In
   particular, the invention relates to a turbine blade assembly driven by the
   wind. However, it should be appreciated that the turbine blade assembly
   may be driven by other fluids such as water.
                         BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
10                Wind driven turbines have been used for many years.
   Technology has advanced considerably from the old-fashioned windmill to
   today's complex large wind farm turbines found throughout the world.
   Though technology continues to advance, the same problems with wind
   turbines blade assemblies continue to exist. A barrier to the increase in
15 efficiencies is the energy lost from the turbine through shedding of tip
   vortices, a form of turbulence. A result of this increased turbulence is often
   an increase in noise. As many wind turbines are located adjacent residential
   communities, any increase in noise is undesirable.
                  An advanced turbine blade assembly has a small hub in which
20 blades extend outwardly and forwardly. The blades terminate in an outer
   ring cowl. In use, the hub is connected to a power generator with rotation of
   the turbine blade assembly generating electricity.
                  It has been found that locating a ring cowl on the end of the
   blades of a turbine blade assembly reduces noise. This is due to the ends of
25 the individual blades being prevented from shedding tip vortices and
   creating turbulence in the air flow. However, the cowl itself can create
   additional turbulence and drag which is unwanted.
                            OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
                  It is an object of the invention to overcome and/or alleviate one
30 or more of the above disadvantages and/or provide the consumer with a

         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
                  FIG. 1 shows a schematic view of wind turbine 1 mounted on
   top of a platform 5.    The wind turbine 1 includes a wind turbine blade
   assembly 10 which is attached to a power generator (not shown) located
15 within a wind turbine housing 2. Details of the power generator and wind
   turbine housing 2 have not been discussed as this is common knowledge to
   a person skilled in the art.
                  FIGS. 2A to 2C show a perspective view of a wind turbine
   blade assembly 10 shown in FIG. 1. The wind turbine blade assembly 10
20 includes a hub 20, a series of hub blades 30, a series of cowl blades 40, a
   first cowl 50 and a second cowl 60.
                  The hub 20 is used to attach the wind turbine blade assembly
   10 to a power generator. The hub 20 is formed from a boss 21 and a flange
   22 as shown in FIG. 3.       The flange 22 is attached to the boss 21 and
25 extends outwardly from the boss 21.      The boss 21 has an end wall 21A
   whilst the flange has a side wall 22A. The end wall 21A and the side wall
   22A are substantially perpendicular with respect to each other. The end wall
   21A and the side wall 22A are of similar width.
                  A generator attachment hole 23 is located through the boss 21
30 for attachment of the wind turbine blade assembly 10 to the power generator.

                                          6
   There are also a series of weight reducing holes 24 located through the boss
   21 in order to reduce the weight of the hub 20.
                 Each of the hub blades 30 are arcuate in shape and are able to
   be driven by the wind. The hub blades 30 extend outwardly from the hub
 5 and are attached to the hub 20.          The hub blades 30 are angled at
   approximately 45 degrees with respect to the hub 20. However, it should be
   appreciated that other angles may be used. The series of hub blades 30
   terminate at and are joined to the first cowl 50.
                 FIG. 3 shows further details of how a hub blade 30 is attached
10 to the hub 20. A blade attachment member 31 and a hub attachment plate
   25 are used for this purpose. The blade attachment member 31 is in the
   form of a tubular pipe which is located within a blade attachment hole 32
   located with the hub blade 30. The blade attachment member 31 is welded
   to the hub blade 30.
15               The hub attachment plate 25 is attached to the hub blade 30,
   the blade attachment member 31 and the hub 20. The hub attachment plate
   25 is welded to the hub blade 30 adjacent a central, longitudinal axis of the
   hub blade 30. The hub attachment plate 25 is also attached to the blade
   attachment member 31. A hub attachment plate hole 26 is located through
20 the hub attachment plate 25 for this purpose. The blade attachment member
   31 is located through the hub attachment plate hole 26 and welded to the
   hub attachment plate 25.
                 The hub attachment plate 25 is connected to the hub 20 via the
   end wall 21A of the boss 21 and the side wall 22A of the flange 22. That is,
25 edges of the hub attachment plate 25 extend and are welded to the end wall
   21A of the boss 21 and the side wall 22A of the flange 22.          The hub
   attachment plate 25 forms an angle of substantially 45 degrees with respect
   to the end wall 21A of the boss 22. The hub attachment plate 25 also forms
   an angle of substantially 45 degrees with respect to the side wall 22A of the
30 flange 22.

                  Similar to the hub blades 30, the cowl blades 40 are arcuate in
   shape and are able to be driven by the wind. The cowl blades 40 extend
   between and are joined to both the first cowl 50 and the second cowl 60 as
   shown in FIG. 4. The cowl blades 40 are the substantially the same length
 5 and orientation as the hub blades 30.         Further, the cowl blades 40 are
   substantially in alignment with the hub blades 30.
                  Both the first cowl 50 and the second cowl 60 are in the form of
   a frusto conical continuous ring of metal with the first cowl 50 being smaller
   than the second cowl 60. First cowl 50 and the second cowl 60 are an angle
10 of approximately 12 degrees with respect to a central axis of rotation of the
   hub 20 as shown in FIG. 5.
                  In use, it is believed that a cowl with an angle of 12 degrees
   will be aligned parallel to the local wind streamlines, so that its interference
   in the wind flow field is minimised.        It is believed that this minimises
15 turbulence, drag, and noise.
                  It should be appreciated that various other changes and
   modifications may be made to the embodiment described without departing
   from the spirit or scope of the invention.
