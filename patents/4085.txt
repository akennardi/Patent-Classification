                METHOD FOR EXPANDING THE DIAMETER OF A METAL CONTAINER
                           CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]             The present     application is divided from Australian       patent application  No.
<removed-apn>, the content of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.
                                              BACKGROUND
[0002]              In  the container   industry, substantially identically shaped     metal  beverage
containers are produced massively and relatively economically. In order to expand a diameter of a
container to create a shaped container or enlarge the diameter of the entire container, often several
operations are required using several different expansion dies to expand each metal container a
desired amount.
                                                SUMMARY
[0003]             A method of forming a metal container comprises: curling outward a top edge of
the metal container to form a curl and expanding a diameter of a first section of the metal container
to form a first expanded section; wherein at least part of the first expanded section is below the curl.
[0004]             A method of forming a metal container comprising providing a one-piece metal
container with a top edge defining an opening and a closed bottom curling outward the top edge of
the metal container to form a curl after curling, inserting an expansion die into the opening of the
metal container, thereby expanding an original diameter of a first section and thereafter expanding
the expansion die thereby forming a first expanded section of the metal container onto the metal
container and wherein the original diameter of the metal container is expanded by at least 5 % in a
single stroke of a single expansion die without prior narrowing of the metal container wherein at
least part of the first expanded section is below the curl.
[0005]             The metal container may be any type of metal container including beverage cans,
bottles and cups, aerosol cans and food containers. The metal comprising the metal container may
be any metal known in the art including aluminum, aluminum alloys and steel. The metal container
can be made by any process known in the art including but not limited to: drawing and ironing;
impact extrusion; spin forming; draw and redraw; and deep drawing.
[0006]              In order to expand more efficiently, in some embodiments, contact between the
expansion die and the top edge of the metal container is avoided in at least some of the expansion
operations. One way to do this is to curl outward the top edge of the metal container prior to at least
some of the expansion operations.
[0007]             Curling is a bending operation that bends the edge of the metal container. Curling
includes forming operations that create a curved rim on top of the metal container. For the purposes
of this patent application, curling also includes flanging and flaring the edge of the metal container.
Curling may add stiffness to the metal container. In some embodiments flanging creates a 900 bend
in the metal container.
[0008]              For the purposes of this patent application, a curl is a bend along the edge of the

metal container.
[0009]            In some embodiments, the steps of curling outward a top edge of the metal
container to form a curl and expanding a first section of the metal container to form a first expanded
section are performed simultaneously.
[0010]            In some embodiments, the steps of curling outward a top edge of the metal
container to form a curl and expanding a diameter of a first section of the metal container to form a
first expanded section are performed in a single stroke of a single die.
[00011]           In some embodiments, the step of expanding a diameter of a first section of the
metal container to form an expanded section is performed after the step of curling outward a top
edge of the metal container to form a curl.
[00012]           Some embodiments further comprise expanding a diameter of a second section of
the metal container to form a second expanded section after the first expanding step.
[00013]           Some embodiments, further comprise a step of expanding a diameter of a third
section of the metal container to form a third expanded section before the step of curling outward a
top edge of the metal container to form a curl.
[00014]           In some embodiments, expanding the first section of the metal container is
accomplished using an expansion die. An expansion die is a die that when inserted into an opening
of a container increases the diameter of the container via mechanical force. In some embodiments,
the step of expanding a first section of the metal container to form an expanded section comprises
inserting the expansion die into an open end of the metal container.
[00015]           In some embodiments, the diameter of the first section of the metal container is
expanded by at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% by a single land in a
single stroke of a single expansion die.
[00016]           In some embodiments, an original diameter of a metal container is expanded by at
least a 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% by a single land in a single stroke
of a single expansion die without first narrowing the metal container.
[00017]           In some embodiments, the top edge of the metal container is curled by one of: a
rotary curler and a die.
[00018]           Some embodiments further comprise removing the curl from the top edge of the
metal container. In some embodiments, the curl is removed from the top edge of the metal
container by trimming the top edge of the metal container.

                                              DESCRIPTION
[00036]           For the purposes of this specification, terms such as top, bottom, below, above,
under, over, etc. are relative to the position of a finished metal container resting on its base on a flat
surface, regardless of the orientation of the metal container during manufacturing or forming steps
or processes. A finished metal container is a metal container that will not undergo additional
forming steps before it is used by an end consumer. In some embodiments, the top of the container
has an opening.
[00037]           Referring to Figures 1-4, in one embodiment, a method of forming a metal
container 100 comprises: curling outward a top edge 102 of the metal container 100 to form a curl
104; expanding a first section 106 of the metal container 100 to form an expanded section 108;
wherein at least part of the expanded section 108 is below the curl 104; wherein the curling and

expanding are accomplished in a single stroke of a single die.
[00038]            Figure 1 shows a cross-section of a metal container 100 before having undergone
the step of curling outward a top edge 102 of the metal container 100 to form a curl 104. The
original diameter 114 is the diameter of the metal container 100 after it has been formed via
drawing and ironing or extrusion but before it has been shaped, i.e. what is commonly known in the
art as a pre-form metal container. In some embodiments, there is no need to pre-stress the metal
container 100 by narrowing or other means before it is expanded.
[00039]            Figure 1 also shows a cross-section of a first working surface 118 of a first
expansion die 116 before contacting the metal container 100. The first working surface 118 has a
first land 124. A land is the portion of the working surface of an expansion die having the largest
outer diameter that contacts a section of a container. It is possible for a die to have multiple working
surfaces, each having a different land, each land having a different outer diameter, wherein the land
having the smallest outer diameter travels further into the container than the land(s) having a larger
outer diameter. The first expansion die 116 of Figure 1 is dimensioned to expand the diameter of
the metal container 100 and also to form of curl 104 on the top edge 102 of the container 100.
[00040]            Figure 2 shows the cross-section of the metal container 100 as the top edge 102 is
being curled and the first section of the metal container 100 is being expanded to form a first
expanded section 108. The first expansion die 116 is shown at the bottom of its stroke inside the
metal container 100.
[00041]            Figure 3 shows a second expansion die 120. The second expansion die 120 has a
second working surface 122 and a second land 126.
[00042]            Figure 4 shows the cross-section of the metal container 100 as a second section
110 (shown in Figure 2) of the metal container 100 is being expanded to form a second expanded
section 112. The second expansion die 120 is shown at the bottom of its stroke inside the metal
container 100. In some embodiments, the stroke of the second expansion die 120 extends to the
bottom of the metal container 100 or proximate to the bottom of the metal container 100.
[00043]            Referring to Figures 5-10, in another embodiment, a method of forming a metal
container 200 comprises: curling outward a top edge 202 of the metal container 200 to form a curl
204; expanding a first section 206 of the metal container 200 to form a first expanded section 208
after curling the top edge 202 of the metal container 200; wherein at least part of the first expanded
section 208 is below the curl 204 and expanding a second section 210 of the metal container to
form a second expanded section 212; wherein at least part of the second expanded section 212 is
below the curl 204.
[00044]            Figure 5 shows a cross-section of a metal container 200 before having undergone the
step of curling outward a top edge 202 of the metal container 200 to form a curl 204. Figure 5 also
shows a cross-section of a curling die 228 before it enters the metal container 200. The curling die 228
is dimensioned to form the curl 204 on the top edge 202 of the container 200 as is well-known in the
art.
[00045]            Figure 6 shows the cross-section of the metal container 200 as the top edge 202 is

being curled by the curling die 228. The curling die 228 is shown at the bottom of its stroke inside
the metal container 200.
[00046]           Figure 7 shows a first expansion die 216 before it enters the metal container
200. The first expansion die 216 has a first working surface 218a and a first land 224a and a
second working surface 218b and a second land 224b each dimensioned to expand the diameter of
the metal container 200.
[00047]           Figure 8 shows the cross-section of the metal container 200 as a first section 206,
shown in Figure 6, of the metal container is being expanded to form a first expanded section 208.
The first expansion die 216 is shown at the bottom of its stroke inside the metal container 200.
[00048]           Figure 9 shows a second expansion die 220 before it enters the metal container
200. The second expansion die 220 has a third working surface 222 and a third land 226
dimensioned to expand the diameter of the metal container 200.
[00049]           Figure 10 shows the cross-section of the metal container 200 as a second section 210,
shown in Figure 9, of the metal container 200 is being expanded to form a third expanded section 212.
The second expansion die 220 is shown at the bottom of its stroke inside the metal container 200.
[00050]           In another embodiment of the invention, a metal container is expanded before a
curl is formed, then expanded again after the curl has been formed. In yet another embodiment of
the invention, a metal container is expanded after a curl has been formed. Then the curl is removed
from the top of the container by trimming of the top edge of the container. The metal container may
be necked after the curl is removed. Necking can be done by any means know in the arts such as
described in US. Patent Nos. 4,512,172; 4,563,887; 4,774,839; 5,355,710 and 7,726,165. In yet a
further embodiment of the invention, a metal container is necked before a curl is formed and
expanded after the curl has been formed.
[00051]           In all of the embodiments above, the metal comprising the metal container may be
any metal known in the art including, but not limited to, aluminum and steel. The metal container
may or may not have a dome in the bottom or base of the metal container. In some embodiments,
the metal container is a one-piece metal container having a closed bottom. In some embodiments,
the metal container is comprised of multiple pieces of metal seamed together. In some
embodiments, a sidewall of the metal container has a uniform thickness from top to near the bottom
of the container. In some embodiments, a sidewall of the metal container has a non-uniform
thickness. In some embodiments, a sidewall of the metal container is tapered so that the thickness
of the sidewall is thinner at the top of the container than the bottom of the container. In some
embodiments, the thickness of a sidewall of the metal container varies along the height of the
sidewall. In some embodiments, the sidewall is thicker at the top of the container than at a lower
sidewall portion of the container.
[00052]           Curling outward the top edge of the metal container to form a curl may be
accomplished by any means known in the art such as die curling and rotary curling. As shown in
Figures 1 and 2 the step of curling outward a top edge of the metal container may be accomplished
by inserting a curling die into the metal container at least until the top edge of the container curls

outwardly.
[00053]           In some embodiments, the presence of a curl prevents the formation of luder lines
during subsequent expansion steps allowing for increased expansion in a single expansion step
without damage to the metal container. In some embodiments, the presence of a curl also reduces
axial shortening of the metal container during expansion.
The radius of curvature of the curl and the angle of sweep of the curl affect the degree of expansion
possible without damaging the metal container in the subsequent expansion step(s). In some
embodiments, generally, the greater the radius of curvature of the curl, the greater degree of
expansion possible in the subsequent expansion step without damaging the metal container. In
some embodiments the angle of sweep of the curl is at least 90 degrees. In some embodiments the
angle of sweep of the curl is at least 180 degrees. In some embodiments the angle of sweep of the
curl is at least 270 degrees. Increasing the radius and/or arc length of the curl generally allows
increased expansion in a single expansion step without damaging the metal container. In some
embodiments, curls having an angle of sweep less than 90 degrees straighten to some extent
during subsequent expansion, so that the angle of sweep is less after expansion. In some
embodiments, curls having an angle of sweep greater than 180 degrees tighten during subsequent
expansion.
[00054]           Expanding the metal container can be done by any means known in the art,
including, but not limited to inserting the working surface of an expansion die into an open end of
the metal container. Expanding using an expansion die can be performed any way known in the art,
including as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 7,934,410 and 7,954,354. As shown in Figures 1 and 2 a
single die can be used to both curl outward the top edge of the container and expand a diameter of
the metal container.
[00055]           In some embodiments, after forming a curl, a 21 percent expansion in diameter of
a portion of the metal container by a single land in a single stroke of a single expansion die is
possible. In other embodiments, after forming a curl, an expansion of diameter of a portion of the
metal container of about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% in a single
expansion step by a single land in a single stroke of a single expansion die is possible. Some
embodiments can expand the diameter of a metal container in one expansion step an amount that
would require multiple expansion steps in the prior art.
[00056]           In some embodiments, the land of the expansion die(s) have an undercut portion
as shown in Figure 5 and as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 7,934,410 and 7,954,354. In other
embodiments, no undercut portion is necessary. The presence of the undercut in the land of the
expansion die enables more aggressive expansions of the metal container, including the ability to
take deeper/longer strokes with the expansion die.
[00057]           In some embodiments, the land has a surface roughness average (Ra) ranging
from more than or equal to 8pin to less than or equal to 32pin, so long as the surface of the land
does not disadvantageously disrupt the aesthetic and/or functional features of an inside coating on
the metal container in a significantly observable manner, as described in U.S. Patent Nos.

7,934,410 and 7,954,354.
[00058]           In some embodiments, a knockout does not need to be used when expanding the
metal container. A knockout provides a surface for releasing a metal container from an expansion
die. In some embodiments, a pilot is used to control a top edge of a metal container. A pilot is a
centering tool that controls movement of the top edge. In some embodiments, after curling the top
edge of the metal container, the original diameter of a portion of the metal container is expanded by
at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% by a single land in a single stroke
of a single expansion die without a knockout and/or without first narrowing the metal container.
[00059]           Embodiments of the invention are also applicable to other types and sizes of metal
containers. For example, some embodiments may be used to form metal beverage, aerosol and/or
food containers.
[00060]           In one example, an embodiment of the invention, as described with respect to
Figures 1-4, was used to make the metal container shown in Figure 11 using the dies shown in
Figures 12a, 12b, 13a, 13b, 14a and 14b. The die shown in Figures 12a and 12b was the first die
inserted into an aluminum pre-form container. As can be seen in Figures 12a and 12b, the die has
three lands. The die in Figures 12a and 12b was inserted into the aluminum pre-form container until
the top edge of the container contacted the shoulder shown in Figure 12b and a curl was formed.
When the die shown in Figures 12a and 12b was inserted into the aluminum pre-form container, the
internal air pressure of the container was 35 psi.
[00061]           Next the die shown in Figures 13a and 13b was inserted into the expanded and
curled container. The die shown in Figures 13a and 13b also has three lands. When the die shown
in Figures 13a and 13b was inserted into the expanded and curled container, the internal air
pressure of the container was 35 psi.
[00062]           Finally, the die shown in Figures 14a and 14b was inserted into the curled and
expanded container, resulting in the container shown in Figure 11. The die shown in Figures 14a
and 14b only has one land. When the die shown in Figures 14a and 14b was inserted into the
expanded and curled container, the internal air pressure of the container was 60 psi.
[00063]           Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with
reference to certain versions thereof, other versions are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope of
the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the versions contained herein.

    container is expanded by at least 5% in a single stroke of a single expansion
    die.
12. The method of claim 8 wherein an original diameter of the metal container is
    expanded by at least 5% in a single stroke of a single expansion die without
    prior narrowing of the metal container.
13. The method of claim 8 wherein the top edge of the metal container is curled
    by one of a rotary curler and a die.
14. The method of claim 8 wherein the curl is removed from the top edge of the
    metal container by trimming the top edge of the metal container.
15. A method of forming a metal container comprising:
providing a one-piece metal container with a top edge defining an opening and a
closed bottom;
curling outward a top edge of the metal container to form a curl; and
after curling, inserting an expansion die having a land into the opening of the
metal container to form by expanding, a single land in a single stroke of the
expansion die, without first narrowing the metal container to form a first
expanded section;
wherein at least part of the first expanded section is below the curl.
16. The method of claim 15 further comprising expanding a diameter of a second
    section of the metal container to form a second expanded section.
17. The method of claim 15 further comprising expanding a diameter of a second
    section of the metal container to form a second expanded section prior to
    curling step.
