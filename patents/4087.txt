                                   ABSTRACT
         A method of treating a neurological condition consists of applying
electrical current to targeted neurological tissue region using a pulse generator
according to a non-regular pulse train comprising a plurality of pulses having
non-regular, non-random, differing inter-pulse intervals therebetween, and
repeating the applying step in succession.

 5 States   Provisional      Patent     Application        Serial   No.
   61/102,575,     filed    October     3,     2008;    and   entitled
   "Stimulation Patterns For Treating Neurological Disorders
   Via Deep Brain Stimulation," which is incorporated herein
   by reference.
10 Field of the Invention
         This invention relates      to systems and methods         for
   stimulating nerves in animals, including humans.
   Background of the Invention
         Deep Brain Stimulation       (DBS)    has been found to be
15 successful   in   treating   a   variety     of   brain-controlled
   disorders, including movement disorders. Generally, such
   treatment involves     placement    of a   DBS   type lead into a
   targeted region of the brain through a burr hole drilled
   in   the   patient's     skull,    and     the     application    of
20 appropriate stimulation through the lead to the targeted
   region.
         Presently,    in DBS,  beneficial       (symptom-relieving)
   effects   are   observed    primarily      at   high    stimulation
   frequencies     above   100    Hz    that     are    delivered    in
25 stimulation   patterns    or  trains    in    which   the  interval

                                            -    2
    between electrical              pulses    (the inter-pulse intervals)                   is
     constant       over      time.       The       trace      of      a    conventional
     stimulation        train        for   DES      is    shown      in    Fig.     2.    The
    beneficial        effects        of   DBS    on motor         symptoms       are    only
  5 observed       at     high        frequencies,          while        low    frequency
     stimulation may exacerbate                  symptoms See Benabid et al.
     1991, Limousin et al. 1995. Thalamic DBS at less ~than or
    equal     to     50     Hz     increases         tremor       in     patients       with
    essential tremor. See Kuncel et al.                        2006. Similarly, 50
10  Hz    DBS    produces          tremor      in      pain    patients         receiving
    simulation of the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the
    thalamus       (VPM),       but     the     tremor      disappears          when      the
    frequency        is      increased.          See      Constantoyannis              2004.
    Likewise, DBS of the subthalamic nucleus                             (STN) at 10 Hz
15  worsens      akinesia        in    patients        with   Parkinson's         disease
     (PD),    while        DBS      at    130      Hz     leads       to     significant
    improvement in motor function See Timmermann et al. 2004,
    Fogelson      et    al.      2005.     Similarly,         stimulation          of    the
    globus    pallidus         (GP)     at or      above    130     Hz    significantly
20  improves dystonia, whereas stimulation at either 5 or 50
    Hz - leads    to     significant        worsening.           See    Kupsch     et    al.
    2003.
           Model      studies         also  indicate        that      the    masking       of
    pathological burst activity occurs only with sufficiently
25  high   stimulation           frequencies.           See  Grill        et  al.     2004,
    Figure    1.    Responsiveness            of     tremor     to    changes      in    DBS
    amplitude and frequency are strongly correlated with the
    ability of applied stimuli to mask neuronal bursting. See
    Kuncel et al. 2007, Figure 2.
30         Although         effective,         conventional           high     frequency
    stimulation        generates         stronger        side-effects          than      low
    frequency stimulation, and the therapeutic window between
    the voltage that generates the desired clinical effect(s)
    and the     voltage       that generates             undesired        side    effects
35  decreases       with        increasing           frequency.          Precise       lead

                                               -3
   placement       therefore            becomes      important.          Further,      high
   stimulation frequencies increase power consumption. The
   need     for        higher         frequencies        and        increased         power
   consumption shortens the useful lifetime and/or increases
 5 the physical            size of battery-powered                implantable        pulse
   generators.         The need for higher frequencies and increased
   power    consumption             requires      a  larger     battery        size,     and
   frequent      charging            of   the   battery,      if     the     battery      is
   rechargeable.
10 Summary of the Invention
           The     invention            provides      stimulation          patterns       or
   trains    with different               temporal     patterns        of    stimulation
   than conventional               stimulation trains.          The invention also
   provides       methodologies              to    identify       and      characterize
15 stimulation           patterns         or   trains     that      produce       desired
   relief      of         symptoms,          while     reducing           the     average
   stimulation frequency.
           According            to    one    aspect    of    the      invention,         the
   intervals between stimulation pulses in a pulse pattern
20 or     train         (in       shorthand         called.    .'.'the     .inter-pulse
   intervals")          is     not    constant      over   time,      but    changes      or
   varies      over          time.       These      patterns        or      trains      are
   consequently               called        in      shorthand          "non-regular."
   According       to       this     aspect     of   the    invention,          the    non
25 regular     (i.e.,          not    constant)      pulse patterns            or  trains
   provide     a    lower         average      frequency      for      a   given     pulse
   pattern or         train,       compared to conventional                 continuous,
   high    rate pulse trains               having regular           (i.e.,     constant)
   inter-pulse intervals. Having a lower average frequency,
30 the non-regular             stimulus patterns or trains make possible
   an increase          in    the efficacy of          stimulation by reducing
   the intensity of side effects; by increasing the dynamic
   range between the onset of the desired clinical effect(s)
   and side effects              (and thereby reducing sensitivity to the
35 position of the lead electrode) ; and by decreasing power

    consumption,     thereby providing a          longer useful        battery
    life   and/or     a  smaller      implantable        pulse     generator,
    allowing battery size reduction and/or, for rechargeable
    batteries, longer intervals between recharging.
 5        The non-regular stimulation patterns or trains can
    be readily applied to deep brain stimulation,                  to treat     a
    variety   of neurological       disorders,       such   as   Parkinson's
    disease,   movement     disorders,     epilepsy,       and psychiatric
    disorders    such    as    obsessive-compulsion           disorder        and
10  depression.     The   non-regular       stimulation         patterns       or
    trains   can   also   be    readily    applied      to   other     classes
    electrical stimulation of the nervous system including,
   but   not  limited    to,    cortical    stimulation,         spinal     cord
    stimulation, and peripheral nerve stimulation (including
15  sensory and motor),         to provide     the attendant         benefits
   described    above   and to treat       diseases       such    as but     not
    limited    to    Parkinson's       Disease,        Essential       Tremor,
   Movement Disorders,       Dystonia,    Epilepsy,      Pain, psychiatric
   disorders      such    as      Obsessive      Compulsive         Disorder,
20 Depression, and Tourette's Symdrome.
          According     to    another     aspect      of   the    invention,
   systems and methodologies make it possible to determine
   the effects of the temporal pattern of DBS on simulated
   and measured neuronal activity,          as well as motor symptoms
25 in   both   animals     and    humans.    The     methodologies         make
   possible the qualitative          determination        of   the temporal
   features of stimulation trains.
          The   systems     and    methodologies        described       herein
   employ a genetic       algorithm,     coupled to a        computational
30 model of DBS of the STN,         to develop non-regular patterns
   of stimulation that produced efficacy                (as measured by a
   low error function,       E)   at lower stimulation frequencies,
   F. The error function, E, is a quantitative measure from
   the   model   which   assesses      how  faithfully        the    thalamus
35 transmitted motor commands that are generated by inputs

                                              - 5
   from the cortex. A very high correlation exists between E
   and   symptoms         in    persons       with PD,    and   therefore     E is      a
   valid predictor for the efficacy of a stimulation train
   in relieving symptoms                  (see Dorval et al.,         2007).
 5         Previous efforts                (see Feng et al.        2007)   sought     to
   design       stimulation             trains     that   minimized       the   total
   current        injection.             The     systems      and     methodologies
   disclosed         herein         include      an   objective      function     that
   maximizes        therapeutic           benefit     (by minimizing       the error
10 function)          and       improves        stimulation        efficiency        (by
   reducing the stimulation frequency),                      using a model of the
   STN    that      reproduces           the    frequency     tuning     of  symptom
   reduction         that        has      been    documented       clinically.        In
   contrast,        the      Feng      et   al.   model    showed,     incorrectly,
15 symptom          reduction            with       regular,       low     frequency
   stimulation.           The     inventors       have   identified      novel    non
   regular temporal patterns of stimulation, while Feng et
   al.   identified           regular       low   frequency     (~   10 Hz)   trains
   that    previous           clinical        work    has   demonstrated       to     be
20 ineffective.
   Brief Description of the Drawings
           Fig.       1    is     an     anatomic      view    of   a    system    for
   stimulating          tissue       of    the   central    nervous     system    that
   includes an lead implanted in brain tissue coupled to a
25 pulse generator that is programmed to provide non-regular
    (i.e., not constant) pulse patterns or trains, in which
   the interval between electrical pulses                         (the inter-pulse
   intervals) changes or varies over time.
           Fig.      2     is     a    diagrammatic       trace     that    shows      a
30 conventional regular high frequency stimulation train, in
   which the interval between electrical pulses                          (the inter
   pulse intervals) is constant.
           Fig.       3      is      a     diagrammatic       trace      showing       a
   representative example of a repeating non-regular pulse
35 pattern or train in which the inter-pulse intervals are

    linearly cyclically ramped over time.
           Figs.     4 and 5 are diagrammatic traces showing other
   representative           examples        of    repeating      non-regular            pulse
   patterns      or    trains      comprising            within,    a     single        pulse
 5 train,     a   combination          of     single      pulses      (singlets)          and
   embedded multiple pulse groups                     (n-lets),     with non-regular
   inter-pulse intervals between singlets and n-lets as well
   as non-regular inter-pulse                  intervals within the multiple
   pulse n-lets.
10 Description of the Preferred Embodiments
          Fig. 1 is a system 10 for stimulating tissue of the
   central     nervous        system.       The    system      includes        a   lead     12
   placed     in   a    desired      position          in  contact       with       central
   nervous system tissue.              In    the illustrated embodiment,                  the
15 lead 12 is      'implanted in           a region of the brain,                  such as
   the thalamus,          subthalamus,            or   globus     pallidus         for the
   purpose of deep brain stimulation. However, it should be
   understood,        the     lead   12     could be       implanted         in,     on,   or
   near   the    spinal       cord;     or    in,    on,   or near a peripheral
20 nerve     (sensory or         motor)       for the purpose            of     selective
   stimulation to achieve a therapeutic purpose.
          The distal          end of the lead 12 carries                   one or more
   electrodes 14 to apply electrical pulses to the targeted
   tissue region.          The   electrical          pulses     are    supplied by a
25 pulse generator 16 coupled to the lead 12.
          In   the illustrated            embodiment,         the pulse generator
   16 is    implanted in         a   suitable location remote                    from the
   lead   12,    e.g.,       in   the     shoulder        region.      It     should       be
   appreciated,        however,      that the pulse generator 16 could
30 be placed in        other regions of the body or externally.
          When implanted,           the case of the pulse generator can
   serve as a reference            or return electrode.              Alternatively,
   the lead 12 can include a reference                       or return electrode
   (comprising        a    bi-polar          arrangement) ,         or     a     separate

   attached elsewhere on the body                    (comprising a mono-polar
   arrangement).
         The     pulse    generator            16     includes         an    on-board,
   programmable      microprocessor             18,    which carries           embedded
 5 code.     The    code    expresses            pre-programmed             rules     or
   algorithms under which a desired electrical stimulation
   waveform pattern or train is generated and distributed to
   the electrode(s)       14   on the lead 12.               According        to these
   programmed     rules,     the     pulse       generator          16   directs     the
10 prescribed      stimulation          waveform           patterns        or     trains
   through the lead 12 to the electrode(s) 14, which serve
   to selectively stimulate the targeted tissue region. The
   code   is   preprogrammed         by      a   clinician         to    achieve     the
   particular physiologic response desired.
15       in the illustrated embodiment, an on-board battery
   20 supplies      power to the microprocessor                      18.   Currently,
   batteries     20    must   be     replaced           every      1   to    9    years,
   depending on the stimulation parameters needed to treat a
   disorder. When the battery life ends, the replacement of
20 batteries requires another invasive surgical procedure to
   gain access to the implanted pulse generator. As will be
   described,      the   system        10     makes       possible,        among     its
   several benefits, an increase in battery life.
         The stimulation waveform pattern or train generated
25 by  the    pulse    generator        differs         from     convention        pulse
   patterns     or    trains     in      that        the    waveform        comprises
   repeating non-regular         (i.e.,        not constant) pulse patterns
   or  trains,     in   which     the       interval         between      electrical
   pulses    (the    inter-pulse         intervals          or    IPI)    changes     or
30 varies over time. Examples of these repeating non-regular
   pulse   patterns     or   trains        are      shown     in    Figs.     3   to  S.
   Compared    to    conventional          pulse       trains      having       regular
   (i.e., constant) inter-pulse intervals                        (as shown in Fig.
   2),    the non-regular (i.e., not constant) pulse patterns
35 or trains provide a lower average frequency for a given

                                            - 8
    pulse pattern or train, where the average frequency for a
     given pulse train (expressed in hertz or Hz) is defined
     as the       sum   of the     inter-pulse       intervals          for the pulse
     train     in   seconds      (Eml)   divided by the number of pulses
  5   (n)  in   the given pulse train,           or (S1 1/n.          A lower average
     frequency makes possible a reduction in the intensity of
     side effects, as well as an increase in the dynamic range
    between the onset of the desired clinical effect(s) and
     side effects,          thereby     increasing the           clinical       efficacy
10  and       reducing        sensitivity       to    the       position         of      the
    electrode(s) - A lower average frequency brought about by
    a     non-regular        pulse   pattern     or   train        also leads          to  a
    decrease in power consumption, thereby prolonging battery
    life and reducing battery size.
15            The repeating non-regular (i.e., not constant) pulse
    patterns or -trains.can take a variety of different forms.
    For     example,        as   will   be   described         in     greater      detail
    later,         the     inter-pulse       intervals          can       be   linearly
    cyclically          ramped     over    time    in    non-regular           temporal
20  patterns        (growing larger and/or smaller. or a combination
    of each over time);             or be periodically embedded in non
    regular temporal patterns comprising clusters or groups
    of multiple pulses             (called n-lets), wherein n is two or
    more. For example, when n=2, the n-let can be called a
25  doublet;        when    n=3,   the n-let      can be        called a       triplet;
    when n=4, the n-let can be called a quadlet; and so on.
    The repeating non-regular                pulse patterns or trains can
    comprise combinations of single pulses                        (called singlets)
    spaced apart by varying non-regular inter-pulse intervals
30  and n-lets         interspersed       among the       singlets,         the n-lets
    themselves         being     spaced     apart    by    varying         non-regular
    inter-pulse          intervals     both between        adjacent n-lets              and
    between the n pulses embedded in the n-let. If desired,
    the non-regularity of the pulse pattern or train can be
35  accompanied          by   concomitant     changes       in     waveform        and/or

                                           - 9
    amplitude, and/or duration in each pulse pattern or train
    or in successive pulse patterns or trains.
            Each pulse comprising a singlet or imbedded in an n
   -let  in     a  given train        comprises      a  waveform     that    can be
 5  monophasic,         biphasic,        or    multiphasic.      Each      waveform
    possesses a given amplitude                (expressed,   e.g.,    in   amperes)
    that can, by way of example, range from 10 pa (E 6 ) to 10
    ma (E- 3 ).   The amplitude of a given phase in              a waveform can
    be  the     same or differ          among the phases.         Each waveform
10  also possesses a duration                (expressed, e.g.,       in seconds)
    that can, by way of example, range from 10 ps                        (E6) to 2
    ms (E-)-. The duration of the phases in a given waveform
    can likewise be the same or different. It is emphasized
    that all numerical values expressed herein are given by
15  way of      example     only.     They can be 'varied,         increased       or
    decreased, according to the clinical objectives.
            When     applied       in   deep     brain   stimulation,         it   is
    believed      that repeating          stimulation patterns or trains
    applied       with     non-regular          inter-pulse     intervals         can
20  regularize the output of disordered neuronal firing, to
    thereby       prevent      the     generation       and   propagation          of
    bursting       activity        with    a    lower   average      stimulation
    frequency        than     required        with    conventional        constant
    frequency trains,          i.e.,      with a    lower   average      frequency
25  than about 100 Hz.           .
    Fig. 3 shows a representative example of a repeating non
    regular pulse pattern or train in which the inter-pulse
    intervals       are   linearly cyclically ramped over time.                    As
    shown    in    Fig.    3,  the     pulse pattern       or  train      includes
30  singlet pulses          (singlets) spaced apart by progressively
    increasing inter-pulse intervals providing a decrease in
    frequency         over      time,        e.g.,     having       an      initial
    instantaneous          frequency       of    140   Hz,   decreasing          with
    doubling inter-pulse intervals, to a final instantaneous
35  frequency of        40 Hz.      The inter-pulse       intervals       can vary

                                                  -   10
    within a         specified            range      selected       based upon          clinical
    objections,           e.g.,         not to exceed 25 ms,                or not to exceed
     100 ms,       or    not to exceed 200 ms,                     to take        into account
    burst        responses         and      subsequent          disruption          of  thalamic
  5  fidelity.           ).      The       non-regular            pulse       trains       repeat
    themselves for a. clinically appropriate period of time.
    As      shown     in    Fig.       3,     the     first      pulse      train      comprises
    progressively               increasing            inter-pulse            intervals        from
     smallest        to     largest,          followed         immediately           by  another
10  essentially             identical           second        pulse      train        comprising
    progressively               increasing            inter-pulse            intervals        from
    smallest - to              largest,            followed         immediately           by    an
    essentially            identical           third        pulse    train,         and   so   on.
    Therefore, between successive pulse trains, there is an
15  instantaneous                change         from        the    largest          inter-pulse
    interval        (at the end of one train)                     to the. smallest inter
    pulse interval               (at the beginning of the next successive
    train)      .   The      train        shown       in     Fig.     3     has     an   average
    frequency          of    85     Hz    and     is    highly      non-regular,          with   a
20  coefficient            of      variation           (CV)     of    about        0.5.    As   is
    demonstrated            in     the      following         Example        (Batch     3),    the
    increased efficiency of the pulse train shown in Fig. 3
     (due      to the      lower        average        frequency)        also      can provide
    greater efficacy, as compared to a constant 100 Hz pulse
25  pattern.
               The train shown in Fig. 3 exploits the dynamics of
    burst       generation           in     thalamic         neurons.        The     early   high
    frequency phase of the train masks intrinsic activity in
    subthalamic           nucleus          (STN)     neurons,       and     the inter-pulse
30  interval increases reduce the average frequency. A family
    of      trains       can       be     provided          by    varying         the    initial
    frequency,         final frequency,               and rate of change within the
    train,        with the objective                 to prevent         thalamic bursting
    with a lower average stimulation frequency than required
35  with constant frequency trains.

                                          - 11
             Figs. 4 and 5 show other representative examples of
       repeating       non-regular       pulse     patterns        or  trains.         The
    pulse trains in Figs. 4 and 5 comprise within, a single
    pulse train, a combination of single pulses                            (singlets)
  5 and embedded multiple pulse groups                    (n-lets), with non
    regular        inter-pulse      intervals       between      singlets       and     n
     lets, as well as non-regular inter-pulse intervals within
    the     n-lets      themselves.        The   non-regular          pulse      trains
    repeat themselves for a clinically appropriate period of
10  time.
             The non-regular pulse train can be characterized as
    comprising one or more singlets spaced apart by a minimum
    inter-pulse         singlet     interval       and   one      or   more     n-lets
    comprising,         for each n-let,         two or more pulses               spaced
15  apart      by    an   inter-pulse       interval      (called       the      "n-let
    inter-pulse         interval")       that   is    less    than     the     minimum
    singlet         inter-pulse       interval.      The   n-let        inter-pulse
    interval        can  itself    vary within the          train,      as     can the
    interval between successive n-lets or a successive n-lets
20  and     singlets.      The   non-regular        pulse    trains      comprising
    singlets and n-lets            repeat     themselves       for a     clinically
    appropriate period of time.
             In Fig. 4, each pulse train comprises four singlets
    in     succession       (with non-regular          inter-pulse         intervals
25  there between);           followed by four doublets in succession
     (with non-regular           inter-doublet        pulse      intervals        there
    between and non-regular inter-pulse intervals within each
    n-let);        followed by      a   singlet,      three     doublets,        and     a
    singlet        (with non-regular        inter-     pulse intervals            there
30  between and non-regular inter-pulse intervals within each
    n-let).      The temporal pattern of this pulse train repeats
    itself in succession for a clinically appropriate period
    of time.       The non-regular temporal pulse pattern shown in
    Fig. 4 has an average frequency of 67.B2 Hz without loss
35  of efficacy,        as is   demonstrated in        the following Example,

                                              -    12
   Batch 17.
              In Fig. 5, each pulse train comprises four singlets
   in     succession            (with    non-regular         inter-pulse     intervals
   there between) ; followed by three doublets in                           succession
 5  (with non-regular                 inter-doublet         pulse    intervals       there
   between and non-regular inter-pulse intervals within each
   n-let)      . The temporal pattern of this pulse train                        repeats
   itself in succession for a clinically appropriate period
   of time.         The non-regular           temporal pulse pattern shown in
10 Fig.      5 has an average frequency of 87.62 Hz without loss
   of efficacy,             as is    demonstrated in         the following Example,
   Batch 18.
             The following Example illustrates a representative
   methodology for developing and identifying candidate non
15 regular stimulation trains                     as shown in      Figs.  3 to 5 that
   achieve comparable or better efficacy at a lower average
   frequency           (i.e.,      more   efficiency)         than   constant      inter
   pulse interval trains.
   EXAMPLE
20           Computational            models of thalamic DBS             (McIntyre. et
   al.     2004,       Birdno,      2009)    and subthalamic          DBS  (Rubin and
   Terman,         2004)       can be used with genetic-algorithm-based
   optimization               (Davis,    1991)       (GA)   to   design non-regular
   stimulation             patterns       or     trains      that   produce     desired
25 relief         of    symptoms        with     a    lower    average    stimulation
   frequency than regular, high-rate stimulation. McIntyre
   et al.         2004,      Birdno,     2009; Rubin and Terman,            2004;       'and
   Davis, 1991 are incorporated herein by reference.
             In      the       GA   implementation,            the   stimulus       train
30  (pattern) is              the chromosome          of  the organism,      and each
   gene in the chromosome is the IPI between two successive
   pulses in the train. The implementation can start, e.g.,
   with      trains        of    21 pulses         (20   genes)    yielding    a    train
   length of          -400      ms   (at average        frequency of 50 Hz) ,           and
35 the     6    s   trains        required      for    stimulation     are   built        by

                                             -  13
    serial      concatenation          of    15   identical pulse trains.                   The
   process       can start       with an initial          population of,            e.g.,      50
   organisms,          constituted          of    random      IPI's       drawn      from        a
   uniform       distribution.           At each step          (generation)           of the
 5 GA,     the    fitness of        each pulse train            is    evaluated using
   either the TC or basal ganglia network model                                (identified
   above)       and     calculating         a   cost     function,         C.    From     each
   generation,          the 10 best          stimulus trains             (lowest      C)    are
   selected, to be carried forward to the next generation.
10 They will also be combined                    (mated) and random variations
    (mutations) introduced into the 40 offspring, yielding 50
   trains in each generation. This process assures that the
   best stimulation trains                  (traits) are carried through to
   the next generation, while avoiding local minima (i.e.,
15 mating       and mutations           preserve       genetic        diversity) .          See
   Grefenstette           1986.     The GA continues            through         successive
   generations          until     the median and minimum values                       of the
   cost       function        reach     a   plateau,        and     this      will      yield
   candidate trains.
20           The objective          is    to find -patterns of non-constant
   inter-pulse interval deep brain stimulation trains that
   provide advantageous results, as defined by low frequency
   and      low    error       rate.     An    error      function         is    desirably
   created that assigns the output of each temporal pattern
25 of stimulation a specific error fraction                           (E) based on how
   the voltage output of the thalamic                         cells       correspond          to
   the      timing      of     the    input      stimulus.       Using        this      error
   fraction,        a   cost     function        (C)  is    desirably created                 to
   minimize both frequency and error fraction, according to
30 representative             equation C        = W*E + K*f,          where        C is    the
   cost, E is the error fraction, f is the average frequency
   of      the     temporal        pattern        of    stimulation,             W   is       an
   appropriate weighting factor for the error function, and
   K is an appropriate weighting factor for the frequency.
35 The      weighting          factors       W    and     K   allow         quantitative

                                          -    14

    to generate patterns of non-constant inter-pulse interval
    deep brain stimulation trains that provide advantageous
    results       with     lower     average         frequencies,          compared     to
  5 conventional constant frequency pulse trains.
             With    this      cost   function,          the     voltage     output     of
    several candidate temporal patterns of stimulation can be
    evaluated and the cost calculated. Temporal patterns of
    stimulation with a low cost can then be used to create
10  new temporal patterns of similar features in an attempt
    to achieve even            lower   costs.       In   this     way,    new temporal
    patterns of stimulation can be "bred" for a set number of
    generations and the best temporal patterns of stimulation
    of each batch recorded.
15           Several      batches     of     the     genetic       algorithm     yields
    useful results in that they achieve lower costs than the
    corresponding          constant      frequency           DBS    waveforms.      Some
    batches can be run in an attempt to find especially low
    frequency temporal patterns of stimulation, by changing
20  the cost      function to weight              frequency more heavily,               or
    vice versa (i.e., by changing W and/or K).                           These batches
    can     also   yield      lower   cost      results        than    the    constant
    frequency waveforms.
             By way of        example,      a   total      of    14   batches   of   the
25  genetic      algorithm       were   run and          evaluated with various
    cost functions and modified initial parameters.
             Before       the    trials       were       run,      a   baseline      was
    established        by   running      constant-frequency               patterns     of
    stimulation          through      the       model         and     analyzing      the
30  associated error fractions                (Example Figure 1) . As can be
    seen     from     Example       Figure       1,     the     healthy. condition
    produced       a     low     error      fraction          of     0.1    while    the
    Parkinsonian condition without DBS yielded a higher error
    fraction      of     0.5.    From    these        results,        constant    high
35  frequency patterns of stimulation ranging from 100-200 Hz

                                                        - 15
    gave     near perfect                    results.       Novel     non-constant          temporal
    patterns             of        stimulation             would       then       be     considered
    advantageous if they showed error fractions very close to
    0.1 with average frequencies less than 100-200 Hz.

             The first set of batches was run by minimizing only
10  the     error          fraction                (E).   Thus,       the      associated         cost
    function was               simply C = E.                The    results       are    summarized
    according             to       average            frequency        and      error      fraction
    (Example Table 1).                       The associated inter-pulse intervals
    (IPI's)          can       be         seen      in    Example       Figure       2.    Batch      3
15  outputted           an error              fraction       0.054.      Another      interesting
    feature is that the IPI's in Batch 3 gradually increased

                                      -  16
   until     about    40 msec,     and      then     repeated     itself.     This
   provides support that ramp trains are advantageous..                           The
   trace shown in Fig. 3 generally incorporates the temporal
   features of Batch 3.
 5         The remaining batches yielded error fractions higher
   than    0.1 and were      no better        than     the 150 Hz        constant
   frequency case.

         Because many batches were yielding error fractions
   above 0.1    (healthy condition), and only a small window of
 5 error   fraction   less   than the      150   HZ DBS    case would be
   useful, a new cost function was constructed to minimize
   an   alternate    feature       of   the    temporal      patterns    of
   stimulation;    namely,     frequency.     This new cost       function
   weighted the error fraction and frequency, yielding the
10 equation    C = 1000*E     + F,    where    C is    cost,   E is   error
   fraction, and F is the average frequency of the waveform
   in Hz, W = 1000, and K=l.
          In  order   to  establish      a   new    baseline    cost,   the
   constant-frequency patterns of stimulation were evaluated
15 again according to the new cost function              (Example Figure
   3).  As can be seen from the graph,           the healthy condition
   reported a cost of 90..65 and the Parkinson case with no
   DBS yielded 505.50. The best constant-frequency pattern
   of stimulation with the new cost function was the 100 Hz
20 case   with   a  cost   of    231.11.    This     new  cost    function
   allowed    for  a   wider     range    of    solutions,      because   a
   temporal    pattern   of     stimulation      would    be   considered
   useful if it had a cost less than 231.11 but presumably
   higher than 90.65.

         The advantage of low frequency was emphasized with a
   new cost function,     which weighted frequency more heavily,
   C = 1000*E + 2*F. Because the frequency of DBS does not
   affect the healthy condition or the PD with no DBS, these
10 baseline    costs   stayed    the    same     at    90.65     and   505.50,
   respectively.     The  100   Hz   was    again the       best    constant
   frequency temporal pattern of stimulation, with a cost of

                                           -   20
    331.11. The following temporal patterns of stimulation,
    then,   were considered useful if                 they had low frequencies
    and costs less than 331.11 and greater than 90.65.
           The results of the revised cost function can be seen
  5 in   Example       Table        3    and      the    IPIs      visualized    in
    ExampleFigure         5.     Of   the      resulting      batches,   batch   17
    proved most interesting because of its very low average
    frequency of 67.82 Hz. Even with such a low frequency,                       it
    managed to prove better              than the 100 Hz condition- with a
10  reduction in cost of about 10. The waveform of batch 17
    is interesting in that it consists of a ramp pattern of
    decreasing     IPI       in   the    first      100   msec,    followed   by    a
    continual    shift        between        large    IPI   and   small  IPI.   The
    qualitative     feature of quickly changing between large and
15  small IPI's      may prove advantageous.                  The trace   shown in
    Fig.  4  generally          incorporates        the temporal      features   of

          The        most       interesting           temporal        patterns          of
 5 stimulation in         this     Example are from batches              15,     17,   and
   18.  Batch 15 produced a temporal pattern of stimulation
   with an average frequency of 98 Hz with an error fraction
   as   low      as    0.098.      Thus,     it     outperformed        the      100    Hz
   constant-frequency             case by managing to             lower the error
10 even further         at roughly the same frequency.                    Still,       the
   qualitatively useful features of batch 15 are difficult
   to discern.         Batch 17 was also appealing because                        of its
   very   low       frequency       of    67.82.      This    low    frequency         was
   gained at the cost of increased                      error at 0.253,           but   it
15 may   nonetheless           be   useful       if    emphasis      is    placed       on
   maintaining low frequency DBS. The qualitative features
   of  batch       17   indicated        at   first      a ramp     followed         by    a
   continual switching between low and high IPI's. Lastly,

                                            -   22
   batch 18 stood somewhere in the middle with a fairly low
   frequency of 87.62 and low error fraction of 0.116,                                    only
   marginally higher than the healthy condition of 0.1. The
   dominant     qualitative           feature       of batch          18's waveform         is
 5 that it    too shows a ramp nature in                      that the IPI initially
   steadily      falls,       then       quickly         rises,       falls,.       and  then
   rises.    The     rapid changing             between          high and low IPI of
   batch 17 can be envisioned as a set of steep ramps.
          A comparison of Batch 17                   (Fig. 4) and Batch 18 (Fig.
10 5) demonstrates how the balance between efficacy (E) and
   efficiency         (f)    in     non-regular              temporal          patterns     of
   stimulation can be purposefully tailored to meet clinical
   objectives. The systems and methodologies discussed allow
   changing the cost function by weighting efficacy (E) or
15 frequency       (f) more heavily               (i.e.,        by changing W and/or
   K) , while still        yielding temporal patterns of stimulation
   with    lower       cost    results          than       the      constant-frequency
   waveforms.       Comparing         Batch       17 with Batch               18,   one  sees
   that   the error fraction                (E)    (i.e.,         the efficacy of          the
20 temporal pattern) of Batch 17                    (0.253)        is  greater than the
   error fraction          (E)    (i.e.,       the efficacy of the temporal
   pattern) of Batch 18               (0.116). However, one                    can also see
   that   the     efficiency          (i.e.,       the      average        frequency)       of
   Batch 17      (67.82 Hz)        is lower than the efficiency (i.e.,
25 the average        frequency)          of Batch 18             (81.28      Hz).    Through
   different in tens of efficacy and efficiency, both Batch
   17 and Batch 18 have costs better than constant-frequency
   temporal patterns.
          The    non-regular           temporal         patterns         of     stimulation
30 generated      and    disclosed above                therefore          make     possible
   achieving at least the same or equivalent                              (and expectedly
   better)    clinical        efficacy        at a        lower average            frequency
   compared      to     conventional             constant-frequency                 temporal
   patterns.       The    lower       average         frequencies             of   the   non
35 regular     temporal         stimulation             patterns          make      possible

   increases in efficiency and expand the therapeutic window
   of amplitudes that can be applied to achieve the desired
   result before side effects are encountered.
         DBS is a well-established therapy for treatment of
 5 movement   disorders,          but       the    lack    of      understanding           of
   mechanisms    of     action has           limited      full       development          and
   optimization      of     this     treatment.         Previous          studies       have
   focused on DBS-induced increases or decreases in neuronal
   firing rates in the basal ganglia and thalamus. However,
10 recent   data     suggest        that       changes       in     neuronal        firing
   patterns   may     be     at   least        as   important          as   changes         in
   firing rates.
         The above described systems and methodologies make
   it  possible     to     determine          the   effects         of   the     temporal
15 pattern   of     DES       on    simulated          and     measured          neuronal
   activity, as well as motor symptoms in both animals and
   humans. The methodologies make possible the qualitative
   and quantitative determination of the temporal features
   of   low 'frequency           stimulation            trains         that      preserve
20 efficacy.     _
         The   systems          and     methodologies             described         herein
   provide robust insight into the effects of the temporal
   patterns of DES, and thereby illuminate the mechanisms of
   action.   Exploiting           this       understanding,             new      temporal
25 patterns   of stimulation can be developed,                           using model
   based optimization,           and tested,           with the objective                and
   expectation     to    increase         DES     efficacy        and    increase        DBS
   efficiency by reducing DES side effects.
         The    invention          provides          non-regular           stimulation
30 patterns   or    trains       that       can    create       a    range     of    motor
   effects   from      exacerbation             of    symptoms         to    relief        of
   symptoms. The non-regular stimulation patterns or trains
   described    herein        and     their       testing       according          to    the
   methodology       described           herein         will        facilitate           the
35 selection    of      optimal         surgical         targets         as     well       as

                                    - 24
   treatments for new disorders. The non-regular stimulation
   patterns      or   trains    described       herein         make    possible
   improved     outcomes   of  DBS by reducing             side   effects    and
   prolonging battery life.
