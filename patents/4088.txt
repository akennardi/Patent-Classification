      WIRELESS ACCESS METHOD AND RELATED DEVICE
                                      AND SYSTEM
                                     TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001]      The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent
 5 Application No. 2013408042, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
   reference.
   [0002]      The present invention relates to the field of communications technologies,
   and in particular, to a wireless access method and a related device and system.
                                       BACKGROUND
10 [0003]      Currently, an increasing quantity of WIFI access points are deployed in
   public places such as an airport, a mall, and a station, so that a user in a public place
   can implement interconnection with the Internet by accessing a WIFI access point. In
   a practical application, a process in which a user accesses a WIFI access point is
   generally as follows: The user enables WIFI access point search on a terminal device
15 (for example, a mobile phone); after the terminal device obtains a WIFI access point
   by means of search, sends a wireless connection request to the WIFI access point;
   after a prompt of entering a password is received from the WIFI access point, the user
   enters the password, and the terminal device sends the password to the WIFI access
   point; and after the WIFI access point verifies that the password is correct, the
20 terminal device is allowed to access the WIFI access point, so that interconnection
   between the terminal device and the Internet is implemented.
   [0004]      It is found from practice that, in the foregoing process of accessing the
   WIFI access point, the user not only needs to manually enable WIFI access point
   search, but also needs to manually enter a password. Consequently, accessing is
25 time-consuming and laborious, and efficiency in accessing the WIFI access point is
   reduced.
   [0005]      Where any or all of the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or
   "comprising" are used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be

   interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or
   components, but not precluding the presence of one or more other features, integers,
   steps or components.
   [0006]       A reference herein to a patent document or any other matter identified as
 5 prior art, is not to be taken as an admission that the document or other matter was
   known or that the information it contains was part of the common general knowledge
   as at the priority date of any of the claims.

                          DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
   [0075]      The following clearly and completely describes the technical solutions in
   the embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying
   drawings in the embodiments of the present invention. Apparently, the described
15 embodiments are merely a part rather than all of the embodiments of the present
   invention. All other embodiments obtained by persons of ordinary skill in the art
   based on the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts shall fall
   within the protection scope of the present invention.
   [0076]      The embodiments of the present invention disclose a wireless access
20 method and a related device and system, which can effectively improve efficiency in
   accessing an access point. Detailed descriptions are separately provided in the
   following.
   [0077]      Referring to FIG. 1, FIG. 1 is a schematic flowchart of a wireless access
   method according to an embodiment of the present invention. The wireless access
25 method shown in FIG. 1 may include the following steps:
   [0078]      101. A terminal device reads access point information stored in an external
   NFC tag.
   [0079]      102. The terminal device acquires one piece of target access point
   information according to the read access point information, and establishes, according
30 to the target access point information, a wireless connection to an access point to
   which the target access point information belongs.
   [0080]      In this embodiment of the present invention, the terminal device may
                                               17

   include a terminal device such as a smartphone, a tablet computer, a personal digital
   assistant (Personal Digital Assistant, PDA), or a mobile Internet device (Mobile
   Internet Devices, MID) having an NCF module, which is not repeated subsequently in
   this embodiment of the present invention. The terminal device may include at least
 5 one processor, and the terminal device may work under the control of the at least one
   processor.
   [0081]      In this embodiment of the present invention, a user may hold the terminal
   device to approach the external NFC tag, so that the terminal device may read, by
   using the NCF module of the terminal device, the access point information stored in
10 the external NFC tag.
   [0082]      In an optional implementation manner, the NFC tag may store only one
   piece of access point information, or the NFC tag may store multiple pieces of access
   point information, which is not limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0083]      In an optional implementation manner, the access point information may
15 include one or more pieces of WIFI access point information and Bluetooth access
   point information. The WIFI access point information may include a WIFI access
   point account and an access password bound to the WIFI access point account, and
   the Bluetooth access point information may include a Bluetooth access point account
   and an access password bound to the Bluetooth access point account.
20 [0084]      In an optional implementation manner, in the foregoing step 102, that the
   terminal device acquires the one piece of target access point information according to
   the read access point information may include the following steps:
   [0085]      Step (11): The terminal device detects a signal strength value of an access
   point to which each piece of the read access point information belongs.
25 [0086]      Step (12): The terminal device selects access point information of an
   access point whose signal strength value is the largest as the target access point
   information.
   [0087]      By performing step (11)        and step (12),     the terminal device can
   automatically select, in the background, the access point information of the access
30 point whose signal strength value is the largest as the target access point information.
   [0088]      In another optional implementation manner, in the foregoing step 102, that
   the terminal device acquires the one piece of target access point information
   according to the read access point information may include the following steps:
   [0089]      Step (21): The terminal device detects a signal strength value of an access
                                               18

   point to which each piece of the read access point information belongs.
   [0090]      Step (22): The terminal device outputs each piece of the read access point
   information and the signal strength value of the access point to which the access point
   information belongs.
 5 [0091]      Step (23): The terminal device detects one piece of access point
   information that is selected by a user according to the signal strength value from the
   access point information output by the terminal device, and uses the piece of access
   point information as a target access point account.
   [0092]      By performing steps (21) to (23), the user can select desirable access point
10 information as the target access point information.
   [0093]      In this embodiment of the present invention, the access point information
   may include an access point account, or the access point information may include an
   access point account and an access password bound to the access point account, which
   is not limited in this embodiment of the present invention.
15 [0094]      For example, when the access point information includes an access point
   account, in the foregoing step 102, that the terminal device establishes, according to
   the target access point information, the wireless connection to the access point to
   which the target access point information belongs may include the following steps:
   [0095]      Step (31): The terminal device sends, according to a target access point
20 account, a wireless connection request to an access point to which the target access
   point account belongs, where the wireless connection request includes an access
   password bound to the target access point account.
   [0096]      Step (32): The terminal device receives a wireless connection success
   response that is sent after the access point to which the target access point account
25 belongs verifies that the access password bound to the target access point account is
   correct.
   [0097]      By performing step (31) and step (32), if the access password is not
   required, the terminal device can automatically access the access point to which the
   target access point information belongs, to establish the wireless connection between
30 the terminal device and the access point to which the target access point information
   belongs.
   [0098]      For another example, when the access point information includes an access
   point account and an access password bound to the access point account, in the
   foregoing step 102, that the terminal device establishes, according to the target access
                                               19

   point information, the wireless connection to the access point to which the target
   access point information belongs may include the following steps:
   [0099]      Step (41): The terminal device sends, according to a target access point
   account, a wireless connection request to an access point to which the target access
 5 point account belongs, where the wireless connection request includes an access
   password bound to the target access point account.
   [0100]      Step (42): The terminal device receives a wireless connection success
   response that is sent after the access point to which the target access point account
   belongs verifies that the access password bound to the target access point account is
10 correct.
   [0101]      By performing step (41) and step (42), if the access password is required,
   the terminal device can quickly and automatically access the access point to which the
   target access point information belongs, to establish the wireless connection between
   the terminal device and the access point to which the target access point information
15 belongs.
   [0102]      For another example, when the access point information includes an access
   point account and an access password bound to the access point account, in the
   foregoing step 102, that the terminal device establishes, according to the target access
   point information, the wireless connection to the access point to which the target
20 access point information belongs may include the following steps:
   [0103]      Step (51): The terminal device sends, according to a target access point
   account, a wireless connection request to an access point to which the target access
   point account belongs.
   [0104]      Step (52): The terminal device receives prompt information sent by the
25 access point to which the target access point account belongs, where the prompt
   information is used to prompt sending of an access password bound to the target
   access point account.
   [0105]      Step (53): The terminal device sends the access password bound to the
   target access point account to the access point to which the target access point account
30 belongs.
   [0106]      Step (54): The terminal device receives a wireless connection success
   response that is sent after the access point to which the target access point account
   belongs verifies that the access password bound to the target access point account is
   correct.
                                              20

   [0107]      By performing step (51) and step (52), if the access password is required,
   the terminal device can automatically access, by using an existing wireless access
   manner, the access point to which the target access point information belongs, to
   establish the wireless connection between the terminal device and the access point to
 5 which the target access point information belongs.
   [0108]      In an optional implementation manner, in the wireless access method
   described in FIG. 1, after executing step 101, the terminal device may further store the
   read access point information.
   [0109]      In another optional implementation manner, in the wireless access method
10 described in FIG. 1, after the terminal device stores the read access point information,
   the terminal device may further determine whether a storage time of the access point
   information exceeds a preset threshold; and if the storage time exceeds the preset
   threshold, delete the stored access point information. Alternatively, after the terminal
   device stores the read access point information, the terminal device may detect
15 whether a wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is received; and if the
   wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is received, delete the stored
   access point information. Therefore, storage space of the terminal device that is
   occupied by the access point information can be released.
   [0110]      In this embodiment of the present invention, in the wireless access method
20 described in FIG. 1, operations such as manually enabling access point search and
   manually entering a password by a user can be avoided, so that efficiency in accessing
   an access point can be effectively improved.
   [0111]      Referring to FIG. 2, FIG. 2 is a schematic flowchart of a wireless access
   method according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the wireless access
25 method described in FIG. 2, an example in which access point information includes
   an access point account and an access password bound to the access point account is
   used for description. The wireless access method shown in FIG. 2 may include the
   following steps:
   [0112]      201. A terminal device reads an access point account and an access
30 password bound to the access point account that are stored in an external NFC tag.
   [0113]      In this embodiment of the present invention, a user may hold the terminal
   device to approach the external NFC tag, so that the terminal device may read, by
   using an NCF module of the terminal device, the access point account and the access
   password bound to the access point account that are stored in the external NFC tag.
                                              21

   [0114]      In this embodiment of the present invention, the NFC tag may store only
   one access point account and an access password bound to the access point account,
   or the NFC tag may store multiple access point accounts and access passwords bound
   to the multiple access point accounts, which is not limited in this embodiment of the
 5 present invention.
   [0115]      In this embodiment of the present invention, the access point account may
   include an access point name (for example, TP-LINK1), an access point identifier,
   and the like.
   [0116]      In this embodiment of the present invention, the access point account may
10 be a WIFI access point account or may be a Bluetooth access point account. Specially,
   when the NFC tag stores multiple access point accounts and access passwords bound
   to the multiple access point accounts, the multiple access point accounts stored in the
   NFC tag may include only WIFI access point accounts, or may include only Bluetooth
   access point accounts, or may include some WIFI access point accounts and some
15 Bluetooth access point accounts.
   [0117]      202. The terminal device acquires one target access point account
   according to the read access point account, and establishes, according to the target
   access point account and an access password bound to the target access point account,
   a wireless connection to an access point to which the target access point account
20 belongs.
   [0118]      In this embodiment of the present invention, when the NFC tag includes
   only one access point account and an access password bound to the access point
   account, the terminal device may use the read access point account as the target access
   point account.
25 [0119]      In this embodiment of the present invention, when the NFC tag includes
   multiple access point accounts and access passwords bound to the multiple access
   point accounts, the terminal device may select any access point account from the read
   access point accounts as the target access point account. Alternatively, the terminal
   device may detect a signal strength value of an access point to which each of the read
30 access point accounts belongs, and select an access point account of an access point
   whose signal strength value is the largest as the target access point account.
   Alternatively, the terminal device may detect a signal strength value of an access point
   to which each of the read access point accounts belongs and output each of the read
   access point accounts and the detected signal strength value of the access point to
                                              22

   which the access point account belongs, and may detect any access point account that
   is selected by the user according to the signal strength value from the access point
   accounts output by the terminal device and use the access point account as the target
   access point account.
 5 [0120]      In this embodiment of the present invention, in step 202, that the terminal
   device establishes, according to the target access point account and the access
   password bound to the target access point account, the wireless connection to the
   access point to which the target access point account belongs may be implemented by
   performing the following steps:
10 [0121]      Step (Al): The terminal device sends, according to the target access point
   account, a wireless connection request to the access point to which the target access
   point account belongs, where the wireless connection request includes the access
   password bound to the target access point account.
   [0122]      Step (B1): The terminal device receives a wireless connection success
15 response that is sent after the access point to which the target access point account
   belongs verifies that the access password bound to the target access point account is
   correct.
   [0123]      In this embodiment of the present invention, when the target access point
   account is a WIFI access point account, the terminal device may enable a WIFI
20 module (if the WIFI module has been enabled, the WIFI module does not need to be
   enabled again) to send the wireless connection request to the access point to which the
   target access point account belongs, where the wireless connection request includes
   the access password bound to the target access point account.
   [0124]      In this embodiment of the present invention, when the target access point
25 account is a Bluetooth access point account, the terminal device may enable a
   Bluetooth module (if the Bluetooth module has been enabled, the Bluetooth module
   does not need to be enabled again) to send the wireless connection request to the
   access point to which the target access point account belongs, where the wireless
   connection request includes the access password bound to the target access point
30 account.
   [0125]      In this embodiment of the present invention, the access point to which the
   target access point account belongs may verify whether the access password bound to
   the target access point account is the same as a locally set access password; and if the
   access password bound to the target access point account is the same as the locally set
                                              23

   access password, verify that the access password bound to the target access point
   account is correct, and in this case, the access point to which the target access point
   account belongs may send a wireless connection success response to the terminal
   device; or if the access password bound to the target access point account is different
 5 from the locally set access password, verify that the access password bound to the
   target access point account is wrong, and in this case, the access point to which the
   target access point account belongs may send a wireless connection failure response
   to the terminal device.
   [0126]      In this embodiment of the present invention, when the target access point
10 account is a WIFI access point account, the terminal device may receive, by using the
   WIFI module, the wireless connection success response that is sent after the access
   point to which the target access point account belongs verifies that the access
   password bound to the target access point account is correct.
   [0127]      In this embodiment of the present invention, when the target access point
15 account is a Bluetooth access point account, the terminal device may receive, by using
   the Bluetooth module, the wireless connection success response that is sent after the
   access point to which the target access point account belongs verifies that the access
   password bound to the target access point account is correct.
   [0128]      In this embodiment of the present invention, in step 202, that the terminal
20 device establishes, according to the target access point account and the access
   password bound to the target access point account, the wireless connection to the
   access point to which the target access point account belongs may also be
   implemented by performing the following steps:
   [0129]      Step (A2): The terminal device sends, according to the target access point
25 account, a wireless connection request to the access point to which the target access
   point account belongs.
   [0130]      Step (B2): The terminal device receives prompt information sent by the
   access point to which the target access point account belongs, where the prompt
   information is used to prompt sending of the access password bound to the target
30 access point account.
   [0131]      Step (C2): The terminal device sends the access password bound to the
   target access point account to the access point to which the target access point account
   belongs.
   [0132]      Step (D4): The terminal device receives a wireless connection success
                                              24

   response that is sent after the access point to which the target access point account
   belongs verifies that the access password bound to the target access point account is
   correct.
   [0133]       Based on the foregoing step 201, after the terminal device acquires one
 5 target access point account according to the read access point account, the present
   invention may also be implemented with reference to the foregoing steps (A2) to (D4),
   which is not limited in this embodiment of the present invention. When the present
   invention is implemented with reference to the foregoing steps (A2) to (D4), an
   existing wireless access process may be used.
10 [0134]       In the method described in FIG. 2, operations such as manually enabling
   access point search and manually entering a password by a user can be avoided, so
   that efficiency in accessing an access point can be effectively improved.
   [0135]       Referring to FIG. 3, FIG. 3 is a schematic flowchart of another wireless
   access method according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the wireless
15 access method shown in FIG. 3, it is assumed that an external NFC tag stores only one
   piece of WIFI access point information, where the WIFI access point information
   includes a WIFI access point account and an access password bound to the WIFI
   access point account. A wireless access process is the same when the NFC tag stores
   only one piece of Bluetooth access point information (including a Bluetooth access
20 point account and an access password bound to the Bluetooth access point account),
   which is not repeated in this embodiment of the present invention.
   [0136]       In the wireless access method shown in FIG. 3, one WIFI access point
   account and an access password bound to the WIFI access point account may be
   written into the external NFC tag in advance, and the NFC tag may be attached at a
25 fixed location.
   [0137]       In this embodiment of the present invention, a management user of a WIFI
   access point may write one WIFI access point account and an access password bound
   to the WIFI access point account into the external NFC tag. For example, the
   management user of the WIFI access point may access an NFC application of a
30 smartphone, and after manually entering one WIFI access point account and an access
   password bound to the WIFI access point account into the NFC application, make the
   smartphone approach the external NFC tag, so as to write the one WIFI access point
   account and the access password bound to the WIFI access point account into the
   external NFC tag. Alternatively, the management user of the WIFI access point may
                                              25

   access an NFC application of a smartphone, call, from the NFC application, one WIFI
   access point account and an access password bound to the WIFI access point account
   that have been stored in the smartphone, and then make the smartphone approach the
   external NFC tag, so as to write the one WIFI access point account and the access
 5 password bound to the WIFI access point account into the external NFC tag.
   [0138]      For example, the NFC tag may be attached at a fixed location in public
   places such as an airport, a mall, and a station, or the NFC tag may be attached at a
   fixed location in a house.
   [0139]      As shown in FIG. 3, the wireless access method may include the following
10 steps:
   [0140]      301. Enable an NFC module of a terminal device.
   [0141]      302. Hold the terminal device to approach an external NFC tag, so that the
   terminal device reads one WIFI access point account and an access password bound
   to the WIFI access point account that are stored in the external NFC tag.
15 [0142]      In this embodiment of the present invention, a user may hold the terminal
   device to approach the external NFC tag, so that the terminal device may read, by
   using the NCF module of the terminal device, the one WIFI access point account and
   the access password bound to the WIFI access point account that are stored in the
   external NFC tag.
20 [0143]      303. The terminal device stores the one WIFI access point account and the
   access password bound to the WIFI access point account that are read.
   [0144]      304. The terminal device uses the read one WIFI access point account as a
   target access point account, and sends, according to the target access point account, a
   wireless connection request to a WIFI access point to which the target access point
25 account belongs, where the wireless connection request includes an access password
   bound to the target access point account.
   [0145]      In this embodiment of the present invention, the terminal device may send,
   by using a WIFI module, the wireless connection request to the WIFI access point to
   which the target access point account belongs, where the wireless connection request
30 includes the access password bound to the target access point account.
   [0146]      305. The terminal device receives a wireless connection success response
   that is sent after the WIFI access point to which the target access point account
   belongs verifies that the access password bound to the target access point account is
   correct, and successfully connects to the WIFI access point.
                                              26

   [01471      306. The terminal device determines whether a storage time of the WIFI
   access point account and the access password bound to the WIFI access point account
   exceeds a preset threshold (for example, two hours); and if the storage time exceeds
   the preset threshold, deletes the WIFI access point account and the access password
 5 bound to the WIFI access point account that are stored.
   [0148]      If the storage time does not exceed the preset threshold, the terminal
   device does not need to delete the WIFI access point account and the access password
   bound to the WIFI access point account that are stored.
   [0149]      In an implementation manner, alternatively, the terminal device may detect
10 whether a wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is received; and if the
   wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is received, delete the WIFI
   access point account and the access password bound to the WIFI access point account
   that are stored; or if the wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is not
   received, does not need to delete the WIFI access point account and the access
15 password bound to the WIFI access point account that are stored.
   [0150]      In the method described in FIG. 3, a terminal device can not only complete
   automatic access to a WIFI access point, but also avoid operations of manually
   enabling access point search and manually entering a password by a user, so that
   efficiency in accessing the WIFI access point can be effectively improved.
20 [0151]      Referring to FIG. 4, FIG. 4 is a schematic flowchart of another wireless
   access method according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the wireless
   access method shown in FIG. 4, it is assumed that an NFC tag stores only multiple
   pieces of WIFI access point information, where each piece of WIFI access point
   information includes a WIFI access point account and an access password bound to
25 the WIFI access point account. A wireless access process is the same when the NFC
   tag stores multiple pieces of Bluetooth access point information (that is, each piece of
   Bluetooth access point information includes a Bluetooth access point account and an
   access password bound to the Bluetooth access point account) or when the NFC tag
   stores some pieces of Bluetooth access point information and some pieces of WIFI
30 access point information, which is not repeated in this embodiment of the present
   invention.
   [0152]      In the wireless access method shown in FIG. 4, multiple WIFI access point
   accounts and access passwords bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts may
   be written into an external NFC tag in advance, and the NFC tag may be attached at a
                                              27

   fixed location.
   [0153]      In this embodiment of the present invention, a management user of a WIFI
   access point may write multiple WIFI access point accounts and access passwords
   bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts into the external NFC tag. For
 5 example, the management user of the WIFI access point may access an NFC
   application of a smartphone, and after manually entering multiple WIFI access point
   accounts and access passwords bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts into
   the NFC application, make the smartphone approach the external NFC tag, so as to
   write the multiple WIFI access point accounts and the access passwords bound to the
10 multiple WIFI access point accounts into the external NFC tag. Alternatively, the
   management user of the WIFI access point may access an NFC application of a
   smartphone, call, from the NFC application, multiple WIFI access point accounts and
   access passwords bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts that have been
   stored in the smartphone, and then make the smartphone approach the external NFC
15 tag, so as to write the multiple WIFI access point accounts and the access passwords
   bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts into the external NFC tag.
   [0154]      For example, the NFC tag may be attached at a fixed location in public
   places such as an airport, a mall, and a station, or the NFC tag may be attached at a
   fixed location (for example, a wall) in a house.
20 [0155]      As shown in FIG. 4, the wireless access method may include the following
   steps:
   [0156]      401. Enable an NFC module of a terminal device.
   [0157]      402. Hold the terminal device to approach an external NFC tag, so that the
   terminal device reads multiple WIFI access point accounts and access passwords
25 bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts that are stored in the external NFC
   tag.
   [0158]      In this embodiment of the present invention, a user may hold the terminal
   device to approach the external NFC tag, so that the terminal device may read, by
   using the NCF module of the terminal device, the multiple WIFI access point
30 accounts and the access passwords bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts
   that are stored in the external NFC tag.
   [0159]      403. The terminal device stores the multiple WIFI access point accounts
   and the access passwords bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts that are
   read.
                                               28

   [0160]       404. The terminal device detects a signal strength value of a WIFI access
   point to which each of the read WIFI access point accounts belongs.
   [0161]       The signal strength value of the WIFI access point is generally represented
   in units of dB.
 5 [0162]       405. The terminal device selects a WIFI access point account of a WIFI
   access point whose signal strength value is the largest as a target access point account,
   and sends, according to the target access point account, a wireless connection request
   to the WIFI access point to which the target access point account belongs, where the
   wireless connection request includes an access password bound to the target access
10 point account.
   [0163]       For example, it is assumed that in step 404, the terminal device detects that
   a signal strength value of a WIFI access point to which a WIFI access point account
   TP-LINK1 belongs is -70 dB, a signal strength value of a WIFI access point to which
   a WIFI access point account TP-LINK2 belongs is -60 dB, and a signal strength value
15 of a WIFI access point to which a WIFI access point account TP-LINK3 belongs is
   -50 dB; in step 405, the terminal device may select the WIFI access point account
   TP-LINK1 of the WIFI access point whose signal strength value is the largest as the
   target access point account.
   [0164]       In this embodiment of the present invention, by performing step 404 and
20 step 405, the terminal device can automatically select, in the background, the WIFI
   access point account of the WIFI access point whose signal strength value is the
   largest as the target access point account.
   [0165]       In this embodiment of the present invention, the terminal device may send,
   by using a WIFI module, the wireless connection request to the WIFI access point to
25 which the target access point account belongs, where the wireless connection request
   includes the access password bound to the target access point account.
   [0166]       406. The terminal device receives a wireless connection success response
   that is sent after the WIFI access point to which the target access point account
   belongs verifies that the access password bound to the target access point account is
30 correct, and successfully connects to the WIFI access point.
   [0167]       407. The terminal device determines whether a storage time of the WIFI
   access point accounts and the access passwords bound to the WIFI access point
   accounts exceeds a preset threshold (for example, two hours); and if the storage time
   exceeds the preset threshold, deletes the WIFI access point accounts and the access
                                               29

   passwords bound to the WIFI access point accounts that are stored.
   [0168]      If the storage time does not exceed the preset threshold, the terminal
   device does not need to delete the WIFI access point accounts and the access
   passwords bound to the WIFI access point accounts that are stored.
 5 [0169]      In an implementation manner, alternatively, the terminal device may detect
   whether a wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is received; and if the
   wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is received, delete the WIFI
   access point accounts and the access passwords bound to the WIFI access point
   accounts that are stored; or if the wireless disconnection instruction entered by the
10 user is not received, does not need to delete the WIFI access point accounts and the
   access passwords bound to the WIFI access point accounts that are stored.
   [0170]      In the method described in FIG. 4, a terminal device can not only complete
   automatic access to a WIFI access point, but also avoid operations of manually
   enabling access point search and manually entering a password by a user, so that
15 efficiency in accessing the WIFI access point can be effectively improved.
   [0171]      Referring to FIG. 5, FIG. 5 is a schematic flowchart of another wireless
   access method according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the wireless
   access method shown in FIG. 5, it is assumed that an NFC tag stores only multiple
   pieces of WIFI access point information, where each piece of WIFI access point
20 information includes a WIFI access point account and an access password bound to
   the WIFI access point account. A wireless access process is the same when the NFC
   tag stores multiple pieces of Bluetooth access point information (that is, each piece of
   Bluetooth access point information includes a Bluetooth access point account and an
   access password bound to the Bluetooth access point account) or when the NFC tag
25 stores some pieces of Bluetooth access point information and some pieces of WIFI
   access point information, which is not repeated in this embodiment of the present
   invention.
   [0172]      In the wireless access method shown in FIG. 5, multiple WIFI access point
   accounts and access passwords bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts may
30 be written into an external NFC tag in advance, and the NFC tag may be attached at a
   fixed location.
   [0173]      As shown in FIG. 5, the wireless access method may include the following
   steps:
   [0174]      501. Enable an NFC module of a terminal device.
                                              30

   [0175]      502. Hold the terminal device to approach an external NFC tag, so that the
   terminal device reads multiple WIFI access point accounts and access passwords
   bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts that are stored in the external NFC
   tag.
 5 [0176]      In this embodiment of the present invention, a user may hold the terminal
   device to approach the external NFC tag, so that the terminal device may read, by
   using the NCF module of the terminal device, the multiple WIFI access point
   accounts and the access passwords bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts
   that are stored in the external NFC tag.
10 [0177]      503. The terminal device stores the multiple WIFI access point accounts
   and the access passwords bound to the multiple WIFI access point accounts that are
   read.
   [0178]      504. The terminal device detects a signal strength value of a WIFI access
   point to which each of the read WIFI access point accounts belongs.
15 [0179]      505. The terminal device outputs each of the read WIFI access point
   accounts and the signal strength value of the WIFI access point to which the WIFI
   access point account belongs.
   [0180]      506. The terminal device detects any WIFI access point account that is
   selected by a user according to the signal strength value from the output WIFI access
20 point accounts, uses the WIFI access point account as a target access point account,
   and sends, according to the target access point account, a wireless connection request
   to a WIFI access point to which the target access point account belongs, where the
   wireless connection request includes an access password bound to the target access
   point account.
25 [0181]      For example, it is assumed that in step 504, the terminal device detects that
   a signal strength value of a WIFI access point to which a WIFI access point account
   TP-LINK1 belongs is -70 dB, a signal strength value of a WIFI access point to which
   a WIFI access point account TP-LINK2 belongs is -60 dB, and a signal strength value
   of a WIFI access point to which a WIFI access point account TP-LINK3 belongs is
30 -50 dB; in step 505, the terminal device may output each of the WIFI access point
   accounts and a signal strength value of a WIFI access point to which the WIFI access
   point account belongs, as shown in FIG. 6. Correspondingly, in step 506, the terminal
   device may detect any WIFI access point account that is selected by the user
   according to the signal strength value shown in FIG. 6 from the WIFI access point
                                              31

   accounts output by the terminal device, and use the WIFI access point account as the
   target access point account. For example, the terminal device may detect the WIFI
   access point account TP-LINK2 that is selected by the user according to the signal
   strength value -60 dB shown in FIG. 6 from the WIFI access point accounts output by
 5 the terminal device, and use the WIFI access point account TP-LINK2 as the target
   access point account.
   [0182]      In this embodiment of the present invention, by performing steps 504 to
   506, the user can select a desirable WIFI access point account as the target access
   point account.
10 [0183]      In an embodiment, alternatively, the user may not consider a selection
   basis of a signal strength value, and may select any WIFI access point account from
   the WIFI access point accounts output by the terminal device. Correspondingly, in
   step 506, the terminal device may detect any WIFI access point account that is
   selected by the user from the WIFI access point accounts output by the terminal
15 device, and use the WIFI access point account as the target access point account.
   [0184]      In this embodiment of the present invention, a purpose of outputting, by
   the terminal device, the signal strength value of the WIFI access point to which the
   WIFI access point account belongs is to provide a selection basis for the user to select
   a WIFI access point account. Certainly, the user may ignore such a selection basis and
20 may directly select any WIFI access point account (that is, a WIFI access point name).
   [0185]      In this embodiment of the present invention, the terminal device may send,
   by using a WIFI module, the wireless connection request to the WIFI access point to
   which the target access point account belongs, where the wireless connection request
   includes the access password bound to the target access point account.
25 [0186]      507. The terminal device receives a wireless connection success response
   that is sent after the WIFI access point to which the target access point account
   belongs verifies that the access password bound to the target access point account is
   correct, and successfully connects to the WIFI access point.
   [0187]      508. The terminal device determines whether a storage time of the WIFI
30 access point accounts and the access passwords bound to the WIFI access point
   accounts exceeds a preset threshold (for example, two hours); and if the storage time
   exceeds the preset threshold, deletes the WIFI access point accounts and the access
   passwords bound to the WIFI access point accounts that are stored.
   [0188]      In an implementation manner, alternatively, the terminal device may detect
                                              32

   whether a wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is received; and if the
   wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is received, delete the WIFI
   access point accounts and the access passwords bound to the WIFI access point
   accounts that are stored.
 5 [0189]      In the method described in FIG. 5, a terminal device can not only complete
   automatic access to a WIFI access point, but also avoid operations of manually
   enabling access point search and manually entering a password by a user, so that
   efficiency in accessing the WIFI access point can be effectively improved.
   [0190]      Referring to FIG. 7, FIG. 7 is a schematic flowchart of another wireless
10 access method according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the wireless
   access method shown in FIG. 7, it is assumed that an NFC tag stores only multiple
   pieces of WIFI access point information, where each piece of WIFI access point
   information includes only a WIFI access point account. In the wireless access method
   shown in FIG. 7, multiple WIFI access point accounts may be written into an external
15 NFC tag in advance, and the NFC tag may be attached at a fixed location.
   [0191]      As shown in FIG. 7, the wireless access method may include the following
   steps:
   [0192]      701. Enable an external NFC module of a terminal device.
   [0193]      702. Hold the terminal device to approach an external NFC tag, so that the
20 terminal device reads multiple WIFI access point accounts stored in the external NFC
   tag.
   [0194]      In this embodiment of the present invention, a user may hold the terminal
   device to approach the external NFC tag, so that the terminal device may read, by
   using the NCF module of the terminal device, the multiple WIFI access point
25 accounts stored in the external NFC tag.
   [0195]      703. The terminal device stores the multiple read WIFI access point
   accounts.
   [0196]      704. The terminal device detects a signal strength value of a WIFI access
   point to which each of the read WIFI access point accounts belongs.
30 [0197]      705. The terminal device outputs each of the read WIFI access point
   accounts and the signal strength value of the WIFI access point to which each of the
   read WIFI access point accounts belongs.
   [0198]      706. The terminal device detects any WIFI access point account that is
   selected by a user according to the signal strength value from the output WIFI access
                                              33

   point accounts, uses the WIFI access point account as a target access point account,
   and sends, according to the target access point account, a wireless connection request
   to a WIFI access point to which the target access point account belongs.
   [0199]      In this embodiment of the present invention, by performing steps 704 to
 5 706, the user can select a desirable WIFI access point account as the target access
   point account.
   [0200]      In an embodiment, alternatively, the user may not consider a selection
   basis of a signal strength value, and may select any WIFI access point account from
   the WIFI access point accounts output by the terminal device. Correspondingly, in
10 step 706, the terminal device may detect any WIFI access point account that is
   selected by the user from the WIFI access point accounts output by the terminal
   device, and use the WIFI access point account as the target access point account.
   [0201]      In this embodiment of the present invention, the terminal device may send,
   by using a WIFI module, the wireless connection request to the WIFI access point to
15 which the target access point account belongs, where the wireless connection request
   includes an access password bound to the target access point account.
   [0202]      707. The terminal device receives a wireless connection success response
   that is sent after the WIFI access point to which the target access point account
   belongs verifies a target access point, and successfully connects to the WIFI access
20 point.
   [0203]      708. The terminal device determines whether a storage time of the WIFI
   access point accounts exceeds a preset threshold (for example, two hours); and if the
   storage time exceeds the preset threshold, deletes the WIFI access point accounts and
   access passwords bound to the WIFI access point accounts that are stored.
25 [0204]      In an implementation manner, alternatively, the terminal device may detect
   whether a wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is received; and if the
   wireless disconnection instruction entered by the user is received, delete the stored
   WIFI access point accounts.
   [0205]      In the method described in FIG. 7, a terminal device can not only complete
30 automatic access to a WIFI access point, but also avoid operations of manually
   enabling access point search and manually entering a password by a user, so that
   efficiency in accessing the WIFI access point can be effectively improved.
   [0206]      Referring to FIG. 8, FIG. 8 is a schematic structural diagram of a terminal
   device according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 8, the
                                               34

   terminal device may include:
               a reading module 801, configured to read access point information stored
   in an external NFC tag;

   the reading module 801 may be implemented by an NFC module; in physical
   implementation, the main control module 802 may be implemented by hardware such
   as a processor or a CPU; and in physical implementation, the radio frequency module
15 803 may be implemented by hardware such as a communication unit.

   operations of manually enabling access point search and manually entering a
   password by a user, so that efficiency in accessing the access point can be effectively
20 improved.

                                              35

   module 806; and
               the first control module 806, configured to delete the access point
   information stored by the storage module 805.
   [0212]      That is, after the processing module 805 is enabled, the first control
 5 module 806 may delete the access point information stored by the storage module 805.
   However, when the processing module 805 determines that the storage time for
   storing the access point information by the storage module 804 does not exceed the
   preset threshold, the processing module 805 does not need to enable the first control
   module 806, and the first control module 806 does not need to delete the access point
10 information stored by the storage module 805 either.
   [0213]      In this embodiment of the present invention, in physical implementation,

   [0215]      That is, after the third detection module 807 is enabled, the second control
   module 808 may delete the access point information stored by the storage module 805.
   However, when the third detection module 807 detects that the wireless disconnection
25 instruction entered by the user is not received, the third detection module 807 does not
   need to enable the second control module 808, and the second control module 808
   does not need to delete the access point information stored by the storage module 805
   either.
   [0216]      In this embodiment of the present invention, in physical implementation,
30 the third detection module 807 may be implemented by hardware such as a detector or
   a sensor, and in physical implementation, the second control module 808 may be
