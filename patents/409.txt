                                                Module for Connecting a Mast to a Board
   Field of the Invention
   The invention relates to a connection module which attaches to a mast that carries a motor
 5 particularly but not exclusively a hydrofoil motor used to power a board.
   Background
   A recent development in surfboard technology is the attachment of a hydrofoil motor to a
   surfboard. The hydrofoil motor includes an electric motor with an integrated hydrofoil. The
10 hydrofoil motor elevates the board clear of the water when under power to reduce drag and
   provide high speed travel over the water. The hydrofoil motor is positioned at a lower end of a
   mast while an upper end of the mast is bolted to an underside of the board.
   A housing is fixed into a top side of the board to accommodate batteries. The housing has
15 waterproof glands that allow multiple external wires to connect to the batteries and circuitry
   within the housing. The wires pass through a hole in the board and internally down the mast in
   order to connect to the electric motor.
   Summary of the Invention
20 In one aspect, the invention provides a module configured for removable attachment to a board
   and attached to an end of a mast, the mast supporting a hydrofoil and a motor to drive the
   board, the module including: an external lead to connect to a power source; internal control
   circuitry; and a thermal bridge to thermally connect the control circuitry to the mast.
25 In one embodiment, the module includes fittings to fix the mast to the board.
   In one embodiment, the fittings include lateral flanges with apertures to receive fasteners that
   screw fix the module to the board.
30 In another aspect, there is provided a mast with a motor coupled to a lower end and the above
   described module fitted to an upper end.

   In another aspect, there is provided a board with a mounting section including a frame that
   defines a through hole from an underside of the board to a connection bay and the above
   described module, wherein the module is fixed relative to the frame so that the module
   projects into the bay for the external lead to connect to a power source.

   In one embodiment, the frame is an insert fixed into the board, the insert having attachments
   holes configured to match fittings on the module.
   In one embodiment, the board includes a compartment for a power source and a below deck
10 space between the compartment and the bay for connection between the power source and the
   external lead of the module.
   In one embodiment, the board includes a tray embedded in a body of the board, the tray being
   an integral unit which defines the bay, compartment and connecting space.

   Detailed Description
   A hydrofoil motor 1 is shown in Figure 1 at a lower end 2 of a mast 3. The hydrofoil motor 1
30 includes an electric motor 5 with a propeller 6 and an integral front and rear hydrofoil 7, 8.

                                                 -3
   A module 10 is attached to an upper end 11 of the mast 3. The module 10 includes a housing
   12 and an attachment plate 13 which has fittings 14 in the form of lateral flanges 15 with
   apertures 16.
 5 Figure 2 shows a frame 17 with a through hole 18. The hole 18 is bordered by a lip 19
   adjacent a channel 20 that extends around a periphery of the hole 18. Rebates 21 are formed in
   a face 22 of the frame 17. The rebates 21 are configured to match the flanges 15 of the module
   10 shown in Figure 1. Attachment holes 23 are positioned to receive fasteners 24 that, in use,
   fix the module 10 to the frame 17.
10
   With reference to Figure 3, the mast 3 and module 10 are shown connected into a tray 25. The
   tray 25 has a compartment 26 and a connection bay 27. A top 28 of the module 10 projects
   into the connection bay 27 when the mast 3 is assembled into the tray 25.
15 Figure 4 illustrates the tray 25 embedded in a body 29 of a board 30. A power source 31 is
   shown in the form of a battery 32 housed in the compartment 26. A space 33 is provided
   between the bay 27 and the compartment 26, below a deck 34 of the board 30, to allow an
   external lead 35 of the module 10 to connect with the power source 31. In an alternative
   arrangement, the tray 25 may be dispensed with and the compartment 26 and bay 27 can
20 instead be formed or moulded directly into the body 29 of the board 30.
   The tray 25 includes an opening 36 which receives the frame 17, which is in the form of an
   insert 37 which is either moulded into the board 30 or press-fit into the opening 36.
   Alternatively, the frame 17 may be integrally formed with the tray 25.
25
   The through hole 18 in the frame 17 allows the top 28 of the module 10 to project into the bay
   27 to enable the lead 35 to electrically connect with the battery 32.
   In order to assemble the module 10, a block 39 with control circuitry is mounted to a base 40
30 of the attachment plate 13 which acts as a thermal bridge 41 to dissipate heat into the mast 3.
   A seal 42 is then positioned between the base 40 and the housing 12 which are fastened

   Documntm2-28I 2017
                                                   -4
   together at corners 43 by screws (not shown) or other suitable fasteners.
   A gasket 44 is inserted into the channel 20 in the frame 17. The fittings 14 are then aligned
   with the rebates 17 in the face 22 of the frame 17 and fasteners (not shown) are used to
 5 connect the frame 17 and module 10 together.
   The module 10 and mast 3 thereby form an integral unit 50 that is effectively plugged into the
   board 30 and fixed in place. Instead of attaching directly to the frame 17, the module 10 and
   mast 3 can instead be fixed directly to an underside 45 of the board 30 using appropriate bolts
10 or the like.
   In any case, the module 10 accommodates control circuitry that can be used to either modulate
   motor speed and/or control the hydrofoils 7, 8 to adjust the aspect of the board 30. The control
   circuitry generates heat which can be readily dissipated into the water via the mast 3, which is
15 preferably formed of a high heat transmissive material such as aluminium.
   Since the control circuitry is contained within the module 10 fitted directly to the upper end 11
   of the mast 3, the only wired connection outside of the module 10 is to the power source via
   the single external lead. As such, there is no requirement for the multiple wires of the prior art
20 boards.
   The invention has been described with reference to a board specifically in the context of a
   surfboard with a mast mounted motor. However, reference to 'board' should be taken as a
   reference to any form or water craft.
25
   As may be appreciated, many modifications and variations may be made without departing
   from the spirit and scope of the invention described. For example, the module can be
   connected to a mast with a motor other than a hydrofoil motor and the motor itself need not be
   an electric motor driving a propeller but could instead be a jet nozzle, turbine or the like.
