     filed July 19, 2012, which is incorporated by reference herein.
                                                   FIELD
              This invention relates to a butyrophilin-like protein and fragments, variants, and
 10  derivatives thereof, nucleic acids encoding such proteins, antibodies that bind to these
    proteins, and agonists and antagonists of these proteins. Pharmaceutical compositions

15                                             BACKGROUND
              Modulation of an immune or inflammatory response may be valuable in various
    therapeutic settings. Downmodulation of an immune or inflammatory response may be
    desirable in treatments for various kinds of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.
    Enhancement of any immune response may be valuable to, for example, amplify a response to
20  a particular antigen, such as an antigen contained in a vaccine and/or an antigen preferentially
    expressed on a cancer cell, a cell mediating a fibrotic disease, or a pathogen. Thus, molecules
    capable of modulating an immune or inflammatory response are potentially of therapeutic
    value in a variety of pathological settings. The present invention provides therapeutic agents
    to diagnose and treat diseases characterized by inappropriate, inadequate, and/or abnormal
25  inflammation and/or immune responses. Some of these agents can stimulate an immune
    response. Others can inhibit inflammation and/or immune responses.
                                                SUMMARY
             The invention provides BTNL3 proteins and variants thereof, nucleic acids encoding
30  them, and antibodies that bind to them. More specifically, the BTNL3 proteins described
    herein are inultimeric proteins and or fusion proteins that can be isolated and/or soluble
    proteins. BNTL3 proteins can be attached to a surface and/or expressed on the surface of a
    cell. Also provided are uses for BTNL3 proteins and for antagonists and agonists of BTNL3,
    including anti-BTNL3 antibodies.
35           In one embodiment, the invention encompasses an isolated multimeric BTNL3
    protein, optionally a soluble protein, or a BTNL3 protein attached to a surface such as a

 5                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
            The invention provides uses for BTNL3 proteins or antagonists or agonists of a
   BTNL3 protein, such as anti-BTNL3 antibodies and/or variant forms of a BTNL3 protein.
   The invention provides BTNL3 proteins, including multimers, fusion proteins, and variants
   thereof, and uses for such proteins, as well as nucleic acids encoding all of the above.
10 BTNL3 proteins can alter T cell function by attenuating T cell activation, proliferation, and
   cytokine production. Such effects can lead to effective treatments of T cell-mediated
   autoimmune or inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and fibrotic
   disorders, among a number of others. Antagonists of BTNL3 can function to prevent or
   antagonize BTNL3 from inhibition of T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine secretion,
15 thus, leading to an overall increase in T cell activation. Such effects can be useful for treating
   diseases such as cancer or for enhancing the efficacy of a vaccine. Further, agonists of
   BTNL3 may be able to alter immune cell function, for example, by clustering the BTNL3
   protein without blocking its function. Such agonists may mediate intracellular signaling into
   cells expressing BTNL3 via the B30.2 domain that may modulate the activity of such cells by,
20 for example, increasing or decreasing proliferation and/or cytokine secretion. Since BTNL3
   is expressed on neutrophils and some kinds of cancer cells, such intracellular signaling may
   modulate the course of diseases mediated by such cells.
                                               Definitions
25          The biological activity of a BTNL3 antagonist that can "antagonize the inhibition
   by a BTNL3 protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:7 of
   proliferation of a T cell stimulated by an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody" can be
   determined by doing a T cell proliferation assay as described in Example 4 and adding the
   antagonist to some of the samples in a controlled fashion so as to determine whether the
30 antagonist affects the activity of a BTNL3 protein comprising the amino acid sequence of
   SEQ ID NO:7. By a similar test, the activity of an agonistic antibody that increases the
   inhibition of T cell proliferation by T cells can be assayed.
            An "antibody," as meant herein, comprises a heavy chain variable region of an
   immunoglobulin and/or a light chain variable region of an immunoglobulin. An antibody
35 may be a full length, tetrameric antibody comprising a light chain variable region (VL), a light
   chain constant region (CL), a heavy chain variable region (VH), a first heavy chain constant
   region (CH1), a hinge region, a second heavy chain constant region (CH2), and a third heavy
                                                    16

   WO 2014/015148                                                                    PCT/US2013/051097
   chain constant region (CH3), such as an IgG, IgA, IgD, IgM, or IgE antibody. Alternatively,
   an antibody can be a fragment such as a Fab fragment or, optionally, a recombinant fragment,
   such as an scFv fragment. Single domain antibodies comprising a single variable region,
   either a VH or VL region, are also antibodies as meant herein. Single domain antibodies are
 5 described in US Patent Appln. Publication US 2006/0062784, the portions of which describe
   single domain antibodies are hereby incorporated by reference. Further, various forms of
   monovalent (including single chain antibodies such as scFvs, Fabs, scFv-Fcs, domain
   antibodies, and various formats described, for example, in International Application WO
   2009/089004 and US Patent 5,837,821, the descriptive portions of which are incorporated
10 herein by reference) and multivalent molecules (such as F(ab) 2's and those described, for
   example, in International Application WO 2009/089004 and US Patent 5,837821, the
   descriptive portions of which are incorporated herein by reference) are encompassed within
   the meaning of "antibody."
            It is said in multiple places herein that a multimeric species of a protein has a
15 molecular weight "at least about" two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
   twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen times that of a monomeric species of the protein.
   While the meaning of this is plain, this phrase is specifically meant to include species that are
   about four, five, six, etc. times larger than a monomer and not only combinations of such
   species with larger species or only larger species. Similarly, it is said in multiple places that a
20 multimer is "at least" a dimer, a trimer, a tetramer, etc. This phrase is specifically meant to
   include species that are dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc. and not only the combination of the
   stated species with larger species or only larger species. Further, it is said in multiple places
   herein that a multimeric species has a molecular weight that is "no more than" two, three,
   four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen
25 times that of a monomeric species of the protein. While the meaning of this is plain, this
   phrase is specifically meant to include species that are about four, five, six, etc. times larger
   than a monomer and not only combinations of such species with smaller species or only
   smaller species. Similarly, it is said in multiple places that a multimer is "no more than" a
   dimer, a trimer, a tetramer, etc. This phrase is specifically meant to include species that are
30 dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc. and not only the combination of the stated species with smaller
   species or only smaller species.
            "BTNL3 proteins," as meant herein, includes full length human, BTNL3 proteins
   and fragments and/or variants thereof, which includes proteins encoded by naturally
   occurring allelic variants of the BTNL3 gene, as well as recombinantly-produced BTNL3
35 proteins, that is, proteins produced in host cells such as non-human or mammalian host cells,
   which may contain some sequence changes relative to naturally-occurring BTNL3 proteins.
   Proteins comprising soluble fragments of a full length human BTNL3 protein that include
                                                      17

   WO 2014/015148                                                                    PCT/US2013/051097
   most or the entire extracellular region and do not include the transmembrane region are
   specifically contemplated. Such proteins can be attached to a surface such as a bead or a
   microtiter plate.
            A patient is receiving "concurrent" treatment with two or more molecules, which
 5 may be, for example, therapeutics or components of a vaccine, when the patient receives the
   two or more molecules during the same general timeframe, optionally at the very same time.
   For example, if a patient were dosed with one molecule daily on an ongoing basis and were
   also dosed with another molecule once a month on an ongoing basis, the patient would be
   receiving these two molecules concurrently. Similarly, a patient dosed with two different
10 molecules, each administered every two weeks, but not on the same day, would be receiving
   concurrent treatment with the two molecules. Further, a patient receiving one molecule on an
   ongoing basis once per week and another molecule once per day for only three days would be
   receiving concurrent treatment for a short period of time with these two molecule.
            A "scFv" is a single chain antibody comprising a heavy chain variable region (VH)
15 and a light chain variable region (VL) and not comprising a constant region of an antibody. In
   some embodiments scFv's can also comprise a linker of variable length between the heavy
   and light chain variable regions. Although an scFv can be fused to other amino acid
   sequences, the portion of a protein referred to as an scFv preferably does not comprise any
   substantial amount of amino acid sequence other than a VH region, a VL region, and,
20 optionally, a linker joining these sequences.
            An "Fc polypeptide," as meant herein, is a fragment of an antibody heavy chain
   comprising a CH2 and a CH3 domain and all or part of a hinge region or a variant of such a
   fragment. An Fc polypeptide does not comprise a CH1 domain or a VH domain. See e.g.
   Kuby, Immunology, Second Edition, p. 1 10-11, W.H. Freeman and Co., New York (1994).
25 An Fc polypeptide can be of the IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgA isotype, including IgG1, IgG2,
   IgG3, IgG4 or other subtypes. An Fc polypeptide can be multimeric, in some cases dimeric.
   Such multimeric Fc polypeptides are referred to herein as "Fc regions." Some Fc
   polypeptides, for example an IgM or IgA Fc polypeptides, can form higher order multimers.
   A single polypeptide chain within a multimeric Fc region is referred to as an "Fc
30 polypeptide." Variants of Fc polypeptides, as meant herein, may comprise from 1 to 30
   (including specifically, no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.) insertions, deletions, or
   substitutions of a single amino acid relative to a naturally-occurring Fc polypeptide. A
   naturally occurring or "native" Fc polypeptide has a sequence that occurs in nature in a living
   organism, for example, a human or a mouse Fc polypeptide. Thus, a "native human" Fc
35 polypeptide has an amino acid sequence that is found in a naturally occurring human Fc
   polypeptide. Guidance as to where variations can tolerated without affecting function can be
   found in the art. For example, alterations of amino acid residues identified in US Patent
                                                   18

   WO 2014/015148                                                                 PCT/US2013/051097
   5,807,706 and International Application WO 2009/089004, the relevant portions of which are
   incorporated herein by reference, may be used to encourage heterodimer formation as
   compared to homodimer formation. Similarly, alterations to the Fc polypeptide that do not
   prevent binding of the neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn, are encompassed within the alterations that
 5 can occur in Fc variants as meant herein. Binding of an Fc polypeptide to FcRn can be
   ascertained at about pH 6 using a Biacore instrument, such as a Biacore 3000.       Human FcRn
   can be coupled to a CM5 chip using standard chemistry. The Fc-containing protein can be
   part of the mobile phase, and the response can be measured in resonance units. Alterations of
   Fc polypeptides are described in, for example, International Patent Application Publication
10 WO 97/34631, the relevant portions of which are incorporated herein by reference.
   Alternatively, comparisons of, for example, IgG sequences within and between species can
   locate highly conserved amino acids, which would suggest to one of skill in the art that
   alteration of those amino acids may affect structure and/or function. Numerous alignments of
   sequences of hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions (which together form the Fc region) are available in,
15 for example, Kabat et al., Sequences of Immunological Interest, National Institutes of Health,
   Publication No. 91-3242, 1991, the relevant portions of which are incorporated herein by
   reference. On the other hand, amino acids which vary among various IgGs are sites at which
   variation is likely to be tolerated without effect on function. Similarly, Fc variants that have
   other desired properties, such as increased or decreased effector functions, including antibody
20 dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or C Iq binding, which leads to complement fixation, are
   encompassed within what is meant by Fc variants.
            The term "full length antibody" refers to a molecule similar in structure to most
   naturally-occurring antibodies, for example, an IgG antibody, that is, containing two entire
   heavy chains and two entire light chains. See e.g. Kabat et al., supra or Kuby, Immunology,
25 Second Edition, p.109-32, W.H. Freeman and Co., New York (1994) for discussion of the
   structure of naturally-occurring antibodies. The portions of these references describing the
   structure of full length antibodies are incorporated herein by reference. Also included among
   "full length antibodies" are antibodies similar in structure to the naturally-occurring
   dromedary antibodies that contain only two complete heavy chains (often with an unusually
30 long CDR3 region) and no light chains. Muldermans et al. (2001), J. Biotechnol. 74:277-302;
   Desmyter et al. (2001), J. Biol. Chem. 276:26285-26290. The portions of these references
   describing the structure of these dromedary antibodies are incorporated herein by reference.
            A "multimeric" protein, such as a multimeric BTNL3 protein, is a protein
   comprising more than one polypeptide chain. The term "multimer" encompasses terms such
35 as "dimer," "trimer," or "tetramer," which specify how many polypeptide chains the multimer
   contains. A "homomultimer" consists of two or more copies of the same polypeptide chain
   and does not contain any different polypeptide chains. Similarly, a "homodimer" consists of
                                                    19

   WO 2014/015148                                                                   PCT/US2013/051097
   two copies of the same polypeptide chain, a "homotrimer" consists of three copies of the
   same polypeptide chain, etc. A "heteromultimer" contains at least two different polypeptide
   chains. If the heteromultimer has three or more polypeptide chains, some of them can be
   identical to each other as long as at least one is different from the others. When a protein is
 5 said to be "at least a trimer," it is meant that it is a trimer or a higher order multimer.
   Similar meanings would be ascribed to "at least a tetramer," "at least a pentamer," etc.
   Similarly, a multimeric protein that is "no more than" a trimer is a trimer or a dimer.
            A "Fab fragment" is an antibody fragment comprising a light chain comprising a VL
   and CL region and a portion of a heavy chain comprising a VH and a CH region. A Fab
10 fragment does not comprise a CH2 or CH3 region. See e.g., Kuby, Immunology, Second
   Edition, pp. 1 10-11 W.H. Freeman and Co., New York (1994) for a discussion of what Fab
   fragments are. Different kinds of Fab fragments may contain either no hinge region, a portion
   of a hinge region, or an entire hinge region.
            An "scFv-Fc," as used herein, is a recombinant protein that is a fusion of an scFv
15 with an Fc polypeptide. See Li et al. (2000), CancerImmunol. Immunother. 49:243-252;
   Powers et al. (2001), J. Immunol. Methods 251:123-135; Gilliland et al. (1996), Tissue
   Antigens 47:1-20. An scFv-Fc can be dimeric.
            As meant herein, "non-reducing conditions" are conditions under which disulfide
   bridges within a protein will not be reduced such that the bridges will be destroyed.
20          A "recombinant" protein or antibody is one resulting from the process of genetic
   engineering. The term "genetic engineering" refers to a recombinant DNA or RNA method
   used to create a cell that expresses a gene at elevated levels or at lowered levels, or expresses
   a mutant form of the gene. In other words, the cell has been transfected, transformed or
   transduced with a recombinant polynucleotide molecule, and thereby altered so as to cause
25 the cell to alter expression of a desired polypeptide.
             Soluble secreted proteins and proteins expressed on the cell surface often comprise an
   N-terminal "signal sequence," which is a hydrophobic sequence that mediates insertion of
   the protein through the membrane bounding the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a eukaryotic
   cell. Type I transmembrane proteins also comprise signal sequences. "Signal sequences," as
30 meant herein are amino-terminal hydrophobic sequences which are usually enzymatically
   removed following the insertion of part or all of the protein through the ER membrane into
   the lumen of the ER. Thus, it is known in the art that a signal sequence can be present as part
   of a precursor form of a secreted or transmembrane protein, but will generally be absent from
   the mature form of the protein. When a protein is said to comprise a signal sequence, it is to
35 be understood that, although a precursor form of the protein does contain the signal sequence,
   a mature form of the protein will likely not contain the signal sequence. Signal sequences
   contain a residue adjacent to and immediately upstream from the cleavage site (position -1)
                                                    20

   WO 2014/015148                                                                 PCT/US2013/051097
   and another residue at position -3, which are important for this enzymatic cleavage. Nielsen
   et al. (1997), Protein Eng. 10(1):1-6; von Heijne (1983), Eur. J. Biochem. 133:17-21; von
   Heijne (1985), J. Mol. Biol. 184:99-105, the portions of which describe signal sequences and
   how to identify them are incorporated herein by reference. Signal sequences can be identified
 5 as described by Nielsen et al. (supra). Examples of signal peptides or sequences that are
   functional in mammalian host cells include the following: the signal sequence for
   interleukin-7 (IL-7) described in US Patent 4,965,195; the signal sequence for interleukin-2
   receptor described in Cosman et al. ((1984), Nature 312:768); the interleukin-4 receptor
   signal peptide described in EP Patent 0 367 566; the type I interleukin-1 receptor signal
10 sequence described in US Patent 4,968,607; the type II interleukin-1 receptor signal peptide
   described in EP Patent 0 460 846; the signal sequence of human IgK (which is
   METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTG; SEQ ID NO:3); and the signal sequence of human growth
   hormone (MATGSRTSLLLAFGLLCLPWLQEGSA;                      SEQ ID NO:4). The relevant portions
   of these references are incorporated herein by reference. Many other signal sequences are
15 known in the art.
             An "immunoglobulin-like" (Ig-like) domain, as meant herein, is distinguished
   mainly by its tertiary structure. See e.g. Bork et al. (1994), J. Mol. Biol. 242: 309-20;
   Hunkapiller and Hood (1989), Adv. Immunol. 44: 1-63; Williams and Barclay (1988), Ann.
   Rev. Immunol. 6: 381-405. However, variable and constant immunoglobulin-like domains do
20 contain a handful of highly conserved amino acids that occur at conserved positions within
   their primary amino acid sequence. See e.g. Kabat et al. (1991), Sequences of Proteins of
   Immunological Interest, U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service,
   National Institutes of Health, NIH Publication No. 91-3242. Such conserved amino acids in
   variable regions and in CH1 and CH2 constant regions are discussed in detail in, e.g., Harpaz
25 and Chothia (1994), J. Mol. Biol. 238: 528-39 and Williams and Barclay (1988), Ann. Rev.
   Immunol. 6: 381-405. The portions of these references that discuss such conserved residues
   are incorporated herein by reference. The presence of such highly conserved amino acids or
   conservative variants thereof occurring in the proper spacing can indicate the presence of an
   IgC-like or IgV-like domain.
30           The percent identity of two amino acid or two nucleic acid sequences can be

            In connection with comparisons to determine sequence identity of polynucleotides or
   polypeptides, what is meant by an "alignment window" is the portion of the polynucleotide
   or polypeptide that is matched, partially or wholly, with another polynucleotide or
   polypeptide by the computer program GAP (Devereux et al. (1984), Nucleic Acids Res. 12:
10 387-95) using the parameters stated herein. For example, when a polypeptide of 20 amino
   acids is aligned with a considerably longer protein and the first 10 amino acids match the
   longer protein exactly while the last 10 amino acids do not match the longer protein at all, the
   alignment window is 10 amino acids. If, on the other hand, the first and last amino acids of
   the 20 amino acid polypeptide match the longer protein, and eight other matches are scattered
15 between, the alignment window is 20 amino acids long. However, long stretches in either
   aligned strand without identical or conservatively substituted amino acids or identical
   nucleotides of at least, for example, 25 amino acids or 75 nucleotides constitute an endpoint
   of an alignment window, as meant herein. Alignment windows for a comparison of
   sequences can be at least about 25, 50, 60, 75, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 225, 300, 400, 450, 500,
20 or 600 amino acids or nucleotides in length.
            Two polypeptide or nucleotide sequences are considered "substantially similar"
   when they are at least 90% identical as determined using the GAP program as described
   above and have similar biological activity. In the case of a BTNL3 protein or variant thereof
   as described herein, the biological activity to be tested in determining whether two sequences
25 are substantially similar can be the ability to inhibit the proliferation of T cells activated by an
   immobilized anti-CD3 antibody or to antagonize such inhibition for certain antagonistic
   BTNL3 variant proteins.
                                          The BTNL Family
30          BTNL3 has been placed within the butyrophilin-like (BTNL) family of proteins based
   on its domain structure. See, e.g., Arnett et al. (2008), Current Immunology Reviews 4: 43
   52 and Arnett et al. (2009), Cytokine 46: 370-75. The human proteins in the BTNL family
   include BTNL2, BTNL3, BTNL8, BTNL9, ERMAP, and MOG, and the domain structures of
   these proteins are shown diagrammatically in Figure 1. As is apparent from Figure 1, BTNL2
35 is the only member of the family having four immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains in its
   extracellular region (two IgV-like and two IgC-like domains). MOG and ERMAP each have
   only one Ig-like domain. BTNL3, BTNL8, and BTNL9 also have one extracellular domain
                                                    22

   WO 2014/015148                                                               PCT/US2013/051097
   that is clearly an IgV-like or Ig-like domain and another domain with many characteristics
   similar to an Ig-like domain, although these domains are not actually classified as Ig-like. All
   BTNL family members have a transmembrane domain. BTNL2 and MOG have short
   intracellular regions, whereas BTNL3, BTNL8, BTNL9, and ERMAP have longer
 5 intracellular regions containing a B30.2 domain. The function of the intracellular B30.2 is
   unknown, although mutations in B30.2 domains of some proteins have been associated with
   certain diseases. See Henry et al. (1998), Mol. Biol. Evol. 15: 1696-1705, the relevant
   disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, binding partners for
   some B30.2 domains have been identified, specifically, a xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) that
10 binds to the BTN1A1 B30.2 domain.. See, e.g., Jeong et al. (2009), J. Biol. Chem. 284:
   22444-22456. As hypothesized by Jeong et al., the interaction of XOR and BTN1A1 may
   play a role in the innate immune system by generating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
   with antibacterial properties following engagement of BTN1A1 with receptors or bacterial
   surfaces. Id., at page 11. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species may also act on downstream
15 targets and regulate gene expression. Id. In addition, the B30.2 domain of BTN3A1 has been
   hypothesized to play a role in gamma delta T cell activation through its effects on the tertiary
   structure of the extracellular domains of BTN3A1. Palakodeti et al. (2012), J. Biol. Chem.
   287: 32780-32790. In addition, an agonistic anti-BTN3 antibody decreased proliferation and
   cytokine production by lymphocytes expressing BNT3, effects that were correlated with
20 phosphorylation of BTN3A. These results suggested that the observed effects on the
   lymphocytes were due to intracellular signaling, which might involve the B30.2 domain.

            The degree of sequence identity shared by human BTNL3 with the other human
   members of the BTNL family is shown in below.

   BTNL3             35%              74%            43%              41%            32%
   As shown in Figure 1, BTNL3, BTNL8, and BTNL9 have similar domain structures. The
   amino acid sequence of BTNL3 is much more similar to that of BTNL8 than to those of other
30 BTNL proteins.
            Beyond levels of sequence identity, certain sites within the BTNL protein family are
   highly conserved as shown in Table 2 below, which is an alignment of all six human BTNL
   like proteins. Beneath the alignment is a consensus sequence (labeled "ALL"). If the
   consensus amino acid(s) occurs in all proteins in which the amino acid sequence spans the
35 portion of the alignment in which the amino acid occurs, it is shown in bold. If it occurs in all
                                                  23

   but one of the proteins in which the sequence spans that portion of the alignment, it appears in
   regular font. If a site has in all cases one of two or more amino acids, each of which are
   conservative variations of the other, these amino acids are listed below that position in bold
   font. If a site has in all but one sequence spanning that portion of the alignment one of two or
 5 more amino acids, each of which are conservative variations of the other, these amino acids
   are listed below that position in regular font. The numbering above the alignments in Table 2
   is the numbering of SEQ ID NO:2, which is the full length amino acid sequence of human
   BTNL3, including the signal sequence, which ends at position 17 of SEQ ID NO:2.

   One of skill in the art will appreciate that the consensus sequence among these proteins
   reflects features that may be important for the structures or functions of these proteins. Given
40 their varying expression patterns, it is likely that these proteins do not have identical
   functions, and, thus, it is unlikely that all amino acids important for the function of each
   protein would be conserved within the family. However, many of the conserved amino acids
   may be important to maintain the proper structure, which is, of course, necessary for function.
   At many sites one of two or more amino acids that are conservative variations of each other
45 occurs in all or most members of the BTNL family. One of skill in the art would understand
   that such conservative variations in BTNL3 would likely not adversely affect function. For
   example, at position 36 of SEQ ID NO:2 (which has the same numbering as the alignment of
   Table 2 above), various members of the BTNL family have one of three different
   hydrophobic amino acids, alanine (BTNL3, BTNL8, and ERMAP), isoleucine (BTNL2), or
50 valine (BTNL3 and MOG).         One of skill in the art would understand that a change from
   valine to alanine or isoleucine at this position of the BTNL3 amino acid sequence would be
   unlikely to affect function. Similar considerations would apply at all of the sites where
                                                     26

   WO 2014/015148                                                                  PCT/US2013/051097
   conservative variations occur within the family. Thus, a BTNL3 protein, as meant herein,
   includes proteins comprising SEQ ID NO:2, or a fragment thereof, wherein the sequence may
   be altered by conservative variation at a site where conservative variation occurs among
   members of the BTNL family and wherein the protein can inhibit the proliferation of T cells
 5 as measured by the method described in the examples below. Such sites include, for example,
   positions 3, 16, 20, 28, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 42, 48, 53, 55, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 72, 79, 81,
   82,87,88,89,91,97,98,100,101,104,112,116,128,165,189,191,195,197,201,204,
   223,255,258,272,276,277,283,284,287,290,291,303,308,311,316,318,323,326,328,
   329,331,332,340,349,350,352,355,357,360,369,371,375,386,391,394,398,401,406,
10 407, 409, 418, 421, 426, 430, 436, and 444 of SEQ ID NO:2. Further, variations may also be
   tolerated at other sites within BTNL3 without effect on function. For example conservative
   substitutions at non-conserved positions would be unlikely to affect function.
            Thus, a BTNL3 protein, as meant herein, includes proteins that (1) have naturally
   occurring polymorphisms or recombinantly-introduced amino acid changes, (2) are at least
15 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:2 and/or to amino acids 18-236
   of SEQ ID NO:2 and/or to amino acids 18-166 of SEQ ID NO:9, and (3) retain the ability to
   attenuate T cell proliferation as measured by the methods described herein or act as an
   inhibitor of native BTNL3. Some such polymorphisms may enhance the ability of a BTNL3
   protein to inhibit T cell proliferation and/or may make a BTNL3 protein easier to produce in a
20 commercial production process. Other such polymorphisms may produce an inhibitor of
   native BTNL3. These polymorphisms can occur at sites within BTNL3 that are not conserved
   such as, for example, position 22, 25, 26, 27, 29, 37, 39, 41 43, 45, 46, 47, and any other site
   shown to be nonconserved in Table 2.
            The expression patterns and biological functions of the BTNL proteins have been
25 explored to some extent in some cases, but not in others. ERMAP is expressed on the surface
   of red blood cells and has not been assigned a specific biological function. MOG is a
   component of the myelin sheath. Neither ERMAP nor MOG is thought to play a role in the
   immune system, although antibodies to MOG are often detected in patients with multiple
   sclerosis. BTN1 is homologous to MOG, and BTN1 is found in cow's milk. It has been
30 hypothesized that human consumption of cow's milk may lead to the development of
   antibodies to BTN1 that cross-react with human MOG, thus leading to autoimmune diseases
   such as multiple sclerosis. See Guggenmos et al. (2004), J. Immunol. 172: 61-68. BTNL2
   has been shown to inhibit T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, but not B cell
   proliferation. Thus, BTNL2 is thought to act as a negative co-regulator of T-cell mediated
35 events. See, e.g., US Patent 7,244,822, the relevant portions of which are incorporated herein
   by reference. A polymorphism in BTNL2 has been clearly linked to sarcoidosis, suggesting
   that BTNL2 may play a role in either initiating or mediating or contributing or responding to

   WO 2014/015148                                                                  PCT/US2013/051097
   this disease. Valentonyte et al. (2005), Nature Genetics 37(4): 357-64. More tentative
   associations have been drawn between various BTNL2 polymorphisms and ulcerative colitis,
   rheumatoid arthritis, spontaneous inclusion body myositis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
   type I diabetes, tuberculoid leprosy, and antigen-specific IgE responsiveness. Arnett et al.
 5 (2009), Cytokine 46: 370-75.
            Levels of RNAs encoding the various BTNL proteins in various cell types and tissues
   have been reported. BTNL3 is expressed in ileum, small intestine, colon, liver, lung, bone
   marrow, and spleen. Arnett et al. (2009), Cytokine 46: 370-375. Among various cell types
   associated with immune function that have been tested for BTNL3 expression, BTNL3 RNA
10 is expressed predominantly in neutrophils. Arnett et al. (2009), Cytokine 46: 370-75. The
   expression of BTNL3 RNA in cells involved in immune function suggests that BTNL3 may
   play a role in immune function, either by driving the inflammatory response or in dampening
   the response following a flare.
15                                           BTNL3 Protein
            The instant invention encompasses secreted, soluble versions of BTNL3, which can,
   optionally, be immobilized by attachment to a surface such as a nanoparticle, a bead, or a
   microtiter plate, as well as versions comprising a transmembrane domain that can be
   expressed on a cell surface. Such BTNL3 proteins can inhibit the proliferation of a T cell
20 stimulated by an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. Some variant BTNL3 proteins also have
   this activity, although variants that antagonize this inhibition are also contemplated. Such
   proteins can be isolated, that is, be part of a purified protein preparation in which the BTNL3
   protein constitutes at least 80% or at least 90% of the protein present in the preparation. The
   invention further includes BTNL3 proteins encoded by the BTNL3 nucleic acids described
25 below. A BTNL3 protein, as meant herein, encompasses a protein comprising the amino acid
   sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 6, 7, or 9, as well as fragments, derivatives, and variants thereof,
   including fusion proteins and multimers, as discussed above and below. The amino acid
   sequences of SEQ ID NO:2, 6, and 9 include a signal sequence starting at position 1 and
   ending at a position from about position 15 to about position 20, optionally at position 17.
30 Thus, the amino acid sequence of the mature BTNL3 begins at a position from about 16 to
   about position 21 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6, or 9. Optionally, the mature amino acid sequence of
   BTNL3 begins at position 18 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6, or 9.
            The signal sequence of BTNL3 is followed by an Ig-like domain extending from
   about position 25 to about position 131 of SEQ ID NO:2, 6, or 9. The following region, from
35 about position 132 to about position 236 of SEQ ID NO:2 or 6, aligns with IgC-like domains
   in BTNL2, but lacks some of the characteristic sequence features commonly found in a IgC 1
   like domain. See, e.g., Williams and Barclay (1988), Ann. Rev. Immunol. 6: 381-405; Peach
                                                    28

   WO 2014/015148                                                              PCT/US2013/051097
   et al. (1995), J. Biol. Chem. 270(36): 21181-21187. This domain is substantially shortened
   in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:9, which is the amino acid sequence encoded by a
   splice variant of BTNL3. The transmembrane domain of BTNL3 begins at about position 237
   of SEQ ID NO:2 or about position 167 or SEQ ID NO: 9 and ends at about position 259 of
 5 SEQ ID NO:2 or about position 189 of SEQ ID NO:9. The intracellular portion of BTNL3
   begins at about position 260 and ends at position 466 of SEQ ID NO:2 or begins at about
   position 190 and ends at position 432 of SEQ ID NO:9. The intracellular region contains a
   B30.2 domain extending from about position 288 to about position 445 of SEQ ID NO:2 or
   about position 254 to position 411 of SEQ ID NO:9. A B30.2 domain is a globular domain
10 of approximately 170 amino acids. Henry et al. (supra) discuss B30.2 domains in some detail
   and provide an alignment of a number of B30.2 domains and a consensus sequence derived
   from the alignment. The portions of Henry et al. (1998), Mol. Biol. Evol. 15(12): 1696-1705
   that show (by sequence comparison) and explain what a B30.2 domain are incorporated
   herein by reference. B30.2 domains are also found in BTNL9, BTNL8, and ERMAP, all of
15 which are members of the butyrophilin-like family of proteins, as discussed herein. The
   alignment of BTNL proteins in Table 2 above from about position 288-445 exhibits a high
   degree of homology, certainly higher than is observed between the more disparate collections
   of proteins containing B30.2 domains aligned by Henry et al. supra.
             Similarly, the protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:9 includes a
20 signal sequence starting at position 1 and ending at a position from about position 15 to about
   position 20, optionally at position 17. Thus, the amino acid sequence of the mature protein
   begins at a position from about 16 to about position 21 of SEQ ID NO:2. Optionally, the
   mature amino acid sequence begins at position 18 of SEQ ID NO:9. This is followed by an
   IgV-like domain extending from about 25 to 131 of SEQ ID NO:9. The majority of the
25 following domain present in SEQ ID NO:2 is missing is SEQ ID NO:9. The transmembrane
   domain begins at about position 167 of SEQ ID NO:9 and extends to about position 189 of
   SEQ ID NO:9. Beginning at about 10 amino acids beyond the transmembrane domain, SEQ
   ID NO:9 includes a stretch of 36 amino acids not found in SEQ ID NO:2. The B30.2 domain
   begins at about position 254 of SEQ ID NO:9 and ends at about position 411 of SEQ ID
30 NO:9.
             BTNL3 proteins, as meant herein, include hetero- and homo-multimers comprising at
   least two BTNL3 proteins. In some embodiments, biologically active multimers can be
   homomultimers. The size of such homomultimers can be determined by polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions or by size exclusion chromatography. The size
35 of the monomeric BTNL3 protein contained in such multimers can be determined by
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the multimer under reducing conditions. Such
   conditions would be expected to break disulfide bridges and interfere with non-covalent
                                                   29

   WO 2014/015148                                                                    PCT/US2013/051097
   interactions such as hydrogen bonds or charge interactions. Thus, multimers held together by
   disulfide bonds or non-covalent interactions would be expected to be reduced to monomers
   under reducing conditions. In some embodiments, the size of the biologically active BTNL3
   homomultimer can be at least about two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
 5 twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen or sixteen times the size of the monomeric BTNL3 protein.
   In some embodiments, the size of such a homomultimer can be no more than about two, three,
   four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen or sixteen
   times the size of the monomeric BTNL3 protein.
            BTNL3 proteins, as meant herein, also include proteins encoded by splice variants of
10 the full length BTNL3 mRNA. The cDNA coding sequence for BTNL3 extends from
   position 1-1401 of SEQ ID NO:1, the last three nucleotides being a stop codon. The coding
   sequence starts within the first exon. The most common splice variant contains eight exons:
   exon 1, encoding amino acids 1-16 of SEQ ID NO:2; exon 2, encoding amino acids 17-132 of
   SEQ ID NO:2; exon 3, encoding amino acids 133-224 of SEQ ID NO:2; exon 4, encoding
15 amino acids 225-262 of SEQ ID NO:2; exon 5, encoding amino acids 263-269 of SEQ ID
   NO:2; exon 6, encoding amino acids 270-278 of SEQ ID NO:2; exon 7, encoding amino
   acids 279-287 of SEQ ID NO:2; and exon 8, encoding amino acids 288-466. However,
   alternative splicing can generate different messages including different exons. One of these
   was cloned by Shibui and coworkers. Shibui et al. (1999), J. Hum. Genet. 44: 249-252. The
20 amino acid sequence reported in Shibui et al. from clone ColF4100 is incorporated by
   reference herein. The cDNA sequence encoding this amino acid sequence from GenBank
   Accession no. AB020625 is also incorporated herein by reference. The protein encoded by
   this splice variant lacks a portion of SEQ ID NO:2 encoded by the third and fourth exons.
   Hence, the encoded protein is missing the majority of the second Ig-like domain of mature
25 BTNL3 protein. Compare SEQ ID NO:2 to SEQ ID NO:9. Moreover, the intracellular
   region of SEQ ID NO:9 includes sequences not found in SEQ ID NO:2 (residues 200-235 of
   SEQ ID NO:9). Both the insertion and deletion of extra amino acids in this splice variant are
   a result from the use of non-canonical splice sites. SEQ ID NO:9, like SEQ ID NO:2,
   contains a signal sequence ending at a residue from 16 to 21 of SEQ ID NO:9, optionally at
30 residue 17.
            Other splice variants might be formed. For example, a splice variant missing either
   of exons 2 or 3, that is one of exons encoding either of the two extracellular domains, is
   contemplated. Similarly, splice variants missing any of exons 5, 6, 7, or 8 are contemplated.
   BTNL3 proteins, as meant herein, can be encoded by splice variants that are missing various
35 exons. Splice variants can, in addition, use cryptic splice sites.
            In some embodiments, a BTNL3 protein can be a soluble fragment of the full length
   transmembrane protein comprising SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9, or a variant thereof. In

   some embodiments, a BTNL3 protein comprises a fragment of BTNL3 comprising the
   immunoglobulin-like domain extending from residue 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
   22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9 to residue 120, 121,
   122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, or
 5 140 of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9. Such embodiments may or may not include all of the
   following domain extending from residue 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130,

   233, 234, 235, 236, 237, or 238 of SEQ ID NO:2. For example, SEQ ID NO:9 lacks the
   amino acids present at positions 158 to 227 of SEQ ID NO:2. Variants lacking other portions
10 of this domain are also contemplated. In further embodiments, a BTNL3 protein can
   comprise a fragment extending from residue 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130,
   131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, or 140 of SEQ ID NO:2 to residue 220, 221,
   222, 223, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, or 238 of
   SEQ ID NO:2. Such embodiments may or may not include the preceding domain extending
15 from residue extending from residue 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
   27, 28, 29, or 30 of SEQ ID NO:2 to residue 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129,
   130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, or 140 of SEQ ID NO:2. A BTNL3 protein
   can comprise a fragment which includes most or all of the extracellular region of BTNL3.
   Such a protein can comprise an amino acid sequence extending from residue 12, 13, 14, 15,
20 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 of SEQ ID NO:2 to residue 220,
   221, 222, 223, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, or 238 of
   SEQ ID NO:2, optionally from about residue 18 to about residue 236 of SEQ ID NO:2.
   Alternatively, a soluble BTNL3 protein can comprise a fragment that includes most or all of
   the extracellular region extending from residue 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
25 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 of SEQ ID NO:9 to residue 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161,
   162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170 of SEQ ID NO:9. All of these fragments can
   contain variations relative to SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9 and can contain a defined
   number of substitutions, insertions, or deletions of a single amino acid relative to SEQ ID
   NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9 as discussed below. These embodiments can inhibit the proliferation
30 of T cells stimulated by an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. Some BTNL3 protein variants
   that do not comprise the amino acid sequence of amino acids 18-236 of SEQ ID NO:2 or
   amino acids 18-166 of SEQ ID NO:9 may antagonize the inhibition of the proliferation of T
   cells stimulated by an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody.
            The invention encompasses epitopes of BTNL3 proteins that are useful for generating
35 antibodies, which are referred to herein as immunogenic fragments. Immunogenic fragments
   are preferably at least 10 amino acids long and can comprise contiguous amino acids from
   SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9. Such epitopes can span regions of a BTNL3 protein encoded
                                                    31

   WO 2014/015148                                                                      PCT/US2013/051097
   by a splice junction, which may have the advantage of specific binding to proteins encoded by
   specific splice variants. In some embodiments the epitope is located within the extracellular
   region of BTNL3, which extends from about amino acid position 18 to about position 236 of
   SEQ ID NO:2 or about residue 18 to about residue 166 of SEQ ID NO:9. An epitope can be
 5 partially or completely within the first immunoglobulin variable region-like domain, which
   extends from about amino acid position 25 to position 131 of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9.
   Alternatively, an epitope can be partially or completely within the following domain, which
   extends from about amino acid position 132 to 236 of SEQ ID NO:2. In SEQ ID NO:9, this
   domain, which is substantially shortened, extends from about position 132 to 166 of SEQ ID
10 NO:9. This shortened domain can also contain part or all of an epitope to which an antibody
   binds.
            A BTNL3 protein, as meant herein, may contain one or more insertions, deletions, or
   substitutions of a single amino acid relative to SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9 or to one of the
   fragments or portions of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9 discussed above. In some
15 embodiments, a BTNL3 protein contains not more than 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11,
   10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 substitutions, insertions, or deletions of a single amino acid
   relative to SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9 or relative to one of the fragments of SEQ ID
   NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9 discussed above. Such BTNL3 protein variants within the scope of
   the invention can retain the ability to attenuate T cell proliferation or can act as an inhibitor or
20 antagonist of this attenuation of T cell proliferation by unaltered BTNL3 protein as assayed
   by the methods described herein.
            In some embodiments the substitutions can be conservative amino acid substitutions.
   Examples of conservative amino acid substitutions, unlikely to affect biological activity,
   include the following: alanine for seine, valine for isoleucine, aspartate for glutamate,
25 threonine for seine, alanine for glycine, alanine for threonine, seine for asparagine, alanine
   for valine, seine for glycine, tyrosine for phenylalanine, alanine for proline, lysine for
   arginine, aspartate for asparagine, leucine for isoleucine, leucine for valine, alanine for
   glutamate, aspartate for glycine, and these changes in the reverse. See e.g. Neurath et al., The
   Proteins,Academic Press, New York (1979), the relevant portions of which are incorporated
30 herein by reference. Further, an exchange of one amino acid within a group for another
   amino acid within the same group is a conservative substitution, where the groups are the
   following: (1) alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, norleucine, and phenylalanine;
   (2) histidine, arginine, lysine, glutamine, and asparagine; (3) aspartate and glutamate; (4)
   seine, threonine, alanine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and cysteine; and (5) glycine,
35 proline, and alanine. As discussed above, sites at which conservative substitutions exist when
   BTNL family members are aligned (as in Table 2) are sites where conservative substitutions
                                                       32

   WO 2014/015148                                                                  PCT/US2013/051097
   are particularly unlikely to affect function. Similarly, highly conserved residues, for example
   residues 2, 40, 57, and 65, among many others, of SEQ ID NO:2, are likely to be less tolerant
   of substitution.
             A BTNL3 protein or variant thereof can be at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%,
 5 or 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9, wherein the alignment window is at least
   50, 60, 75, 80, 90, or 100 amino acids long, and wherein the BTNL3 protein can inhibit the
   proliferation of T cells activated with an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. As discussed
   above, sequence mismatches with other human BTNL family members can guide one of skill
   in the art as to where modifications in the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9 can be
10 made without affecting function. In some embodiments, the insertions, deletions, or
   substitutions can occur at, or adjacent to, residues that are not conserved among human BTNL
   family members. See Table 2. In some embodiments, these alterations occur at (in the case
   of deletions or substitutions) or adjacent to (in the case of insertions) one or more of the
   following non-conserved residues of SEQ ID NO:2: 22, 25-27, 29, 37. 39. 41, 43, 45-47, 49,
15 50, 56, 58-62, 71, 73-76, 80, 86, 93, 94, 96, 102, 103, 105-107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117-123,
   126, 127, 130, 132-137, 139-158, 160-162, 164, 166-187, 190, 192-194, 196, 198-200, 202
   203, 205-217, 219-222, and/or 224-236. Alterations at the analogous sites in SEQ ID NO:9,
   where such analogous sites exist, are also contemplated. Alternatively, a BTNL3 protein can
   contain not more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 amino acid substitutions,
20 deletions, or insertions relative to SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9. The proteins described
   above are BTNL3 proteins or variants thereof as meant herein as long as they can inhibit the
   proliferation of T cells activated by an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody or antagonize such
   inhibition by a BTNL3 protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:7.
             BTNL3 proteins may be glycosylated to varying degrees or not glycosylated. As an
25 illustration, a BTNL3 protein may comprise one or more N- or 0-linked glycosylation sites in
   addition to those already found in a protein comprising SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9. SEQ
   ID NO:2 contains two potential N-linked glycosylation sites at positions 103 and 368. SEQ
   ID NO:9 contains the potential N-linked glycosylation sites at position 103 and 334. The
   potential N-linked glycosylation site at position 103 of SEQ ID NO:2 or 9 is also present in
30 BTNL8, the BTNL protein most closely related to BTNL3. Thus, this glycosylation site may
   play a role in BTNL3 function or structure. One of skill in the art would be aware that
   asparagine residues that are part of the sequence Asn Xxx Ser/Thr (where Xxx is any amino
   acid except proline) can serve as sites of addition for N-glycans. In addition, there are many
   serine and threonine residues that may serve as 0-linked glycosylation sites. Glycosylation
35 may increase in vivo half life or alter biological activity. Variants of BTNL3 proteins also
   include proteins comprising one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten more N
   and/or 0-linked glycosylation sites than are present in SEQ ID NO:2 as long as the resulting
                                                    33

   WO 2014/015148                                                                    PCT/US2013/051097
   protein can inhibit the proliferation of T cells. Variant BTNL3 proteins also include those
   that have one, two, three, four, or five fewer N- and/or O-linked glycosylation sites than are
   present in SEQ ID NO:2 as long as they can inhibit the proliferation of T cells activated with
   an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody or can inhibit the ability of unmutated versions of BTNL3
 5 protein to do so.
             BTNL3 proteins, as meant herein, can be fusion proteins comprising at least one
   BTNL3 polypeptide, which can comprise an amino acid sequence that is a variant and/or a
   fragment of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9 (as explained above), and at least one other
   moiety. The other moiety can be a polypeptide other than a BTNL3 protein. The other
10 moiety can also be a non-protein moiety such as, for example, a polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   moiety or a cytotoxic, cytostatic, luminescent, and/or radioactive moiety.
             Attachment of PEG has been shown to increase the in vivo half life of at least some
   proteins. Moreover, cytotoxic, cytostatic, luminescent, and/or radioactive moieties have been
   fused to antibodies for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, for example, to locate, to inhibit
15 proliferation of, or to kill cells to which the antibodies can bind. Similarly, BTNL3 proteins
   fused to such moieties can be used to locate, to inhibit proliferation of, or to kill cells that
   BTNL3 can bind to, for example, cells involved in immune response. Among such cytotoxic,
   cytostatic, luminescent, and/or radioactive moieties are, for example, maytansine derivatives
   (such as DM1), enterotoxins (such as a Staphylococcal enterotoxin), iodine isotopes (such as
20 iodine-125), technetium isotopes (such as Tc-99m), cyanine fluorochromes (such as
   Cy5.5.18),    ribosome-inactivating proteins (such as bouganin, gelonin, or saporin-S6), and
   calicheamicin, a cytotoxic substance that is part of a product marketed under the trademark
   MYLOTARGIm (Wyeth-Ayerst).
             A variety of polypeptides other than BTNL3 can be fused to a BTNL3 polypeptide
25 for a variety of purposes such as, for example, to increase in vivo half life of the protein, to
   facilitate identification, isolation and/or purification of the protein, to increase the activity of
   the protein, and to promote oligomerization of the protein.
             Many polypeptides can facilitate identification and/or purification of a recombinant
   fusion protein of which they are a part. Examples include polyarginine, polyhistidine, or
30 HATTM (Clontech), which is a naturally-occurring sequence of non-adjacent histidine residues
   that possess a high affinity for immobilized metal ions. BTNL3 proteins comprising these
   polypeptides can be purified by, for example, affinity chromatography using immobilized
   nickel or TALONTM resin (Clontech), which comprises immobilized cobalt ions. See e.g.
   Knol et al. (1996), J. Biol. Chem. 27(26): 15358-15366. Polypeptides comprising
35 polyarginine allow effective purification by ion exchange chromatography. Other useful
   polypeptides include, for example, the antigenic identification peptides described in U.S.
   Patent 5,011,912 and in Hopp et al. (1988), Bio/Technology 6:1204. One such peptide is the
                                                     34

   WO 2014/015148                                                                PCT/US2013/051097
   FLAG® peptide, which is highly antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a
   specific monoclonal antibody, enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed
   recombinant fusion protein. A murine hybridoma designated 4E1 1 produces a monoclonal
   antibody that binds the FLAG® peptide in the presence of certain divalent metal cations, as
 5 described in U.S. Patent 5,011,912. The 4E1 1 hybridoma cell line has been deposited with
   the American Type Culture Collection under Accession No. HB 9259. Monoclonal
   antibodies that bind the FLAG® peptide can be used as affinity reagents to recover a
   polypeptide purification reagent that comprises the FLAG® peptide. Other suitable protein
   tags and affinity reagents are: 1) those described in GST-BindTM system (Novagen), which
10 utilizes the affinity of glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins for immobilized glutathione;
   2) those described in the T7-TAG* affinity purification kit (Novagen), which utilizes the
   affinity of the amino terminal 11 amino acids of the T7 gene 10 protein for a monoclonal
   antibody; or 3) those described in the STREP-TAG® system (Novagen), which utilizes the
   affinity of an engineered form of streptavidin for a protein tag. Some of the above-mentioned
15 protein tags, as well as others, are described in Sassenfeld (1990), TIBTECH 8: 88-93,
   Brewer et al., in PurificationandAnalysis ofRecombinant Proteins,pp. 2 3 9-266, Seetharam
   and Sharma (eds.), Marcel Dekker, Inc. (1991), and Brewer and Sassenfeld, in Protein
   PurificationApplications, pp. 91-111, Harris and Angal (eds.), Press, Inc., Oxford England
   (1990). The portions of these references that describe protein tags are incorporated herein by
20 reference. Further, fusions of two or more of the tags described above, such as, for example,
   a fusion of a FLAG tag and a polyhistidine tag, can be fused to a BTNL3 protein of the
   invention.
            Recombinant fusion proteins comprising polypeptides other than BTNL3 may have
   other kinds of unique advantages, such as, for example, a propensity to form dimers, trimers,
25 or higher order multimers, an increased in vivo half-life, and/or an increased biological
   activity. A "higher order multimer" when used in conjunction with, for example, "dimer,"
   means a multimer containing more than two polypeptide chains. When used in a phrase like
   "a trimer or a higher order multimer," the higher order multimer contains more than three
   polypeptide chains. Thus, a higher order multimer is one that has more polypeptide chains
30 than the multimer it is compared to. Techniques for preparing fusion proteins are known, and
   are described, for example, in International Application WO 99/31241 and in Cosman et al.
   ((2001). Immunity 14: 123-133).
            As an illustration, a polypeptide that comprises an Fc region of an antibody,
   optionally an IgG antibody, or a substantially similar protein, can be fused to a BTNL3
35 polypeptide or fragment thereof. An Fc region of an antibody is a polypeptide comprising the
   most or all of hinge plus the CH2, and the CH3 domains from an antibody or immunoglobulin
   domains substantially similar to these. For discussion, see Hasemann and Capra,
                                                    35

   WO 2014/015148                                                                 PCT/US2013/051097
   Immunoglobulins: Structure and Function, in William E. Paul, ed., Fundamental
   Immunology, Second Edition, 212-213 (1989). The Fc fragment can be a human IgG Fc,
   such as an IgGi, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 Fc. An Fc fragment can be a native human or animal
   Fc fragment. Truncated forms of Fc regions, that is, forms missing some portion of the hinge,
 5 CH2, and/or CH3 domains, that promote dimerization can also be used. Other portions of
   antibodies and other immunoglobulin isotypes can be used. Recombinant fusion proteins
   comprising Fc regions of antibodies are likely to form dimers or higher order multimers.
   Fusion proteins comprising various portions of antibody-derived proteins have been described
   by Ashkenazi et al. ((1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:10535-39), Byrn et al. ((1990),
10 Nature 344: 677-70), Hollenbaugh and Aruffo (in Current Protocols in Immunology, Suppl. 4,
   pp. 10.19.1-10.19.11 (1992)), Baum et al. ((1994), EMBO J. 13: 3992-4001) and in US Patent
   5,457,035 and International Application WO 93/1015 1, the relevant portions of which are
   incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, an altered Fc region can have the
   advantage of having a lower affinity for Fc receptors compared to a wild type Fc region. This
15 can be an advantage because it may lessen the lysis of cells to which such recombinant fusion
   proteins bind by immune effector cells. Such alterations to the Fc region are described in US
   Patent 5,457,035 and International Patent Application WO 93/1015 1, the relevant portions of
   which are incorporated herein by reference. Example 2 below describes the production of a
   fusion protein containing the extracellular region of human BTNL3 and the Fc region of a
20 human IgGi antibody.
             Alternatively, a BTNL3 fusion protein can comprise all or part of a BTNL3
   polypeptide as described herein plus a non-Fc polypeptide that has the effect of increasing the
   half life of the fusion protein such as, for example, a serum albumin protein, optionally a
   human protein, or a fragment thereof, or a protein that binds to serum albumin or a fragment
25 thereof. In some embodiments this additional polypeptide could be all or part of a
   fibronectin protein, which is, optionally a human protein.
             A recombinant fusion protein comprising a BTNL3 protein can comprise a
   polypeptide comprising a leucine zipper. Among known leucine zipper sequences are
   sequences that promote dimerization and sequences that promote trimerization. See e.g.
30 Landschulz et al. (1988), Science 240: 1759-64, the relevant portions of which is incorporated
   herein by reference. Leucine zippers comprise a repetitive heptad repeat, often with four or
   five leucine residues interspersed with other amino acids. Use and preparation of leucine
   zippers are well known in the art. A BTNL3 fusion protein can comprise one or more peptide
   linkers. Generally, a peptide linker is a stretch of amino acids that serves to link plural
35 polypeptides to form multimers and provides the flexibility or rigidity required for the desired
   function of the linked portions of the protein. Typically, a peptide linker is between about 1
   and 30 amino acids in length. Examples of peptide linkers include, but are not limited to, -

   Acad. Sci. 85: 5879-83 (1988), Whitlow, M., et al., Protein Engineering 6: 989-95 (1993),
   Newton, D. L., et al., Biochemistry 35: 545-53 (1996), and U.S. Patents 4,751,180 and
   4,935,233. The relevant portions of these references, that is, the portions describing linkers,
   are incorporated herein by reference.
10          Alternatively, described herein are BTNL3 variant proteins that can antagonize the
   inhibition by a BTNL3 protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:7 of
   proliferation of a T cell stimulated by an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. Such BTNL3
   variants can comprise an amino acid sequence at least about 90%, 95%, or 98% identical to
   amino acids 18-236 of SEQ ID NO:2 or 18-166 of SEQ ID NO:9 and/or can comprise an
15 amino acid sequence containing not more than 20, 15, 10, 8 or 5 insertions, deletions, or
   substitutions of a single amino acid relative to amino acids 18-236 of SEQ ID NO:2 or amino
   acids 18-166 of SEQ ID NO:9. Such variants do not contain an amino acid sequence identical
   to amino acids 18-236 of SEQ ID NO:2 or amino acid 18-166 of SEQ ID NO:9.
            A recombinant BTNL3 fusion protein can comprise a BTNL3 protein that lacks its
20 normal signal sequence and has, instead, a different signal sequence replacing it. The choice
   of a signal sequence depends on the type of host cells in which the recombinant protein is to
   be produced, and a different signal sequence can replace the native signal sequence.
   Examples of signal sequences that are functional in mammalian host cells include the
   following: the signal sequence for interleukin-7 (IL-7) described in US Patent 4,965,195; the
25 signal sequence of human IgK (which is METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTG;                   SEQ ID NO:3);

                                         BTNL3 Nucleic Acids
35          The invention encompasses isolated nucleic acids, including, for example, DNAs and
   RNAs that encode the BTNL3 proteins described herein, which include proteins comprising
   the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:9 and fragments and/or variants
                                                   37

   WO 2014/015148                                                                PCT/US2013/051097
   thereof Such nucleic acids include DNAs that do not include exon sequences. These nucleic
   acids are useful for, inter alia, producing recombinant proteins and detecting the presence of
   BTNL3 nucleic acids in tissue samples, e.g., for diagnostic uses. Such nucleic acids can be
   genomic DNA or cDNA. As is known in the art, a cDNA sequence does not include exon
 5 sequence that can be present in genomic DNA. The nucleic acids can comprise an
   uninterrupted open reading frame encoding a BTNL3 protein. Nucleic acid molecules of the
   invention include DNA and RNA in both single-stranded and double-stranded form, as well
   as the corresponding complementary sequences. An "isolated nucleic acid" is a nucleic acid
   that has been separated from adjacent genetic sequences present in the genome of the
10 organism from which the nucleic acid was isolated, in the case of nucleic acids isolated from
   naturally-occurring sources. In the case of nucleic acids synthesized chemically, such as
   oligonucleotides, or enzymatically from a template, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   products or cDNAs, it is understood that the nucleic acids resulting from such processes are
   isolated nucleic acids. An isolated nucleic acid molecule refers to a nucleic acid molecule in
15 the form of a separate fragment or as a component of a larger nucleic acid construct such as a
   vector.
             Further, the invention encompasses fragments of a nucleic acid encoding a BTNL3
   protein that can serve (1) as probes for detecting BTNL3 nucleic acids by a number of
   methods well known in the art, e.g., Southern and northern blotting, dot blotting, colony
20 hybridizations, hybridization to an array, etc., (2) as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers
   to amplify BTNL3 nucleic acids, or (3) as a means to regulate expression of BTNL3 nucleic
   acids, e.g., through inhibition of expression with antisense nucleic acids (including peptide
   nucleic acids), ribozymes, triple helix-forming molecules, or interfering RNAs. DNAs that
   encode any of these RNAs are also BTNL3 nucleic acids as meant herein. PCR primers can
25 comprise, in addition to BTNL3 nucleic acid sequences, other sequences such as restriction
   enzyme cleavage sites that facilitate the use of the amplified nucleic acid. PCR is described,
   for example, in the following references: Saiki et al. (1988), Science 239: 487-91; PCR
   Technology, Erlich, ed., Stockton Press, (1989). As explained below, PCR can be useful to
   detect over- or under-expression of BTNL3 mRNAs, and PCR primers can be taken from
30 various parts of the BNTL3 gene and can also be selected to distinguish between different
   splice variants. Antisense RNAs (and DNAs encoding them), DNAs, or synthetic nucleotides
   and their use to regulate expression are well known in the art and are described in, e.g. Izant
   and Weintraub (1984), Cell 36(4): 1007-15; Izant and Weintraub (1985), Science 229(4711):

   (1987), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84(3): 648-52. The portions of these references
   describing techniques of modulating gene expression using nucleic acids are incorporated by
   reference herein. Similarly, interfering RNAs (and DNAs encoding them) and their use to
   inhibit expression of selected genes are well known in the art and described in, e.g., Fjose et
 5 al. (2001), Biotechnol. Ann. Rev. 7: 31-57; Bosher and Labouesse (2000), Nature Cell Biol.
   2: E31-E36. The relevant portions of these references are incorporated herein by reference.
   Further, ribozymes or DNAzymes can be targeted to cleave specific RNAs and thus used to
   inhibit gene expression as described in, e.g., Lewin and Hauswirth (2001), Trends Mol. Med.
   7(5): 221-28; Menke and Hobom (1997), Mol. Biotechnol. 8(1): 17-33; Norris et al. (2000),
10 Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 465: 293-301; Sioud (2001), Curr. Mol. Med. 1(5): 575-88; and
   Santiago and Khachigian (2001), J. Mol. Med. 79(12): 695-706. The portions of these
   references describing these methods of modulating gene expression are incorporated by
   reference herein. Such nucleic acids that can regulate BTNL3 expression can find use in in
   vivo or in vitro studies of BTNL3 function or as therapeutics, optionally, as gene therapy
15 agents.
            The present invention also includes nucleic acids, for example, DNAs, comprising the
   sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:8 or a fragment thereof or nucleic acids that
   hybridize under moderately stringent conditions, and optionally highly stringent conditions, to
   nucleic acids comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:8, which
20 are BTNL3 cDNAs, wherein the nucleic acid encodes a protein that can inhibit the
   proliferation of T cells activated with an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. Hybridization
   techniques are well known in the art and are described by Sambrook, J., E. F. Fritsch, and T.
   Maniatis (MolecularCloning: A LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,
   Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., chapters 9 and 11, (1989)) and CurrentProtocols in Molecular
25 Biology (F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and 6.3-6.4
   (1995)), the relevant portions of which are incorporated by reference herein. Generally,
   moderately stringent conditions for filter hybridizations include hybridization in about 50%
   formamide, 6 x SSC at a temperature from about 42 C to 55 C and washing at about 60 C in
   0.5 x SSC, 0.1% SDS. Generally, highly stringent conditions are defined as hybridization
30 conditions as above, but with washing at approximately 68'C in 0.2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS. SSPE
   (1xSSPE is 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM NaH 2PO 4, and 1.26 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted
   for SSC (1xSSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash
   buffers; washes, optionally at least two washes, are performed for 15 minutes after
   hybridization is complete.
35          It should be understood that the wash temperature and wash salt concentration can be
   adjusted as necessary to achieve a desired degree of stringency by applying the basic
   principles that govern hybridization reactions and duplex stability, as known to those skilled
                                                   39

   WO 2014/015148                                                                   PCT/US2013/051097
   in the art and described further below (see e.g., Sambrook et al., supra). When nucleic acids
   of known sequence are hybridized, the hybrid length can be determined by aligning the
   sequences of the nucleic acids (for example, using GAP) and identifying the region or regions
   of optimal sequence complementarity. Somewhat different conditions than those described
 5 above can apply for hybrids of relatively short lengths. The hybridization temperature for
   hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5 to 10 C less than the
   melting temperature (Tm) of the hybrid, where Tm is determined according to the following
   equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, Tm (degrees C) = 2(# of A + T
   bases) + 4(# of G + C bases). For hybrids above 18 base pairs in length, Tm (degrees C)=
10 81.5 + 16.6(logio [Na]) + 0.41(% G + C) - (600/N), where N is the number of bases in the
   hybrid, and [Na] is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer. Each such
   hybridizing nucleic acid can have a length that is at least 15 nucleotides, or at least 18
   nucleotides, or at least 20 nucleotides, or at least 25 nucleotides, or at least 30 nucleotides, or
   at least 40 nucleotides, or at least 50 nucleotides, or at least 100 nucleotides. Sambrook et al.,
15 supra.
            BTNL3 nucleic acids, such as cDNAs, include nucleic acids comprising the following
   polynucleotides: (1) all or a fragment of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:8, wherein the
   fragment encodes a BTNL3 protein that can inhibit proliferation of T cells; (2) a
   polynucleotide including nucleotide sequences at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%,
20 99%, 99.5%, or 99.7% identical to SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:8, wherein the alignment
   window is at least 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 1000. or 1200
   nucleotides long and wherein the sequence encodes a BTNL3 protein that can inhibit the
   proliferation of T cells activated with an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody or can antagonize
   such inhibition; (3) fragments of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:8 or substantially similar
25 sequences that are useful for detecting or amplifying nucleic acids encoding the BTNL3
   proteins of the invention or for regulating the expression of BTNL3 mRNAs and/or proteins;
   (4) a polynucleotide that comprises not more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30
   alteration(s) of a single nucleotide relative to SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:8, wherein an
   alteration can be an insertion, deletion or substitution of a single nucleotide, and wherein the
30 polynucleotide encodes a BTNL3 protein can inhibit the proliferation of T cells activated with
   an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody or can serve as an antagonist of such inhibition; and (5) a
   polynucleotide that encodes a BTNL3 protein as described herein, which includes fragments,
   derivatives and variants of a human BTNL3 protein.
35               Methods of Making BTNL3 Proteins and Anti-BTNL3 Antibodies
            BTNL3 proteins, including multimeric BTNL3 proteins or variant BTNL3 proteins,
   or anti-BTNL3 antibodies (or anti-idiotypic antibodies) can be made as follows. A nucleic
                                                    40

   WO 2014/015148                                                                   PCT/US2013/051097
   acid, for example a DNA, that encodes a BTNL3 protein or an anti-BTNL3 antibody, as
   described herein, can be introduced into a vector, which can be introduced into a host cell, for
   example a non-human host cell, which can be a mammalian cell. Vectors and host cells
   comprising nucleic acids, such as DNAs, encoding a BTNL3 protein or an anti-BTNL3
 5 antibody are encompassed by the invention. The host cell containing the nucleic acids
   encoding a BTNL3 protein or an anti-BTNL3 antibody can be cultured under conditions such
   that the BTNL3 protein or the anti-BTNL3 antibody can be expressed. The expressed
   BTNL3 protein or anti-BTNL3 antibody can then be obtained from the medium in which the
   cells are cultured or from the cells and purified by any of the many appropriate means known
10 in the art. In addition, genetic engineering methods for the production of BTNL3 proteins
   include the expression of the polynucleotide molecules in cell free expression systems, in
   cellular hosts, in tissues, and in animal models, according to known methods.
             The vector can include a selectable marker and an origin of replication, for propagation
   in a host. The vector can further include suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory
15 sequences, such as those derived from mammalian, microbial, viral, or insect genes, operably
   linked to the nucleic acid encoding the BTNL3 protein or the anti-BTNL3 antibody. Examples
   of such regulatory sequences include transcriptional promoters, operators, or enhancers, mRNA
   ribosomal binding sites, and appropriate sequences that control transcription and translation.
   Nucleotide sequences are operably linked when the regulatory sequence functionally relates to
20 the DNA encoding the target protein. Thus, a promoter nucleotide sequence is operably linked
   to a nucleic sequence if the promoter nucleotide sequence directs the transcription of the anti
   BTNL3 antibody-encoding or BTNL3 protein-encoding sequence. If the BTNL3 protein is a
   fusion protein, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the fusion protein, for example, a
   signal sequence, can be part of a vector, and a nucleic acid encoding an anti-BTNL3 antibody or
25 a BTNL3 protein can be inserted into the vector such that a protein comprising the added signal
   sequence plus the anti-BTNL3 antibody or BTNL3 protein is encoded by the vector.
             Suitable host cells for expression of BTNL3 proteins or anti-BTNL3 antibodies include
   human and non-human cells including prokaryotic cells such as bacteria, yeast cells, plant cells,
   insect cells, and higher eukaryotic cells, including mammalian cells. The regulatory sequences
30 in the vector will be chosen such that they are operable in the host cell. Suitable prokaryotic
   host cells include bacteria of the genera Escherichia, Bacillus, and Salmonella, as well as
   members of the genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, and Staphylococcus. For expression in
   prokaryotic cells, for example, in E. coli, the polynucleotide molecule encoding a BTNL3
   protein or anti-BTNL3 antibody preferably includes an N-terminal methionine residue to
35 facilitate expression of the recombinant polypeptide. The N-terminal methionine may
   optionally be cleaved from the expressed polypeptide. Suitable yeast host cells include cells
                                                     41

   WO 2014/015148                                                                  PCT/US2013/051097
   from genera including Saccharomyces, Pichia, and Kluveromyces, including species such as S.
   cerevisiae and P. pastoris. A suitable system for expression in an insect host cell is described,
   for example, in the review by Luckow and Summers ((1988), BioTechnology 6: 47), the
   relevant portions of which are incorporated herein by reference. Suitable mammalian host cells
 5 include the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells (Gluzman et al. (1981), Cell 23: 175-182),
   baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Puck et al. (1958),
   PNAS USA 60: 1275-1281), CV-1 (Fischer et al. (1970), Int. J. Cancer 5: 21-27), 293 cells
   from human kidney (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC*) catalog no. CRL-10852TM),
   and human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA) (ATCC* CCL 2). The relevant portions of the
10 references referred to in this paragraph are incorporated herein by reference.
            Expression vectors for use in cellular hosts generally comprise one or more phenotypic
   selectable marker genes. Such genes encode, for example, a protein that confers antibiotic
   resistance or that supplies an auxotrophic requirement. A wide variety of such vectors are
   readily available from commercial sources. Examples include pGEM@ vectors (Promega),
15 pSPORTIm vectors, and pPROEXIm vectors (InVitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA),
   Bluescript vectors (Stratagene), and pQE vectors (Qiagen). Yeast vectors will often contain an
   origin of replication sequence from a 2g yeast plasmid, an autonomously replicating sequence
   (ARS), a promoter region, sequences for polyadenylation, sequences for transcription
   termination, and a selectable marker gene. Vectors replicable in both yeast and E. coli (termed
20 shuttle vectors) may also be used. In addition to the above-mentioned features of yeast vectors,
   a shuttle vector will also include sequences for replication and selection in E. coli. Direct
   secretion of the target polypeptides expressed in yeast hosts may be accomplished by the
   inclusion of nucleotide sequence encoding the yeast a-factor leader sequence at the 5' end of the
   BTNL3- or antibody-encoding nucleotide sequence. Brake (1989), Biotechnology 13: 269
25 280.
            Examples of suitable expression vectors for use in mammalian host cells include
   pcDNA3.1/Hygro+ (Invitrogen), pDC409 (McMahan et al. (1991), EMBO J. 10: 2821-2832),
   and pSVL (Pharmacia Biotech). Expression vectors for use in mammalian host cells can
   include transcriptional and translational control sequences derived from viral genomes.
30 Commonly used promoter sequences and enhancer sequences that can be used to express
   BTNL3 RNA include, but are not limited to, those derived from human cytomegalovirus
   (CMV), Adenovirus 2, Polyoma virus, and Simian virus 40 (SV40). Methods for the
   construction of mammalian expression vectors are disclosed, for example, in Okayama and
   Berg ((1982) Mol. Cell. Biol. 2:161-170), Cosman et al. ((1986) Mol. Immunol. 23:935-941),

   relevant portions of these references are incorporated herein by reference.

   WO 2014/015148                                                                PCT/US2013/051097
                                        Anti-BTNL3 Antibodies
            Antibodies that bind specifically to the BTNL3 proteins described herein, anti
 5 idiotypic antibodies that bind to anti-BTNL3 antibodies and uses of these antibodies are
   described herein. An anti-BTNL3 antibody can bind to a polypeptide, wherein the amino acid
   sequence of the polypeptide consists of the amino acids 18 to 236 of SEQ ID NO:2 or amino
   acids 18 to 166 of SEQ ID NO:9. As used herein, specific binding of an epitope on a BTNL3
   protein by a first antibody means that the first antibody can be displaced from the BTNL3
10 protein by another antibody that competes with the first antibody, but not by other anti
   BTNL3 antibodies that do not compete with the first antibody for binding. Numerous
   competitive binding assays are known in the art.
            Typically competition of antibodies for binding can be evaluated by a fluorescence
   activated cell sorting (FACS) assay. The antibody of interest can be biotinylated. The
15 biotinylated antibodies are combined with cells known to express the antigen to which the
   antibodies bind. If the biotinylated antibodies bind to the cells as expected, a shift in
   fluorescence intensity should be observed using a secondary consisting of strepavidin
   conjugated to a fluorochrome. Pre-incubation of the cells with an unlabeled version of the
   same antibody should completely eliminate the observed shift in fluorescence. Pre-incubation
20 with a different unlabeled antibody may completely or partially eliminate the fluorescence
   shift or have no effect. In the later case, one would conclude that the unlabeled antibody does
   not compete with the labeled antibody. In the former case, the antibodies do compete for
   binding, and, as meant herein, one would conclude that the epitopes are either fully or
   partially overlapping. Alternatively, the unlabeled antibody may compete by altering the
25 conformation of the epitope bound by the labeled antibody. Among the antibodies
   contemplated are those that compete, either fully or partially, with any specifically provided
   anti-BTNL3 antibody.
            In some embodiments, an anti-BNTL3 antibody can bind to a human BTNL3 protein
   with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of no more than 10-, 10-9, 10-10, or 10- M. A
30 KD  is commonly determined by use of a specialized instrument that can detect interactions
   between proteins in real time using surface plasmon resonance, such as those sold by Biacore
   Life Sciences, Piscataway, New Jersey. In some embodiments, an anti-BTNL3 antibody can
   bind to a BTNL3 protein comprising an amino acid sequence at least 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%,
   or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO:2 and/or SEQ ID NO:9, wherein the alignment window with
35 SEQ ID NO:2 and/or 9 is at least 50, 60, 70, 80, or 100 amino acids long and, optionally,
   wherein the BTNL3 protein can inhibit the proliferation of a T cell stimulated by an
                                                    43

   WO 2014/015148                                                                PCT/US2013/051097
   immobilized anti-CD3 antibody or can antagonize such inhibition by a BTNL3 protein
   comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:7. In some embodiments, an anti
   BTNL3 antibody can bind to a protein comprising a fragment of the amino acid sequence of
   SEQ ID NO:2 and/or 9.
 5          In addition, the impact of an anti-BTNL3 antibody on activation of anti-CD3
   activated T cells in the presence or absence of a BTNL3 protein may provide additional useful
   information about the functional properties of an antibody. Particularly, antibodies that
   prevent or inhibit BTNL3 from exerting its usual role of inhibiting the proliferation of anti
   CD3 -activated T cells are contemplated. Alternatively, antibodies that agonize or enhance the
10 inhibition of proliferation of anti-CD3-activated T cells by BTNL3 are contemplated. Thus,
   the antibodies can be either antagonists or agonists of BTNL3. Since BTNL3 contains an
   intracellular B30.2 domain, it may transduce a signal into the cell on which it is expressed
   when its extracellular domain is engaged by an agonist, such as a naturally occurring ligand
   or an agonistic antibody. This kind of agonistic antibody can be distinct from antibodies that
15 enhance the inhibition of proliferation of T cells. The invention includes monoclonal
   antibodies, each of which binds to a particular epitope of BTNL3, and monoclonal antibodies
   that compete with these for binding. The antibodies can be human, humanized, or chimeric
   antibodies and can be in various formats.
            Epitopes on BTNL3 protein may comprise contiguous amino acids and also may
20 comprise non-contiguous amino acids. Epitopes can be identified by methods known in the
   art, including the use of protein fragment or peptide libraries, alanine scanning, epitope
   extraction, epitope excision, or X-ray crystallography. See e.g. Leinonen et al. (2002), Clin.
   Chem. 48(12): 2208-16; Kroger et al. (2002), Biosens. Bioelectron. 17(11-12): 937-44; Zhu
   et al. (2001), Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 282(4): 921-27; Obungu et at. (2009),
25 Biochemistry 48: 7251-60. The relevant portions of these references, i.e., the portions
   describing methods of epitope mapping, are incorporated herein by reference. In addition,
   especially in view of the fact that BTNL3 includes some domains of well known tertiary
   structure, such as an IgV-like domain, tertiary structures of BTNL3 generated by analogy to
   known tertiary structures can be used as an aid to determining epitopes.
30          Antibodies can be polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies and can be produced by
   methods well known in the art. See, for example, Monoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A

   Kuby, Immunology, Second Edition, p.162-64, W.H. Freeman and Co., New York (1994); the
   relevant portions of these references are incorporated herein by reference. Hybridoma cell
   lines that produce monoclonal antibodies specific for the BTNL3 proteins as described herein
 5 are also contemplated herein. Such hybridoma lines can be produced and identified by
   conventional techniques. The hybridoma producing an anti-BTNL3 antibody can be
   cultivated in vitro or in vivo. Further, anti-BTNL3 antibodies can be produced in other
   cultured cells, including, for example, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), HeLa, VERO, BHK,
   Cos, MDCK, 293, 3T3, myeloma (e.g. NSO, NSI), or W138 cells, yeast cells, insect cells, and
10 bacterial cells, including, for example, Escherichiacoli. Such antibodies can be produced by
   introducing nucleic acids, such as DNAs, encoding the antibodies plus nucleic acids to enable
   expression of these nucleic acids into desired host cells. The antibodies can then be produced
   by culturing the cells into which these nucleic acids have been introduced. Monoclonal
   antibodies can be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, IgD and any
15 subclass thereof, such as, for example, IgGi, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4.
            Anti-BTNL3 antibodies can be full-length tetrameric antibodies comprising two
   heavy chains and two light chains, like those found in most mammalian species. Such a full
   length antibody can be of the IgA, IgD, IgG, IgM, or IgE isotype. If it is an IgG antibody, it
   can be an IgGi, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 antibody. Alternatively, anti-BTNL3 antibodies can be
20 single chain antibodies comprising a heavy and a light chain variable region and, optionally,
   also one or more constant region-like domain (US Patent 4,946,778; Bird et al. (1988),
   Science 242: 423-26; Huston et al. (1988), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 5879-83), dimeric
   or multivalent antibodies (see e.g. Lantto et al. (2002), J. Gen. Virol. 83: 2001-05; Hudson
   and Souriau (2001), Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 1(5): 845-55), tetrameric antibodies (see e.g.

   Boulianne et al., supra). Further, antibodies can be "matured" by in vitro selection schemes
   to yield an antibody with altered properties such as, for example, a higher affinity for the
   epitope to which it binds. See e.g. Jackson et al. (1995), J. Immunol. 154(7): 3310-19; Pini

   Supply. A: S106-12. Alternatively, fragments of antibodies such as, for example, Fab
   fragments, F(ab') 2 fragments, or single chain Fv fragments (scFv's) that can bind specifically
   to a BTNL3 protein of the invention are also encompassed by what is meant herein as an anti
 5 BTNL3 antibody. See Kuby, supra, pp.109-112 and Janeway et al., supra, for discussion of
   Fab and Fv fragments. The invention also encompasses anti-idiotypic antibodies that bind
   specifically to antibodies that bind specifically to BTNL3 proteins and that mimic the effects
   of BTNL3 proteins. Such anti-idiotypic antibodies find the same uses as BTNL3 proteins.
   Methods for generating anti-idiotypic antibodies are well known in the art. See e.g. Kuby et
10 al., supra, at 371-72. Various kinds of recombinant and non-recombinant bispecific
   antibodies that can bind specifically to a BTNL3 protein of the invention and another protein
   are also contemplated. Various kinds of bispecific antibodies and methods for making them
   are described in e.g. US Patents 4,474,893, 6,060,285, and 6,106,833.
            The anti-BTNL3 antibodies can be multimeric antibodies, including full-length,
15 tetrameric, bispecific antibodies containing two complete heavy chains and two complete
   light chains or multimeric monovalent antibodies containing, for example, a heavy chain plus
   a light chain plus an Fc region. Such multimeric antibodies can contain certain mutations in
   their Fc region that facilitate the formation of heterodimers. Such antibodies and mutations
   are described in International Patent Publication No. International Application WO
20 2009/089004 and US Application 2007/0105199, the portions of which describe such
   antibodies and mutations are incorporated by reference herein. The Fc regions in such
   antibodies can have native human sequences or sequences native to other species.
   Alternatively or in addition, the Fc regions of such antibodies can contain mutations in their
   Fc regions that either increase or decrease effector function by increasing or decreasing the
25 affinity of various Fc receptors for the Fc region. Some such Fc alterations are discussed in
   US Patent No. 5,457,035 and International Patent Application Publication No. WO 93/10151,
   the relevant portions of which are incorporated herein by reference.
            Anti-BTNL3 antibodies can also be conjugated to moieties can be used to locate, to
   inhibit proliferation of, or to kill cells that antibody can bind to. Among such cytotoxic,
30 cytostatic, luminescent, and/or radioactive moieties are, for example, maytansine derivatives
   (such as DM1), enterotoxins (such as a Staphlyococcal enterotoxin), iodine isotopes (such as
   iodine-125), technetium isotopes (such as Tc-99m), cyanine fluorochromes (such as
   Cy5.5.18), ribosome-inactivating proteins (such as bouganin, gelonin, or saporin-S6), and
   calicheamicin, a cytotoxic substance that is part of a product marketed under the trademark
35 MYLOTARGm (Wyeth-Ayerst).
            An antibody may contain only a single heavy or light chain variable region,
   optionally fused to another portion of an antibody as described in US Patent Application
                                                       46

   2004/058820, the portions of which describe these single domain antibodies are incorporated
   herein by reference.
            Some naturally-occurring antibodies, which have been found in camels and llamas,
   are dimers consisting of two heavy chains and include no light chains. Muldermans et al.,
 5 2001, J. Biotechnol. 74:277-302; Desmyter et al., 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:26285-90, the
   portions of which describe the structures of these antibodies are incorporated herein by
   reference. Anti-BTNL3 antibodies having this structure are among the anti-BTNL3
   antibodies of the invention.
            Anti-BTNL3 antibodies can have a variety of activities and uses. Anti-BTNL3
10 antibodies may be antagonistic antibodies that block or inhibit the biological function of
   BTNL3, for example by blocking or antagonizing BTNL3-dependent inhibition of T cell
   proliferation, which can be assayed by the methods described in the Examples herein. The
   antibodies can also be agonistic antibodies. In some embodiments, agonistic antibodies can
   bind to the BTNL3 counterstructure and mimic BTNL3 binding to inhibit T cell activation or
15 proliferation. Agonistic antibodies may also be anti-idiotypic antibodies that bind to anti
   BTNL3 antibodies and/or also bind to the BTNL3 counterstructure and mimic the activity of
   BTNL3, that is, they inhibit the proliferation of T cells as described herein. Such agonistic
   anti-BTNL3 antibodies can be used for the same uses as a BTNL3 protein. Anti-BTNL3
   antibodies can be agonistic or antagonistic by, for example, stabilizing or disrupting the
20 BTNL3 protein, possibly in combination with other proteins, on the cell surface. For
   example, an agonistic antibody may enhance the activity of BTNL3 by stabilizing the
   transmembrane form of BTNL3, or by stabilizing the interaction of a BTNL3 protein with
   other BTNL3 proteins or different proteins on the surface of a cell or the clustering of BTNL3
   protein on the surface of cells. Further, an antagonistic antibody may inhibit BTNL3 activity
25 by destabilizing the transmembrane form of BTNL3, or by destabilizing interactions among
   multiple molecules of BTNL3 or interactions of BTNL3 with other proteins, on the cell
   surface of cells. Agonistic anti-BNTL3 antibodies can also bind transmembrane forms of
   BTNL3, causing it to transduce a biological signal into the cell on which it is expressed. Such
   a signal, may, for example, decrease or increase the immune function of an immune cell, e.g.,
30 a neutrophil, expressing BTNL3. In some embodiments, an agonistic anti-BTNL3 antibody
   may cause a decrease in proliferation or cell death of cells expressing BTNL3, such as cancer
   cells or neutrophils. An antagonistic anti-BTNL3 antibody can be used to enhance an
   immune response. Hence, antagonistic anti-BNTL3 antibodies can find use, for example, in
   the treatment of cancer or in a vaccine, for example in a vaccine to induce a response to a
35 cancer-specific antigen.

   WO 2014/015148                                                                  PCT/US2013/051097
             Anti-BTNL3 antibodies can be conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic, luminescent,
   and/or radioactive moiety. Such antibodies can be used to locate, to inhibit proliferation of,
   or to kill cells that express BTNL3. Since some cancer cells express BTNL3, such antibody
   conjugates can be used to treat such cancers. Similarly, since neutrophils express BTNL3,
 5 such antibody conjugates can be used to treat conditions characterized by excessive numbers
   of neutrophils or excessive neutrophil activity, for example, asthma, inflammatory bowel
   disease including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, COPD, and gout and related
   inflammatory crystal deposition diseases. Among such cytotoxic, cytostatic, luminescent,
   and/or radioactive moieties are, for example, maytansine derivatives (such as DM1),
10 enterotoxins (such as a Staphylococcal enterotoxin), iodine isotopes (such as iodine-125),
   technetium isotopes (such as Tc-99m), cyanine fluorochromes (such as Cy5.5.18), ribosome
   inactivating proteins (such as bouganin, gelonin, or saporin-S6), and calicheamicin, a
   cytotoxic substance that is part of a product marketed under the trademark MYLOTARGE
   (Wyeth-Ayerst).
15           The antibodies of the invention can also be used in assays to detect the presence of
   the BTNL3 proteins of the invention, either in vitro or in vivo. The antibodies also can be
   employed in purifying BTNL3 proteins of the invention by immunoaffinity chromatography.
                           Agonists and Antagonists of BTNL3 Polypeptides
20           In addition to antagonistic or agonistic antibodies, other antibody-related molecules
   that can bind specifically BTNL3 proteins, such as affibodies (R5nnmark et al. (2002), J.
   Immunol. Methods 261(1-2): 199-211, the portion of which describes affibodies is
   incorporated by reference herein) and the biologically active peptides described in
   International Application WO 00/24782 (the portions of which describe these peptides are
25 incorporated herein by reference) that can bind specifically to BTNL3 and inhibit the
   biological activity of BTNL3 proteins are encompassed by the invention. Further, BTNL3
   antagonists include the nucleic acids described above that are useful for modulating
   expression of BTNL3 protein and/or mRNA, such as, for example, interfering RNAs (or
   DNAs that encode them) or antisense RNAs or DNAs.
30           Antagonists further include proteins that comprise amino acid sequences selected in
   vitro to bind to BTNL3 or its receptor and that can, optionally, interfere with the interaction
   of BTNL3 and its receptor. In some embodiments such proteins can be variant forms of
   BTNL3 that lack the normal activity of BTNL3 and essentially act as decoys. Alternatively,
   such proteins can be BTNL3 agonists that promote or mimic the biological function of
35 BTNL3. Proteins that bind to BTNL3 or its receptor can be screened for their ability to
   interfere with the interaction of BTNL3 with its receptor, or, alternatively, a selection can be
                                                     48

   WO 2014/015148                                                                PCT/US2013/051097
   designed to obtain such proteins directly. Alternatively, a BTNL3 antagonist can be a variant
   BTNL3 protein that interferes with the biological activity of the wild type BTNL3 protein, for
   example, a soluble, biologically inactive BTNL3 variant that blocks the interaction of wild
   type BTNL3 with its receptor.
 5          Proteins may be selected by a number of methods such as, for example, phage display
   or display of the surface of a bacterium. See e.g. Parmley and Smith (1989), Adv. Exp. Med.
   Biol. 251: 215-218; Luzzago et al. (1995), Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 1: 149-83; Lu et al.
   (1995), Biotechnology (NY) 13(4): 366-372. In these methods, each member of a library of
   binding domains can be displayed on individual phage particles or bacterial cells, and bacteria
10 or phage that bind to a protein of interest under chosen conditions can be selected. Nucleic
   acids encoding the selected binding domains can be obtained by growing the selected phage
   or bacteria and isolating nucleic acids from them.
            Alternatively, a protein can be selected entirely in vitro. For example, each
   individual polypeptide in a library of potential binding domains can be attached to nucleic
15 acids encoding it, and those that bind to the protein of interest under chosen conditions can be
   selected. Since the polypeptides are attached to nucleic acids encoding them, subsequent
   operations, such as amplifying, cloning, or sequencing nucleic acids encoding effective
   binding domains are facilitated. Various schemes for such selections are known in the art,
   including antibody-ribosome-mRNA particles, ribosome display, covalent RNA-peptide
20 fusions, or covalent DNA-RNA-peptide fusions. He and Taussig (1997), Nucleic Acids. Res.

30                                         Therapeutic Uses
            It is demonstrated herein that a BTNL3.Fc fusion protein can inhibit proliferation of
   activated T cells. See Example 4; Figure 5. BTNL3 also reduces the activation state of CD4+
   T cells in response to an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody as reflected in a changed gene
   expression profile. See Example 5; Figure 6. Also, it is shown herein that BTNL3 is
35 relatively highly expressed on neutrophils and some kinds of cancer cells. Figures 2 and 4.
   In some situations, polymorphic forms of BTNL3 expressed on neutrophils could possibly
   alter immune homeostasis. Hence, BTNL3, or a molecule with the ability to agonize the
                                                   49

   WO 2014/015148                                                                  PCT/US2013/051097
   BTNL3 pathway, may be useful as a therapeutic to treat autoimmune or inflammatory
   diseases that are mediated by T cells or neutrophils. These diseases include, for example,
   arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis,
   Addison's disease, asthma, polyglandular endocrinopathy syndromes, systemic lupus
 5 erythematosus, chronic active hepatitis, thyroiditis, lymphocytic adenohypophysitis,
   premature ovarian failure, idiopathic phyoparathyroidism, pernicious anemia,
   glomerulonephritis, autoimmune neutropenia, Goodpasture's syndrome, myasthenia gravis,
   scleroderma, primary Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, an
   inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, psoriasis,
10 dermatitis, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma,
   type 1 and type 2 diabetes, transplantation-related conditions such as graft rejection or graft
   versus host disease, gout and related inflammatory crystal deposition diseases, or a fibrotic
   disease, such as atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis,
   scleroderma, kidney transplant fibrosis, kidney allograft nephropathy, pulmonary fibrosis,
15 including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, pemphigus
   vulgaris, acute rheumatic fever, mixed essential cryoglobulinemia, and warm autoimmune
   hemolytic anemia, among many others.
             BTNL3 antagonists that block or inhibit the BTNL3 pathway can find use in
   oncology settings. As explained above, BTNL3 antagonists can include, for example, anti
20 BTNL3 antibodies or variant forms of a BTNL3 protein that interfere with binding of
   endogenous BTNL3 proteins expressed on a cell membrane and their receptors. As shown
   below, BTNL3 is relatively highly expressed in certain cancer cells. Example 3; Figure 4.
   This suggests that the ability of BTNL3 to inhibit activation of T cells might play a role in the
   ability of cancer cells to evade elimination by the immune system.
25           An antibody that binds to either BTNL3 or its receptor and can block or inhibit the
   interaction between these molecules can be used as a therapeutic to treat cancer. Other
   antagonists of BTNL3 described above could also be used. Some of the various cancers that
   might be treated with a BTNL3 pathway blocker include acute or chronic leukemias,
   lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic leukemias,
30 lymphocytic or cutaneous lymphomas, carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, sarcomas, thymomas,
   neoplasms of the mediastinum, breast cancer, prostate cancer, cancers of the head and neck,
   lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, various kinds of skin cancer,
   cancer of the bladder, malignant gliomas, cancers of the gastrointestinal system including
   cancer of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, or rectum, cancer of the pancreas,

   cancer of the urethra or penis, gynecologic tumors, ovarian cancer, sarcomas of the bone,

   cancers of the endocrine system, cutaneous melanoma, intraocular melanoma, neoplasms of
   the central nervous system, and plasma cell neoplasms, among many other cancers.
            Similarly, BTNL3 antagonists, including anti-BTNL3 antibodies, can be used as a
   therapeutic to treat infection by a wide variety of pathogens. This may be particularly
 5 important where a pathogen can suppress T cell response. Pathogenic infections that can be
   treated with a BTNL3 antagonist include, without limitation, infections by viruses, bacteria,
   fungi, and various eukaryotic pathogens including malaria, i.e., members of the species
   Plasmodium, the species Leishmania, nematodes, and helminths, e.g., the species Ascarus,
   among many others. In some embodiments, the BTNL3 antagonist can be administered
10 before, concurrently with, or after administration of an antigen that is all or some portion of
   the pathogen or is similar enough to all or some portion of the pathogen that it can elicit an
   immune response to the pathogen.
            A BTNL3 antagonist can also find use as an agent to make a vaccine more effective.
   BTNL3 could be used with a vaccine to induce a response against any antigen. Among these
15 antigens are antigens that are highly expressed on cancer cells, such as cells from the cancers
   mentioned above. Among these cancer antigens are the following human proteins: WT1,

   (also known as B7-1), PDGFRP, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA, also known as
   glutamate carboxypeptidase 2, among many other names). Cancer antigens also include the
   human herpes virus 4 protein LMP2, the human papillomavirus proteins E6 and E7, and the
   glycoceramide globo H (as described in Gilewski et al (2001), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98(6):
 5 3270-3275, the portions of which describe globo H are incorporated herein by reference), the
   a4 subunit of the a4p1 and a4p7 integrins, the a4P7 integrin, BAFF, APRIL, CD2, CD3,
   CD20, CD52, CD73, CD80, CD86, the C5 complement protein, IgE, IL-1 , IL-5, IL-6R, IL
   12, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF a).
            When used to make a vaccine more effective, a BTNL3 antagonist, for example, an
10 anti-BTNL3 antibody, can be administered before, concurrently with, or after an antigen. The
   antigen can be a part or all of a cancer antigen as described above. An antigen can also be
   part or all of a pathogen, or a molecule similar to part or all of a pathogen, part or all of a
   molecule that is expressed specifically on the surface of any cell that mediates a disease, a
   soluble antigen secreted by cells, or a molecule that can elicit a immune response to a
15 pathogen.
            A molecule that agonizes intracellular signaling through BTNL3, can serve as a
   treatment for a cancer where the cancer cells express BTNL3. Similarly, an inflammatory
   disease mediated by immune cells expressing BTNL3, for example neutrophils, can be treated
   with a molecule that agonizes intracellular signaling through BTNL3. Such an agonist can be
20 an anti-BTNL3 antibody, and the intracellular signaling may be mediated through the B30.2
   domain of BTNL3.
            Thus, molecules that can bind to BTNL3 expressed on a neutrophil, thereby
   downregulating or inhibiting proliferation of the neutrophil, can be useful treatments in
   conditions where there is an excess of neutrophils or excessive neutrophil activity, for
25 example, in congestive obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, inflammatory bowel
   disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and gout and related inflammatory
   crystal deposition diseases. Such molecules can include anti-BTNL3 antibodies.
            On the other hand, molecules that encourage neutrophil proliferation can be useful in
   patients with neutropenia, who are susceptible to infection. Such patients include patients that
30 have received chemotherapy or radiation for cancer, patients that have been exposed to toxic
   chemicals or drugs, or patients that have certain autoimmune diseases. Molecules that bind to
   BTNL3 on the surface of a neutrophil in such a way as to prevent intracellular signals of
   downregulation or inhibition of proliferation can be useful treatments for such patients. Such
   molecules can include anti-BTNL3 antibodies. Further, molecules that act as decoys, thereby
35 preventing the interaction of BTNL3 expressed on a neutrophil with a ligand that ordinarily
   binds to BTNL3 thereby downregulating or inhibiting proliferation of the neutrophil on which

   BTNL3 is expressed, can be treatments for such conditions. Such molecules can include a
   BTNL3 protein or variants thereof
             In addition, an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic, luminescent, and/or
   radioactive moiety as described above can be used to treat a cancer in which the cancer cells
 5 express BTNL3 or can be used to treat an inflammatory or autoimmune disease characterized
   by increased numbers of neutrophils, for example, asthma, COPD, inflammatory bowel
   disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and gout and related inflammatory
   crystal deposition diseases.
             "Treatment" of any disease mentioned herein encompasses an alleviation of at least
10 one symptom of the disease, a reduction in the severity of the disease, or the delay or
   prevention of disease progression to more serious symptoms that may, in some cases,
   accompany the disease or lead to at least one other disease. Treatment need not mean that the
   disease is totally cured. A useful therapeutic agent needs only to reduce the severity of a
   disease, reduce the severity of one or more symptoms associated with the disease or its
15 treatment, or delay the onset of more serious symptoms or a more serious disease that can
   occur with some frequency following the treated condition. For example, if the disease is an
   inflammatory bowel disease, a therapeutic agent may reduce the number of distinct sites of
   inflammation in the gut, the total extent of the gut affected, reduce pain and/or swelling,
   reduce symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, or vomiting, and/or prevent perforation of
20 the gut. A patient's condition can be assessed by standard techniques such as an x-ray
   performed following a barium enema or enteroclysis, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and/or a
   biopsy. Suitable procedures vary according to the patient's condition and symptoms.
             A "therapeutically effective amount" of a drug used to treat a disease is an amount
   that can reduce the severity of a disease, reduce the severity of one or more symptoms
25 associated with the disease or its treatment, or delay the onset of more serious symptoms or a
   more serious disease that can occur with some frequency following the treated condition.
             The invention encompasses a method of treating inflammatory diseases such as
   arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis,
   Addison's disease, asthma, polyglandular endocrinopathy syndromes, systemic lupus
30 erythematosus, chronic active hepatitis, thyroiditis, lymphocytic adenohypophysitis,
   premature ovarian failure, idiopathic phyoparathyroidism, pernicious anemia,
   glomerulonephritis, autoimmune neutropenia, Goodpasture's syndrome, myasthenia gravis,
   scleroderma, primary Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, an
   inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, psoriasis,
35 dermatitis, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma,
   type 1 and type 2 diabetes, transplantation-related conditions such as graft rejection or graft
   versus host disease, gout and related inflammatory crystal deposition diseases, or a fibrotic
                                                    53

   WO 2014/015148                                                                PCT/US2013/051097
   disease, such as atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis,
   scleroderma, kidney transplant fibrosis, kidney allograft nephropathy, pulmonary fibrosis,
   including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, pemphigus
   vulgaris, acute rheumatic fever, mixed essential cryoglobulinemia, and warm autoimmune
 5 hemolytic anemia, among many others.
             . Such treatment involves using a therapeutically effective amount of a BTNL3
   protein, or an agonistic antibody that binds to BTNL3 or its receptor, for a time sufficient to
   induce a sustained improvement over baseline of an indicator that reflects the severity of a
   particular disorder or the severity of symptoms caused by the disorder or to delay or prevent
10 the onset of a more serious disease that follows the treated condition in some or all cases. The
   treatments of the invention may be used before, after, or during other treatments for the
   disorder in question that are commonly used, or they may be used without other treatments.
   For example, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are commonly treated with sulfasalazine,
   5-aminosalicylic acid, or corticosteroids. These treatments may be used before, during, or
15 after treatments using a BTNL3 protein or an agonist or antagonist thereof.
             Similarly, cancer is often treated with chemotherapeutic agents and such agents can
   be used along with the BTNL3 antagonist therapeutics, such as anti-BTNL3 antibodies,
   described herein. In some embodiments, the BTNL3 antagonist can be administered before,
   concurrently with, or after a chemotherapeutic agent. Chemotherapeutic agents include, for
20 example, the following therapeutics: alkylating agents (e.g. busulfan, temozolomide,
   cyclophosphamide, lomustine (CCNU), methyllomustine, streptozotocin, cis-diamminedi
   chloroplatinum, aziridinylbenzo-quinone, and thiotepa); inorganic ions (e.g. cisplatin and
   carboplatin); nitrogen mustards (e.g. melphalan hydrochloride, ifosfamide, chlorambucil, and
   mechlorethamine HCl); nitrosoureas (e.g. carmustine (BCNU)); anti-neoplastic antibiotics
25 (e.g. adriamycin (doxorubicin), daunomycin, mitomycin C, daunorubicin, idarubicin,
   mithramycin, and bleomycin); plant derivatives (e.g. vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine,
   paclitaxel, docetaxel, vindesine, VP-16, and VM-26); antimetabolites (e.g. methotrexate with
   or without leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil with or without leucovorin, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, 6
   mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-azacytidine, hydroxyurea, deoxycoformycin,
30 gemcitabine, and fludarabine); podophyllotoxins (e.g. etoposide, irinotecan, and topotecan);
   as well as actinomycin D, dacarbazine (DTIC), mAMSA, procarbazine,
   hexamethylmelamine, pentamethylmelamine, L-asparaginase, and mitoxantrone, among
   many known in the art. See e.g. Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology,     4 th Edition,
   DeVita et al., eds., J.B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, PA (1993), the relevant portions of
35 which are incorporated herein by reference.

             Cancer is also commonly treated by a variety of methods with a variety of forms of
   radiation. It is contemplated herein that the administration of a BTNL3 antagonist to a cancer
   patient can occur before, concurrently with, or after radiation treatment or any other anti
   neoplastic treatment.
 5           For autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, T cells can be removed from a patient,
   for example, through apheresis, and stimulated ex vivo using BTNL3, optionally plus other
   proteins, such that the T cells attain a regulatory or inhibitory phenotype. The T cells can
   then be transferred back into the patient. To stimulate the T cells to attain a regulatory or
   inhibitory phenotype, they can be incubated in the presence of a surface, for example, with
10 beads or in microtiter plate well, that is coated with human T cell agonistic anti-CD3
   antibody, rBTNL3.Fc, and rB7-1.Fc or rB7-2.Fc in the presence of TGF-beta and IL-2.
   Alternatively, the surface could be coated with a combination of proteins that includes
   rBTNL3 or BTNL3.Fc plus an agonistic anti-CD3 antibody or a combination that includes
   only these proteins. In one embodiment, the agonistic anti-CD3 antibody, rBTNL3.Fc, and
15 rB7-1.Fc or rB7-2.Fc can be, for example, at a molecular weight ratio of 2:10:2.5. The TGF
   beta and IL-2 can be at appropriate concentrations, such as, for example, from about 0.05 to 5
   ng/ml for TGF-beta and from about 0.5 to 10 ng/ml for IL-2. This can program the T cells to
   become inhibitory or regulatory, resulting in an "expansion" of regulatory T ("T reg") cells.
   "Expansion" of T reg cells means that the ratio of T reg cells (CD3 FOXP3) to T cells as a
20 whole (CD3 FOXP3-) becomes greater. This ratio can be determined by FACS analysis
   using antibodies to detect cell proteins, a method well known in the art. See, e.g., Swanson et
   al. (2013), J. Immunol. 190: 2027-2035, the relevant portions of which are incorporated
   herein by reference. The T cells can be incubated in such a setting for, e.g., three to seven
   days and then harvested and delivered back to the same patient. Optionally, the T cells can be
25 incubated about three, four, five, six, or seven days. In some embodiments, the T cells can
   also be rested, i.e., cultured in the presence of, for example, IL-2, without T cell receptor or
   costimulatory stimulus, and then restimulated as explained above one to four more times.
   The autoimmune or inflammatory conditions treatable with such a regime include, for
   example, arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and psoriatic
30 arthritis, Addison's disease, asthma, polyglandular endocrinopathy syndromes, systemic lupus
   erythematosus, chronic active hepatitis, thyroiditis, lymphocytic adenohypophysitis,
   premature ovarian failure, idiopathic phyoparathyroidism, pernicious anemia,
   glomerulonephritis, autoimmune neutropenia, Goodpasture's syndrome, myasthenia gravis,
   scleroderma, primary Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, an
35 inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, psoriasis,
   dermatitis, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma,

   hemolytic anemia, among many others.
            Any of the above-described therapeutic agents can be administered in the form of a
   composition, that is, with one or more additional components such as a physiologically
10 acceptable carrier, excipient, or diluent. For example, a composition may comprise a soluble
   BTNL3 protein, an anti-BTNL3 antibody, or a BTNL3 agonist or antagonist as described
   herein plus a buffer, an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid, a low molecular weight polypeptide
   (such as those having less than 10 amino acids), a protein, amino acids, carbohydrates such as
   glucose, sucrose, or dextrins, chelating agent such as EDTA, glutathione, and/or other
15 stabilizers, excipients, and/or preservatives. The composition may be formulated as a liquid
   or a lyophilizate. Further examples of components that may be employed in pharmaceutical
   formulations are presented in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,          16 th Ed., Mack
   Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., (1980), the relevant portions of which are incorporated
   herein by reference.
20          Compositions comprising therapeutic molecules described above can be administered
   by any appropriate means including, but not limited to, parenteral, topical, oral, nasal,
   vaginal, rectal, or pulmonary (by inhalation) administration. If injected, the composition(s)
   can be administered intra-articularly, intravenously, intraarterially, intramuscularly,
   intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Localized
25 administration, that is, at the site of disease, is contemplated, as are transdermal delivery and
   sustained release from implants, skin patches, or suppositories. Delivery by inhalation
   includes, for example, nasal or oral inhalation, use of a nebulizer, inhalation in aerosol form,
   and the like. Administration via a suppository inserted into a body cavity can be
   accomplished, for example, by inserting a solid form of the composition in a chosen body
30 cavity and allowing it to dissolve. Other alternatives include eye drops, oral preparations
   such as pills, lozenges, syrups, and chewing gum, and topical preparations such as lotions,
   gels, sprays, and ointments. In most cases, therapeutic molecules that are polypeptides can be
   administered topically or by injection or inhalation.
            The therapeutic molecules described above can be administered at any dosage,
35 frequency, and duration that can be effective to treat the condition being treated. The dosage
   depends on the molecular nature of the therapeutic molecule and the nature of the disorder

   being treated. Treatment may be continued as long as necessary to achieve the desired
   results. The periodicity of treatment may or may not be constant throughout the duration of
   the treatment. For example, treatment may initially occur at weekly intervals and later occur
   every other week. Treatments having durations of days, weeks, months, or years are
 5 encompassed by the invention. Treatment may be discontinued and then restarted.
   Maintenance doses may be administered after an initial treatment.
            Dosage may be measured as milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) or as
   milligrams per square meter of skin surface (mg/m 2 ) or as a fixed dose, irrespective of height
   or weight. These are standard dosage units in the art. A person's skin surface area is
10 calculated from her height and weight using a standard formula. For example, a therapeutic
   BTNL3 protein or an antibody that binds to BTNL3 or its receptor can be administered at a
   dose of from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg or from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 1.0
   mg/kg. Alternatively, a dose of from about 1 mg to about 500 mg can be administered. Or a
   dose of about 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg, 35 mg, 40, mg, 45, mg, 50 mg, 55
15 mg, 60 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg can be administered.
            The invention is described below with reference to specific examples. These
   examples are not meant to limit the invention in any way. It is understood for purposes of this
   disclosure, that various changes and modifications may be made to the invention that are well
   within the scope of the invention. Numerous other changes may be made which will readily
20 suggest themselves to those skilled in the art and which are encompassed in the spirit of the
   invention disclosed herein and as defined in the appended claims.
                                             EXAMPLES
   Example 1: Expression ofmRNA encoding human BTNL3 protein in human immune
25 cells
            The following experiments were done in order to gather information on expression of
   mRNA encoding human BTNL3 in primary human immune cells.
            Primary immune cells were isolated from whole blood or leukopaks via various
   commercially available selection methods from Stem Cell Sciences (Palo Alto, California) or
30 Miltenyi Biotech (Germany). For example, the EASYSEP* Human T cell enrichment kit
   and/or the CD4+ T cell enrichment kit (both from Stem Cell Sciences), was used to isolate
   CD4+ T cells, while monocytes were isolated using the Miltenyi Monocyte Isolation Kit II.
   Such cell separations using such commercially available reagents are routine in the art.
   Macrophages were obtained through the ex vivo maturation of negatively-selected monocytes
35 for seven days. Each isolated cell population was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell
   sorting (FACS) to determine whether the isolated cell population was expressing the expected
                                                   57

   WO 2014/015148                                                               PCT/US2013/051097
   cell surface proteins. RNA was isolated and assessed by Affymetrix array (Affymetrix
   GENECHIPm HG-U1333 Plus 2.0). Data normalization and analysis for human BTNL3
   transcript detection was performed using ROSETTA RESOLVER® software (Rosetta
   Biosoftware, Cambridge, MA, USA).
 5          The results of these analyses are shown in Figure 2. The cells type tested included
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ Tcells, B cells, monocytes,
   macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and NK cells. Among cell types tested, neutrophils
   (lane 8 in Figure 2) expressed the highest amounts of BTNL3.
10 Example 2: Preparation of Human BTNL3.Fc
            The following describes how a fusion protein containing the extracellular region of
   human BTNL3, a linker, and the Fc portion of a human IgGi antibody was made. A cDNA
   in an appropriate vector was constructed encoding the extracellular domain of human BTNL3,
   that is amino acids 1 to 236 of SEQ ID NO:2, fused to a linker plus a human IgGi Fc
15 fragment. SEQ ID NO:5 provides the sequence of this cDNA, and SEQ ID NO:6 provides
   the amino acid sequence of the BTNL3.Fc protein encoded by this cDNA, including the
   signal sequence. The mature BTNL3.Fc protein sequence, that is, lacking the signal
   sequence, is provided in SEQ ID NO:7. Cos PKB cells were transfected with the BTNL3.Fc
   mammalian expression construct using LIPOFECTAMINET 2000 (Invitrogen) and cultured
20 in complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 0.5% Low Ig Serum. These
   methods are described in detail by Ettehadieh et al., OVEREXPRESSION OF PROTEIN KINASE
   Ba ENHANCES RECOMBINANT PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN TRANSIENT SYSTEMS in Animal                  Cell
   Technology: From Target to Market: Proceedings of the      1 7 th ESACT Meeting, Tyl5sand,
   Sweden, June 10-14, 2001, Vol. 1, Lindner-Olsson et al., eds., pp. 31-35, Springer, 2001. The
25 portions of this reference describing how to make a recombinant protein are incorporated
   herein by reference. Seven days post transfection, supernatants were harvested, and the
   BTNL3.Fc protein was purified by Protein A column chromatography (MABSELECTE
   SuRe column, GE Healthcare).
            The size of the resulting protein was determined by gel electrophoresis and size
30 exclusion chromatography (SEC). It was expected that the protein would be dimeric because
   of the presence of the Fc region, which causes dimerization due to noncovalent interactions
   between CH3 regions and disulfide bonds formed between hinge regions. If the protein were a
   dimer, its expected molecular weight would likely be in excess of about 120 kD due to
   variable glycosylation. Similarly, its expected molecular weight under reducing conditions,
35 in which it would be expected to be monomeric, would be at least about 60 kD. On a
   reducing gel, a number of bands were observed, most of which were between about 50 and 64
   kD. The observed molecular weight of the main peak by SEC under non-reducing conditions
                                                   58

   WO 2014/015148                                                               PCT/US2013/051097
   was about 140 kD, although both higher and lower molecular weight species were also
   observed. These data indicate that the protein is at least dimeric under non-reducing
   conditions and that it likely also forms higher order multimers.
 5 Example 3: Expression of BTNL3 in Human Normal and Tumor Tissue
              To determine the level of expression of BTNL3 at the RNA level in human normal
   and tumor tissue, RNA was isolated and assessed by next-generation sequencing analysis. In
   particular, the TruSeq® (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California) reagents were used to prepare
   samples and reactions that were processed in a HiSeq* 2000 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego,
10 California) sequencing system. Data was analyzed to quantify the number of BTNL3 RNAs
   per cell. The results of this analysis for normal human tissues are shown in Figure 3. Little or
   no BTNL3 expression was detected in most tissues, but higher levels of expression were
   detected in samples from colon and small intestine. Thus, BTNL3, like BTNL2, is expressed
   primarily in the gut.
15           Similar methods were used to determine levels of BTNL3 RNA expression in various
   human tumor tissue samples. These results are shown in Figure 4. Moderate levels of
   BTNL3 expression were detected in several different adenocarcinoma samples, but not in all
   tumor tissues. In addition, moderate and high levels of BTNL3 expression were detected in
   some samples from type II diabetes patients, suggesting that BTNL3 could play a role in
20 mediating or responding to this disease in some cases.
   Example 4: In Vitro Analysis of Murine CD4' T Cell Proliferation
             The following experiment was done to determine the effects of a human BTNL3:Fc
   fusion protein on the proliferation of mouse CD4+ T cells in vitro.
25           A single cell splenocyte suspension, which was prepared from spleens harvested from
   at least five female C57BL/6 mice per experiment, was used to purify CD4+ T cells with the
   mouse EASYSEPIm CD4+ negative selection kit (Stem Cell Sciences). Purity of CD4+ T cells
   was greater than 90% as assessed by FACS analysis. Tissue culture-treated microtiter plates
   were coated with variable concentrations of an anti-mouse CD3 monoclonal antibody (Clone
30 2C1 1, BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and the Fc fusion protein indicated
   in the brief description of Figure 5. Each well was equalized for total protein content using
   human IgG (Sigma). All coatings/dilutions were done in PBS. Plates were incubated
   overnight. Wells were then washed with PBS, and then 1-2 x 105 purified CD4+
   splenocytes/well were added. Proliferation of the CD4+ T cells was determined by
35 incorporation of 3H-thymidine (1 gCi/well) during the last 6 hours of the 72 hour culture.
   Human IgG was used as a negative control. As positive controls, mouse BTNL2.Fc, which
                                                   59

   had been previously shown to inhibit proliferation of T cells, and human B7-2-Fc (R & D
   Biosystems), a known positive costimulator of T cells, were also included.
            The results are shown in Figure 5. Lane 1 in Figure 5 represents a negative control
   assay containing no immobilized protein and no additional protein. Lanes 2 and 3 show
 5 results from positive control assays containing immobilized anti-mouse CD3 antibody plus
   either human IgG (lane 2) or a human B7-2-Fc protein. Lane 4 shows results from an assay
   containing immobilized anti-mouse CD3 antibody plus mouse BTNL2.Fc, a negative
   costimulatory molecule. Lane 5 shows results of an assay containing immobilized anti-mouse
   CD3 antibody plus human BTNL3.Fc. Lanes 6 and 7 show results from an assay using
10 immobilized human IgG plus either mouse BTNL2.Fc (lane 6) or human BTNL3.Fc (lane 7).
   These data confirm the stimulatory effect of human B7-2-Fc and the inhibitory effect of
   mouse BTNL2.Fc on mouse T cell proliferation and indicate that human BTNL3.Fc can
   inhibit mouse T cell proliferation. These data suggest that a human BTNL3.Fc fusion protein
   can have effects on murine T cells similar to those observed using a murine BNTL2.Fc fusion
15 protein. Furthermore, these data suggest that human BTNL3 can interact with a receptor on
   murine T cells, despite the fact that a close murine homolog of human BTNL3 has not been
   isolated
   Example 5: Effects of BTNL3.Fc on Gene Expression of mouse CD4+ T cells
20          In a standard anti-CD3 proliferation assay, mouse CD4t T cells were isolated as
   described above and stimulated with an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody plus no additional
   protein, immobilized mouse BTNL2.Fc, or immobilized human BTNL3.Fc. Proliferation was
   measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation. After 24 hours of stimulation, RNA was isolated
   from the cells and analyzed by Affymetrix cDNA chips to determine levels of expression of a
25 large variety of sequences. Results are shown in Figure 6 and Table 4 below. Stimulation of
   murine CD4+ cells with an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody upregulated the expression many
   immunoregulatory and inflammatory genes as expected. Inclusion of murine BTNL2.Fc or
   human BTNL3.Fc dampened this response.
            In Figure 6, a black dot represents the relative amount of expression of a particular
30 sequence observed in stimulated as compared to unstimulated cells. Sequences with no
   significant difference in expression between stimulated and un-stimulated cells are not
   represented in Figure 6. In Figure 6, the left panel shows data from cells stimulated with an
   anti-CD3 antibody alone, the middle panel shows data from cells stimulated with an anti-CD3
   antibody plus a murine BTNL2.Fc fusion protein, and the right panel shows data from cells
35 stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody plus a human BTNL3.Fc fusion protein. These data
   show that the expression of many genes is significantly up- or down-regulated by 24 hours of
   stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody. However, addition of either murine BTNL2.Fc or
                                                   60

   human BTNL3.Fc substantially reduces this number of genes. These data confirm that
   BTNL2.Fc is a negative costimulator and indicate that BTNL3.Fc is also a negative
   costimulator. Thus, these results indicate that both molecules inhibit the activation of murine
   CD4+ T cells by anti-CD3 antibody.
 5          Table 4 below provides additional numeric data from this experiment. Out of 45,060
   sequences assayed, expression of many (26,530) sequences was not changed in a statistically
   significant manner by stimulation with an anti-CD3 antibody alone. However, expression of
   8,631 and 9,899 sequences was significantly up- or down-regulated, respectively, upon
   stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody alone. These numbers were substantially decreased when
10 either murine BTNL2.Fc or human BTNL3.Fc was added. Hence, both BTNL2 and BTNL3
   inhibit the activation of T cells.
