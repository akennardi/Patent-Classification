   A  DEVICE FOR THE POSITIONING OF A NUMBER OF SUPPORTS ON A RAIL
   The present invention concerns a device for the positioning of
   a number of supports on a rail and a table with the same.
 5
   Known devices of such a type usually comprise a screw of, for
   instance, the trapezoidal type having a nut, on which the
   support is arranged. The screw is coupled to a servomotor for
   the rotation of the same and thereby movement of the nut with
10 the support to a desired position. This means that only one
   nut having support can be arranged on each screw. A table unit
   with eight screws has only eight supports and requires eight
   servomotors, one for each screw. If an application surface of
   five table units is required for the deployment and assembling
15 of a desired frame e.g.,  a roof truss, forty screws and forty
   servomotors will be required, which still only renders forty
   supports. According to prior art, an increase of the number of
   supports would mean large difficulties in addition to the
   large drawbacks of the large number of servomotors and control
20 systems associated therewith.
   The object of simplifying devices according to prior art, and
    simultaneously making the same more versatile by an increase
   of the number of possible supports, forms the basis of the
25 present invention.
   According to the present invention, this object is solved by
   the device mentioned by way of introduction being given the
    features of claim 1 and a table having such devices.
30
    By a device according to the present invention, it is possible
    to construct so-called jig tables, which often consist of five
    table units having eight puck grooves in each, which gives
    totally 40 puck grooves in the entire jig table arrangement.
35  By the device according to the present invention, it is

   possible to have two pucks in each groove, which are moved one
   after the other by one and the same drive chain. It is
   furthermore possible, by the device according to the present
   invention, to drive all drive chains of a table unit using a
 5 single servomotor. This is allowed thanks to, among other
   things, the arrangement of an absolute encoder being assigned
   to each puck-carrying carriage. By a jig table having devices
   according to the present invention, it is possible to, by
   means of suitable software, retrieve different job files,
10 rotate a job, e.g.,  a roof truss by 3600, flip a roof truss
   (upper side down),  move a roof truss variably in the x & y
   direction, communicate directly with laser and nailing bridge,
   communicate with Vision and press of a roof truss plant and
   presentation of a roof truss graphically in HMI. Upon manual
15 application of material parts on a jig table, it may be
   suitable to use laser as a means and upon automatic applica
   tion, it is suitable to use an additional puck in the same
   groove for pneumatic clamping. In a jig table having devices
   according to the present invention, the pucks are running on a
20 rail guide and have a lock unit, which clamps the puck in the
   correct position, wherein the pucks can be positioned by a
   common servomotor, the pucks can be set by a nailing bridge,
   and the pucks may be set by a robot.

25 One embodiment of the device according to the present
   invention will now be described in more detail, reference
   being made to the drawing figures, in which the same reference
   designations refer to the same parts and in connection with a
   plant for the manufacture of a frame, e.g.,  roof truss or the
30 like, wherein application of a number of parts forming part of
   the roof truss is included, assembling of the parts for
   allowing movement of the assembled frame for anchoring the
   parts to each other by placing and pressing-on nail plates
   across the joints between the parts of an entire roof truss or
35 a part of a roof truss.

                               14
   The invention is not limited to the use of the device
   according to the same for the manufacture of roof trusses, but
   can be used in the production of different types of frames or
 5 structures comprising parts which are to be laid out on an
   application surface for joining to each other temporary or
   permanently.
   The embodiment shown in the drawing figures of a device
10 according to the present invention comprises a beam 1 having
   an upper part 2 and a bottom part 3 in the form of,  for
   instance, a quadrangular hollow beam having a primarily
   rectangular cross section, on one short side of which the
   upper part 2 is fastened. At each edge of the upper part 1,
15 there are arranged two carriages 4, 5, 6, and 7 which are
   movable backward and forward along the edge and have each a
   support 8 in the form of a so-called puck, which extends
   partly in over the edge of the upper part 2 of the beam 1 and
   which is rotatably journalled on a shaft 9 which projects from
20 the carriage 4, 5, 6, 7 and is fastened to a puck carrier 10.
   The puck carrier 10 is mounted on a lid part 11 which in turn
   is fastened to a carriage side 12, which supports a guide bar
   13 which, together with the lid part 11,  forms a channel 14
25 for a drive chain 15. The drive chain 15 extends over sprocket
   wheels 16 at the ends of the bottom part 3, a tension sprocket
   wheel 17 and a driving sprocket wheel 18 on a drive shaft 19.
   The sprocket wheels 16 are rotatable on a shaft 20 extending
   through the bottom part 3. The tension sprocket wheels 17 are
30 rotatable on each a shaft, which extends through an elongate
   groove 21 in a U-shaped holder 22 in order to be displaceable
   along the groove 21 by means of a tightening screw 23. The U
   shaped holder 22 is fastened underneath the bottom part 3 of
   the beam 1 and rests on a fixed part so that the tightening
35 screw 23 will be able to move the shaft with the tension

   sprocket wheel 17 along the groove 21. The carrier of the
   tightening screw 23 and the tension sprocket wheel 17 at one
   edge of the beam 1 may be connected with the carrier of the
   tightening screw 23 and the tension sprocket wheel 17 at the
 5 opposite edge of the beam 1.
   The carriage side 12 of each one of the carriages 4-7  supports
   a rail guide 24 for the co-operation with a guide rail 25,
   which is mounted on the side of the bottom part 3 of the beam
10 1 under the edge of the upper part 2 of the beam 1 extending
   beyond the same and allows displacement of the carriages 4-7
   backward and forward along the beam 1 by means of the drive
   chain 15. The rail guide 22 and the proper guide rail 25 have
   such cross sections interacting with each other that the
15 carriages 4-7 cannot be removed anywhere along the beam 1 but
   only at one or the other end of the same and thereby the guide
   rail 25. The carriages 4-7 have each a lock unit 26 for the
   co-operation with the guide rail 25 in such a way that the
   carriages 4-7 individually are lockable to the guide rail 25
20 or as long as it is not a matter of concern to change the
   position of the carriage 4-7 and thereby of the puck 8 along
   the guide rail 25 and the beam 1, which means that the
   position of the carriage 4-7 is fixed on the guide rail 25 as
   long as it is not a matter of concern to move it and the puck
25 8 to a new position. Furthermore, the carriage side 12 of each
   one of the carriages 4-7 supports a cylinder lock 27 for the
   connection of the carriage 4-7 that is about to be moved with
   the drive chain 15. The cylinder locks 27 of the carriages 4-7
   are pneumatic and are coupled to a common valve package and a
30 source of compressed air.
   For the determination of the position of the carriages 4-7
   along the beam 1, a linear absolute encoder of magnetic type
   is arranged, which may be of known type per se and is marketed
35 under the trademark "Temposonics". The linear absolute encoder

                                  b
   comprises a waveguide 28, which extends along the beam 1 at
   the underside of the bottom part 3 under the guide rail 25
   to allow co-operation with a magnet-carrying arm 29, which
   is fastened to the carriage side 12 and the end of which is
 5 formed to at least partly surround the waveguide 28 as is
   seen in Fig. 6. The waveguide 28 may be tubular and be of a
   magnetostrictive type for the co-operation with a permanent
   magnet on the end of the arm 29.
   In the drawing figures 7 -  12 is seen that the guide bar 13
10 is mounted on the top of the carriage side 12 together with
   the lid 11 carrying the puck/support carrier 10. The guide
   bar 13 and the lid 11 forms the channel 14 for the drive
   chain 15.  The channel 14 extends over the cylinder lock 27
   which has a piston moveable to and from the lid 11 for
15 clamping of the drive chain 15 in the channel 14 against the
   lid 11 when the carriage 4 -  7 is to be moved. A pneumatic
   pressure is used to actuate the lock unit 27 for clamping of
   the drive chain 15 in the channel 14 against the lid 11
   during movement of the carriage 4-7.   The rail guide 24 is
20 mounted on the carriage side 12 below the guide bar 13. The
   lock unit 26 is mounted on the carriage side 12 in the same
   direction as the rail guide 24 and has moveable jaws on each
   side of the guide rail 25 for clamping on the guide rail 25
   as  long as the carriage 4-7 is be kept in position and not
25 to be moved. The jaws are spring-biased against the guide
   rail 25 with the guide rail 25 between the jaws and the jaws
   have almost the same profile as the guide rail 25 in order
   to get a firm grip against the guide rail 25. A pneumatic
   pressure is used to release the jaws from the grip on the
30 guide rail 25. The magnet carrying arm 29 is mounted on the
   carriage side 12 opposite to the rail guide 24 and extends
   under the carriage side 12 and partly surround the waveguide
   28,  so that the wave guide 28, the guide rail 25 and the
   channel 14 for the drive chain 15 are close to a vertical
35 plane perpendicular to the upper part 2 of the beam 1. When

   the carriage 4 - 7 has been released from the guide rail 25,
   the carriage 4-7 may be moved by the drive chain 15 when the
   drive chain 15 has been clamped against the lid 11 for
   movement by the drive chain 15 to a new position.   It might
 5 be possible to release and clamp at the same time or release
   slightly before clamp.
   On each side of the beam 1, a cable duct 30 is furthermore
   arranged for a cable drag 31.  On the underside, the lower
   tubular part 3 of the beam 1 supports a number of
10 attachments and supports  for the different parts included in
   the device.
   In the drawing figures 13-19, the utilization of devices
   according to the present invention is illustrated for the
   provision of a table unit,  viz. a so-called jig table unit,
15 which comprises four devices according to the drawing
   figures 1-12, which are placed side by side with spaces
   between them in a table stand consisting of a number of legs
   32 and beams 33 connecting the same. Between the devices,
   there are filling parts  34, which are of the same type as
20 the upper parts 2 of the beams 1 so as to, together with the
   same, form an application surface, and which are fastened to
   quadrangle hollow beams  35. Between the upper parts 2 and
   the filling parts 34,  grooves are formed for the puck shafts
   9 carried by the carriages 4-7,  so that the pucks 8 extend
25 in over the application surface. Conveyors 36 are arranged
   between the outer devices and the centrally placed devices
   following next. The conveyors 36 are vertically adjustable
   for raising the frame produced on the application surface
   and transporting away the same for continued processing. The
30 conveyors 36 comprise chains, which are running over
   sprocket wheels at each end and which are driven by a motor
   M.

   In Fig. 17, it is seen that the drive chains 15 of the
   different devices extend over sprocket wheels 37 of a common
   drive shaft 38, which is coupled to a motor 39 via a trans
   mission 40, so that all the chains 15 of all the devices of
 5 the table unit are driven by means of a single motor 39 via
   one and the same drive shaft 38. The pneumatic cylinder locks
   27 are, via compressed-air lines, coupled to a valve package
   41.
10 The device according to the present invention obviously allows
   the construction of a table unit of the type shown in the
   drawing figures 13-19 having two puck carriages 4-7 in each
   groove and thereby totally 16 pucks 8 on the application
   surface. The pucks 8 are placeable in the desired position one
15 after the other after the detachment of the carriage 4-7 by
   means of the lock unit 26 from the locking on the guide rail
   25 and connection of the carriage 4-7 with the drive chain 15
   by means of the lock unit 27. The lock unit 26 comprises a
   piston or clamping jaw, which clamps the guide rail 25 and is
20 spring-loaded into engagement with the guide rail 25, while
   the lock unit 27 comprises a double-acting cylinder or piston.
   By the interaction between the permanent magnet arm 29 of the
   carriage 4-7, having the puck 8 that is to be moved or
   positioned, and the tubular waveguide 28 of the linear
25 absolute encoder, the position of the puck 8 is determined
   where the drive chain 15 is released by adjusting the double
   acting piston and the clamping jaw is released for adjustment
   by means of the spring into engagement with the guide rail 25
   and thereby locking of the carriage 4-7 in the new position.
30 The lock units 26 and 27 are pneumatic and coupled to the
   valve package 41.
   The table unit described above having four devices according
   to the present invention is possible to combine with further
35 similar table units as illustrated in drawing figure 20, which

   shows five table units which are placed parallel to each other
   and interconnected by means of pipes 42 for various driving
   and control means. For instance, the absolute encoders are
   coupled to a computer system having suitable software for the
 5 deployment of the pucks and control of their positions in
   relation to basic drawing data.
   In Fig. 21, a plant for the manufacture of different types of
   roof trusses is illustrated, in which table units of the type
10 described above are included for the co-operation with a
   nailing bridge 43 of the parts of a roof truss for assembling.
   The parts are fetched from a storage 44 and are laid out on
   the application surface formed by the table units, whereupon
   the nailing bridge 43 is moved backward and forward over the
15 application surface for the assembling of the parts so that
   movement of the roof truss from the application surface to the
   table 45 and from there to tables 46 and 47 as well as further
   to the nail plate press 48 for the assembling of the parts of
   the roof truss by means of nail plates on both sides of each
20 joint can take place. From the nail plate press 48, the roof
   trusses are moved to the table 49 and then to the table 50.
   Between the table 49 and the table 50, a roll press 51 is
   arranged for the post-pressing of the nail plates. Along the
   table 49, a number of nail plate magazines 52 are arranged.
25
   Plants for the assembly of roof trusses are exemplified in the
   Swedish patent 0601495-5/530069, which is a nail plate press,
   and in the Swedish patent 0802105-7/532903, which is of the
   vision type.
30
   By the device according to the present invention, it is, as
   illustrated in Fig. 21, possible to manufacture different
   types of roof trusses one after the other by the repositioning
   of the pucks 8 on the table units by means of software for

                                              IU
computer aided design, which also controls the nailing bridge
43  and the nail plate press 48.
Numerous modifications of the embodiment described above are
possible within the scope of the general idea of the invention
defined in the subsequent claims.
