FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The present invention relates to the application of a gene encoding capsid protein of
porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2).
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART
[0002] Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general
knowledge in the field.
[0002a] Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was first discovered in Canada in the mid-1990s as the
etiological agent of postweaning and multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). PCV2 is an
emerging swine pathogen causing immense economic losses in the global swine industry.
[0003] The PCV2 genome is composed of 1767-1768 nucleotides and predicted to possess
eleven open reading frames (ORFs). Two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encode replicase (Rep)
and capsid protein (Cap) respectively. Further studies found that the Cap protein contains a
highly conserved basic aa sequence (such as arginine) at the former 41 aa of the N-terminus
resembling that of the major structural protein of chicken anemia virus. This area has a
functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the Cap protein and is an essential motif affecting
PCV2 nuclear distribution. Animals vaccinated with Cap protein can produce neutralizing
antibodies against PCV2. ORF2 has been used as a key target of developing PCV2 genetic
engineering vaccine. However, Cap protein has low production based on the current technology
using eukaryotic expression system. What's more, the isolation and purification of Cap protein is
difficult because of Cap protein contains a highly conserved basic aa sequence (such as arginine)
at the former 41 aa of the N-terminus. Most of the previous reports are prokaryotic expression
based on truncated Cap protein, the expression quantity of Cap protein is high but it is
impossible to form complete virus-like particles (VLP) because of using the truncated Cap
protein.
[0004] The isolation and purification of Cap protein is difficult because of Cap protein contains
a highly conserved basic aa sequence (such as arginine) at the former 41 aa of the N-terminus.
Most of the previous reports are prokaryotic expression based on truncated Cap protein, the
expression quantity of Cap protein is high but it is impossible to form a complete virus-like
particles (VLP) because of using the truncated Cap protein.
[0004a] It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the
disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.

[0038] The pET30a-ORF2 from example I was transformed into BL21 (E.coli), recombinant
expression bacteria BL21/pET30a-ORF2 was obtained.

for 16-18 hours and then inoculated at a ratio of 1:50 in LB medium containing 25 pg/ml
kanamycin to be further incubated in a 37' C., 200 rpm incubator until the OD. 600 nm is 0.6

and the E. coli host cells were incubated in a 37' C., 200 rpm incubator for 5 more hours. With
the negative control, the same procedure was carried out. I mL samples at each condition were

                                                   5

actual size. Next, western blotting was deployed to check whether the expressed recombinant
proteins are PCV2 ORF2 fragments. Following electrophoresis, the SDS-PAGE was transferred
onto a PVDF Nylon membrane. The resulting membrane was blocked with blocking buffer,
which is TBST (10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim
milk, for I h at room temperature to prevent non-specific binding of proteins. After that, the
proteins were identified using alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated mouse anti-His monoclonal
antibodies against the His-tag fusion proteins for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by 6
times of wash with TBST, 5 minutes for each. After wash, NBT/BCIP substrate (Bio-Rad) was
added. After 10 minutes, the reaction was stopped by adding water. The result shows in FIG. 3.

After that, isopropyl-p-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM, and
the E. coli host cells were incubated in a 37' C., 200 rpm incubator for 3 more hours. PCV2 Cap
