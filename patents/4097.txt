TRANSFORMER
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to a transformer.
Description of Related Art
[0002] For example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2008-004823 discloses a
transformer having a structure that holds primary coils formed of conductor patterns on a printed
circuit board between secondary coils formed of ring-shaped conductor plates.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0003] Unfortunately, in the transformer having the structure described in JP 2008-004823 A, in
order to secure electric insulation between the primary coils and the secondary coils,
components such as electric insulating sheets are required, for example. Consequently, in this
transformer, there are such problems that the number of components becomes increased, and
man-hours of component assembly also become increased.
[0004] The present invention provides a transformer having a structure capable of reducing the
number of components, and also reducing man-hours of component assembly, while securing
electric insulation between a primary coil and a secondary coil.
[0005] A transformer of a first aspect of the present invention includes: a first coil section
formed around a insertion hole provided on a circuit board by coiling a conductor pattern by one
round or more in a planar state; a second coil section that includes a first ring composed of a coil
formed by coiling a conductor plate by one round or more, the coil being covered with an
electric-insulating resin, the first ring being annular and being arranged on a first surface of the
circuit board such that a core of the first ring coincides with a core of the first coil section, a
second ring composed of a coil formed by coiling a conductor plate by one round or more, the
coil being covered with the electric-insulating resin, the second ring being annular and being
arranged on a second surface of the circuit board such that a core of the second ring coincides

                                                     2
with the core of the first coil section, and a coupled part formed by covering a coupled position
between the first ring and the second ring with the electric-insulating resin; and core sections
inserted through the insertion hole, the first coil section, and the second coil section, core
sections holding the circuit board from both sides of the circuit board so as to form a closed
magnetic circuit that magnetically couples the first coil section and the second coil section.
[0006] According to the first aspect of the present invention, as the second coil section, there is
employed a shape formed by coupling the annular first ring composed of a coil covered with the
electric insulating resin and the annular second ring composed of a coil covered with the electric
insulating resin to each other. Hence, it is possible to insert the core sections that are magnetic
cores through respective holes extending through the first ring and the second ring after being
resin-molded so that the core sections can be fixed. Through this, it becomes unnecessary to
prepare a bobbin around which the wire is coiled as a different component. Accordingly, it is
possible to reduce the number of components of the transformer, and also reduce man-hours of
component assembly.
[0007] In addition, according to the first aspect of the present invention, the second coil section
(one of the primary coil and the secondary coil) is covered with the electric-insulating resin.
Through this, it is possible to secure electric insulation between the first coil section and the
second coil section that is required for the transformer in a state in which the second coil section
is assembled to the first coil section (the other of the primary coil and the secondary coil).
[0008] In the transformer of the first aspect of the present invention, the circuit board may
include a slit, the coupled part being inserted and fitted into the slit so as to position the first coil
section and the second coil section such that the core of the first coil section coincides with a
core of the second coil section.
[0009] In the first aspect of the present invention, when the second coil section is assemble to
the circuit board where the first coil section is formed, the circuit board is provided with the slit
for positioning the first coil section and the second coil section such that the core of the first coil
section coincides with the core of the second coil section. A part (the coupled part) where the
first ring and the second ring of the second coil section are coupled to each other is inserted and
fitted into the slit of the circuit board until the coupled position abuts to the end portion of the
slit.

                                                  3
[0010] Through this, the assembling work with less components allows the core of the first coil
section and the core of the second coil section to readily coincide with each other, and to secure
coaxial accuracy of the holes into which the core sections are inserted, that is, coaxial accuracy
between the through-hole of the circuit board and the through hole of the second coil section.
Accordingly, it is possible to enhance assemblability of the core section after the second coil
section is fixed to the circuit board.
[0011] In the first aspect of the present invention, the conductor plate may be a rectangular
copper wire.
[0012] In the first aspect of the present invention, there may be a gap between the first ring and
the second ring, and the circuit board may be disposed in the gap.
[0013] As aforementioned, according to the transformer of the present invention, it is possible to
reduce the number of components, and also reduce man-hours of component assembly, while
securing electric insulation between the primary coil and the secondary coil.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
Outline
[0023] A transformer of the present invention is configured such that each of air core coils
around which a coil wire (conductor plate) is coiled is covered with an electric-insulating resin
in a manner as to have a hole through which a core as a magnetic core is to be inserted. Hence,
coil components after being resin-molded can be fixed by inserting cores thereof as magnetic
cores through the holes. This configuration eliminates necessity of preparing a bobbin around
which the coil wire is coiled as a separate component. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the
number of components of the transformer, and also reduce man-hours of component assembly.
Structure of each component
[0024] First, with reference to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, each of components composing the
transformer 1 according to one embodiment of the present invention will be described.
[0025] FIG. 1 is a view explaining the structure of the transformer 1 according to one
embodiment of the present invention with the components of the transformer developed. The
transformer 1 exemplified in FIG. 1 is composed of the following components: a circuit board
10 where a first coil section 11 is formed, a second coil section 20, an upper core section 30, and
a lower core section 40. FIG. 2 is a view explaining a more detailed structure of the second coil
section 20 in FIG. 1.
[0026] The transformer 1 according to the present embodiment is formed by assembling the
following components: the second coil section 20, the upper core section 30, and the lower core

                                                   5
section 40, respectively to the circuit board 10 (the first coil section 11) in numerical order
indicated in respective arrows from respective directions of these arrows shown in FIG. 1. This
assembling method will be described later.
[0027] The transformer 1 assembled in this manner becomes an element having a structure in
which the first coil section 11 and the second coil section 20 are magnetically coupled with each
other via the upper core section 30 and the lower core section 40.
Circuit board 10 and first coil section 11
[0028] The circuit board 10 is a print circuit board on which conductor patterns allowing
electricity to flow therethrough are printed, and wire-connects surface mounted components and
others by the conductor patterns so as to configure a predetermined electric circuit. This circuit
board 10 may have a multiple layer structure or a single layer structure.
[0029] The circuit board 10 is provided with an insertion hole 12a through which a center leg
portion 40a of the lower core section 40 described later is inserted, an insertion hole 12b through
which an outer leg portion 40b of the lower core section 40 is inserted, and an insertion hole 12c
through which an outer leg portion 40c of the lower core section 40 is inserted, respectively.
[0030] A conductor pattern in a coil shape is so formed as to be coiled around the insertion hole
12a of the circuit board 10 by one round or more in a planar state. If the circuit board 10 has a
multiple layer structure, a coiled conductor pattern may be formed in each layer. The first coil
section 11 formed by this coiled conductor pattern composes a coil on a higher-voltage side in
the transformer 1.
[0031] The circuit board 10 is provided with a slit 13 into which a coupled part 24c of the
second coil section 20 described later is inserted. This slit 13 is formed to facilitate positioning
of the first coil section 11 and the second coil section 20 such that cores thereof coincide with
each other by inserting and fitting the coupled part 24c into the slit 13 until the coupled part 24c
abuts to an end portion 13w located at an innermost position of the slit 13.
[0032] In addition, the circuit board 10 is provided with screw holes 14n, 15n used for fixing
and connecting, to the circuit board 10, a first connecting terminal 21t and a second connecting

                                                   6
terminal 22t of the second coil section 20 in which the coupled part 24c is inserted and fitted to
the slit 13.
Second coil section 20
[0033] The second coil section 20 composes a coil on a lower-voltage side of the transformer 1.
This second coil section 20 has a structure (resin-mold structure) in which a conductor formed
by connecting two coils 21 and 22 to each other at a coupled position 23 is covered with a resin
(electric-insulating resin) 24 having an electric insulation property, as shown in FIG. 2.
[0034] Each of the coil 21 and the coil 22 is an air core coil formed of a conductor plate such as
a rectangular copper wire, coiled by one round (edgewise coil), for example. The coil 21 and the
coil 22 are formed with the same coil inner diameter and the same coil outer diameter. The coil
21 and the coil 22 are electrically coupled to each other at a coupled position 23 such that both
cores thereof coincide with each other, in substantially parallel to each other with a
predetermined distance therebetween. The predetermined distance is designed to be any
dimension that allows a predetermined gap 24g to be formed between a first ring 24u and a
second ring 24d that are covered with the electric-insulating resin 24 described later.
[0035] The first connecting terminal 21t extending to the outside of the electric-insulating resin
24 is connected to the coil 21. This first connecting terminal 21t is provided with a screw hole
21n. A second connecting terminal 22t extending to the outside of the electric-insulating resin
24 is connected to the coil 22. This second connecting terminal 22t is provided with a screw
hole 22n.
[0036] The coil 21 is covered with the electric-insulating resin 24 so as to have a predetermined
thickness around the circumference of the coil 21, to thereby form the annular first ring 24u
having a through-hole inside the coil. The coil 22 is so covered with the electric-insulating resin
24 as to have a predetermined thickness around the circumference of the coil 22, to thereby form
the annular second ring 24d having a through-hole inside the coil. In addition, the coupled
position 23 where the coil 21 and the coil 22 are coupled to each other is covered with the
electric-insulating resin 24 so as to have a predetermined thickness around the circumference of
the coupled position 23, to thereby form a coupled part 24c. The coil 21 and the coil 22 are
molded in a manner as to form the predetermined gap 24g between the first ring 24u and the
second ring 24d. The predetermined gap 24g is designed to have a dimension that allows the

                                                    7
circuit board 10 to be inserted thereinto (a thickness equal to or greater than that of the circuit
board 10). The coupled position 23 is molded such that the coupled part 24c has a thickness not
greater than the width of the slit 13 provided to the circuit board 10.
[0037] A pair of V-shaped first guide ribs 24ur between which the upper core section 30 is to be
fitted and fixed is erected on a surface of the first ring 24u opposite to the gap 24g. The first
guide ribs 24ur are formed in a manner as to correspond to the outer shape of the upper core
section 30 so that inner surfaces facing each other of the first guide ribs 24ur are engaged with
side surfaces of the upper core section 30. In addition, a pair of V-shaped second guide ribs 24dr
between which the lower core section 40 is to be fitted and fixed is erected on a surface of the
second ring 24d opposite to the gap 24g. These second guide ribs 24dr are formed in a manner
as to correspond to the outer shape of the lower core section 40 so that inner surfaces facing
each other of the second guide ribs 24dr are engaged with side surfaces of the lower core section
40.
[0038] In the example of FIG. 2, there has been explained the case in which each of the coil 21
and the coil 22 is formed by coiling the conductor plate by one round. However, each of the coil
21 and the coil 22 may be formed by coiling the conductor plate by two rounds or more, or the
coil 21 and the coil 22 may have different coiling rounds from each other.
Upper core section 30 and lower core section 40
[0039] The upper core section 30 is a so-called I-shaped core that is in a flat plate-like and
butterfly shape in a plan view, and is made of a magnetic material such as a ferrite material, for
example. The upper core section 30 is formed to have one pair of side surfaces whose center
portions are recessed so as to be engaged with the pair of first guide ribs 24ur erected on the
surface of the first ring 24u of the second coil section 20.
[0040] The lower core section 40 is a so-called E-shaped core that is made of a magnetic
material such as a ferrite material, and has a main body 40p in a flat plate-like and butterfly
shape in a plan view, the center leg portion 40a, the outer leg portion 40b, and the outer leg
portion 40c. The main body 40p is formed to have one pair of side surfaces whose center
portions are recessed so as to be engaged with the pair of second guide ribs 24dr erected on the
surface of the second ring 24d of the second coil section 20. The outer leg portion 40b is erected
at one longitudinal end of the main body 40p such that the outer leg portion 40b can be inserted

                                                   8
through the insertion hole 12b of the circuit board 10. The outer leg portion 40c is erected at the
other longitudinal end of the main body 40p such that the outer leg portion 40c can be inserted
through the insertion hole 12c of the circuit board 10. The center leg portion 40a is erected
between the outer leg portion 40b and the outer leg portion 40c such that the center leg portion
40a can be inserted through the insertion hole 12a. The center leg portion 40a, the outer leg
portion 40b, and the outer leg portion 40c are formed from the main body 40p at the same height
so that respective end surfaces thereof become parallel to the main body 40p.
[0041] In the upper core section 30 and the lower core section 40, when the end surfaces of the
respective leg portions of the lower core section 40 are joined to one flat surface of the upper
core section 30, a closed magnetic circuit (closed magnetic path) through which a magnetic flux
passing through the coiled wire of the first coil section 11 and the coiled wire of the second coil
section 20 passes is formed by the center leg portion 40a and the outer leg portion 40b, and
center leg portion 40a and the outer leg portion 40c.
Assembling method of respective components
[0042] Next, with reference to FIG. 1, the assembling procedure of the respective components
to form the transformer 1 according to the present embodiment will be described.
[0043] First, the second coil section 20 is assembled to the circuit board 10 from the direction
indicated by the arrow (1) in FIG. 1. At this time, the coupled part 24c is inserted into the slit 13
while the circuit board 10 is inserted into the gap 24g between the first ring 24u and the second
ring 24d. The second coil section 20 is inserted until the coupled part 24c abuts to the end
portion 13w located at the innermost position of the slit 13.
[0044] Through this, the first ring 24u of the second coil section 20 is arranged on one surface
(in the upward direction of the drawing) of the circuit board 10 in such a manner that the core of
the first ring 24u coincides with the core of the first coil section 11; and the second ring 24d of
the second coil section 20 is arranged on the other surface (in the downward direction of the
drawing) of the circuit board 10 in such a manner that the core of the second ring 24d coincides
with the core of the first coil section 11. This means that the second coil section 20 is positioned
relative to the circuit board 10 such that the core of the first coil section 11 formed on the circuit
board 10 and the core of the second coil section 20 coincide with each other. The screw holes
14n and 15n provided to the circuit board 10 coincide with the screw holes 21n and 22n

                                                   9
provided respectively to the first connecting terminal 21t and the second connecting terminal 22t
of the second coil section 20, and thus screw clamp can be carried out.
[0045] Next, the lower core section 40 is assembled to the circuit board 10 to which the second
coil section 20 is assembled, from the direction indicated by the arrow (2) in FIG. 1, that is,
from a direction where the second ring 24d of the second coil section 20 is located. At this time,
the side surfaces of the lower core section 40 are fitted so as to be engaged with the pair of guide
ribs 24dr erected on the surface of the second ring 24d of the second coil section 20, to thereby
insert the center leg portion 40a of the lower core section 40 into the insertion hole 12a of the
circuit board 10, the outer leg portion 40b of the lower core section 40 into the insertion hole
12b of the circuit board 10, and the outer leg portion 40c of the lower core section 40 into the
insertion hole 12c of the circuit board 10, respectively.
[0046] Through this, the respective end surfaces of the center leg portion 40a, the outer leg
portion 40b, and the outer leg portion 40c of the lower core section 40 come into a state of
projecting from the surface of the first ring 24u of the second coil section 20.
[0047] Finally, the upper core section 30 is assembled to the circuit board 10 where the second
coil section 20 and the lower core section 40 have already been assembled, from the direction
indicated by the arrow (3) in FIG. 1, that is, from the direction where the first ring 24u of the
second coil section 20 is located. At this time, the side surface of the upper core section 30 is
fitted to be engaged with the pair of first guide ribs 24ur erected on the surface of the first ring
24u of the second coil section 20.
[0048] Through this, while being inserted through the insertion hole 12a, the through-hole of the
first coil section 11, and the through-hole of the second coil section 12, and also holding the first
coil section 11 and the second coil section 20 from the both sides of the circuit board 10, the
respective end surfaces of the center leg portion 40a, the outer leg portion 40b, and the outer leg
portion 40c of the lower core section 40 are joined to one flat surface of the upper core section
30. Accordingly, it is possible to form the closed magnetic circuit that magnetically couples the
first coil section 11 and the second coil section 20 to each other, by the upper core section 30
and the lower core section 40.

                                                   10
Structure of transformer
[0049] Next, further with reference to FIG. 3 to FIG. 5, the structure of the transformer 1 in a
state in which the circuit board 10 (the first coil section 11), the second coil section 20, the
upper core section 30, and the lower core section 40 are assembled in the above manner will be
described.
[0050] FIG. 3 is a perspective view showing a state of the transformer 1 formed by assembling
the respective components. FIG. 4 is a view of the transformer 1 in FIG. 3, as viewed from a
point A in the arrow direction. FIG. 5 is a view of the transformer 1 in FIG. 3, taken along V-V
line and as viewed in the arrow direction.
[0051] As shown in the respective drawings, the transformer 1 to which the respective
components are assembled and mounted to the circuit board 10 has a total thickness by summing
the thickness of the upper core section 30 and the thickness of the lower core section 40. In the
transformer 1, the circuit board 10 is held by the first ring 24u of the second coil section 20 and
the second ring 24d of the second coil section 20. In the transformer 1, the coupled part 24c of
the second coil section 20 is inserted in the slit 13 of the circuit board 10.
Operational Effect of embodiments
[0052] As described above, according to the transformer 1 of one embodiment of the present
invention, there is used the second coil section 20 having a shape such that the annular first ring
24u having a through-hole and composed of the coil 21 covered with the electric-insulating resin
24, and the annular second ring 24d having a through-hole and composed of the coil 22 covered
with the electric-insulating resin 24 are coupled at the coupled part 24c. Hence, the upper core
section 30 and the lower core section 40 that are the magnetic cores can be inserted into and
fixed to the through-holes of the first ring 24u and the second ring 24d after being resin-molded.
Through this, it becomes unnecessary to prepare a bobbin around which the coil wire is coiled as
a different component. Hence, it is possible to reduce the number of components of the
transformer 1, and also reduce man-hours of component assembly.
[0053] In addition, according to the transformer 1 of one embodiment of the present invention,
the second coil section 20 is covered with the electric-insulating resin 24. Through this, it is
possible to secure electric insulation between the first coil section 11 and the second coil section

                                                   11
20 required for the transformer 1 while the second coil section 20 is assembled to the first coil
section 11 formed on the circuit board 10.
[0054] According to the transformer 1 of one embodiment of the present invention, each of the
coil 21 and the coil 22 that are the conductor of the second coil section 20 are formed by a
conductor plate having a wider width such as a rectangular copper wire. Through this, it is
possible to suppress increase in wiring resistance on the second coil section 20 side that is
caused in accordance with increase in voltage conversion rate. Accordingly, a radiating
mechanism that should be required for heat suppression becomes unnecessary; thus it is possible
to reduce the number of components of the transformer 1.
[0055] According to the transformer 1 of one embodiment of the present invention, the first coil
section 11 is formed by utilizing the conductor pattern on the circuit board 10 coiled around the
insertion hole 12a by one round or more in a planar state. Through this, the first coil section 11
can be set by using a multiple-round wire; thus it is possible to configure the transformer 1
having a coiling ratio depending on the high voltage conversion rate.
[0056] According to the transformer 1 of one embodiment of the present invention, the coupled
part 24c between the first ring 24u and the second ring 24d of the second coil section is inserted
and fitted into the slit 13 until the coupled part 24c abuts to the end portion 13w of the slit 13
formed in the circuit board 10, to thereby position the first coil section 11 and the second coil
section 20 to each other. Through this, it is possible to readily allow the core of the first coil
section 11 and the core of the coil 22 to coincide with each other. That is, it is possible to secure
coaxial accuracy of the insertion hole 12a of the circuit board 10 into which the center leg
portion 40a of the lower core section 40 is inserted, relative to the through-holes of the first ring
24u and the second ring 24d of the second coil section 20. Accordingly, the assemblability of
the lower core section 40 after the second coil section 20 is assembled to the circuit board 10 is
enhanced.
[0057] Furthermore, according to the transformer 1 of one embodiment of the present invention,
the circuit board 10 is inserted into the gap 24g of the second coil section 20 so as to assemble
the first coil section 11 and the second coil section 20 to each other. That is, this is a structure
that holds the first coil section 11 between the first ring 24u and the second ring 24d of the
second coil section 20. With this structure, there is a possibility to reduce the dimension of the

                                                   12
transformer 1 (particularly, a total thickness thereof when the first coil section 11 and the second
coil section 20 are held by the upper core section 30 and the lower core section 40). Since the
magnetic coupling between first coil section 11 and the second coil section 20 can be tight, to
thereby reduce the number of components such as a radiation mechanism for heat suppression
and electronic components for suppressing electric stress (surge), and others.
[0058] In the transformer 1 according to one embodiment of the present invention, it is possible
to freely design how many first coil sections 11 on the higher-voltage side are used, or which of
the first coil section 11 on the higher-voltage side and the second coil section 20 on the lower
voltage side is set to be the primary coil or the secondary coil. For example, as shown in FIG.
6A, the circuit board 10 having a multiple layer structure may be used so as to configure three
first coil sections 11. For example, as shown in FIG. 6B, a step-up transformer may be
configured such that the primary coil of the transformer 1 is composed of the second coil section
20 as the lower-voltage side, and the secondary coil of the transformer 1 is composed of the first
coil section 11 as the higher-voltage side. Furthermore, for example, as shown in FIG. 6C, a
step-down transformer may be configured such that the primary coil of the transformer 1 is
composed of the first coil section 11 as the higher-voltage side, and the secondary coil of the
transformer 1 is composed of the second coil section 20 as the lower-voltage side.
[0059] The transformer of the present invention is usable in a solar power generation system, for
example, and is useful particularly in the case in which it is desired to reduce the number of
components and man-hours of component assembly while securing the electric insulation
between the primary coil and the secondary coil.
