                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   [0002]      Disclosed aspects and methodologies relate to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
   operations, and more particularly, to systems and methods relating to planning and operations
15 of an LNG project or projects.
                                           BACKGROUND
   [0003]      This section is intended to introduce various aspects of the art, which may be
   associated with aspects of the disclosed techniques and methodologies. References discussed
   in this section may be referred to hereinafter. This discussion, including the references, is
20 believed to assist in providing a framework to facilitate a better understanding of particular
   aspects of the disclosure. Accordingly, this section should be read in this light and not
   necessarily as admissions of prior art.
   [0004]      The current liquefied natural gas (LNG) business is driven by long-term contracts
   and planning. Currently, annual delivery schedules for each LNG project are planned and
25 agreed upon by various parties before the beginning of each contractual time period. In
   addition an updated 90-day delivery schedule is developed by the LNG producer and
   provided to customers every month to account for deviations from the annual schedule.
   Agreement on these delivery plans can involve significant negotiation and coordination of
   operations by several parties. Consequently, developing a portfolio of LNG projects and
                                                 -1 -

   operating LNG liquefaction terminals involves significant long-term planning which can
   greatly benefit from robust planning and optimization tools.
   [0005]       Increasing liquidity in the LNG market may cause the global LNG business to
   evolve from a long-term contracts based business to one with significantly more flexibility
 5 and short-term sales. This will complicate the management of projects since operations will
   have to be optimized not only to satisfy contractual obligations but also to maximize
   profitability by exploiting contractual flexibility and market opportunities. Known attempts to
   manage LNG projects via computational technology               have fallen short because       of
   substantially reduced scope, reduced capabilities of the proposed solutions, and/or a lack of
10 the technology utilized. The following paragraphs discuss known attempts as they relate to
   various aspects of the disclosed methodologies and techniques.
   [0006]       Many conventional LNG projects tend to use simple spreadsheets for scheduling
   ships. The schedule has to be populated manually and does not provide any optimization
   functionality. Even in the more detailed systems, there are no known integrated models for
15 lifting schedule generation combined with ship schedule optimization. This can lead to sub
   optimal plans manifested in over-utilization of spot vessels for satisfying contractual
   demands. Further, generating a feasible shipping schedule could require a great number of
   iterations between the capacity planning and the ship scheduling components. Additionally,
   the ship scheduling components of the more sophisticated models do not seek to optimize
20 schedules for selling spot cargoes, and do not account for transportation losses in cargo (e.g.
   boil-off, fuel) and consequently the generated ship schedules have discrepancies when
   attempting to satisfy contractual obligations related to annual volume delivered.
   [0007]       As an example, Rakke et al appears to describe a first attempt to address problems
   of developing Annual Development Plans (ADPs) for larger LNG projects.            See, e.g., J.G.
25 Rakke, M. Stilhane, C.R. Moe, M. Christiansen, H. Andersson, K. Fagerholt, I. Norstad,
   (2010), "A rolling horizon heuristic for creating a liquefied natural gas annual delivery
   program", To appear in Transportation Research Part C, doi:10.1016/j.trc.2010.09.006.
   While Rakke reports results for problems with multiple ships and a one year planning
   horizon, the optimization model and solution methods are fairly simplified. For example, the
30 model is built for a case with only one producing terminal, boil-off and heel calculations are
   not integrated with ship schedules, partial loads and discharges are not allowed, time
   windows are not specified for deliveries, etc. From a practical perspective, known ship
                                                   -2-

   schedule methodologies address a much simplified and a small subset of the LNG ship
   schedule optimization problem.
   [0008]      To address some of the problems in conventional methods, other methods may
   provide the capability to perform a number of valuation and validation analyses for the LNG
 5 supply chain incorporating options and opportunities. See, .e.g., Intl. Patent Application
   Publication Nos. 2013/085688; 2013/085689; 2013/085690; 2013/085691; and 2013/085692.
   These methods may include identification and valuation of short-term and long-term options,
   portfolio planning analysis, and management of shipping operations, validation of supply
   chain operability, and new LNG project design and evaluation. Accordingly, these references
10 describe a suite of fit-for-purpose optimization and analytics applications are used in
   combination within various workflows and methodologies. In particular, these models form
   the combined suite of applications (e.g., five optimization and analytical models in the
   software suite) to be used in operations, analysis and decision-making within the LNG value
   chain. These models include: (1) ship scheduling, which has a capability for combined LNG
15 ship scheduling, logistics and inventory optimization to develop annual delivery programs,
   rolling 90-day schedules, or schedules of any other useful scheduling time horizon; (2)
   optionality planning, which is used to identify the benefits, value or advantages in potential
   options and investments in long-term global LNG market analysis and for portfolio planning;
   (3) price model, which provides advanced price scenario generation capabilities enabling the
20 valuation and statistical analysis of short-term optionality; (4) supply chain design, which
   provides optimization under uncertainty for robust LNG supply chain designs of new LNG
   projects including appropriate operational details; and (5) shipping simulation, which is a
   high-fidelity simulator to study, probabilistically analyze and visualize the behavior of LNG
   supply chain operations. The models encompass a variety of analytical tasks and levels of
25 fidelity.
   [0009]      Despite these enhancements, existing models for Annual Development Plan fail to
   properly integrate each of the components, such as multiple production facilities, multiple
   storage facilities, multiple berths both in production and regas side, multiple LNG grades,
   multiple ships in varying capacities and fuel options, multiple contracts/delivery locations,
30 mass balance calculations (production, inventory, and potential losses), full, partial and co
   loads, planned dry-dock schedules, ratability windows, complex delivery windows, and fiscal
   calculations. Accordingly, a need exists to integrate each of the components within a model
   that can optimize all variables simultaneously. In addition, conventional algorithms do not
                                                  -3-

   optimize real-sized problems in a time frame necessary for practical business purposes. In
   particular, what is needed is an algorithm and its extensions that optimize real-sized models
   in a reasonable time frame. Further, conventional methods consider all constraints to be
   equally important.      Hence, for highly constrained systems, these methods may be
 5 unsuccessful in finding any solution due to their inherent inflexibility. As such, a need exists
   to be able to prioritize constraints such that some of them can be considered more important
   ("hard"), than others ("soft"). This will enable us to find solutions than can satisfy all hard
   (critical) constraints and minimize violation in the soft (less important) constraints. As a
   result, finding good solutions can become easier, with the possibility of improving economics
10 at the expense of minor violations in the soft constraints.
   [0010]       Further still, none of the conventional models provide the ability to update the
   ship schedules based on operational disruption events, or on updated information that is
   different from the assumptions that were used for developing the plan.            This type of
   functionality is useful in developing 90-day delivery schedules. Because the annual delivery
15 schedules are negotiated between the LNG buyers and LNG sellers to best suit the interests of
   both parties, a need exists to develop updated ship schedules being able to re-optimize the
   schedules, such that the deviations from the initial plan can be minimized, in addition to
   maximizing economics.
                                             SUMMARY
20 [0011]       In yet another aspect, a computer implemented method for generating an
   optimized ship schedule to deliver liquefied natural gas (LNG) from one or more LNG
   liquefaction terminals to one or more LNG regasification terminals using a fleet of ships is
   described.     The method includes: obtaining a baseline ship schedule for LNG shipping
   operations; obtaining input data associated with the LNG shipping operations; in response to
25 the input data, developing an updated ship schedule using one or more algorithms, wherein
   the one or more algorithms balance the economics of the updated ship schedule and the
   changes in the updated ship schedule as compared to the baseline ship schedule; outputting
   one or more notifications associated with the updated ship schedule; and using the one or
   more notifications to perform LNG shipping operations.
30 [0012]       The one or more algorithms comprises developing an updated ship schedule that
   does not have constraint violations; minimizing deviation between the updated ship schedule
   and the baseline ship schedule; maximizing economics while maintaining deviation between
   the updated ship schedule and the baseline ship schedule within a tolerance; maximizing
                                                  -4-

   economics and evaluating additional LNG shipment opportunities; minimizing deviation
   between the updated ship schedule and the baseline ship schedule while maintaining the
   economics.
    [0013]     In still yet another aspect, a system for generating an optimized ship schedule to
 5 deliver liquefied natural gas (LNG) from one or more LNG liquefaction terminals to one or
   more LNG regasification terminals using a fleet of ships is described. The system comprises
   a processor; an input device in communication with the processor and configured to receive
   input data associated with the LNG shipping operations; memory in communication with the
   processor, the memory having a set of instructions, wherein the set of instructions, when
10 executed, are configured to: obtain a baseline ship schedule for LNG shipping operations; in
   response to the input data, develop an updated ship schedule using one or more algorithms,
   wherein the one or more algorithms balance the economics of the updated ship schedule and
   the changes in the updated ship schedule as compared to the baseline ship schedule; an output
   device that outputs one or more notifications associated with the updated ship schedule.

20                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    [0032]     To the extent the following description is specific to a particular embodiment or a
   particular use, this is intended to be illustrative only and is not to be construed as limiting the
   scope of the invention. On the contrary, it is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications,
   and equivalents that may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention.
25  [0033]     Some portions of the detailed description which follows are presented in terms of
   procedures, steps, logic blocks, processing and other symbolic representations of operations
   on data bits within a memory in a computing system or a computing device. These
   descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing
   arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. In this
30 detailed description, a procedure, step, logic block, process, or the like, is conceived to be a
                                                    -6-

   self-consistent sequence of steps or instructions leading to a desired result. The steps are
   those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, although not
   necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical, magnetic, or optical signals capable of
   being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven
 5 convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits,
   values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.
   [0034]      Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions,
   terms such as generating, modeling, accepting, interfacing, running, outputting, evaluating,
   optimizing, performing, minimizing,        maximizing, developing, determining, analyzing,
10 identifying, representing, incorporating, entering, employing, displaying, using, integrating,
   simulating, valuating, valuing, validating, comparing, accounting for, prescribing, or the like,
   may refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or other electronic device, that
   transforms data represented as physical (electronic, magnetic, or optical) quantities within
   some electrical device's storage into other data similarly represented as physical quantities
15 within the storage, or in transmission or display devices. These and similar terms are to be
   associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied
   to these quantities.
   [0035]      Embodiments disclosed herein also relate to an apparatus for performing the
   operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it
20 may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a
   computer program or code stored in the computer. Such a computer program or code may be
   stored or encoded in a non-transitory computer readable medium or implemented over some
   type of transmission medium. A computer-readable medium includes any medium or
   mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine, such as a
25 computer ('machine' and 'computer'        are used synonymously herein). As a non-limiting
   example, a non-transitory computer-readable medium may include a computer-readable
   storage medium (e.g., read only memory ("ROM"), random access memory ("RAM"),
   magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media, flash memory devices, etc.). A
   transmission medium may be twisted wire pairs, coaxial cable, optical fiber, or some other
30 suitable transmission medium, for transmitting signals such as electrical, optical, acoustical or
   other form of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.)).
   [0036]      Furthermore, modules, features, attributes, methodologies, and other aspects can
   be implemented as software, hardware, firmware or any combination thereof. Wherever a
                                                  -7-

   component of the invention is implemented as software, the component can be implemented
   as a standalone program, as part of a larger program, as a plurality of separate programs, as a
   statically or dynamically linked library, as a kernel loadable module, as a device driver,
   and/or in every and any other way known now or in the future to those of skill in the art of
 5 computer programming. Additionally, the invention is not limited to implementation in any
   specific operating system or environment.
   [0037]      Example methods may be better appreciated with reference to flow diagrams.
   While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the illustrated methodologies are shown and
   described as a series of blocks, it is to be appreciated that the methodologies are not limited
10 by the order of the blocks, as some blocks can occur in different orders and/or concurrently
   with other blocks from that shown and described. Moreover, less than all the illustrated
   blocks may be required to implement an example methodology. Blocks may be combined or
   separated    into    multiple    components.      Furthermore,     additional    and/or alternative
   methodologies can employ additional blocks not shown herein. While the figures illustrate
15 various actions occurring serially, it is to be appreciated that various actions could occur in
   series, substantially in parallel, and/or at substantially different points in time.
   [0038]      Various terms as used herein are defined below. To the extent a term used in a
   claim is not defined below, it should be given the broadest possible definition persons in the
   pertinent art have given that term as reflected in at least one printed publication or issued
20 patent.
   [0039]      As used herein, "and/or" placed between a first entity and a second entity means
   one of (1) the first entity, (2) the second entity, and (3) the first entity and the second entity.
   Multiple elements listed with "and/or" should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., "one or
   more" of the elements so conjoined.
25 [0040]      As used herein, "displaying" includes a direct act that causes displaying, as well
   as any indirect act that facilitates displaying. Indirect acts include providing software to an
   end user, maintaining a website through which a user is enabled to affect a display,
   hyperlinking to such a website, or cooperating or partnering with an entity who performs
   such direct or indirect acts. Thus, a first party may operate alone or in cooperation with a
30 third party vendor to enable the reference signal to be generated on a display device. The
   display device may include any device suitable for displaying the reference image, such as
   without limitation a CRT monitor, a LCD monitor, a plasma device, a flat panel device, or
   printer. The display device may include a device which has been calibrated through the use
                                                    -8-

   of any conventional software intended to be used in evaluating, correcting, and/or improving
   display results (e.g., a color monitor that has been adjusted using monitor calibration
   software). Rather than (or in addition to) displaying the reference image on a display device,
   a method, consistent with the invention, may include providing a reference image to a
 5 subject. "Providing a reference image" may include creating or distributing the reference
   image to the subject by physical, telephonic, or electronic delivery, providing access over a
   network to the reference, or creating or distributing software to the subject configured to run
   on the subject's workstation or computer including the reference image. In one example, the
   providing of the reference image could involve enabling the subject to obtain the reference
10 image in hard copy form via a printer. For example, information, software, and/or
   instructions could be transmitted (e.g., electronically or physically via a data storage device
   or hard copy) and/or otherwise made available (e.g., via a network) to facilitate the subject
   using a printer to print a hard copy form of reference image. In such an example, the printer
   may be a printer which has been calibrated through the use of any conventional software
15 intended to be used in evaluating, correcting, and/or improving printing results (e.g., a color
   printer that has been adjusted using color correction software).
   [0041]      As used herein, "exemplary" is used exclusively herein to mean "serving as an
   example, instance, or illustration." Any aspect described herein as "exemplary" is not
   necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects.
20 [0042]      As used herein, "hydrocarbon" includes any of the following: oil (often referred to
   as petroleum), natural gas in any form including liquefied natural gas (LNG), gas condensate,
   tar and bitumen.
   [0043]      As used herein, "machine-readable medium" refers to a non-transitory medium
   that participates in directly or indirectly providing signals, instructions and/or data.      A
25 machine-readable medium may take forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media
   (e.g. ROM, disk) and volatile media (RAM). Common forms of a machine-readable medium
   include, but are not limited to, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, a hard disk, a magnetic tape,
   other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, other optical medium, a RAM, a ROM, an EPROM, a
   FLASH-EPROM, EEPROM, or other memory chip or card, a memory stick, and other media
30 from which a computer, a processor or other electronic device can read.
   [0044]       The terms "optimal," "optimizing," "optimize," "optimality," "optimization" (as
   well as derivatives and other forms of those terms and linguistically related words and
   phrases), as used herein, are not intended to be limiting in the sense of requiring the present
                                                  -9-

   invention to find the best solution or to make the best decision. Although a mathematically
   optimal solution may in fact arrive at the best of all mathematically available possibilities,
   real-world embodiments of optimization routines, methods, models, and processes may work
   towards such a goal without ever actually achieving perfection. Accordingly, one of ordinary
 5 skill in the art having benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate that these terms, in the
   context of the scope of the present invention, are more general. The terms may describe one
   or more of: 1) working towards a solution which may be the best available solution, a
   preferred solution, or a solution that offers a specific benefit within a range of constraints; 2)
   continually improving; 3) refining; 4) searching for a high point or a maximum for an
10 objective; 5) processing to reduce a penalty function; or 6) seeking to maximize one or more
   factors in light of competing and/or cooperative interests in maximizing, minimizing, or
   otherwise controlling one or more other factors, etc.
   [0045]       As used herein, the term "production entity" or "production entities" refer to
   entities involved in a liquefaction project or regasification project.
15 [0046]       Example methods may be better appreciated with reference to flow diagrams.
   While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the illustrated methodologies are shown and
   described as a series of blocks, it is to be appreciated that the methodologies are not limited
   by the order of the blocks, as some blocks can occur in different orders and/or concurrently
   with other blocks from that shown and described. Moreover, less than all the illustrated
20 blocks may be required to implement an example methodology. Blocks may be combined or
   separated     into   multiple    components.      Furthermore,     additional    and/or alternative
   methodologies can employ additional blocks not shown herein. While the figures illustrate
   various actions occurring serially, it is to be appreciated that various actions could occur in
   series, substantially in parallel, and/or at substantially different points in time.
25 [0047]       In general, LNG inventory routing problems (IRPs) have special characteristics
   that differentiate them from general maritime IRP's. Maritime IRP's in turn have special
   characteristics that distinguish them from vehicle routing problem (VRPs). The LNG IRP is
   based on a real-world application and shares the fundamental properties of a single product
   maritime IRP.       However, the LNG IRP includes several variations including variable
30 production and consumption rates, LNG specific contractual obligations, and berth
   constraints. Further, the LNG IRP seeks to generate schedules where each ship perform
   several voyages over a time horizon with both the number of voyages and the time horizon
   being considerably larger than those considered by a typical maritime IRP. As an example,
                                                   - 10 -

   LNG boils off during transportation and this boil-off can be used as fuel.          Further, LNG
   involves long term delivery contracts where schedules for a year have to developed and then
   adhered to as closely as possible. In LNG shipping, the ships are typically fully loaded and
   fully discharged and the ships are owned/leased by shipper, which further complicate the
 5 economics related to taxes, royalties, etc.
   [0048]      The present techniques involve enhancements to systems and methods for ship
   schedule optimization. The present techniques involve integrating LNG ship schedule
   optimization and inventory management in an enhanced manner. As may be appreciated,
   various inputs, such as production schedule of different grades of LNG, inventory limitations,
10 ship fleet details and ship-terminal compatibility, contract details including destinations,
   quantity, pricing, ratability requirements are integrated to enhance LNG shipping operations.
   As part of the LNG shipping optimization algorithm, several search routines may be utilized
   to optimize shipping decisions, e.g., which ship to deliver which cargo to a certain
   destination. Typically, the optimal solution is searched for a criterion such as maximizing
15 social economics, minimizing shipping cost. Exemplary ship schedule optimization methods
   and systems are described in Intl. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2013/085688;
   2013/085689; 2013/085690; 2013/085691; and 2013/085692, each of which is incorporated
   hereby by reference in their entirety.
   [0049]      As shown in Figure 1A, an LNG optimization model 102 may obtain various
20 inputs, such as production terminal information 104 (e.g., production schedule and/or
   infrastructure constraints), ship fleet information 106 (e.g., terminal compatibility, boil-off
   rates, fuel options, and/or degree of pooling), delivery contract information 108 (e.g.,
   destination, annual quantity, ratability, pricing and/or optionality), and fiscal information 110
   (e.g., tax and/or royalty structure). These inputs are used by the LNG shipping optimization
25 model 102 to generate various outputs that are used in the LNG shipping operations. These
   outputs include shipping decision information 112 (e.g., ship schedule, optimal fleet size, fuel
   requirements, speed selection, maintenance schedule); terminal inventory profile 114 (e.g.,
   amount of inventory for a given time period); optionality information 116 (e.g., diversions);
   and profitability metrics 118 (e.g., taxes, royalty, expenses, allocation of income, etc.).
30 [0050]      As LNG projects include one or more LNG production or liquefaction terminals
   that supply LNG to multiple regasification terminals using a fleet of ships, the outputs of the
   LNG shipping optimization model 102 generates a schedule and associated plans for the
   LNG shipping operations.       The outputs include an annual delivery plan (ADP) created to
                                                  - 11 -

   specify the LNG delivery schedule for the forthcoming planning period (e.g., year) for one or
   more customers.     The ADP may be developed and agreed upon by the supplier and the
   various customers. In addition, one or more 90-day plans (e.g., delivery schedule that
   accounts for deviations in the existing business conditions from the forecasts used during the
 5 ADP development) is provided by the LNG shipping optimization model 102. This 90-day
   plan may be provided to one or more customers on a monthly basis through the year.
   [0051]      The present techniques involve enhancement to a method and system to develop
   annual delivery plans (ADPs) and some of which apply to developing 90-day schedules
   (90DS). Specifically, the system enables optimization of ship schedules, terminal inventory
10 management, LNG production schedules, and maintenance schedules while accounting for
   tradeoffs related to various options in available shipping, customer requirements, price
   uncertainty, contract flexibility, market conditions, and the like. The system may provide the
   ability to optimize these decisions from several perspectives including minimizing costs,
   satisfying contractual obligations, maximizing profit, and the like.
15 [0052]      The method and system includes specific workflows, which use various
   optimization models to provide enhanced ADP and 90-day plans. As an example, the system
   may include models and algorithms stored in memory, input data and output data stored in
   one or more databases, and a graphical user interface.
   [0053]      For ADP creation, the disclosed aspects and methodologies provide the capability
20 to perform a number of valuation and validation analyses for the LNG supply chain
   incorporating options and opportunities.     In particular, one or more embodiments may be
   include a system or method that enhances LNG ship scheduling modeling (e.g., ADP
   modeling), such that the LNG ship scheduling model is configured to (1) obtain input data
   associated with LNG shipping operations; (2) determine objectives for the LNG shipping
25 operations; (3) define constraints for the optimization decisions, wherein the constraints
   include hard constraints and soft constraints; (4) determine one or more algorithms, wherein
   the algorithms include basic algorithms and along one or more extensions to handle soft
   constraints; (5) calculate optimal decisions using the one or more algorithms to maximize
   and/or minimize one or more objectives based on the input data, one or more soft constraint
30 and one or more hard constraint; and (6) generate output data based on decision data. Then,
   the LNG ship schedule or updated ADP may be utilized to operate the LNG supply
   operations.
                                                 -12-

   [0054]       For the LNG ship scheduling (e.g. ADP), the data used in the modeling may
   include one or more of contract specification; production and re-gasification location
   specifications rates; ship specifications; ship compatibilities with contracts, production and
   re-gas terminals and/or berths; dry-dock requirements; storage tank requirements; berth
 5 specifications; berth and storage maintenance; loans and/or transfers of LNG among co
   located joint ventures; LNG grades; optionality opportunities including in-charter, out-charter
   and/or diversion; price projections; and potential ship routes. The output data may include
   ship travel details (e.g., time, route, fuel, speed, "state" (e.g., warm or cold)); cargo size;
   LNG quality; storage-berth combination which a cargo is served; ship status as in-chartered
10 or out-chartered; and planned dry-dock for the ship. The constraints may include one or more
   of ship    travel restrictions based     on arrival   and departure    times,    speed,  distance,
   loading/unloading operations; compatibility requirements between different parties, storage
   tanks, berths, contracts, cargo sizes; limits on loans between different parties; storage
   restrictions; berth utilization; contractual requirements (quantity, time); and/or maintenance
15 requirements. The objectives may include one or more of maximize social interest; minimize
   shipping costs; maximize profitability; and/or maximize shareholder profitability (e.g.,
   multiple different parties involved in operations).
   [0055]       The basic algorithms may include different algorithms that may be utilized in the
   system. As an example, the algorithms may be configured to be a five-stage method. The
20 five stage method may include (i) stage 1: generating feasible solution to the feasibility
   model; (ii) stage 2: generating optimal solution to feasibility model; (iii) stage 3: reducing in
   chartered ships; (iv) stage 4: pursuing out-charter opportunity; and (v) stage 5: finding
   optimal solution to optimality model. The feasibility model, in-charter model, out-charter
   model and optimality model is based on the LNG ship scheduling model or is a variant of the
25 LNG ship scheduling model (e.g., an embodiment of the ADP model). These models are a
   less complex models that are computational more efficient than the LNG ship scheduling
   model.
   [0056]       The extensions configured to handle soft constraints may include a soft ratability
   constraint method and a soft inventory constraint method.          The soft ratability constraint
30 method may include different approaches, such as minimizing violations after stage 5 of the
   five-stage method and/or minimizing violations after stage 2 of the five-stage method. The
   soft inventory constraint method may also include different approaches, such as minimizing
                                                  - 13 -

   violations after stage 5 of the five-stage method and/or minimizing violations after stage 2 of
   the five-stage method.
   [0057]       Beneficially, the present techniques provide an annual development plan that
   integrates each of the components, such as multiple production facilities, multiple storage
 5 facilities, multiple berths both in production and regas side, multiple LNG grades, multiple
   ships in varying capacities and fuel options, multiple contracts/delivery locations, mass
   balance calculations (production, inventory, and potential losses), full, partial and co-loads,
   planned dry-dock schedules, ratability windows, complex delivery windows, and fiscal
   calculations. Further, the present techniques may be utilized to optimize real-sized problems
10 in a time frame necessary for practical business purposes. The present techniques may be
   utilized to handle soft constraints that are effective in finding feasible solutions easier or
   improving economics. As another enhancement, the present techniques may provide updates
   to ship schedules based on operational disruption events, or on updated information that is
   different from the assumptions that were used for developing the plan, and/or on customer
15 requests for delivery changes, and/or on new market opportunities. This functionality may be
   utilized to enhance the 90-day delivery schedules (e.g., the 90-day plan), schedule repair,
   and/or ADP negotiation.       Also, the present techniques may be configured to re-optimize
   schedules such that the deviations from the initial plan can be minimized, in addition to
   maximizing economics.
20 [0058]       As an example, Figure 1B is a flow chart 150 of a LNG supply chain design
   optimization. In this flow chart 150, the generation and use of the ADP is described in blocks
   152 to 156, while the generation and use of the 90-day plan is described in blocks 158 to 164.
   [0059]       With regard to the LNG ship scheduling model (e.g., ADP model), input data on
   LNG shipping operations is obtained in block 152. This input data may include the input
25 data described in blocks 104 to 110 of Figure 1A. From this input data, an ADP may be
   generated from the LNG ship scheduling model, as shown in block 154. The generation of
   the LNG ship schedule model is described further below with reference to Figures 2A to 3
   and 13.     The ADP may be iterated through various versions based on changes and/or
   discussions with third parties.     The ADP may be displayed and used for LNG shipping
30 operations as shown in block 156. The display of the ADP may be via a computer display,
   and use may involve using the ADP for LNG shipping operations.
   [0060]       With regard to the LNG ship re-scheduling model (e.g., 90-day scheduling,
   schedule repair, ADP negotiation), input data on LNG shipping operations may be obtained
                                                 - 14 -

   in block 161. This input data may include the input data described in blocks 104 to 110 of
   Figure 1A or other data, as noted further below. A baseline schedule may also be obtained in
   block 160. The baseline schedule can be user-defined based on the ADP produced by the
   LNG ship scheduling model, as discussed in block 154, or the updated plan produced by the
 5 LNG ship rescheduling model, as discussed in block 158. At block 158, a 90-day plan may
   be generated from the LNG ship re-scheduling model. The generation of the 90-day plan
   may include obtaining input data on LNG shipping operations, as discussed in block 161,
   and/or obtaining an LNG operation baseline schedule, as shown in block 160. The LNG ship
   re-scheduling model is described further below with reference to Figures 4 to 13. The 90-day
10 plan may be displayed and used for LNG shipping operations, as shown in block 162. The
   display of the 90-day plan may be via a computer display, and use may involve using the 90
   day plan for LNG shipping operations. Further, as shown in block 164, updated information
   may be obtained.      This updated information may be utilized to construct the baseline
   schedule for the next ship schedule updating. The present techniques are explained further
15 below in Figures 2A to 13.
   LNG Ship Scheduling Optimization Model
   [0061]      As noted above, the present techniques integrate LNG ship schedule optimization
   and inventory management. The LNG shipping optimization model uses various inputs, such
   as production schedule of different grades of LNG, inventory limitations, ship fleet details
20 and ship-terminal compatibility, contract details including destinations, quantity, pricing,
   ratability requirements. Then, optimization algorithms are used to optimize shipping
   decisions (e.g., which ship to deliver which cargo to a certain destination). The output (e.g.,
   decisions) is based on the optimal solution to an objective function, which may include
   maximizing social economics and/or minimizing shipping cost.
25 [0062]      Figure 2A is a flow chart 200 of an ADP optimization method according to an
   exemplary embodiment of the present techniques. In this diagram 200, various steps may be
   performed to create an ADP based on an LNG ship scheduling model. At block 202, input
   data associated with LNG shipping operations is obtained to for use in a LNG ship
   scheduling model. The input data may include data associated with the long-term planning
30 operations. In addition, the input data may be categorized as: production data at one or more
   liquefaction terminals, facility management data at production terminals, customer requests,
   customer terminal data, market conditions, contracts and/or shipping data. Production data
   may include data relating one or more of: the types or grades of LNG produced and their heat
                                                - 15 -

   content; production rates of one or more types or grades of LNG; production unit
   maintenance schedules and associated flexibility in scheduling the maintenance.           Facility
   management data may include data relating one or more of: the number of berths available
   for loading; storage capacity for each type or grade of LNG; connection between berth and
 5 storage unit; and berth maintenance schedules and their associated flexibility.         Customer
   requests may include input data relating to one or more of the ratability of deliveries; the time
   window and cargo sizes for specific deliveries; the speeds that the ships should take; and the
   fuel modes that the ships should use. Customer terminal data may include input data relating
   to one or more of: storage capacities for each type or grade of LNG; the number of berths
10 available for unloading; regasification rate schedules; and distances from each liquefaction
   terminal. Market conditions may include input data relating to one or more of: the outlook
   for index prices to be used in pricing formula; the outlook for future market opportunities
   such as spot sales; and futures and forward contract prices. Contracts may include input data
   relating to one or more of: terminals where LNG can be delivered; annual delivery targets for
15 each customer terminal; ratability of delivery, which is the timing and spacing of delivery of
   portions of an agreed-upon amount of LNG; gas quality, type, or grade to be delivered;
   pricing formulas; diversion flexibility; and other types of flexibility such as downflex (an
   option whereby the buyer may request a decreased quantity of LNG). Contracts may also
   include input data relating to the length of contract to which one or more LNG customers are
20 bound. For example, an LNG customer may be bound by a long-term contract, such as sales
   and purchase agreements or a production sharing contracts. Shipping data may include input
   data relating to one or more of: a list of leased DES (delivered ex ship), CIF (cost, insurance
   and freight), CFR (cost and freight) and available spot ships; a list of FOB (freight on board)
   ships for each customer, the ships typically being owned or leased by the customer; ship
25 capacities; restrictions on what ship can load/unload at what terminal; maintenance schedules
   for ships; cost structures for ships; boil-off and heel calculations for each ship, including an
   optimal heel amount upon discharge at a regasification terminal; range of ship speeds and
   associated cost profile; and/or set of allowed fuels. Further, the input data may include one or
   more of contract specification; production and re-gasification location specifications rates;
30 ship specifications; ship compatibilities with contracts, production and re-gas terminals
   and/or berths; dry-dock requirements; storage tank requirements; berth specifications; berth
   and storage maintenance; loans and/or transfers of LNG among co-located joint ventures;
                                                  - 16 -

   LNG grades; optionality opportunities including in-charter, out-charter and/or diversion;
   price projections; and potential ship routes.
   [0063]      At block 204, objectives for the LNG shipping operations are determined.          The
   objectives may be determined by the user or system to provide certain outputs.                The
 5 objectives may include one or more of maximize social interest; minimize shipping costs;
   maximize profitability; and/or maximize shareholder profitability (e.g., multiple different
   parties involved in operations).
   [0064]       Then, at block 206, constraints for the optimization decisions are defined. The
   constraints may include hard constraints and soft constraints. The constraints may include
10 one or more of ship travel restrictions based on arrival and departure times, speed, distance,
   loading/unloading operations; compatibility requirements between different parties, storage
   tanks, berths, contracts, cargo sizes; limits on loans between different parties (e.g., JVs);
   storage restrictions; berth utilization; contractual requirements (quantity, time); and/or
   maintenance requirements.
15 [0065]      At block 208, one or more algorithms are determined.           The algorithms may
   include basic algorithms and along one or more extensions to handle soft constraints. The
   basic algorithms may include different algorithms that may be utilized in the system. As an
   example, the algorithms may be configured to be a five-stage method. The five stage method
   may include (i) stage 1: generating feasible solution to the feasibility model; (ii) stage 2:
20 generating optimal solution to feasibility model; (iii) stage 3: reducing in-chartered ships; (iv)
   stage 4: pursuing out-charter opportunity; and (v) stage 5: finding optimal solution to
   optimality model.
   [0066]       Once the algorithms, constraints and objectives are determined, optimal decisions
   are calculated, as shown in block 210.       The calculation of optimal decisions may include
25 using the one or more algorithms to maximize and/or minimize one or more objectives based
   on the input data, one or more constraint that may be confirguable as a soft or hard constrant
   (e.g., turned into a soft constraint or maintained as a hard constraint). This may be subject to
   a model including input data, one or more constraint that may be adjusted based on the
   various settings. The extensions is configured to handle soft constraints may include a soft
30 ratability constraint method and a soft inventory constraint method.          The soft ratability
   constraint method may include different approaches, such as minimizing violations after
   stage 5 of the five-stage method and/or minimizing violations after stage 2 of the five-stage
   method. The soft inventory constraint method may also include different approaches, such as
                                                  - 17 -

   minimizing violations after stage 5 of the five-stage method and/or minimizing violations
   after stage 2 of the five-stage method.
    [0067]      Once calculated, the optimal decisions are provided as output data, as shown in
   block 212.     The output data may include ship travel details (e.g., time, route, fuel, speed,
 5 "state" (e.g., warm or cold)); cargo size; LNG quality; storage-berth combination which a
   cargo is served; ship status as in-chartered or out-chartered; and planned dry-dock for the
   ship.
    [0068]      Then, the output is utilized for LNG operations, as shown in block 214. The use
   of the output may include updating the ADP or other scheduling plan, adjusting may be
10 utilized to operate the LNG supply operations. That is, the decision variables are used by the
   user to manage and/or adjust LNG shipping operations.
    [0069]     As noted above, the LNG ship scheduling model may include various types of
   input data, constraints, and/or objectives.       The LNG ship scheduling model may be a
   mathematical model that involves a collection of independent decision variables, dependent
15 (auxiliary) variables, and constraints specified by a data input instance. Decision variables
   may be manipulated by the solution algorithm toward the optimal value of an objective
   function (e.g. to find optimal decisions).       The final solution is assumed to satisfy the
   associated constraints and/or limits.
    [0070]     As an example, the LNG ship scheduling model may include an initial state of the
20 inventories, availability of ships, projected production profiles, contractual requirements,
   such as target quantity and/or quality; and schedules cargos in varying sizes to ships such that
   an objective, such as social economics, is optimized. The LNG ship scheduling model can be
   used for generating an initial annual delivery plan (ADP). In addition, the model can be used
   to analyze the impact of various business decisions to the bottom-line economics.            One
25 specific example may involve reviewing the impact of speeding up (or down) the entire or a
   part of the fleet and also determining whether to out-charter or in-charter a ship.
    [0071]     As this is a mathematical model, input data for the LNG ship scheduling model
   includes a wide range of data types. Some or all of this data may be required for a specific
   instance. This section presents all the input data and provides further explanation for certain
30 sections. As an example, the time horizon may be one of the input data types. The time
   horizon may include the start date of the planning horizon; length and duration (e.g., a one
   year period, but it may involve shorter and/or longer periods); time discretization, which is
   the smallest unit of time that specifies the frequency of decisions (e.g., 2 days, 1 day, and 1/2
                                                  - 18 -

   day). The time discretization is useful because the time calculations are based on discrete
   units of time. Fine discretization of time increases the complexity of the calculations by
   increasing the size and volume of computations, while course discretization may not provide
   realistic schedules as it is a simplified view of the problem. The time discretization is
 5 assumed to uniform throughout the planning horizon.
   [0072]       Due to the time discretization, rounding of various time-based data may be
   performed. The rounding rules employed may involve an internal parameter, such as X. Any
   time-based parameter or data may be rounded down to the nearest integer number of time
   units, if the fraction is less than or equal to X, and rounded up to the next largest integer
10 number of time units, if fraction is greater than X. As a specific example, if X is equal (=) to
   0.3 with discrete time units of one day, then a value of 1.25 days is rounded down to 1 day
   and 4.6 days is rounded up to 5 days. Further, some data may be the sum of multiple data
   entries (e.g., input data) and then the sum is rounded up or down. As such, for the discrete
   time units greater than a day, the data may be aggregated. For discrete time units less than a
15 day, daily data will be divided evenly. Price data is simply multiplied or reduced based on
   time granularity (e.g. half day units have same price where price is given daily). Further, to
   accommodate multi-time period operations, such as loading and unloading, the quantity
   loaded or unloaded per day may involve an approximation. The load or unload quantity may
   be spread out evenly across the number of time units associated with loading and/or
20 unloading and post-loading and/or unloading activities. Time unit rounding rules may be
   used to calculate that number of time units.
   [0073]      Another data type that may be utilized with the LNG ship scheduling model is
   ship specification data. The ship specification data may be associated with each ship in the
   fleet. The ship specification data may include ship type; owner; capacity; cargo sizes; fuel
25 options; fuel (diesel) usage; daily boil-off rates; minimum SSD MCR coefficient; minimum
   DFD MCR coefficient; heel volume; fuel usage at port and canal; speed; fixed cost; available
   time windows; start location and state, end location and state; out-charter option; cool-down
   time(e.g., cool-down time from warm and/or cool-down time from dry); and/or cool down
   loss from warm; cool down loss from dry.
30 [0074]       The ship specification data may include information about the ships' operation.
   This data may include classifications, such as conventional, QFLEX, QMAX). The owner
   may include a designation whether the ship is joint venture ship (JV), which is referred to as
   DES, and if it is a customer ship, it is referred to as FOB. The capacity may include
                                                  - 19 -

   maximum volume of LNG that a ship can carry and/or ability to load any quality and/or grade
   of LNG. The cargo sizes may include discrete set of loading sizes for ships, which may not
   necessarily be used in all variants of the LNG ship scheduling model, or more specifically an
   ADP model.
 5 [0075]      Another type of ship specification data is the fuel options. The fuel options may
   include an indication that ships can operate using different fuels. Further, as LNG is carried
   in very low temperatures, some of the LNG evaporates (i.e. boil-off) during the travel. This
   is a result of the heat difference between the tank and outside and associated efficiencies for
   the storage. Accordingly, some ships may use this boil-off gas as fuel. This makes the fuel
10 options and boil-off rates related to each other. The fuel options may include this input to
   specify which fuel options are compatible with each ship. For example, the input may be
   specified as NBO (natural boil-off) and diesel (e.g., uses the boil-off from LNG tank as fuel
   in addition to the diesel fuel); NBO and forced boil-off (FBO) (e.g., uses natural and forced
   boil-off as fuel); slow steam diesel (SSD) with re-liquefaction (e.g., uses only diesel and
15 liquefies the boil-off therefore there is no loss due to boil-off); and/or gas combustion unit
   (GCU) (e.g., uses only diesel, re-liquefaction is turned-off).
   [0076]      Another type of ship specification data may include other fuel related data types.
   For example, the fuel (diesel) usage may include a cubic function of speed, wherein its
   coefficients are provided or specified by the ship manufacturer. The daily boil-off rates may
20 depends on ship, voyage leg (loaded and/or ballast), speed, fuel selection. The minimum
   slow steam diesel (SSD) maximum continuous rating (MCR) coefficient is the minimum
   MCR coefficient for SSD and steaming ships for calculating fuel use based on speed. The
   minimum DFD MCR coefficient is the minimum MCR coefficient for DFD ships for
   calculating fuel use based on speed. The heel volume involves the ship's requirement of a
25 small amount of gas left in the tank in the ballast leg of a ship's trip to keep the tank cool by
   natural evaporation. Ships are assumed to arrive at a production terminal in cold state. Fuel
   usage at port and canal is the ship's use of some fuel while they are not travelling.         An
   average daily fuel consumption rate is assumed.
   [0077]      The ship specification data may also include ship operation data. For example,
30 the speed may include the ship's speed, which is assumed to travel with one of three average
   speeds (e.g., minimum, maximum, and nominal). This type of discretization is useful to
   formulate the LNG ship scheduling model using a time-space network. The travel times are
   assumed to be identical during the entire year for this aspect. The LNG ship scheduling
                                                 -20  -

   model can also accommodate speed changes based on seasonal variations, if preferred. As
   specific example, the LNG ship scheduling model may include MCR at a base speed, which
   is the maximum continuous rate at base speed. The fixed cost may include the fixed daily
   cost incurred for each DES ship. This part of the shipping cost is fixed, while the fuel cost
 5 depends on the distance and speed. Also, the available time windows are the time period that
   the ship is assumed to be available. The unavailability due to dry-dock may be handled
   separately. The start location and state, end location and state are initial conditions that are
   set for a ship based on last year's expected final situation and business expectations for next
   year. The out-charter option may specify if a DES ship can be considered for a potential out
10 charter opportunity.
    [0078]     Further, the ship specification data may include additional ship operation data.
   For example, the cool-down time is the time needed for the ship to be cooled down before
   loading operation. The cool-down time from warm is the time spent when the ship arrives to
   production without any heel. The cool-down time from dry is the time that is spent when a
15 ship arrives to production from dry-dock. These can be ship, berth, or port specific. Also,
   the cool down loss from warm may include energy cost to cool ship from warm and cool
   down loss from dry which is energy cost to cool ship from dry.
    [0079]     As an example of the ship specification data, the following table describes the
   comparison of boil-off ship and reliquefaction ship, as shown in Table 1.               Table 1
20 summarizes the fuel, boil-off and heel related information, which is shown below:

    [0080]     As shown in this Table 1, the LNG ship scheduling model may include constraints
   that capture the relationship between speed, fuel usage, boil-off, and voyage leg for each ship.
25  [0081]     Further still, the input data may include other specifications, such as production
   and regasification specifications and dry-dock specifications. For example, the production
   and regasification specifications may include locations, compatibility with each vessel and/or
   port fees. The dry-dock specifications may include planned maintenance (e.g., each ship
   needs to be regularly maintained). The planned maintenance window may be included in the
                                                 - 21 -

    input data, which may include the following specifications of locations, compatibility with
    each vessel (e.g., dry-dock location; earliest and/or latest start date, duration, and/or exit
    status (e.g., cold, warm, dry, and the like)).
    [0082]       Another input data type may include storage tanks located in production and re
 5  gasification side; berths and storage and berth compatibility. The storage tanks located in
   production and re-gasification side may include location, capacity, initial inventory and/or
    grade. The grade may include storage units at production terminals may only accept a single
    quality of LNG, while the initial inventory is the amount of LNG available in the beginning
    of planning horizon. The storage unit may be shared by various parties. For example, in a
10 joint venture (JV) setting, each party of the JV may send produced LNG to multiple storage
   units. These specifications have to comply with the compatibility between the joint venture
    agreement and storage unit. The berths may include location; berthing/de-berthing time (e.g.,
    amount of time a ship takes for these operations); and/or load/unload rates (e.g., this rate
    affects the time it takes to complete loading or unloading operations). The rates and times
15  may vary based on ship and location.        The loading and/or unloading operation(s) may be
   performed at a single berth. The LNG ship scheduling model may or may not consider berth
    limits at re-gasification terminals because a producer has limited visibility or control of
    operations at re-gasification terminals.      The storage and berth compatibility may involve
    specifying storage tanks that can transfer LNG to specific berths. This is typically bound by
20  the available infrastructure of the LNG facility. For regas operations, the LNG ship
    scheduling model may be used for managing inventory for approximating ratability, actual
    control, simulating customer behavior.
    [0083]       The input data type may also include specific LNG information. For example, the
    input data may include loans and/or transfers of LNG among co-located third parties (e.g.,
25  JVs). The loans and/or transfers of LNG among co-located third parties may include third
   party supplier and storage unit; destination third party (e.g., JV) and storage unit; quantity
    and quality of LNG; transfer rate, daily max loan and/or maximum net; and/or time and/or
    date of transaction. Transfers may be assumed to finalize instantaneously within a storage
   unit. Between separate storage units, transfer time may be based on a rate limit between
30 units. Transfers should be of the same quality and/or grade. The balance should be restored
   by the end of the time horizon and no cost or fees are assumed for the transfers and loans.
   Also, production and regasification rates are another input data type. This data type may
    include daily projections of LNG production of multiple third parties, allocation of a third
                                                    -22 -

   parties production to a storage unit; and/or daily projections of re-gasification of customers.
   The daily production and re-gas rate forecasts are provided as input data. Production changes
   due to planned maintenance can be adjusted in the input data. Moreover, another input data
   type may include LNG grades.           The LNG grades may include energy content: typically
 5 specified as energy quantity per volume; boil-off equivalent: coefficient to calculate boil off
   fuel energy equivalence to fuel oil amount; and/or density.
   [0084]      As another input data type, contractual data may be used in the LNG ship
   scheduling model. The contractual data may include contract name; third party involved in
   the agreement (e.g., JVs, which may include single JV customer or multiple location
10 assignment per contract); customer, location, type (e.g., DES/FOB), minimum (min), target,
   and/or maximum (max) delivery quantities, start and/or end date of annual delivery window,
   minimum      and/or   maximum       energy   content    of delivered     cargos;  and/or ratability
   specifications (e.g., monthly, quarterly, etc.). The ratability time windows may be inclusive
   of deliveries within the time range. These may include start date (e.g., beginning of ratability
15 period); end date (e.g., end of ratability period); minimum quantity (e.g., minimum quantity
   in period); target quantity (e.g., target quantity in ratability period); and/or maximum quantity
   (e.g., maximum quantity in ratability period).
   [0085]      The contractual data may also include various other contractual terms, such as fuel
   compatibility; whether or not an in-charter ship may deliver one or more cargos for contract;
20 whether or not vessels may return back to supply location warm or cold; maximum additional
   spot sale; diversion notification time; maximum divertible quantity; replacement penalty;
   and/or compatible cargo sizes for each contract. The fuel compatibility may specify if ships
   serving a contract may use a specific fuel type.         The maximum additional spot sale may
   include the maximum amount of spot sales (e.g. due to overproduction) that may be delivered
25 to a contract. The diversion notification time may include a notification requirement for
   scheduling a diversion. The max divertible quantity may include the maximum quantity that
   may be diverted from contract. The replacement penalty may include a fee paid to buyer for
   diverted quantity. The compatible cargo sizes for each contract may specify the cargo sizes
   that may be utilized in the LNG ship scheduling model. Further, a contract can have multiple
30 delivery windows, which may or may not overlap and each cargo can have varying grades of
   LNG.
   [0086]      As yet another type of input data, time windows and maintenance data may be
   used by the LNG ship scheduling model. For each time window, the delivery location, start
                                                   - 23 -

   date, end date, minimum cargoes (e.g., minimum number of deliveries), maximum cargoes
   (e.g., maximum number of deliveries), minimum quantity (e.g., minimum LNG to be
   delivered within time span), maximum quantity (e.g., maximum LNG to be delivered within
   time span) and/or compatible cargo sizes for each time window. The maintenance data may
 5 include berth and storage maintenance that may be handled by setting berth and storage
   availability in the LNG ship scheduling model.
   [0087]      The data input may also include optionality opportunities.             The optionality
   opportunities may include in-charter, out-charter and/or short term diversion. The in-charter
   may include a list of ships available for in-chartering. For the in-charter ships, the data may
10 include ship specifications; daily costs; available time window; type (e.g., one way - paid
   only for one way voyage and fees, round trip - paid for roundtrip voyage, and/or long term
   paid for long time period without specific voyage info); positioning (e.g., whether or not
   positioning fee is required and paid); positioning lump sum for fee for positioning; re
   positioning, whether or not re-positioning is required and paid; re-positioning lump sum if fee
15 for re-positioning is required; fixed cost (e.g., general fixed costs); and /or daily rate if a daily
   rate is charged. The out-charter may include a list of opportunities for out-chartering. The
   out-charter data may include required ship specifications; revenue; required time window;
   ship class (e.g., ship class required for out-charter); opportunity type (e.g., one way that is
   paid only for one way voyage and fees; round trip that is paid for roundtrip voyage; and/or
20 long term that is paid for long time period without specific voyage information); required
   location (e.g., location to send ship for out-charter, such as first location in one way or
   roundtrip); required date, which is the date to send ship; required state, which is the state of
   ship to arrive at location; completion location, which is the location of ship when finished,
   such as the last location in one way or roundtrip); completion date that is the date the ship is
25 finished and at location; end state, which is the state of ship when returning; positioning (e.g.,
   whether or not positioning fee is required and paid); position lump sum (e.g., fee for
   positioning); re-positioning, which is a determination whether or not re-positioning is
   required and paid; re-positioning lump sum, which is the fee for re-positioning; fixed cost,
   which is the general fixed costs; and/or daily rate, which is the daily rate charged. The short
30 term diversion may include required quantity and/or quality; time range; and/or price.
   [0088]      As an example of the optionality opportunity data, the following table describes
   the comparison of in-charter between incoming voyage, returning voyage, intermediate
                                                  -24  -

   voyages and number of deliveries, as shown in Table 2. Table 2 summarizes the type and
   voyage details for in-charters, which is shown below:

 5 where FixedCost is the fixed cost, PosLumpSum is the positioning lump sum amount,
   RePosLumpSum is the re-positioning lump sum amount, numDays is the number of days.
   [0089]      Price data is yet another input data type.     The price data may include price
   projections for each day or other time period. The price data may include market index,
   which is the list of market indices for which to assign market pricing; fuel, which is the list of
10 production locations for which to assign fuel price; spot, which is the list of re-gasification
   terminals for which to assign spot pricing; and/or contract, which is the list of contracts for
   which to assign contract pricing. The prices are assumed to be adjusted (e.g., rolling average,
   or other suitable method) such that price on the day delivered (DES) or picked up (FOB) is
   the price expected to be received for revenue and royalty calculations, or cost of fuel on a day
15 for cost calculations. The fuel price may be independent of location and/or region.
   [0090]      Route data is another input data type. The route data may include the nautical
   distance between production, re-gas, and/or dry-dock locations based on various routes (e.g.,
   both ways). The route data may also include determining whether or not there is a delay due
   to canal on a route and/or the cost of transit from canal.    The route data may also include
20 determining whether or not there is a delay due to bunkering on a route, and/or bunker fee.
   Bunkering is assumed to occur on return voyages to production locations.
   [0091]      Complex time windows are yet another input data type. Some complex deliveries
   may involve more than single seller, port, and/or buyer. For such situations, the LNG ship
   scheduling model may include input data that represents the business needs. For example, the
25 complex time windows may include various data to model the business needs. This data may
   include contract IDI (e.g., contract for delivery part one); location 1 (e.g., re-gasification
                                                 -25 -

   location for delivery part one); cargo size 1 (e.g., size of delivery part one); LNG gradel
   (e.g., LNG energy quality for delivery part one); earliest start datel (e.g., earliest date for
   complex delivery part one); latest end date 1 (e.g., last date for complex delivery part one);
   contract ID2 (e.g., contract for delivery part two); location 2 (e.g., re-gasification location for
 5 delivery part two); cargo size 2 (e.g., size of delivery part two); LNG grade2 (e.g., LNG
   energy quality for delivery part two); earliest start date 2 (e.g., earliest date for complex
   delivery part two); latest end date 2 (e.g., last date for complex delivery part two);minimum
   deliveries (e.g., minimum number of complex deliveries, such as split and/or co-load, in a
   time window); maximum deliveries (e.g., maximum number of complex deliveries, such as
10 split and/or co-load, in time window); and/or fiscal relationship. The fiscal relationship may
   include the fiscal rules that specify tax rate, profit fraction, royalty rate for each delivery.
   Each contract can have complex relationships, correlations across deliveries.
   [0092]      Following table, Table 3, summarizes some of such complex deliveries.

   [0093]      In this Table 3, combinations of settings for complex windows. For example, one
   or more JVs and/or one or more contractors may be involved with one or more locations.
   [0094]      In addition to the input data, different variables may be utilized by the LNG ship
   scheduling model as well. For example, variables can be classified as two types: decision
20 variables and dependent (auxiliary) variables. Decision variables are the variables that the
   optimization algorithms are manipulating to achieve a desirable objective value. Decision
   variables specify activities of each ship within the entire time horizon.        For example, the
   decision variables may include arrival date to production or re-gas locations; departure date
                                                  - 26 -

   and/or time from production/re-gas locations; size of assigned cargo size at each trip and
   associated LNG quality; storage-berth combination which a cargo is served; travel route; fuel
   type in each leg of a trip; speed in each leg of a trip; departure "state" from regas port (e.g.,
   warm versus cold); whether a ship is in-chartered or out-chartered for a certain period; and/or
 5 whether a ship goes to dry-dock on a certain day. The dependent (auxiliary) variables are
   dependent on the value of the data input and decision variables. For example, the dependent
   variables may include storage levels at production and re-gas terminals at each point in time.
   [0095]       Further, constraints may be used by the LNG ship scheduling model to force the
   decisions to comply with some business or physical requirements. In the LNG ship
10 scheduling model, constraints should satisfy a feasible solution. As will be explained further
   below, some of these constraints can be considered as soft constraints, which may be able to
   slightly violate the constraint, while hard constraints are more rigid.
   [0096]       Certain constraints are related to the input data noted above.       For example,
   constraints   may include compatibility requirements between JV and storage tanks;
15 compatibility requirements between storage tanks and berth to ensure loading a single grade
   to a ship; compatibility requirements between contracts and fuel options and/or third party
   (e.g., JV) transfers being limited to not exceed a daily maximum amount and maximum net
   amount. Other constraints may be included in the LNG ship scheduling model as specific
   constraints.   For example, constraints may include setting arrival and departure timing of
20 vessels to feasible time periods based on speed, distance, loading/unloading operations;
   inventory mass balance at production and regasification storage units being set to a value
   greater than or equal to zero; inventory is maintained under storage capacity (e.g., relaxed in
   soft constraints extension); loans between JV's have to be balanced by the end of the time
   horizon; cargo size has to be less than vessel capacity; berths can be utilized by only one
25 vessel at a time; total delivery amount and/or quality has to be acceptable based on
   contractual requirements; deliveries have to be performed within the delivery time windows
   (e.g., quantity and time window); deliveries follow ratability windows; and/or vessels have to
   be maintained within necessary time windows.
   [0097]       The input data and constraints are utilized based on one or more objectives. That
30 is, one or more optimization algorithm may be utilized to manipulate the decision variables to
   maximize or minimize one of these potential objective functions (e.g.,               the value
   determination for an objective).      The objective functions may include maximizing social
   interest; minimize shipping costs, maximizing joint venture profitability, maximizing IOC
                                                  -27  -

    shareholder profitability and/or maximizing NOC interest, for example.           The maximizing
    social interest may be the difference between overall revenue coming from deliveries and
    shipping costs due to fixed, fuel, canal, and bunker costs. The minimizing shipping costs
    may be the shipping cost is based on fixed, fuel, canal, and/or bunker costs. The maximizing
 5 joint venture profitability (e.g., single JV case) may include maximizing profit of a single JV,
    which may apply if there are multiple JV's.         The maximize IOC shareholder profitability
    (e.g., multiple JV case) may include maximizing profit of an IOC partnering with multiple
    JV's.    The maximizing NOC interest (e.g., multiple JV case) may include maximizing
    interests of an NOC having shares in multiple JV's
10  [0098]       With the objectives, one or more algorithms may be used in the LNG ship
    scheduling model to provide the optimal decision variables.         The algorithm uses several
    models derived from the optimality model, which is a variation of the LNG ship scheduling
    model. The optimality model contains the variables, constraints and objective function which
    may be one of several alternatives, such as maximization of social economics and/or
15  minimization of shipping cost. The LNG ship scheduling model and all derived models may
   be mixed-integer linear models. Details of other models are provided further below.
    [0099]       The feasibility model is a relaxation of the optimality model. It includes various
    features, such as objective function which minimizes total penalty due to infeasibilities. The
    infeasibilities may include slacks, such as daily loss production, daily stock-out, violation of
20  lower bound of contractual requirements, and/or violation of lower bound of time windows
    requirements.
    [00100]      Another model is the in-charter model.      The in-charter model is similar to the
    optimality model except the objective function.         This model includes features, such as
    objective function that minimizes cargos delivered by in-chartered ships. It may include all
25  variables and constraints of optimality model.
    [00101]      The out-charter model is yet another model. The out-charter model is similar to
    the optimality model except the objective function. This model includes features, such as
    objective function which minimizes the total number of cargos that a specific ship delivers. It
    may include all variables and constraints of optimality model.
30  [00102]      The minimize-ratability-violation (MRV) model is a model similar to the
    feasibility model except the objective function and some additional constraints. The objective
    function minimizes the violations due to ratability constraints. Model includes an additional
    constraint to limit the deterioration in optimal objective value such as social economics.
                                                   -28-

   [00103]     As noted above, the algorithm may include five stages. Figure 2B is a flow chart
   220 of the five stage algorithm method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present
   techniques. In this diagram 220, various stages may be performed to enhance the LNG ship
   scheduling model. In stage 1, as shown in block 222, a feasible solution is generated using
 5 feasibility model. In stage 2, as shown in block 224, an optimal solution is generated for the
   feasibility model. The optimal solution has no violation and therefore it is also feasible to the
   optimality model. In stage 3, as shown in block 226, utilization of in-chartered ships are
   minimized using in-charter model. In stage 4, as shown in block 228, potential out-charter
   opportunities are searched using out-charter model. In stage 5, as shown in block 230, an
10 optimal solution is searched for the optimality model. The output of these algothrms is used
   to perform LNG shipping operations, as shown in block 232.
   [00104]     The stages 3, 4, and 5 may follow the described order or may be rearranged into a
   different order to emphasize a different aspect of optimal solution.       For example, if out
   chartering is more beneficial than lessening in-chartering, then stage 4 may be performed
15 before stage 3. These various stages are further described below.
   [00105]     In stage 1, as noted in block 222, a feasible solution is generated to the feasibility
   model. The feasibility model is initialized and then solved by a rolling time algorithm. The
   rolling time algorithm breaks the entire time horizon into a sequence of smaller, but
   overlapping time blocks, and solves each smaller problem sequentially. A feasible solution is
20 constructed by solving a sequence of optimization sub problems, each of which corresponds
   to smaller time block. The rolling time algorithm is shown further in Figure 3.
   [00106]     Figure 3 is flow chart 300 of a rolling time algorithm according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present techniques. In this flow chart 300, a feasibility model is obtained
   in block 302. The model variables are initialized in block 304.
25 [00107]     Then, at block 306, the parameters to construct subproblems may be determined
   based on the difficulty of the problem. These parameters may include the total number of
   time periods that are to be solved in each sub problem, and the total number of time periods
   during which the schedule are fixed after a sub problem is solved.
   [00108]     Once the parameters are calculated, subproblems may be constructed and solved
30 iteratively starting from the beginning of the planning horizon to the end of the planning
   horizon. For each iteration, a determination is made whether the current starting time period
   of the subproblem t is less than T, as shown in block 308. If t exceeds T (e.g., number of
   time periods in the planning horizon, such as 365 days), then ship delivery schedules have
                                                 - 29 -

   been made for all time periods in the planning horizon, and a feasible solution to the
   feasibility model is obtained, as shown in block 310.
   [00109]      However, if t is less than T (e.g., number of time periods in the planning horizon,
   such as 365 days), the process may be continued by constructing a subproblem whose
 5 objective function coefficients are adjusted in block 312. The adjustment of the objective
   function coefficients may be performed to achieve a reasonable scaling for violations. For
   example, the scaling may include penalty rate for cargo violation of 250; penalty rate for
   quantity violation of 4; and penalty rate for volume violation on time t. Then, the penalty
   rates may be adjusted during the algorithm.
10 [00110]      Once the objective function coefficients are adjusted, sub problem may be created,
   as shown in block 314. The sub problem is created by populating variables, parameters and
   constraints.    Then in block 316, the solver configuration may be adjusted.           The solver
   adjustment may include, but are not limited to, node limits, time limits and optimality
   tolerance. At block 318, the sub problem is solved. The solving the sub problem may
15 include using different stopping criteria based on the distance between the current time
   periods and the end of the time horizon.
   [00111]      Once the sub problem is solved, problem settings may be updated, including the
   ship schedules for some specific time periods, and the starting time period of the next
   potential subproblem, as shown in block 320. Then, the update is provided to block 308 to
20 determine whether the process should be reiterated or the feasible solution to the feasibility
   model is determined, as shown in block 310.
   [00112]      In stage 2, the optimal solution to feasibility model is generated.        This may
   involve the algorithm performing a sequence of local searches until the objective function
   value of the feasibility model reaches zero. The sequence of local searches may include two
25 rounds. During the first round, one-direction search, k-day-flexibility-time-window search,
   sorted one-ship search and sorted two-ship search are performed sequentially. If the objective
   function value is positive after the first round, it may be the result of the local search getting
   stuck in a local optimal solution or infeasibility of the optimality model.           In case the
   algorithm cannot find a solution with zero infeasibility in the first round, a second round is
30 performed. The second round may include performing a time-window search, sorted one
   ship search and sorted two-ship search. If the objective function value is still positive, it is
   very likely that the optimality problem is infeasible.
                                                   - 30 -

   [00113]     As noted above, the local searches here may include a one-direction search, a k
   day-flexibility-time-window search, a sorted one-ship search, a sorted two-ship search, and a
   time-window search. The one-direction search may include solving feasibility subproblems
   iteratively in which, loading and unloading arcs are fixed to their current values alternatively
 5 while all other arcs are left as free variables. The algorithm is terminated when the objective
   function value reaches zero or cannot be improved after a specified number of iterations (e.g.,
   number of subproblems may be created in this neighborhood structure). The k-day-flexibility
   time-window search may also be performed. For this search, each ship is given flexibility to
   leave several days earlier or later for a given existing schedule. The number of days that each
10 ship is allowed to advance or delay may take various values. A typical value used in practice
   is one day. In the network traveling and waiting arcs for each ship within search time window
   are left as free variables while all other arcs are fixed to their current value. The algorithm
   optimizes feasibility model for each ship and the algorithm is terminated when the objective
   function value reaches zero or cannot be improved. The sorted one-ship search may also be
15 performed. For this search, the schedule for each ship is optimized while schedules for other
   ships are fixed to a given existing schedule. In the network, the arcs related to one ship are
   set free while others are fixed to their current values. The algorithm optimizes feasibility
   model and is terminated when the objective function value reaches zero or cannot be
   improved after a specified number of iterations (e.g., the total number of ships). The sequence
20 of ships to optimize depends on the solution quality associated with each ship. Typically,
   higher level of violation a ship has in its schedule; there is more chance to improve its
   schedule. Therefore, the ships are sorted according to their violation degree in non-increasing
   order at the beginning of the algorithm. After each round of local search, the order of ships is
   updated based on the new schedule. The sorted two-ship search may also be performed. For
25 the sorted two-ship search, schedules for two ships are optimized simultaneously, while
   schedules for other ships are fixed to a given existing schedule. In the network, arcs for two
   ships are left as free variables while all other arcs are fixed to their current values. The
   algorithm optimizes feasibility model and is terminated when the objective function value
   reaches zero or cannot be improved after a specified number of iterations (e.g., the total
30 number of ship pairs). Similar as the one-ship search, the ship pairs are prioritized in non
   increasing order based on the total violation. After each round of local search, the order of
   pairs is updated based on the new schedule. The time-window search may also be performed.
   Time-window search in this stage is similar to the rolling time window search in stage 1. This
                                                  -31 -

   search may optimize all ship schedules for shorter time blocks sequentially, while fixing the
   schedule outside of the time block. The parameters may also be defined to determine the
   number of periods solved in a subproblem and the number of time periods where the ship
   schedule will be fixed. The algorithm optimizes feasibility model and is terminated when the
 5 objective function value reaches zero or cannot be improved after a specified number of
   iterations (e.g., the total number of time windows which can be constructed during one
   planning horizon).
   [00114]     In stage 3, the in-chartered ships may be reduced.        Reducing the usage of in
   chartered ships may have a beneficial impact on the economics. This stage of the algorithm
10 seeks potential improvements in the solution be reducing in-chartered ships, while
   maintaining the delivery plans within acceptable limits. This stage minimizes the usage of
   in-chartered ships one by one, each of which is accomplished in three steps. The first step
   involves the selection of the next in-chartered ship which is more likely to be idled compared
   to other in-charters. In this step, all in-chartered ships may be sorted based on the number of
15 cargos that it carries.  The in-chartered ship that carries the fewest cargos may be selected
   because it may be easier to idle such a ship by switching fewer cargos to other ships. The
   second step tries to use sorted two-ships local searches to totally idle the selected in-chartered
   ship by shifting/swapping cargos. Similar to the operation in stage 2, schedules for two ships,
   the selected in-charter and another ship that may take over cargos from the selected in
20 chartered ship are optimized simultaneously, while maintaining other ships fixed. The only
   difference from the step in stage 2 and this step is that the in-charter model is used where the
   objective is to minimize the number of cargos that the selected in-chartered ship carries. The
   algorithm optimizes in-charter model and is terminated when the objective function value
   reaches zero, is below a threshold or after a specified number of iterations (e.g., the total
25 number of ships that may take over cargos from the selected in-chartered ship). Then, the
   time window search is performed in the third step. Similar to the step in stage 2, this search
   optimized ship schedules for shorter time blocks sequentially, while fixing the schedule
   outside of the time block. There are two differences between the step in stage 2 and this step.
   One difference is that, the time windows is constructed around the period when the in
30 chartered ship has cargo delivery; and the other is that in-charter model is used with the
   objective to minimize the number of cargos for the selected in-chartered ship.
   [00115]     In stage 4, out-charter opportunities are pursued.      Out-chartering a ship has a
   beneficial impact on the economics as long as it does not affect the delivery plans. Given a
                                                   - 32 -

   feasible schedule for the optimality problem, this stage tries to maximize the number of ships
   to be out-chartered. This stage of the algorithm investigates out-chartering eligible ships one
   by one by using three steps. In the first step, all ships, which are eligible for out-charter
   opportunity may be sorted based on the number of cargos. The ship carrying fewest cargos
 5 may be selected since it may be easier to switch fewer cargos to other ships. Then, in the
   second step, local searches are used to totally idle the selected ship by shifting/swapping
   cargos. These searches may include the sorted two-ship search and the time-window search
   similar to the steps in stage 3.   Instead of the in-charter model used in stage 3, out-charter
   model is used to minimize the total number of carrying cargos for the selected ship. In the
10 third step, the assignments are finalized between the idled ships and out-charter opportunities.
   Note that this part of the algorithm is specifically designed for pursuing out-charter
   opportunities that require a ship to be idle for the entire time horizon. Shorter term
   opportunities can be materialized in stage 5.
   [00116]      In stage 5, optimal solution is determined for the optimality model. The algorithm
15 may perform a sequence of local searches until the objective function value of the optimality
   model is within a threshold, or does not improve for a specified number of iterations. The
   local searches include time-windows search, one-ship, and two-ship search, which are
   discussed below.
   [00117]      The time-windows search may be similar to the rolling time algorithm in stage 1.
20 This search may optimize all ship schedules for shorter time blocks sequentially, while fixing
   the schedule outside of the time block. The parameters may include number of time periods
   solved in the sub problem, and number of time periods fixed after the sub problem is solved.
   [00118]      Further, the one-ship search and the two-ship searches may be performed similar
   to the algorithm in stage 2, which is noted above, with the exception that this local search is
25 applied to the optimality problem.
   [00119]      With regard to the soft constraint extensions to LNG ship scheduling model, a
   feasible solution for the LNG ship scheduling model (e.g., optimality model) satisfies all the
   constraints. The benefit of satisfying feasibility is not the same for each of the constraints.
   While some of the constraints need to be satisfied due to the contractual or physical capacity
30 restrictions (e.g. inventory and/or production), others, such as ratability constraints, present
   users' or customers' preferences and can be slightly violated. Such soft constraints may
   enhance the solution algorithm. That is, soft constraints may be applied either because it is
   difficult to find a feasible solution when hard constraints are used (e.g., infeasible or time
                                                   - 33 -

   consuming) or because economics improvement is restricted due to burdensome hard
   constraints.    Accordingly, soft ratability constraints are designed to facilitate limited
   flexibility for feasibility and economics; while soft inventory levels are designed for
   feasibility.
 5 [00120]      As an example, the soft constraints may be utilized to enhance the solution
   algorithm. In particular, the soft constraints may enhance solutions for situations where it is
   difficult and/or impossible to find a feasible solution due to hard constraints. These situations
   may involve those having infeasible solutions and/or very few feasible solutions (e.g.,
   performance of algorithm may not complete within an acceptable time period).               Other
10 situations may involve those where the economics deteriorate drastically due to restrictions
   by hard constraints.    Specifically, relaxing some of strict ratability constraints may allow
   some deliveries to be made a day early or late. This may not cause any problem for the LNG
   operations and may create additional value.
   [00121]      To provide advantages for this flexibility to enhance the algorithm's performance,
15 the LNG ship scheduling model may include soft constraints, such as soft ratability
   constraints and/or soft inventory constraints.       The soft ratability constraints may include
   ratability constraints that represent users' or customers' preferences. These may guide the
   LNG ship scheduling model to make certain deliveries in a desired fashion, but can be
   slightly violated (e.g., adjusted to have a larger tolerance range) without creating any
20 problems for the LNG shipping operations.           The soft inventory constraints may include
   shipping and production disruptions that lead to changes in projected inventory levels.
   Therefore, some of the physical inventory restrictions may not have to be enforced strictly for
   the entire year. Imposing such hard inventory constraints for the entire planning horizon may
   unduly restrict the solution space. As shown in block 242, the algorithm may be automated to
25 identify constraints that can be modeled as soft constraints.
   [00122]      With regard to soft ratability constraints, each customer has a specific preference
   for deliveries throughout the year. For example, the customer may prefer the deliveries to be
   evenly distributed throughout the year. Optimality model includes constraints for ratability
   windows for each contract, which enforce a proportional                  shipment to a certain
30 location/contract throughout the year.
   [00123]      Various mechanisms may be utilized to implement ratability windows in the LNG
   ship scheduling model. As an example, the ratability constraints may include monthly; bi
   monthly, bi-monthly with one month overlap; quarterly; quarterly with one month overlap;
                                                  - 34 -

   quarterly with two month overlap. Further, the upper and lower bound quantity for each
   ratability window can be generated in various manners. As an example, two different logics,
   based on the variety of vessels serving a specific contract/location, and one logic based on
   aggregation is described below. If the size of ships serving a location is close to each other,
 5 then the following logic for each contract may be implemented:
   TargetQuantity(tw)     = TargetMMBTU / NofRatabilityWindows
   avgTargetNOfDeliveries(tw)      = TargetQuantity(tw)/(AvgShipSize * EnergyContent)
   minTargetNumberOfDeliveries(tw)        = max(O,floor(avgTargetNOfDeliveries(tw))-1)
   maxTargetNumberOfDeliveries(tw)        =  ceiling(avgTargetNOfDeliveries(tw))
10 minQuantity(tw)=minTargetNumberOfDeliveries(tw)*minshipsize(c)*EnergyContent
   maxQuantity(tw)=maxTargetNumberOfDeliveries(tw)*maxshipsize(c)*EnergyContent
   where TargetMMBTU is the target annual delivery quantity from contractual obligations;
   minshipsize, maxshipsize, AvgShipSize: min, max, average size of ships which can serve to a
   specific contract; minQuantity, maxQuantity, TargetQuantity: min, max, target quantity of
15 LNG       to    be    delivered   in    a    time     window;  minTargetNumberOfDeliveries,
   maxTargetNumberOfDeliveries;         avgTargetNOfDeliveries: min, max, average number of
   deliveries for a ratability window; EnergyContent: energy content of LNG; TargetMMBTU:
   target amount of LNG to deliver in MMBTU units; and NofRatabilityWindows: number of
   ratability windows in one year. The logic uses the similar ships are similar than it is enough
20 to provide one to two delivery flexibility for each time window.
   [00124]      If the size of ships serving a location are different from each other (above a
   threshold), then the following logic may be implemented:
   TargetQuantity(tw)     = TargetMMBTU / NofRatabilityWindows
   minQuantity(tw)= max(O, TargetQuantity(tw) - downflex)
25 maxQuantity(tw)= TargetQuantity(tw) + upflex;
   , where downflex and upflex are defined as:
   Downflex     = maxshipsize * EnergyContent
   Upflex   =  maxshipsize * EnergyContent
   [00125]      Another logic is to aggregate (e.g., sum) the monthly upper and lower bounds of
30 two months and generate upper and lower bounds for bi-monthly; and similarly summing
   bounds of three months for calculating quarterly ratability windows. Using aggregate
   ratability windows creates a relaxation of the original model.
                                                   - 35 -

   [00126]      In other embodiments, it may be preferred to have deliveries to be made roughly
   even without satisfying the ratability constraints exactly. Accordingly, this type of business
   constraints may be represented using soft constraints.          While multiple methods may be
   utilized to incorporate the soft ratability constraints into the current algorithm, two alternative
 5 approaches are described below, which include the minimize ratability after stage 5 and
   minimize ratability after Stage 2.
   [00127]      In the proposed algorithms, two or more sets of ratability restrictions may be used
   (e.g., original and looser (or aggregate)). The original constraints are typically created based
   on business needs. For instance if a customer requests deliveries to be roughly equal in each
10 month, then similar lower and upper bounds on deliveries are provided for each month. The
   proposed algorithm may be automated to decide which type of aggregation to use based on
   model inputs such as the number of vessels, number of contracts, number of deliveries, and
   original ratability requirements.
   [00128]      With regard to the minimize ratability violation after stage 5 method, the
15 algorithm first decides on the aggregate ratability constraints based on model inputs. Stages 1
   to 5 is applied with ratability constraints which are looser (or aggregate) than original model.
   For instance, if the original model has monthly ratability windows, then aggregate model may
   have quarterly ratability windows. Aggregate (Quarterly) may be generated in several
   potential approaches provided above. The objective of the aggregate ratability is to lessen
20 solution time without compromising the quality of optimal solution. At the end of stage 5,
   algorithm finds a feasible solution to the model with aggregate ratability windows.            This
   solution may or may not be feasible with respect to the original ratability (e.g., monthly).
   Then, in a MRV stage (Minimize Ratability Violation), the algorithm minimizes ratability
   violations with respect to the original ratability windows. The model may also include an
25 additional constraint, which limits deterioration in the objective function value to a range
   within some tolerance around the optimal solution found in stage 5. The MRV stage, similar
   to stage 2, may be solved using one-direction search, time-window search, sorted one-ship
   search, and sorted two-ship search.
   [00129]      As an example, the method may include the following stages. In stage 1, the
30 feasible solution to feasibility model is generated using aggregate ratability windows. Then,
   in stage 2, the optimal solution to feasibility model is generated using aggregate ratability
   windows. At stage 3, the in-charter usage is reduced using the aggregate ratability windows.
   Then, at stage 4, the out-charter opportunities are pursued using the aggregate ratability
                                                  - 36  -

   windows. At stage 5, optimal solution to optimality model is calculated using the aggregate
   ratability windows.     Then, following stage 5, ratability violation with respect to original
   ratability windows are calculated.        Following this calculation, the minimize ratability
   violation using the original ratability windows is calculated in the MRV stage.
 5 [00130]     If aggregate ratability windows are based on quarters, and original ratability
   windows are based on months.          Then, stages 1 to 5 optimize using quarterly ratability
   windows and produce an optimal solution based on quarterly ratability windows.              The
   quarterly ratability solution is then evaluated based on monthly ratability windows. If there is
   any violation, the MRV stage minimizes the resulting violations, while sustaining the
10 economics within a certain level same as or close to the maximized economics achieved in
   stage 5.With regard to the minimize ratability violation after stage 2 method, this method is
   similar to the method above, but the order is adjusted. First algorithm determines the
   aggregate ratability constraints based on model inputs. Stages 1 and 2 use the aggregate
   ratability windows, and generate a feasible solution. Stage MRV takes the feasible solution,
15 which is based on aggregate ratability, and minimizes violations with respect to the original
   ratability windows.      The stage MRV may or may not eliminate each of the ratability
   violations. After the stage MRV, stages 3 to 5 follow to further improve the solution.
   [00131]     As an example, the method may include the following stages. In stage 1, feasible
   solution to feasibility model is generated using the aggregate ratability windows. In stage 2,
20 the optimal solution to feasibility model is generated using the aggregate ratability windows.
   Then, the ratability violations with respect to original ratability windows are calculated.
   Following this calculation, the minimal ratability violation is determined in the original
   ratability windows. Then, in stage 3, in-charter usage is reduced using the original ratability
   windows.     In stage 4, out-charter opportunities are pursued using the original ratability
25 windows. Then, in stage 5, the optimal solution is determined from the optimality model
   using the original ratability windows.
   [00132]     If the aggregate ratability windows are based on quarters, and original windows
   are based on months, the stages 1 and 2 use quarterly ratability windows. At the end of stage
   2, the algorithm may have a feasible solution based on quarterly ratability windows. This
30 solution is then evaluated based on monthly ratability windows and if there is any violation,
   the MRV stage minimizes the resulting violations.        Then, stages 3 to 5 are performed to
   enhance the solution, while sustaining the violation towards the monthly ratability within a
   pre-specified tolerance.

   [00133]       These two approaches are two exemplary algorithms that may be used to address
   the soft ratability issue. The minimize ratability after stage 5 method is directed to providing
   the best solution through stages 1 to 5 and then minimize violations as much as possible. In
   the minimize ratability after stage 2 method, the method is directed to feasibility because the
 5 ratability violations are minimized after stage 2. This approach may help for situations where
   it is difficult to get a feasible solution. After ratability violations are minimized, stages 3 to 5
   are performed to enhance the solution.
   [00134]      As an example, Figure 2C is a flow chart 240 of the five stage algorithm with soft
   extensions method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present techniques.               The
10 reference characters from Figure 2B are included may be referenced as described above. In
   addition to the five stages, the method includes a violation calculation with respect to original
   constraint (e.g., window or range around the constraint), as shown in block 248. The violation
   may be a ratability violation and the original constraint may be an original ratability window
   or other soft constraint window or range.          Further, as shown in block 250, the minimal
15 violation is calculated.       The violation may be a ratability violation (MRV) for certain
   embodiments.
   [00135]       With regard to soft inventory constraints, LNG ship scheduling models may be
   optimized during the preparations for next year's delivery plan. Once the ADP is finalized
   and operations start, shipping and production disruptions may lead to changes in projected
20 inventory levels. The initial plan may invovle regular adjustments to account for these
   variations. Imposing such hard inventory constraints for the entire planning horizon may
   restrict the solution space more than it is needed. Therefore some of the physical inventory
   restrictions may not be treated as soft constraints.
   [00136]       Similar to the example for soft ratability constraints, the algorithm can be
25 extended to address soft inventory issues. As shown in block 244, the proposed algorithm
   may be automated to decide how to relax the inventory constraints based on model inputs
   such as the number of vessels, number of contracts, number of deliveries. A relaxed set of
   inventory constraints can be used to find a feasible solution and then the violations can be
   minimized in a manner similar to the method used in the stage MRV, as described for the
30 ratability example. In stages 1 and 2, the feasibility model may be used to reduce the penalty
   with respect to the relaxed constraints to zero. The solution at the end of stage 2 may still
   have violations in inventory constraints as evaluated when using the original (e.g., tighter)
   bounds.     During stages 3 to 5, the algorithm seeks to constrain the violation in inventory
                                                    - 38 -

   constraints as evaluated for the tighter bounds such that the violations do not exceed the
   violation obtained at the end of stage 2. The penalty structure for violating the inventory
   constraints may be set in various manners. There may be multiple techniques of creating
   relaxed inventory constraints. One example is to increase inventory capacity over time such
 5 that relaxed capacity is always higher than the original inventory levels. The penalties can
   also be differentiated by storage units. Similarly, the relaxed bounds for inventory constraints
   can be generated in various manners. For example, the relaxed bounds may be based on
   degree of flexibility in re-routing production to other storage facilities, or on degree of
   flexibility in securing additional storage from another entity that shares storage at that
10 facility.
    [00137]     With the input data, constraints and objectives, the LNG ship scheduling model
   may be used to predict decision variables. The model, which is a mathematical model, is
   further described in Appendix A as an ADP model.
   LNG Ship Re-scheuling Optimization System
15  [00138]    With regard to -LNG ship re-scheduling (e.g., 90-day plan), the optimization
   system may develop updated LNG loading and delivery schedules based on new planning
   information, and/or in response to a disruption event or customer request or new market
   opportunity.
    [00139]    The - updated ship schedule may be provided by a re-scheduling optimization
20 system by performing analysis of the input data through the use of one or more objectives,
   constraints and algorithms, which may be similar to the discussion above for the ship
   scheduling model. However, the re-scheduling system is intended to be used more frequently
   concurrently with the updates of LNG shipping operations, disruptions, customer requests
   and/or new market opportunities. This system can be used for 90-day plan development, ship
25 schedule repair and ADP negotiation. Further, the algorithm may include different stages,
   such as (i) stage A that recovers feasibility; (ii) stage B that minimizes changes; (iii) stage C
   that maximizes economics, while sustaining minimum changes; (iv) stage D that -maximizes
   economics, which may induce significant number of changes to the baseline schedule; and/or
   (v) stage E that minimizes changes while sustaining the maximum economics. An example
30 of one embodiment of the system for developing 90-day plan is shown in Figure 4.
    [00140]    Figure 4 is a block diagram 400 of a LNG ship re-scheduling optimization model
   according to an exemplary embodiment of the present techniques. In this diagram 400, the
   input data 404 (e.g., baseline schedule (which may be the ADP or another baseline schedule),
                                                  - 39 -

   updated planning assumptions, user preferences, such as the degree of flexibility for various
   changes, historical actuals data (e.g., deliveries, inventory and the like)) is provided to an
   optimization system 402 to create an updated ship schedule 406. The optimization system
   402 includes a user interface 408, intelligent model preprocessor 418, optimization models
 5 410 and optimization solution method 412, which each communicate with each other. The
   updated ship schedule 406 is communicated to the user system 414, which is provided to the
   customer system 416.
   [00141]     This system extracts different information from different scenes accordingly (e.g.,
   new planning information, disruption, new customer request and new opportunity) and use
10 them in an intelligent manner to update delivery schedules in a more efficient manner. The
   system includes a suite of optimization models 410 and specifically designed algorithms
   (e.g., optimization solution method),    which recover the schedule from disruptions (e.g.,
   resolve the infeasibility caused by the updated information), minimize changes with respect
   to a baseline schedule, maximize economics within some specified tolerance for changes to
15 schedule, evaluate new market opportunities, and minimize changes again while sustaining
   the maximized economics which are achieved after considering the new market opportunities.
   [00142]     The system can be used to develop 90-day delivery schedules (e.g., 90-day plans).
   The system can also be used to recover delivery schedule from disruptions (e.g., ship
   breakdown, terminal breakdown, etc.). The system can also update the delivery schedules
20 beyond the 90-day period to enable analysis around the effects of disruptions and changes
   made in the 90-day period on planned deliveries further out in the future. The system can
   also be used to investigate different market opportunities within 90-days or further out in the
   future. The system can also be used to experiment the tradeoff between maintaining schedule
   stability and increasing customer satisfaction or pursuing new market opportunities.       The
25 system can also be used to prioritize changes that are applied to recover schedules.       The
   system can also be used in negotiating annual delivery programs. In developing the updated
   delivery schedules, the system can optimize ship schedules, terminal inventory management,
   LNG production schedules, maintenance schedules, and other shipping decisions, while
   accounting for tradeoffs related to various options          in available shipping, customer
30 requirements, price uncertainty, contract flexibility, market conditions, and the like. Other
   shipping decisions may include ship fuel selection, ship speed, and/or heel selection for every
   voyage.
                                                 - 40 -

   [00143]      Figure 5A is a block diagram 500 of how the system may be implemented for
   updating ship schedules according to an exemplary embodiment of the present techniques.
   This system includes the input data 502, the intelligent model preprocessor 504, the model
   and algorithm system 506, and the output data 508 with the illustration of how they could
 5 work together to realize the objective of the present techniques. The input data includes two
   categories: data in one category is the original information used to generate the baseline
   schedule (e.g. annual delivery plan, another baseline plan, etc.) as discussed above, and data
   in the other category represents the new and/or updated information and the new objective
   requirements. The intelligent model preprocessor 504 translates the updated information and
10 business preferences in an intelligent manner that the model and algorithm can use the
   translated information to recover schedules from disruptions or evaluate new market
   opportunities in an efficient manner. Then, the system creates a time-space network model
   (e.g., LNG ship rescheduling model) and applies a suite of specially designed algorithms to
   solve it based on the specifications of the objectives. The outputs of the system may be used
15 not only for ship scheduling, but also for inventory management, optionality utilization,
   and/or maintenance schedules.
   [00144]      A portion of the LNG ship re-scheduling optimization model may utilize one or
   more of the input data associated with the long-term planning modules to provide consistency
   between the long-term production plan and contractual obligations. The input data 502 may
20 be categorized as: production data at one or more liquefaction terminals, facility management
   data at production terminals, customer requests, customer terminal data, market conditions,
   contracts and/or shipping data. Production data may include data relating one or more of: the
   types or grades of LNG produced and their heat content; production rates of one or more
   types or grades of LNG; production unit maintenance schedules and associated flexibility in
25 scheduling the maintenance.        Facility management data may include data relating one or
   more of: the number of berths available for loading; storage capacity for each type or grade of
   LNG; connection between berth and storage unit; and berth maintenance schedules and their
   associated flexibility. Customer requests may include input data relating to one or more of
   the ratability of deliveries; the time window and cargo sizes for specific deliveries; the speeds
30 that the ships should take; and the fuel modes that the ships should use. Customer terminal
   data may include input data relating to one or more of: storage capacities for each type or
   grade of LNG; the number of berths available for unloading; regasification rate schedules;
   and distances from each liquefaction terminal.        Market conditions may include input data
                                                  - 41 -

   relating to one or more of: the outlook for index prices to be used in pricing formula; the
   outlook for future market opportunities such as spot sales; and futures and forward contract
   prices. Contracts may include input data relating to one or more of: terminals where LNG
   can be delivered; annual delivery targets for each customer terminal; ratability of delivery,
 5 which is the timing and spacing of delivery of portions of an agreed-upon amount of LNG;
   gas quality, type, or grade to be delivered; pricing formulas; diversion flexibility; and other
   types of flexibility such as downflex (an option whereby the buyer may request a decreased
   quantity of LNG). Contracts may also include input data relating to the length of contract to
   which one or more LNG customers are bound.              For example, an LNG customer may be
10 bound by a long-term contract, such as sales and purchase agreements or a production sharing
   contracts. Shipping data may include input data relating to one or more of: a list of leased
   DES (delivered ex ship), CIF (cost, insurance and freight), CFR (cost and freight) and
   available spot ships; a list of FOB (freight on board) ships for each customer, the ships
   typically being owned or leased by the customer; ship capacities; restrictions on what ship
15 can load/unload at what terminal; maintenance schedules for ships; cost structures for ships;
   boil-off and heel calculations for each ship, including an optimal heel amount upon discharge
   at a regasification terminal; range of ship speeds and associated cost profile; and/or set of
   allowed fuels.
   [00145]     Further, the input data into the LNG ship rescheduling model may include other
20 data, such as time horizon (e.g., start time, end time, and/or time discretization); ship initial
   information (e.g., start time, start location, start heel status, LNG volume on board, grade for
   LNG on board, contract for LNG on board, needs to redirect to another destination location);
   updated planning information towards ships (e.g., daily availability, fuel modes, speed levels,
   heel options, and/or loading sizes); updated production/regasification profile (e.g., daily
25 production rates and/or daily regasification rates); updated inventory profile (e.g., initial
   inventory level at each storage tank and/or inventory capacity for each JV); updated
   maintenance schedule; new in-chartering offers; new out-chartering opportunities; new
   diversion opportunities; new spot market opportunities; new backhaul options; baseline
   schedule including a list of cargos (e.g., delivery contract, delivery location, delivery ship,
30 delivery time, and/or delivery quantity); change flexibility for each cargo (e.g., cargo
   divertable/optional, ship change allowed, time change allowed, number of days that it can
   advance or delay, and/or quantity change allowed or amount of quantity that can be reduced
                                                   - 42 -

    or increased); relative importance of each change; objectives: minimize changes; maximize
    economics; minimize cost, etc.; and/or thresholds towards changes, economics, cost etc.
    [00146]      In addition to the input data, the LNG ship rescheduling model may include
    constraints.    Appropriate constraints and specifications are layered onto the LNG ship
 5  rescheduling model for conducting various analyses that are specific to problem being
    addressed. The constraints in the LNG ship rescheduling model may be similar to those in
    the LNG ship scheduling model, which is noted above. Further, the core optimization model
   provides the ability to model a supply chain that includes one or more LNG liquefaction
    terminals, multiple customers with long and short-term purchase contracts, and spot LNG
10  markets/buyers.     The supply chain also has the capability to include multiple fleets of
    heterogeneous time-chartered ships together with opportunities to in-charter or out-charter
    ships.    When dry-docks are required, the model also ensures the ships to take dry-docks
    within specified time windows. The model also provides functionality to model contractual
    flexibilities and market opportunities such as opportunities to divert cargo or backhaul third
15 party cargo on a return voyage.        Detailed operational constraints related to liquefaction
    terminals and shipping, contractual obligations and market conditions are included in the
    model.
    [00147]      The input for contracts may consider the possibility of multiple operating entities
    or owners involved in a liquefaction project, and each operating entity or owner may have a
20 joint-venture agreement or other arrangement with the natural gas producer (e.g., national oil
    company or government (NOC)) including fiscal agreements that cover royalties and taxes.
   Another type of contract covered by contracts arises in liquefaction projects with shared
    facilities and infrastructure (such as storage facilities, loading facilities, and ships), in which
    there exist facility sharing agreements and fleet sharing agreements between the different
25 production entities (e.g., joint ventures (JVs)). These agreements may include terms outlining
    volume storage entitlements, lifting entitlements and cost-sharing terms among others.
    Further, sales and deliveries typically are negotiated between a production entity and a
   buying entity, such as a joint venture and a customer. These contracts can be long-term or
    short-term and include SPAs (Gas Sales and Purchase Agreements) and PSCs (Production
30  Sharing Contracts). These agreements typically include terms related to annual volumes,
    ratable delivery requirements, ships required for transport, price and penalties. In any of these
    multiple entity - type contracts or agreements, it is possible that various parties are operating
   under different fiscal conditions. For example, two companies may be working with a
                                                  -43   -

   national oil company on a liquefaction project under different joint venture agreements. For
   various reasons those joint venture agreements may have different terms governing the above
   types of subjects. These different terms are factored into the ship scheduling optimization
   model as disclosed herein.
 5 [00148]     The system takes as input a baseline schedule, customer preferences regarding
   flexibility in different kinds of changes to the schedule, updated information regarding
   assumptions that are used to build the schedule, and new market opportunities. The system
   develops an updated schedule that minimizes the degree of change with respect to the
   baseline schedule.    The system also generates the most economic schedule that does not
10 deviate from the baseline schedule by more than a pre-specified tolerance for changes. The
   system also investigates new market opportunities while minimizing impact on the baseline
   schedule.
   [00149]     In the baseline schedule, a list of planned cargos is specified with the following
   aspects for each cargo: the customer, the destination, the delivery ship, the delivery time and
15 the delivery quantity. All of these aspects can (sometime have to) be changed in the updated
   plan. For example, if a ship is delayed 1 day, the delivery time for some cargos may have to
   be delayed 1 day. As another example, if a ship is broken down, an extra ship may have to be
   in-chartered to cover the cargos which are planned for the broken ship. If the in-charted ship
   has different capacity, the delivery quantity is also changed.      As another example, if a
20 destination terminal is shut down, the cargos which are originally planned to be sent to this
   terminal have to be diverted to another destination. As another example, the customer may
   request to send the cargo to another destination with a bigger ship on a different date, and
   therefore multiple aspects of the cargo are changed.
   [00150]     The system provides the user the ability to specify the allowed flexibility in
25 changing different aspects of the schedule. For example, the user may specify whether the
   ship associated with a planned cargo can be changed in the updated plan.            As another
   example, the user may specify the amount of time by which the delivery date for a cargo can
   be delayed (or advanced) in the updated schedule. As another example, the user may specify
   the amount by which the quality of LNG to be loaded or delivered on a planned cargo could
30 be changed in the updated schedule. As another example, the user may specify whether or
   not a planned cargo needs to be delivered to the planned customer/location at all. As another
   example, the system provides the user the ability to specify whether or not extra ships could
   be in-chartered or out chartered in the updated schedule.
                                                 - 44 -

   [00151]      The system provides flexibility for the user to specify the relative importance of
   the different types of changes mentioned above, while minimizing the overall differences
   between the baseline schedule and the updated schedule. For example, the user may specify a
   higher priority for minimizing changes for deliveries to a specific customer, or for
 5 minimizing changes to deliveries in the specific period of the calendar. As another example,
   the user may prefer to make a sequence of ship swaps or date changes than to rent extra in
   charters. As yet another example, the user may prefer ship changes instead of delivery date
   changes, or vice versa.
   [00152]      As specified above, the system may also obtain as input the new and/or updated
10 information regarding assumptions that pertain to the forward planning period. These
   assumptions can be different from those that were used to build the baseline schedule. The
   system may provide the user the ability to provide updated information or consider more
   decision options which can only be practical during short-term periods. For example, the
   user can specify the initial status for ships at the beginning of the planning period with
15 different granularities including: the earliest available date, location, heel status, volume on
   board, LNG quality on board and contract information. As another example, the user can
   specify constraints on the daily availability for ships. Some of this information may not have
   been available and/or accurate when the baseline schedule was initially developed. As yet
   another example, the user can update the initial inventory level in terminal storage at the
20 beginning of the planning period which can be different from what was predicted in the
   baseline schedule.       In another example,       the user can update the projected daily
   production/regasification    rates.  Also, the user can specify short-term out-chartering
   opportunities which were not foreseen when the baseline schedule was developed.              For
   example, the user may want to move the planned dry-docking events from one period to
25 another period in order to ensure ample shipping resource during the periods when the LNG
   market price is higher according to the updated pricing information. Further, the user may
   want to consider different or multiple fuel or speed options in the short-term periods instead
   of the options used in baseline schedule. As another example, the user may want to adopt
   different loading strategy including partial loading, split and co-loading instead of the
30 strategy used to make a long-term plan, etc.
   [00153]      Some of these information updates, especially those related to changes for ships,
   facilities, production and/or deliveries, often causes infeasibility of the baseline schedule
   (e.g., disruptions).  As example, if a ship is delayed, it may not be able to complete all
                                                  - 45  -

   deliveries on time as planned in the baseline schedule. For example, if a ship is broken down,
   other ships may have to change their schedules or extra ships may have to be in-chartered in
   order to cover the deliveries for the broken ship.        As another example, if a destination
   terminal is shut down, all cargos which are planned for this terminal may have to be diverted
 5 to other locations. As yet another example, if initial inventory level at a production terminal
   is much higher than what is predicted in the baseline schedule, some cargos may have to be
   enlarged or extra cargos may have to be added in order to consume the extra volume. For
   example, if the daily production rate is higher than what is assumed in the baseline schedule,
   cargos may have to be loaded faster and extra cargos may have to be added to avoid lost
10 production. As another example, if a customer requests to change the delivery time of his
   cargos, the entire schedule may have to be changed because ship availability may be changed
   and loading/unloading schedules may also be changed. As yet another example, if the user
   wants to move a dry-dock event from one period to another period, all schedules in between
   these two periods may be affected and need to be re-planned.
15 [00154]      Disruption types that user may face in LNG supply chain optimization are pre
   built in the intelligent model preprocessor.        When new and/or updated information is
   provided, the preprocessor may first determine whether or not and what disruptions may be
   caused. If disruptions are caused, the preprocessor may translate the information through a
   pre-defined scheme into objectives and constraints into the model to recover the schedule
20 from disruptions in a more efficient manner before the algorithms put effort to minimize
   deviations from baseline schedule.
   [00155]      Other information updates, together with new market opportunities, may not affect
   feasibility. That is, the baseline schedule may still function if the new options or opportunities
   are not pursued.       By considering the new options or opportunities, however, economic
25 efficiency may be improved with potentially significant deviation from the baseline schedule.
   For example, the user can investigate the benefit to slow down the ship fleet by allowing a
   slower speed than that used in the baseline schedule. For example, the user can improve the
   netback by allowing some specific fuel modes other than the standard mode used in the
   baseline schedule. As another example, the user can reduce shipping cost and avoid ship
30 spare time by out-chartering additional ships while not affecting the reliability for the
   transportation network significantly. As yet another example, the user can generate higher
   profit by diverting cargos to spot markets with high price.
                                                 - 46  -

   [00156]      Similar as disruption types, opportunity types that user may consider in LNG
   supply chain optimization are also pre-built in the intelligent model preprocessor.
   Information related to opportunities may also be translated through a pre-defined scheme into
   objectives and constraints in the model to provide insight in evaluating the economic benefit
 5 in an efficient manner. If taking the opportunity may cause significant deviation from the
   baseline schedule, however, the opportunity may not be considered when the system focuses
   on schedule recovery and deviation minimization; instead, it may be investigated separately
   followed by the deviation minimization again.
   [00157]      The system may also take other inputs related to setting up the objective function
10 including user preferences on flexibility to various kinds of changes for each cargo and user
   preferences on the relative importance of different kinds of changes.        Inputs could also
   include user preferences for the objective function to be optimized.       The selections may
   include minimizing changes compared to a baseline schedule, maximizing economics,
   minimizing changes for a given economic performance, or maximizing economics for a given
15 level of changes. Economic maximization may include user-defined model objectives such
   as maximizing LNG throughput, minimizing costs, maximum profits, maximizing gross
   netback, optimizing optionality, and/or maximizing robustness in face of uncertainty related
   to weather conditions, travel times, or market conditions.
   [00158]      The models for LNG ship rescheduling optimization also have time-space network
20 structure similar as in the long-term ship scheduling optimization with specific modifications.
   These modifications are associated with the time horizon, cargo expression and/or ship
   availability.
   [00159]      For example, the time horizon may include the length of planning horizon, which
   is adjustable. That is, the time horizon may be any practical number of time periods, which is
25 not limited to 90-day periods. Also, besides the planning horizon, a posterior horizon may
   also be created in the network, which includes an appropriate number of time periods further
   out in the future. The posterior horizon provides the model ability to incorporate the future
   and make better decisions by avoiding unnecessary costly changes or increasing chance to
   take market opportunities during the planning horizon. For an example, during the planning
30 horizon, daily production rates are higher than what were predicted in the baseline schedule
   and one spot cargo needs to be delivered by the end of the horizon. An extra ship may have
   to be in-chartered for this spot cargo if the model cannot see that a ship (not in-chartered)
   may idle for a long time period since the end of this planning horizon. For example, in the
                                                 - 47 -

   baseline schedule, there is a divertible cargo whose delivery time is close to the end of the
   planning horizon. However, the spot market that may take this cargo is much farther away
   than the cargo's original destination. The cargo can be possibly diverted only if the network
   includes the posterior periods because, otherwise, no decision variables associated with this
 5 diversion may be created in the network. Moreover, degree of flexibility (e.g., number of
   decision variables) in different horizons may be adjustable.        For example, all operational
   options (e.g., fuel modes, speed levels, heels etc.) may be considered in the planning horizon
   to make a practical delivery schedule in near future. However, only the standard options,
   which are used in the long-term planning, may be considered in the posterior periods since
10 this horizon is further out in the future and the corresponding planning information is less
   accurate and more uncertain.
    [00160]    As another example, these modifications may include cargo expression. That is,
   instead of the general exclusive time windows expressed in the network for the long-term
   planning, individual cargos are expressed explicitly in the network in this problem. By
15 including cargos in the arcs, all changes associated with cargos can be tracked precisely,
   while only the binary decision variables towards arcs need to be created.
    [00161]    As yet another example, the modifications may include ship availability. When a
   ship is unavailable on a specific time period, all traveling arcs (e.g., ship is always on duty on
   traveling arcs in the network), which includes that time period may not be created in the
20 network to: 1) reduce the network size and speed up the solution searching; and 2) avoid
   using constraints to handle the ships' unavailability and so reduce the difficulty of the model.
    [00162]    For the LNG ship rescheduling model, the variables may include different types of
   variables associated with different aspects. For example, variables in the model may include
   cargo variables; contract variables; spot market opportunity variables; when to dry-dock each
25 ship that requires dry-docking variables; what ship to out-charter and when variables; and/or
   what ships to in-charter and when variables.
    [00163]    The cargo variables may include whether it may be diverted; load timing,
   discharge timing; load quantity, discharge quantity; assigned ship, destination terminal; heel
   left on ship; ship speed and fuel selection for laden voyage; ship speed and fuel selection for
30 ballast voyage; what tank farm to load cargo at; and/or what berth to load cargo at. The
   contract variables may include how much quantity to divert; which cargo to divert; how much
   extra spot sale to take; and/or how many extra spot cargos to take and when. The spot market
                                                 -48-

   opportunity variables may include whether it may be taken; how much quantity to deliver;
   and/or how many cargos to deliver and when.
   [00164]     In addition to the variables, the LNG ship rescheduling model may also include
   various constraints. The time space network model for the long-term planning problem can
 5 be applied for this problem including additional constraints related to the cargos with their
   specific flexibilities towards: delivery contract, delivery destination, delivery ship, delivery
   time, and/or delivery quantity.     The delivery contract and/or destination constraints may
   include a determination whether a cargo is not divertible/optional (e.g., the cargo is enforced;
   the cargo can only be delivered to its original contract and destination; the cargo has to satisfy
10 the other restrictions (delivery ship, time, quantity etc.)) and/or a determination whether the
   cargo is divertible/optional (e.g., diversion is favored, for example, contract/destination
   change may not penalized; and/or the other restrictions (delivery ship, time, quantity etc.) are
   deactivated). The delivery ship constraints may include a determination that the cargo can
   only delivered by the original ship if ship reassignment is not allowed; a determination that
15 the cargo can also be delivered by the other compatible ships if ship reassignment is allowed;
   and/or a determination that the delivery ship changes may be penalized. The delivery time
   constraints may include a determination that the cargo cannot be delivered beyond the
   specified time window; a determination that the cargo can be delivered at any time period
   within the specified time window; and/or a determination that the delivery time changes may
20 be penalized. The delivery quantity constraints may include a determination that the cargo
   cannot deliver LNG less than or more than the specified range; a determination that the cargo
   can deliver any LNG quantity within the specified range; and/or a determination that delivery
   quantity changes may not be penalized.
   [00165]     With regards to the intelligent model preprocessor, this processor is a translation
25 layer between the input data and the optimization model, which may translate the practical
   information provided in the input data to the advanced information used by the model and
   algorithms. This preprocessor may provide a mechanism to translate business preferences
   and new/updated information into constraints and objectives that can be built into the model,
   and guide the optimization solver searching solutions towards feasibility in a more efficient
30 manner when disruptions are faced or towards optimality in a more efficient manner when
   opportunities are investigated.
   [00166]     This preprocessor may also include a series of criteria which reflect management
   options or preferences, a scheme to manipulate cargos which may be changed due to the
                                                 - 49 -

   updated information, and a penalty calculator which assigns cargo specific penalty weights
   for changes in the schedule. When updated information is provided in the input data, this
   preprocessor may execute the following steps: detect whether disruptions are caused and/or
   opportunities need to be investigated; manipulate, delete and/or add cargos according to the
 5 management preferences; calculate the cargo specific penalties for potential changes in the
   schedule; and feed the modified cargos with their change penalties to the optimization model
   and algorithms.     These steps may be provided in logic or set of instructions as discussed
   further below.
   [00167]     The intelligent model preprocessor provides users ability to specify their business
10 preference towards LNG supply chain management. For example, if a ship is delayed and
   delivery of one cargo is affected, there may be two approaches to address the problem, which
   may include delaying the cargo (which is cost efficient but may reduce customer's
   satisfaction) and/or in-chartering an extra ship for that cargo (which is expensive but may
   improve customer's satisfaction).      The user can specify which approach is preferred.    For
15 instance, if the ship delay is less than a certain number of days, the former may be preferred
   than the latter; if a specific customer is involved, however, the latter may be preferred than
   the former. As another example, if a customer requests to change a cargo delivery date, the
   user can specify the amount of effort permitted to satisfy that request. For instance, if the
   request is from some specific customer, the user may prefer to in-charter an extra ship if
20 necessary to satisfy the request and so to improve the customer's satisfaction. Otherwise, the
   user may prefer to negotiate the delivery date with the customer to avoid the cost for in
   chartering an extra ship. If the user does not specify their preferences, default assumptions
   may be applied, which may default to the typical practice in the art.
   [00168]     These cargos, whose delivery schedules may be affected by the updated
25 information, may be manipulated with respect to the delivery contract, delivery ship, delivery
   time, and delivery quantity. If necessary, some cargos may be deleted or optional cargos may
   be added to lead solution searching. The changes associated with these manipulated cargos
   may be assigned with specifically designed penalties based on the user's preferences. The
   manipulation and penalty scheme may be used to enhance the optimization solver to recover
30 feasible schedule or investigate opportunities in a more efficient manner.      When updated
   information is provided, the intelligent model preprocessor may detect the followings:
   whether the baseline schedule is disrupted; how many cargos may be affected; how severe the
                                                  - 50 -

   disruption is; which method is preferred and how to fix the schedule; whether new market
   opportunities are present; and how to take the opportunity.
   [00169]      For example, if a ship is delayed seven days and in-chartering an extra ship (if
   necessary) is preferred, the system may determine that only the first cargo of the delayed ship
 5 needs to be handled by the in-charter and the remaining cargo can be handled by the original
   ship. Then, the first cargo may be assigned with the in-chartered ship. This modification
   could result in schedule feasibility immediately if the in-charter's available time window fits
   to the first cargo's delivery window. If there is a solution in which the usage of this in
   charter is unnecessary, the model may get rid of this in-charter when minimizing deviation
10 from baseline schedule by assigning a large penalty for using extra in-charters.
   [00170]      As another example, if the ship is only delayed two days and delaying cargos is
   preferred over using in-charters, the system may determine that there are three cargos that
   may be delayed potentially. Then the delivery time flexibility for these three cargos may be
   enlarged accordingly so that they can still be delivered by the delayed ship. Thus, the model
15 may recover the schedule in a more efficient manner because it only has to resolve the
   inventory and facility conflict when shipping resource is not a problem.              However, if
   delivering a cargo by its original ship two days later is not preferred compared with
   delivering the cargo by another ship (e.g., not in-chartered) on time, higher penalties may be
   assigned to delivery delays than to ship changes. When deviation from baseline schedule is
20 minimized, delivery delay could then be pushed out from the schedule if such a solution
   exists.
   [00171]      As yet another example, if a user has six divertible cargos and a market
   opportunity who may take all of these six cargos. In this scenario, the original schedule is
   still a feasible solution. The system may evaluate the spot market opportunity first and then
25 minimize changes if the market opportunity is taken. Before making a decision, the user first
   needs to understand: how many cargos should be diverted; how it may improve economics;
   and what is the impact on the baseline schedule. To achieve this objective, the intelligent
   model preprocessor may add six optional cargos with the following specifications: 1) delivery
   destination is the spot market; 2) delivery ship is existing ships (e.g., not in-chartered) if they
30 are available to deliver the spot cargos without causing too many changes; extra in-chartered
   ships otherwise; 3) delivery time is calculated so that the corresponding loading time matches
   the loading time of each divertible cargo; 4) delivery quantity is calculated so that the
   corresponding loading quantity matches the loading quantity of each divertible cargos. The
                                                 -51 -

   settings of these optional cargos may be useful to avoid shipping resource conflict, inventory
   tank conflict and facility conflict.                 By using these settings, the optimization solver may
   efficiently discover the first solution with diversions to the spot market by searching solutions
   in the neighborhood around these cargos. And then, the solver may enhance the economics
 5 by optimizing the aspects associated to these cargos. After the economics are maximized,
   deviation from the baseline schedule is minimized by assigning large penalty for using extra
   in-chartered ships. Thus, the final solution is a trade-off among economic pursue, change
   tolerance and management preferences.
    [00172]      Beneficially, the intelligent model preprocessor is a scheme to translate business
10 preferences and new and/or updated information in LNG supply chain management to
   constraints and objectives in the model that may be useful to the model in finding feasible
   and more economic solutions in a more efficient manner.                                     This preprocessor provides a
   mechanism for the optimization model to obtain optimality in a more efficient manner when
   feasible solutions exist, or make practical recommendations to the user when updated
15 information causes infeasibility.                 The preprocessor also enables the optimization model to
   evaluate all possible solutions and balance conflicting priorities based the user's requests and
   preference in one shot.                 The preprocessor provides the user with the ability to avoid
   unnecessary delays.            The present techniques are specifically designed for and applied to, but
   may not be limited to, LNG supply chain optimization. However, it may be applied to other
20 scheduling problems in which the schedules need to be updated based on new information
   and user's preferences.
    [00173]      As an example, a customer request may be made to change delivery.                                              In the
   baseline schedule, a cargo named as "cargoA" has been planned.                                            The cargo's original
   specifications are listed in Table 4, including cargo ID, contract, delivery ship, delivery
25 location, delivery time, and delivery quantity. The cargo's original allowed flexibility is also
   shown in Table 4, below.

    [00174]      In this table, the cargo is not optional and this aspect has to be reflected in the
30 updated schedule; the cargo can be delivered by other ships instead of the specified shipp1;
   the cargo can have up to 300,000 million British thermal units (mmbtu) more or less quantity
                                                                   - 52  -

    [00176]         If the customer request involves advancing the cargo by seven days (e.g., on
   3/5/2014), the user may have various concerns before the decision can be made. The user's
   concerns may include questions, such as (i) is it possible to satisfy the request (with or
   without extra in-chartered ships); (ii) What should the user propose to minimize the deviation
10 from the baseline schedule (e.g., most undesirable changes: introduce extra in-chartered
   ships; undesirable but acceptable changes: deliver the cargo between 3/6/2014 and 3/12/2014;
   and/or desirable: deliver cargoA on 3/5/2014); (iii) regular changes: reassign delivery ships
   (not in-chartered); (iv) how may these changes affect other deliveries; and (v) how may these
   changes impact economics.                       The intelligent model preprocessor may perform various
15 calculations, such as cargo manipulation and/or change the penalty scheme.                                        The cargo
   manipulation may include cargoA being modified to cargoA' as in Table 5 above. In this
   table, the delivery date may be changed to 3/5/2014; and it is allowed to delay up to seven
   days. The change penalty scheme manipulation may include adjusting the penalty scheme.
   That is, penalties for all cargos may be designed as noted below in the following logic:
20                  -    Delivery location (col):
                               - Original destination: c_1 = 0

25                             - Outside specified range: toq = 0 if the cargo is divertible; not allowed
                                    otherwise

                               - Other non-in-chartered ships: cs = 1
30                             - Extra in-chartered ship: cs = 100
                    -    Date(aod)

                                           - Within specified range (3/6/2014-3/12/2014): cd = (date

                                                                  - 53 -

                               - Within specified range: (od = date-original date
                               - Outside specified range: not allowed
               -   Penalty for each cargo: co l+ owq+ co_s+ o_d
 5             -   Total change penalty: summation of penalties for all cargos
   [00177]     Beneficially, the system may provide the best recommendations instead of merely
   indicating that the request is infeasible. That is, the original baseline plan is always feasible,
   which provides the optimization solver with a solution that avoids spending large amounts of
   time on demonstrating feasibility or infeasibility.       Further, when the change penalty is
10 minimized, trade-offs are made between satisfying the customer's request and modifying
   other customers' delivery schedule. For cargoA', the closer the delivery date to 3/5/2014, the
   less the penalty, the more impact on others' schedule. The designed penalty scheme may be
   useful for the optimization solver by searching towards satisfying the customer's request
   because the penalty function       wd for cargoA' is steeper than that for other cargos.
15 Meanwhile, the solution does not have unacceptable amount of impact on others' schedule
   because the penalties for others' change may be dominant and may be pushed out during
   minimization. Also, in-charters may not be preferred compared with the regular changes and
   the economics may be maximized after the derisible change tolerance is discovered.
   [00178]     As a result of the LNG ship rescheduling modeling, the outputs from the LNG
20 ship rescheduling model to the user may include information that may be utilized for
   negotiation and decision making.       That is, the date to deliver the cargo (e.g., some day
   between the original delivery date and the requested date); the impact on other's schedule;
   and/or the impact on economics. Accordingly, the user may reply to the customer with a
   counter offer based on the outputs. The user's counter offer, if the cargo cannot be advanced
25 with 7 days, may include an offer to advance five days instead of seven days, as an example.
   [00179]     Similar to the LNG ship scheduling model and noted above, the LNG ship
   rescheduling model may include different algorithms that are utilized to calculate the outputs.
   That is, the system includes a suite of specially designed algorithms consisting of five stages.
   These different stages are shown in Figure 5B. Figure 5B is a flow chart 550 of the five stage
30 algorithm method for the LNG ship rescheduling model according to an exemplary
   embodiment of the present techniques. In stage A, as shown in block 552, a schedule that has
   no constraint violations is developed. The schedule may be created to recover the schedule
   from disruptions (e.g., repair schedule to satisfy all hard constraints which may be violated
   due to disruptions). Then, as shown in block 554, the deviation from baseline schedule may
35 be minimized in stage B.       Then, in stage C, as shown in block 556, economics may be
                                                 -54   -

   maximized while sustaining deviation at the minimized level or within a pre-specified
   tolerance. At block 558, in stage D, economics is maximized regardless the deviation from
   the baseline schedule. In this stage, new market opportunities which may induce significant
   changes may be captured.         Then, in stage E, the deviation from baseline schedule is
 5 minimized, while sustaining a certain level of economics, as shown in block 560. The output
   of these algorithms may be used to for LNG shipping operations and negotiations with third
   parties, as shown in block 562.
   [00180]      The system may perform these algorithms stage by stage, wherein the solution of
   the previous stage is automatically fed to the following stage to speed up the optimization
10 algorithms. Depending on the new and/or updated information, some of these stages may be
   bypassed or skipped. For an example, if disruptions are caused by the new and/or update
   information, while no new market opportunities are provided, the system may perform the
   algorithms in stages A to stage C and skipping stage D and stage E. As another example, if
   disruptions are not caused, while only new market opportunities need to be investigated, the
15 system could skip performing the algorithm in stage A to stage C and perform the algorithms
   in stage D and stage E. When both disruptions and new market opportunities are present, the
   system can also be terminated after any of these stages depending on user's need.
   [00181]      Further, each of the stages of the algorithms solves a series of local neighborhood
   optimization problems.      The local neighborhood structures are designed for this system
20 include, but are not limited to, those described below.
   [00182]      In stage A, the schedule is recovered from disruptions, as noted in block 552.
   This stage determines a means to recover the schedule from disruptions in a more efficient
   manner (e.g., repair schedule in a more efficient manner to satisfy all hard constraints, which
   may be violated due to the new and/or updated information).          In this stage, non-negative
25 slack variables may be added to hard constraints; and the total amount of slack variables is
   minimized. If the objective function value can be minimized to zero, then the schedule is
   recovered successfully. Otherwise, the solution may suggest what may cause infeasibility
   and provide hints for the user to resolve the disruptions. This stage includes three major
   steps, which include (step 1) construct a solution based on the cargos specified in the baseline
30 schedule and the cargos manipulated by the intelligent model preprocessor; (step 2) improve
   the solution by applying a series of local neighborhood searches, which are similar as in the
   annual delivery model; and (step 3) search the solution directly in the global region to
                                                  -55 -

   demonstrate feasibility or infeasibility if step 1 and step 2 fail to discover the first feasible
   solution.
   [00183]     Due to the potential disruptions caused by the new and/or updated information,
   the baseline schedule may not be feasible.            However, the cargos manipulated by the
 5 intelligent model preprocessor are designed to recover the schedule from disruptions in a
   more efficient manner. Thus, a narrow neighborhood is constructed and searched around the
   cargos specified in the baseline schedule and the cargos manipulated by the intelligent model
   preprocessor.    Very often, the slack variables can be pushed to zero in a more efficient
   manner due to the design of the manipulated cargos. Branch and bound node limits can be
10 specified to terminate each search, as well.
   [00184]     If the first feasible solution is not discovered in the above neighborhood, local
   neighborhood searches may be performed in a sequence.          That is, k-day-flexibility search,
   rolling time window search, one-ship search and two-ship search may be performed in a
   specific sequence.      These searches are similar as the searches designed for the annual
15 delivery model, which is discussed further above. Branch and bound node limits may be
   specified to terminate each search.
   [00185]     If step 1 and step 2 fail to determine the first feasible solution, step 3 may be
   performed either to find the first feasible solution or to demonstrate infeasibility of the
   original configuration and provide suggestions on how to adjust the schedule. In step 3, slack
20 variables may be deleted and the global region may be searched.            The search may be
   terminated after a time limit specified by user or specified number of iterations. For example,
   if a terminal is down, the user needs to divert all cargos planned for that terminal to another
   candidate spot market. However, the shipping resource and inventory management conflict
   may not be solved. As such, the spot market does not have the capacity to consume all
25 volumes that need to be diverted or the user does not have resource to satisfy the requirement
   of the spot market.     Thus, the user may need to consider another market or obtain more
   resource.
   [00186]     In stage A, the system provides the capability to recover from various types of
   disruptions. When disruptions have been pre-built in the intelligent model preprocessor, the
30 schedule can be recovered in a more efficient manner in step 1; otherwise, step 2 and step 3
   can obtain feasible solutions for any general type of disruptions. Also, if a disruption type is
   new and cannot be resolved in step 1, the intelligent model preprocessor may learn from that
                                                  - 56 -

   disruption, update its techniques and develop new capabilities to recover from that type of
   disruption in future performances.
   [00187]     In stage B, the deviation from baseline schedule is minimized, as shown in block
   554. The first schedule recovered from disruptions may have an unacceptably significant
 5 amount of deviation from the baseline schedule.        This stage is designed to minimize the
   deviation from baseline schedule. The algorithms in this stage can be categorized into two
   groups, which are a group of searches which may eliminate changes for all cargos
   simultaneously within a local neighborhood, and another group of searches each of which
   may eliminate changes of one specific cargo.
10 [00188]     The first group includes a time window search and two global searches.         In the
   time window search, the changes are detected one by one starting from the beginning of 90
   day period, and a time window around the change is created.            Within the time window,
   variables are freed and may be re-evaluated, while outside the time window, variables may be
   fixed to their current values. In one global search, variables in the posterior periods are fixed
15 to the current values and the remainders are freed up; in the other global search, decision
   variables related to in-chartered ships are fixed to their current values and the remainders are
   freed up. Branch and bound node limit can be specified to terminate each search.
   [00189]     The second group includes a neighborhood structure, which is specifically
   designed for cargos with changes.      If a cargo has deviation from the baseline schedule, a
20 hybrid neighborhood structure may be created for the cargo. In this neighborhood, variables,
   either inside the time window which is created around the cargo, or associated with the
   decisions corresponding to the cargo, or related to the ship that originally delivers the cargo
   in the baseline schedule, may be freed up; other variables may be fixed to their current
   values.   Cargos can be sorted according to the significance of their deviations in this
25 neighborhood search. For an example, cargos which are using extra in-chartered ships can be
   investigated earlier than the cargos which only have regular date or ship changes. Branch and
   bound node limit can be specified to terminate each search.
   [00190]     If the user has higher tolerance towards the deviation from the baseline schedule,
   the deviation tolerance can also be used to terminate the algorithm. That is, the algorithm can
30 be stopped as soon as a solution whose deviation is within tolerance is discovered.
   [00191]     In stage C, the economics are maximized, while sustaining minimized deviation.
   The economics for the solution with minimized deviation discovered in stage B may be
   enhanced by optimizing options. For example, different speeds, fuel modes and spot markets
                                                  - 57 -

   may be some of the options. This stage may maximize economics among solutions with the
   minimized deviation or a deviation within a specified tolerance by adding an upper bound to
   the total deviation.     The algorithms in this stage may include two rolling time window
   searches with different parameter specifications.        The structure of rolling time window
 5 searches is similar to that described above for the annual delivery model.
   [00192]      The first rolling time window search has more narrow windows (as compared with
   the second rolling time window search). For each iteration, all variables, either outsides of
   the window, or for the decisions associated with a spot market, or for the decisions associated
   with an extra in-chartered ship, are fixed to their current values; and all other variables are
10 freed up. This neighborhood search is directed to optimize the options which are not related
   to spot market opportunities, for example the options for fuel, speed, or heel, etc. A smaller
   branch and bound node limit can be specified to terminate the search.
   [00193]      The second rolling time window search has wider windows (as compared with the
   first rolling time window search). For each iteration, variables outsides of the window are
15 fixed to their current values; and other variables are freed up. This neighborhood search may
   not only optimize the options which are not related to spot market opportunities, it may also
   investigate whether cargos should be sent to spot market to improve economics.              This
   neighborhood is larger compared to the first one and thus a larger branch and bound node
   limit should be specified to terminate the search.
20 [00194]      This is the stage where the user can test the trade-off between deviations from the
   baseline schedule and the economic pursue.          Within a certain threshold, the higher the
   deviation tolerance, the maximum economics results. Above the threshold, however, further
   higher deviation tolerance may not be useful because the optimality of the project may have
   been achieved.
25 [00195]      In stage D, economics may be further maximized regardless schedule deviation
   from the baseline schedule.        The new optionality may be evaluated.       As noted above,
   economics are maximized within the specified change tolerance in stage C. If the change
   tolerance is small or set up improperly, new market opportunities, which could further
   maximize economics, may be excluded because they may involve significant amount of
30 changes on the schedule. To resolve this situation, economics may be maximized without
   any change limit in this stage. Rolling time window algorithms are designed and applied in
   this stage.
                                                  - 58 -

   [00196]     The rolling time window is a similar hybrid structure as in stage C. Rolling time
   windows are created one by one starting from the beginning of 90-day horizon. For each
   iteration, all variables, either inside of the time window, or for decisions associated with
   optional cargos, or for decisions associated with spot markets, are freed up for optimization
 5 while all others are fixed to their current values. Without change limit, the optimization
   solver is free to take all options or spot market opportunities as long as the economics are
   improved.     Thus, the solution in this stage has the optimal economic benefit given the
   resource and market at that time.
   [00197]     In stage E, deviations are minimized while sustaining maximized economics. The
10 schedule achieved after stage C may have unnecessary changes or unacceptable significant
   amount of deviations even though the economics are maximized.       This stage may provide the
   user a different approach to make the trade-off between deviations from baseline schedule
   and the economic performance. In this stage, deviations may be minimized while sustaining
   the economics at the maximized or a pre-specified level. The algorithms in this stage are
15 similar as those in stage B.      The only difference is that, a lower bound is added to the
   economics in the local neighborhood optimization problems in this stage to sustain the
   economic level.
   [00198]     In this stage, the user can specify how much economic benefit to be allocated to
   minimize deviations from baseline schedule. Within a certain threshold, the more economics
20 given up, the less the deviations from baseline schedule.      Above the threshold, however,
   further larger tolerance for economic decrement may not be beneficial because the deviations
   from baseline schedule may have been minimized.         The solution achieved in stage B and
   stage D present the two extreme preferences that the user may have regarding with the trade
   off between solution reliability and economic pursue. This model provides user capability to
25 make selections among these solutions at the same time.
   [00199]     This system is designed for and applied to, but is not limited to, LNG ship
   rescheduling optimization. The present techniques perform one or more of the following:
   recovering from the disruptions; minimizing changes to the schedule; maximizing benefits
   while sustaining deviations within a certain level; maximizing benefit by evaluating new
30 opportunities; minimizing changes while sustaining economics at a certain level.        These
   provide a mechanism to update schedules for all projects in which planning assumptions are
   changed frequently and trade-off between schedule reliability and economic pursue has to be
   made.
                                                 - 59 -

   [00200]     As an output from the system, the system may be used in various manners during
   project-specific operations planning, such as: to negotiate an ADP during the negotiation
   process; to develop an initial 90-day delivery plan; and/or to evaluate the effect of customer
   requests for modifying the initial 90-day delivery plan. Also, it may be used to recover ship
 5 schedule from disruptions (e.g. ship breakdown, and/or terminal breakdown). Further, it may
   be used in a similar way for other scheduling time horizons other than annual and 90-days.
   The ship schedule optimizer may be integrated with maintenance and production planning, as
   well as looking at maximizing profits by utilizing flexibility within contracts. For example,
   the ship schedule may be optimized simultaneously with any of the following: LNG
10 inventory levels at one or more LNG liquefaction terminals; LNG inventory levels at one or
   more LNG regasification terminal; fuel selection for at least one voyage; ship speed for at
   least one voyage; a maritime route for at least one voyage; berth assignment at any of the
   LNG liquefaction terminals         and/or LNG regasification terminals;      ship maintenance
   schedules; and LNG liquefaction or production schedules. Further, aspects disclosed herein
15 may be used for developing delivery plans for an individual LNG producer to one or more
   customers, or for a company that owns equity gas in one or more LNG liquefaction terminals
   and delivers LNG to one or more customers. Disclosed aspects may also be used to evaluate
   the performance of an optimized schedule under various future scenarios associated with
   uncertainties identified herein.
20 [00201]     The system may provide the user the capability to recover schedule from
   disruptions and evaluate new market opportunities in a more efficient manner through its
   intelligent model preprocessor. Depending on how severe the disruption is and how urgent
   that the schedule needs to be recovered, the system can provide different solutions with
   different priorities. If the user prefers to recover the schedule as soon as possible regardless
25 of deviation from the baseline schedule, the system may stop immediately after stage A
   which is designed to get the first feasible/practical solution in a more efficient manner.
   Alternatively, if the user also wants to minimize deviation from the baseline schedule, the
   system could be terminated after stage B in which the total weight for prioritized changes is
   minimized until satisfying the user-pre-defined change tolerance. Alternatively, if economic
30 benefits are also pursued, the system could run till the end of stage C in which economics are
   maximized with the given change tolerance. Alternatively, if more market opportunities need
   to be investigated, the system could perform stage D in which economics may be maximized
                                                  - 60 -

   regardless the change tolerance and stage E in which changes may then be minimized while
   sustaining the economic advantages.
   [00202]     The system may provide the user the ability to analyze the trade-off between
   minimizing changes in the updated planned compared to the baseline plan, and maximizing
 5 the incremental economics. For example, the system may optimize economics without
   constraining for the number of changes compared to a baseline plan. The system may also
   develop a schedule that minimizes overall changes compared to the baseline plan.
   Alternatively, the system may optimize economics for a given number of changes compared
   to baseline plan. Alternatively this system may minimize the number of changes for a given
10 level of economic performance. In each of these cases, the system provides a mechanism for
   the user to specify the degree of flexibility and importance associated with each type of
   change on a cargo by cargo basis.
   [00203]     Figure 6 is a chart 600 of a notional curve 602 representing the incremental
   economics generated by allowing for more changes in the updated schedule compared to the
15 baseline schedule. Within a certain threshold, the higher the deviation tolerance, the
   maximum economics results, as shown on the curve 602.          Above the threshold, however,
   further higher deviation tolerance may not be useful because the optimality of the project may
   have been achieved.
   [00204]     The system may provide the ability to optimize economics from several
20 perspectives including minimizing costs, maximizing throughput, maximizing profit etc.
   [00205]     The updated schedule can be used as a starting point to negotiate 90-day delivery
   schedules with customers. During the negotiation with a specific customer, the system can be
   used to evaluate the operational feasibility, economic effect, and side-effects on the delivery
   schedules for the overall portfolio of satisfying requests by that specific customer. For
25 example, the system may evaluate how a customer request (or the relevant scenario under
   consideration) may affect LNG inventory profiles at each storage tank farm, and re-optimize
   the schedule to ensure that storage inventory constraints are satisfied. Similarly, the system
   may evaluate whether the relevant scenario may cause any berth conflicts and may
   reoptimize the schedule to mitigate such issues. Similarly, the system may evaluate if the
30 relevant scenario may cause any contractual constraints to be violated, the system may re
   optimize the schedule to ensure that these violations are minimized
   [00206]     The system can also be used to reoptimize schedules during negotiations with
   customers during the 90-day scheduling or ADP development stage
                                                 - 61 -

   [00207]      The system can optimize the schedule at different levels of granularity. For
   instance, some decisions (e.g. ship speed) may be optimized at a finer scale in the near term
   (e.g., within the time period of the rescheduling horizon, such as within the 90-day plan), and
   at a coarser scale beyond the near term. Similarly, the system may optimize ship fuel
 5 selection in the near term, but assume nominal selection rules beyond the near term.
   [00208]      The design of the system can be applied to any scheduling problems in which
   schedules need to updated frequently based business's preferences and new information, and
   trade-off between change minimization and economics maximization need to be made.
   [00209]     As an example, the present techniques for LNG ship rescheduling may include
10 various scenarios that can be solved by this system include, but are not limited to, the
   followings: 1) production and inventory change (e.g., daily production rate differs from the
   production assumptions and or inventory level deviates from the predicted volume in the
   baseline schedule); 2) ship delay or ship down (e.g., ship delay by several days; and/or ship is
   down for a significant long period); 3) terminal down (e.g., terminal is down so cargos need
15 to be diverted; terminal is closed for maintenance so cargos need to be rescheduled; and/or
   berth is closed for maintenance); 4) change requests from customers (e.g., customer requests
   to change delivery destination/ship/time/quantity/grade and/or negotiation about the annual
   delivery plan); 5) divert contracts to spot market (e.g., spot market that accepts certain ship
   types/ cargo sizes / LNG grade); 6) dry-dock window is moved from period to period (e.g., to
20 ensure ample shipping resource during periods with higher LNG price) and/or 7) combined
   scenarios with more than one feature specified above.
   [00210]      The system may also provide intuitive interfaces to provide the user flexibility and
   enhance the identifying the differences between the baseline and the updated schedules. As
   an example, Figure 7 is a diagram 700 that represents the difference in ship schedules in the
25 updated and baseline plans for three ships. In this diagram 700, the difference in ship
   schedules in the updated and baseline plans is shown by the different color boxes.            The
   diagram 700 shows the differences in the two schedules for three ships where a schedule
   changed for one of its original cargos. Each voyage (e.g., laden or ballast) is represented by
   one box. The boxes are color-coded by cargo, as noted in the legend 702.
30 [00211]      Figure 8 shows a chart 800 of a notional comparison of economics for the updated
   delivery plan compared to baseline delivery plan. The changes shown in Figure 7 provide the
   economic benefits shown in the chart 800 of Figure 8.
                                                 - 62 -

   [00212]      The user interface for the system may provide several capabilities for comparing
   two or more versions of the same schedule. The intended use of this functionality is to
   identify where the optimization model has modified the schedule in a significant way and
   provide an easy method for quantifying the value of the updated schedule.
 5 [00213]      To quantify the value of the schedule updates, the original ADP as well as the
   previous version of the schedule may be benchmarked.           Benchmarking against the ADP
   provides insights into the comparison of the 90-day plan and the ADP.              This type of
   benchmarking provides insights into the question of "how are we doing according to the
   original plan?" or "how are we doing given all previous schedule modifications since the
10 ADP?".
   [00214]      Outputs from the model may be utilized to provide visual indicators for the user.
   As an example, the outputs may include side-by-side comparison charts for certain metrics.
   These metrics may include total units loaded and delivered; sales revenue in dollars per unit
   delivered and overall; profit in dollars per unit delivered and overall; shipping cost in dollars
15 per unit delivered and overall; profit in dollars per unit delivered and overall; burn down
   chart showing ADP as the baseline with previous and current schedule to project the schedule
   status (e.g., units delivered, shipping costs; sales revenue, and profit).     All of the above
   metrics should be displayed for the schedule overall, each Joint Venture, each Contract, and
   each Region of sale.
20 [00215]      When determining the value it is also valuable to have other metrics to benchmark
   two solutions. Some of these examples are Ship Utilization, Number of Cargos, Ratio of the
   Number of Cargos to the Cargo Size, Knots Sailed, Canal Fees Paid, etc. These metrics can
   quantify how much the schedule has changed for the value that is seen from the above charts.
   [00216]      For the system to effectively communicate changes to a schedule, several unique
25 comparison interfaces       needed to be implemented. Accordingly, displaying schedule
   differences side-by-side are filtered down to the relevant changes as well as cargoes that fall
   within the visible time period as defined by the user. These changes can be viewed side-by
   side and from multiple different perspectives, as shown in Figures 9 and 10.
   [00217]      Figure 9 is a diagram 900 that represents the difference in ship schedules for how
30 cargos are moving between the ships. In this diagram 900, the changes are represented for
   each individual ship.
   [00218]      Figure 10 is another diagram 1000 that represents the difference in ship schedules
   for how cargos are moving between the ships. In this diagram 1000, cargo schedule are
                                                 -63  -

   represented as to how the cargos are changing with respect to time, but also shows when a
   ship is changed.
    [00219]     In these diagrams 900 and 1000, the perspective blends the cargo in diagram 900
   to show the customer's delivery schedule for their cargos only. The value of this display is to
 5 provide clear indications and notifications with a user.
    [00220]     The customer schedule shows how a customer's cargos are changed for the
   purposes of updating the customer on the impact. To illustrate the scheme of this system, the
   ship down case is shown below. In this scenario, a ship Ship 1 is down in the middle of
   February and may get back to the production terminal on 3/18/2014 instead of 3/11/2014 as
10 planned. Due to the tight schedule of the ship Ship 1, the delay may affect two cargos. This
   aspect is shown further in the cargos planned for ship Ship 1 during March-May, which is
   indicated in Table 6 below.

15  [00221]     As shown in the Table.6, when the ship Ship1 is delayed from 3/11/2014 to
   3/18/2014, the cargos Cargo 1 and Cargo6 are impacted and cargo Cargo7 may or may not be
   affected depending on the change of facility usage caused by the ship being down. The
   system may repair the schedules for March to December (Mar-Dec) with minimum change
   given that the customers do not permit any delivery side change after July and allow ship
20 change, 1 day delivery change and 10% of quantity change during March-May period.
    [00222]     The system is able to recover the schedule in 15 minutes with minimized total
   weight of changes and maximized economics. An extra in-chartered ship is not used as in
   this correction and five cargos ship reassignments.                        After the schedule is repaired, the

   assignments.
    [00225]    See Figure 11 and Figurel2 for the illustration of ship reassignments at below.
    [00226]    As an example, Figure 13 is a block diagram of a computer system 1300 that may
   be used to perform any of the methods disclosed herein. A central processing unit (CPU)
10  1302 is coupled to system bus 1304.         The CPU 1302 may be any general-purpose CPU,
   although other types of architectures of CPU 1302 (or other components of exemplary system
    1300) may be used as long as CPU 1302 (and other components of system 1300) supports the
   inventive operations as described herein. The CPU 1302 may execute the various logical
   instructions according to disclosed aspects and methodologies. For example, the CPU 1302
15 may execute machine-level instructions for performing processing according to aspects and
   methodologies disclosed herein.
    [00227]    The computer system 1300 may also include computer components such as a
   random access memory (RAM) 1306, which may be SRAM, DRAM, SDRAM, or the like.
   The computer system 1300 may also include read-only memory (ROM) 1308, which may be
20 PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, or the like. RAM 1306 and ROM 1308 hold user and system
   data and programs, as is known in the art. The computer system 1300 may also include an
   input/output (1/0) adapter 1310, a communications adapter 1322, a user interface adapter
    1324, and a display adapter 1318. The 1/0 adapter 1310, the user interface adapter 1324,
   and/or communications adapter 1322 may, in certain aspects and techniques, enable a user to
25 interact with computer system 1300 to input information.
    [00228]    The 1/0 adapter 1310 preferably connects a storage device(s) 1312, such as one or
   more of hard drive, compact disc (CD) drive, floppy disk drive, tape drive, etc. to computer
   system 1300. The storage device(s) may be used when RAM 1306 is insufficient for the
   memory requirements associated with storing data for operations of embodiments of the
30 present techniques. The data storage of the computer system 1300 may be used for storing
                                                    - 65   -

   information and/or other data used or generated as disclosed herein. The communications
   adapter 1322 may couple the computer system 1300 to a network (not shown), which may
   enable information to be input to and/or output from system 1300 via the network (for
   example, a wide-area network, a local-area network, a wireless network, any combination of
 5 the foregoing). User interface adapter 1324 couples user input devices, such as a keyboard
   1328, a pointing device 1326, and the like, to computer system 1300. The display adapter
   1318 is driven by the CPU 1302 to control, through a display driver 1316, the display on a
   display device 1320. Information and/or representations of one or more 2D canvases and one
   or more 3D windows may be displayed, according to disclosed aspects and methodologies.
10 [00229]     The architecture of system 1300 may be varied as desired. For example, any
   suitable processor-based device may be used, including without limitation personal
   computers,    laptop   computers, computer       workstations,   and multi-processor servers.
   Moreover, embodiments may be implemented on application specific integrated circuits
   (ASICs) or very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. In fact, persons of ordinary skill in the
15 art may use any number of suitable structures capable of executing logical operations
   according to the embodiments.
   [00230]     In one or more embodiments, the method may be implemented in machine
   readable logic, set of instructions or code that, when executed, performs the instructions to
   create the 90-day plan and/or the ADP. The method may perform the operations noted in the
20 blocks of the different figures.
   [00231]     In one or more embodiments of LNG ship scheduling model, the LNG ship
   scheduling model may include various logic and components. The system may be used to
   develops annual delivery plan given the contract specification; production and re-gasification
   location specifications, rates; ship specifications; ship compatibilities with contracts,
25 production and re-gas terminals, berths; dry-dock requirements; storage tank requirements;
   berth specifications; berth and storage maintenance; loans / transfers of LNG among co
   located JVs; LNG grades; optionality opportunities including in-charter, out-charter,
   diversion; price projections; and/or potential ship routes. The system generates decisions,
   which are based on ship travel details (time, route, fuel, speed, "state" (warm vs. cold)); cargo
30 size, LNG quality; storage-berth combination which a cargo is served; is ship in-chartered or
   out-chartered;   and/or does ship go to dry-dock on a certain day. The system may also
   optimize decisions in consideration of ship travel restrictions based on arrival and departure
   times, speed, distance, loading/unloading operations; compatibility requirements between JV,

   storage tanks, berths, contracts, cargo sizes; limits on loans between JV's; storage
   restrictions; berth utilization; contractual requirements (quantity, time); and/or maintenance
   requirements. The system may also optimize decisions to maximize/minimize an objective;
   maximize social interest; minimize shipping costs; maximize joint venture profitability
 5 (single JV case); maximize IOC shareholder profitability (multiple JV case); maximize NOC
   interest (multiple JV case). The system uses algorithms to optimize model may include basic
   algorithm has five stages or phases, as noted above.          Further, the system may include
   extensions to handle soft constraints, such as soft ratability constraints (approach 1: minimize
   violation after Stage 5 and approach 2: minimize violation after stage 2) and/or soft inventory
10 constraints (e.g., approach 1: minimize violation after stage 5 and approach 2: minimize
   violation after stage 2.
   [00232]      In one or more embodiments of the LNG ship rescheduling model, LNG ship
   rescheduling model may include various logic and components.            The system may develop
   updated LNG loading and delivery schedules. The present techniques may adjust the given
15 baseline schedule for individual flexibility specifications towards cargo divertible/optional,
   delivery destination; delivery ship, delivery date, and/or delivery quantity.     In response to
   new/updated information, the system may update the schedule in response to updated
   planning information; disruptions; new market opportunities; new customer request etc. The
   objective of the system may be to minimize changes; maximize economics; and/or combined
20 (balance changes and economics).           The LNG ship rescheduling model may provide
   adjustment to the length of planning horizon is adjustable; posterior horizon further in future;
   degree of flexibility (# decision variables) in different horizon.      The system may include
   various constraints for cargos, such as a cargo is enforced if it is not divertible/optional;
   cargos cannot have changes beyond their specified flexibilities; cargo-based penalties are
25 assigned to each cargos to penalize changes; and/or the total penalties are minimized. As part
   of the system, an intelligent model preprocessor may be provided, which provide user's
   preferences responding to new/updated information; cargo manipulation; penalty calculation
   and/or guide optimizations to recover feasible schedules and achieve better economics in a
   more efficient manner. The system may also provide balancing between schedules need to
30 updated based business's preferences and new information and/or trade-off between change
   minimization and economics maximization need to be made

    The objective function can be selected as one of the objectives in (la) - (Id). The objective function
(1a) considers the overall profit of the entire social economy which is simply the difference of sales revenue
and shipping cost; the objective function (ib) represents the after-tax profit for all joint ventures; the
objective function (1c) describes the profit for a specific international oil company IOC; and the objective
function (Id) represents the profit of the national oil company NOC. One of these four objectives can
be selected to optimize and in the current version, the objective is selected as maximizing the social
economics.
    Constraints (2a) - (2c) are the network flow constraints. Constraint (2a) and (2b) ensure that each
ship leaves its source node and arrives at its sink node, while constraint (2c) conserves the flow through
network.
    Constraints (3a) - (3g) enforce the inventory balance at the terminals. During a time period i, the
production inventory unit (jv, su) might have four activities: production, loaning LNG from others,
returning LNG to others and loading LNG to ships. Constraint (3a) ensures that the inventory at the
production terminals is balanced at the end of each day given these four activities. Regasification termi
nals, however, only have two activities: regasification and discharging LNG from ships. Constraint (3b)
                                                             - 94 -

guarantees the inventory at regasification terminals is balanced based on the two activities. Constraints
(3c) - (3e) put the storage limits or inventory capacities on production inventory unit (jv, u), storage
unit su and regasification inventory unit (invCm, trrg); while constraints (3f - (3g) put the limits on
the net loan volume and daily transfer rate between two different production inventory units.
     Constraint (4) ensure that only one ship can be operated at a berth at a time. Incase a regas
terminal has two terminals, there has to be two distinct berth entries in the input file.
     Constraints (Sa) - (Sc) guarantee that all contractual requirements are satisfied. Constraint (5a) gives
the minimum and maximum cargo requirements for the contract while constraints (5b) put the minimum
and maximum energy quantity requirements for that contract. Two additional options of requirements
might be provided for a contract: one specifies the maximum quantity that can be diverted from the
contract and the other one specifies the maximum quantity that the contract can take ifthe jv has over
production. These options provide flexibility with regard to quantity requirements and it is reflected in
the lower and upper limits in (5b) and (5c).
     Constraints (6a) - (c) ensure that the fiscal regime of each cargo is set correctly. Constraint (6a)
specify that the energy quantity assigned to a base fiscal regime should not exceed its limit. Ifthe fiscal
regime associated with an arc a has immediate preceding regime, constraint (6b) guarantees that all of
cargos assigned the preceding regime will be scheduled earlier than the cargo that is represented by a
if the arc a is selected; while constraint (6c) says that the are a can be selected only if the quantity of
precedent regime has been fulfilled,
     Constraints (7a) - (7b) provide cargo and quantity requirements for inclusive and exclusive time
windows.
     Constraint (8)ensure that the outcharter opportunity isonly taken at most once.
     Constraint (9)forces that maintenance isapplied exactly once.
     Constraints (10a) - (10h) guarantee that all requirements for a diversion are satisfied if it is selected.
Constraints (10a) - (10b) give the minimum and maximum cargo and quantity requirements for diverion
opportunities that do not require unique joint venture or unique contract. Constraints (10e) - (10&) are
cargo and quantity requirements for diversions that require all cargos to be from the same joint venture;
while constraints (13f) - (10h) are for those that require all cargo to be from the same fiscal regime.
     Constraint (11) gives the minimum and maximum cargo requirements for coloading and split time
windows,
