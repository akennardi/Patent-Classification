        COMBINED SOLUTION PUMP AND STORAGE SYSTEM FOR USE WITH A
                         REDUCED-PRESSURE TREATMENT SYSTEM
[0001]     This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013347852 which
claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/729,926 filed
November 26, 2012, entitled "Combined Solution Pump and Storage System for use with a
Negative Pressure Treatment System," the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by
reference in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]     The present disclosure relates generally to medical treatment systems for treating tissue
sites that produce liquids, such as exudate, and for processing body fluids. More particularly, but
not by way of limitation, the present disclosure relates to a system for volumetric delivery of
solution with a therapy device.
BACKGROUND
[0003]     Clinical studies and practice have shown that reducing pressure in proximity to a tissue
site can augment and accelerate growth of new tissue at the tissue site. The applications of this
phenomenon are numerous, but it has proven particularly advantageous for treating wounds.
Regardless of the etiology of a wound, whether trauma, surgery, or another cause, proper care of
the wound is important to the outcome. Treatment of wounds with reduced pressure may be
commonly referred to as "reduced-pressure therapy," but is also known by other names, including
"negative-pressure therapy," "negative-pressure wound therapy," "vacuum therapy," and "vacuum
assisted closure," for example. Reduced-pressure therapy may provide a number of benefits,
including migration of epithelial and subcutaneous tissues, improved blood flow, and micro
deformation of tissue at a wound site. Together, these benefits can increase development of
granulation tissue and reduce healing times.
[0004]     In addition, the delivery of therapeutic fluids, such as saline or antibiotic fluids, to the
tissue site can also provide healing benefits to the tissue site. Treatment of tissue sites with the
delivery of therapeutic fluids may be referred to as "instillation therapy." Instillation therapy may
assist in cleaning the tissue site by aiding in the removal of infectious agents or necrotic tissue.

                                                    -2
The therapeutic fluids used in instillation therapy may also include medicinal fluids, such as
antibiotics, anti-fungals, antiseptics, analgesics, or other similar substances, to aid in the treatment
of a tissue site.
[0005]      While the clinical benefits of reduced-pressure therapy and instillation therapy are widely
known, the cost and complexity of reduced-pressure therapy and instillation therapy can be a
limiting factor in its application, and the development and operation of reduced-pressure systems,
components, and processes continues to present significant challenges to manufacturers,
healthcare providers, and patients.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
[0035]      New and useful systems, methods, and apparatuses for providing a combined solution
pump and solution storage system for treating a tissue site are set forth in the appended claims.
Objectives, advantages, and a preferred mode of making and using the systems, methods, and
apparatuses may be understood by reference to the following detailed description in conjunction
with the accompanying drawings.          The description provides information that enables a person
skilled in the art to make and use the claimed subject matter, but may omit certain details already
well-known in the art. Moreover, descriptions of various alternatives using terms such as "or" do
not necessarily require mutual exclusivity unless clearly required by the context. The claimed
subject matter may also encompass alternative embodiments, variations, and equivalents not
specifically described in detail.     The following detailed description should therefore be taken as
illustrative and not limiting.
[0036]      The example embodiments may also be described herein in the context of reduced
pressure therapy and instillation therapy applications, but many of the features and advantages
are readily applicable to other environments and industries. Spatial relationships between various
elements or the spatial orientation of various elements may be described as depicted in the
attached drawings.      In general, such relationships or orientations assume a frame of reference

                                                    -6
consistent with or relative to a patient in a position to receive reduced-pressure therapy. However,
as should be recognized by those skilled in the art, this frame of reference is merely a descriptive
expedient rather than a strict prescription.
[0037]     Figure 1 is a simplified functional block diagram illustrating details that may be
associated with some embodiments of a therapy system 100. In some embodiments, the therapy
system 100 can provide therapeutic pressure and/or instillation in accordance with this
specification. In some embodiments, the therapy system 100 may include a dressing 102 fluidly
coupled to a therapy device 104. The dressing 102 may include a drape, such as a drape 108,
and a tissue interface, such as a manifold 110. The therapy system 100 may also include a fluid
container, such as a container 112, and/or a solution cartridge, such as a cartridge 114. The
container 112 may be fluidly coupled between the dressing 102 and the therapy device 104. The
cartridge 114 may be fluidly coupled to the dressing 102 and operationally coupled the therapy
device 104.
[0038]     In general, components of the therapy system 100 may be coupled directly or indirectly
to each other. For example, the therapy device 104 may be directly coupled to the container 112
and indirectly coupled to the dressing 102 through the container 112. Components may be fluidly
coupled to each other to provide a path for transferring fluids (i.e., liquid and/or gas) between the
components. In some embodiments, components may be fluidly coupled with a tube, for example.
A "tube," as used herein, broadly refers to a tube, pipe, hose, conduit, or other structure with one
or more lumina adapted to convey fluids between two ends. Typically, a tube is an elongated,
cylindrical structure with some flexibility, but the geometry and rigidity may vary.          In some
embodiments, components may additionally or alternatively be coupled by virtue of physical
proximity, being integral to a single structure, or being formed from the same piece of material.
Coupling may also include mechanical, thermal, electrical, or chemical union (such as a chemical
bond) in some contexts.
[0039]     In operation, a tissue interface, such as the manifold 110, may be placed within, over,
on, against, or otherwise adjacent to a tissue site. For example, the manifold 110 may be placed
against a tissue site, and the drape 108 may be placed over the manifold 110 and sealed to tissue
proximate to the tissue site. Tissue proximate to a tissue site is often undamaged epidermis
peripheral to the tissue site. Thus, the dressing 102 can provide a sealed therapeutic environment
proximate to a tissue site, substantially isolated from the external environment, and the therapy

                                                   -7
device 104 can reduce the pressure in the sealed therapeutic environment.            Reduced pressure
can be distributed through the tissue interface across the tissue site in the sealed therapeutic
environment to induce macrostrain and microstrain, as well as to remove exudates and other
fluids from a tissue site, which can be collected in the container 112 and disposed of properly.
[0040]     Exudates may refer to fluid that filters from the circulatory system into lesions or areas of
inflammation. Exudates may include water and dissolved solutes. Dissolved solutes may include
blood, plasma proteins, white blood cells, platelets, and red blood cells. In some embodiments,
exudates may include serum, fibrin, and white blood cells. In other embodiments, exudates may
include pus having a thin protein-rich fluid and dead leukocytes.
[0041]     The fluid mechanics of using a reduced-pressure source to reduce pressure in another
component or location, such as within a sealed therapeutic environment, can be mathematically
complex. However, the basic principles of fluid mechanics applicable to reduced-pressure therapy
are generally well-known to those skilled in the art, and the process of reducing pressure may be
described illustratively herein as "delivering," "distributing," or "generating" reduced pressure, for
example.
[0042]     In general, exudates and other fluids flow toward lower pressure along a fluid path.
Thus, in the context of reduced-pressure therapy, the term "downstream" typically implies
something in a fluid path relatively closer to a reduced-pressure source, and conversely, the term
'upstream" implies something relatively further away from a reduced-pressure source. Similarly, it
may be convenient to describe certain features in terms of fluid "inlet" or "outlet" in such a frame of
reference. This orientation is generally presumed for purposes of describing various features and
components of reduced-pressure therapy systems herein. However, the fluid path may also be
reversed in some applications (such as by substituting a positive-pressure source for a reduced
pressure source) and this descriptive convention should not be construed as a limiting convention.
[0043]     The term "tissue site" in this context broadly refers to a wound or defect located on or
within tissue, including but not limited to, bone tissue, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, neural tissue,
dermal tissue, vascular tissue, connective tissue, cartilage, tendons, or ligaments. A wound may
include chronic, acute, traumatic, subacute, and dehisced wounds, partial-thickness burns, ulcers
(such as diabetic, pressure, or venous insufficiency ulcers), flaps, and grafts, for example. The
term "tissue site" may also refer to areas of any tissue that are not necessarily wounded or

                                                 -8
defective, but are instead areas in which it may be desirable to add or promote the growth of
additional tissue. For example, reduced pressure may be used in certain tissue areas to grow
additional tissue that may be harvested and transplanted to another tissue location.
[0044]     "Reduced pressure" generally refers to a pressure less than a local ambient pressure,
such as the ambient pressure in a local environment external to a sealed therapeutic environment
provided by the dressing 102.        In many cases, the local ambient pressure may also be the
atmospheric pressure at which a patient is located. Alternatively, the pressure may be less than a
hydrostatic pressure associated with tissue at the tissue site. Unless otherwise indicated, values
of pressure stated herein are gauge pressures.       Similarly, references to increases in reduced
pressure typically refer to a decrease in absolute pressure, while decreases in reduced pressure
typically refer to an increase in absolute pressure.
[0045]     The therapy device 104 may include a reduced-pressure source. A reduced-pressure
source may be a reservoir of air at a reduced pressure, or may be a manual or electrically
powered device that can reduce the pressure in a sealed volume, such as a vacuum pump, a
suction pump, a wall suction port available at many healthcare facilities, or a micro-pump, for
example. A reduced-pressure source may be housed within or used in conjunction with other
components, such as sensors, processing units, alarm indicators, memory, databases, software,
display devices, or user interfaces that further facilitate reduced-pressure therapy. While the
amount and nature of reduced pressure applied to a tissue site may vary according to therapeutic
requirements, the pressure typically ranges between -5 mm Hg (-667 Pa) and -500 mm Hg (-66.7
kPa). Common therapeutic ranges are between -75 mm Hg (-9.9 kPa) and -300 mm Hg (-39.9
kPa).
[0046]     The therapy device 104 may also include a fluid source.        A fluid source may be a
reservoir of fluid at an atmospheric or greater pressure, or may be a manual or electrically
powered device, such as a pump, that can convey fluid to a sealed volume, such as a sealed
therapeutic environment, for example. In some embodiments, a fluid source may be a peristaltic
pump. A peristaltic pump may include a circular pump casing having a rotor with one or more
rollers. In some embodiments, a rotor may also be referred to as a pump head, and rollers may
also be referred to as shoes, wipers, or lobes, for example. The rollers may be attached around a
circumference of the rotor and positioned proximate to a section of tube. A peristaltic pump may
further include a motor coupled to the rotor and configured to rotate the rotor so that the rollers

                                                   -9
engage the section of tube. As each roller engages the tube it may compress a portion of the
tube, occluding the compressed portion of the tube.           Rotation of the rotor may move the
compressed location of the tube, pushing fluid through the tube ahead of the roller. In addition, as
the tube opens after a roller passes, fluid may be drawn into the tube behind the roller. In this
manner, fluid may be drawn into and moved through the tube. Generally, tubes engaged by a
roller of a peristaltic pump may be formed of silicone.
[0047]      A fluid source may be housed within or used in conjunction with other components, such
as sensors, processing units, alarm indicators, memory, databases, software, display devices, or
user interfaces that further facilitate instillation therapy.  The amount and nature of the fluid
applied to a tissue site may vary according to therapeutic requirements, which may include the
size of the sealed therapeutic environment, the type of fluid, and any additives to the fluid. In
some embodiments, the fluid may include: hypochlorite based solutions, such as hypochlorous
acid and sodium hypochlorite; silver nitrate; sulfur based solutions, such as sulfonamides;
biguanides, such as polyhexanide; cationic solutions, such as octenidine and benzalkonium
chloride; and isotonic solutions.
[0048]      The therapy device 104 may also include a user interface. A user interface may be a
device configured to allow communication between a controller and an environment external to
the therapy device 104. In some embodiments, an external environment may include an operator
or a computer system configured to interface with the therapy device 104, for example. In some
embodiments, a user interface may receive a signal from a controller and present the signal in a
manner that may be understood by an external environment.             In some embodiments, a user
interface may receive signals from an external environment and, in response, send signals to a
controller.
[0049]      In some embodiments, a user interface may be a graphical user interface, a
touchscreen, or one or more motion tracking devices. A user interface may also include one or
more display screens, such as a liquid crystal display ("LCD"), lighting devices, such as light
emitting diodes ("LED") of various colors, and audible indicators, such as a whistle, configured to
emit a sound that may be heard by an operator. A user interface may further include one or more
devices, such as knobs, buttons, keyboards, remotes, touchscreens, ports that may be configured
to receive a discrete or continuous signal from another device, or other similar devices; these
devices may be configured to permit the external environment to interact with the user interface.

                                                   - 10
A user interface may permit an external environment to select a therapy to be performed with the
therapy device 104.      In some embodiments, a user interface may display information for an
external environment such as a duration of the therapy, a type of therapy, an amount of reduced
pressure being supplied, an amount of instillation solution being provided, a fluid level of a
container, or a fluid level of a cartridge, for example.
[0050]     The therapy device 104 may also include one or more pressure sensors. A pressure
sensor may be a piezoresistive strain gauge, a capacitive sensor, an electromagnetic sensor, a
piezoelectric sensor, an optical sensor, or a potentiometric sensor, for example.            In some
embodiments, a pressure sensor can measure a strain caused by an applied pressure.                  A
pressure sensor may be calibrated by relating a known amount of strain to a known pressure
applied. The known relationship may be used to determine an unknown applied pressure based
on a measured amount of strain.           In some embodiments, a pressure sensor may include a
receptacle configured to receive an applied pressure.
[0051]     The therapy device 104 may also include one or more valves. In some embodiments,
for example, a valve may be fluidly coupled between a fluid reservoir and the dressing 102. A
valve may be a device configured to selectively permit fluid flow through the valve. A valve may
be a ball valve, a gate valve, a butterfly valve, or other valve type that may be operated to prevent
or permit fluid flow through the valve. Generally, a valve may include a valve body having a flow
passage, a valve member disposed in the flow passage and operable to selectively block the flow
passage, and an actuator configured to operate the valve member.                An actuator may be
configured to position the valve member in a closed position, preventing fluid flow through the flow
passage of the valve; an open position, permitting fluid flow through the fluid passage of the valve;
or a metering position, permitting fluid flow through the flow passage of the valve at a selected
flow rate. In some embodiments, the actuator may be a mechanical actuator configured to be
operated by an operator.        In some embodiments, the actuator may be an electromechanical
actuator configured to be operated in response to the receipt of a signal input. For example, the
actuator may include an electrical motor configured to receive a signal from a controller.         In
response to the signal, the electrical motor of the actuator may move the valve member of the
valve. In some embodiments, a valve may be configured to selectively permit fluid communication
between the therapy device 104 and the dressing 102.

                                                  - 11
[0052]     The therapy device 104 may also include one or more flow meters. A flow meter may
be a device configured to measure a fluid flow rate. A flow meter may include a mechanical flow
meter, a pressure based flow meter, an optical flow meter, an open channel flow meter, a thermal
mass flow meter, a vortex flow meter, electromagnetic, ultrasonic and coriolis flow meters, and
laser doppler flow meters. The flow meter may determine a rate of fluid flow through the valve and
transmit a signal to a controller corresponding to the determined flow rate.
[0053]     The therapy device 104 may also include one or more controllers communicatively
coupled to components of the therapy device 104, such as a valve, a flow meter, a sensor, a user
interface, or a pump, for example, to control operation of the same.             As used herein,
communicative coupling may refer to a coupling between components that permits the
transmission of signals between the components.         In some embodiments, the signals may be
discrete or continuous signals.      A discrete signal may be a signal representing a value at a
particular instance in a time period. A plurality of discrete signals may be used to represent a
changing value over a time period. A continuous signal may be a signal that provides a value for
each instance in a time period.      The signals may also be analog signals or digital signals. An
analog signal may be a continuous signal that includes a time varying feature that represents
another time varying quantity.      A digital signal may be a signal composed of a sequence of
discrete values.
[0054]     In some embodiments, the communicative coupling between a controller and other
devices may be one-way communication. In one-way communication, signals may only be sent in
one direction.   For example, a sensor may generate a signal that may be communicated to a
controller, but the controller may not be capable of sending a signal to the sensor.       In some
embodiments, the communicative coupling between a controller and another device may be two
way communication.      In two-way communication, signals may be sent in both directions.       For
example, a controller and a user interface may be communicatively coupled so that the controller
may send and receive signals from the user interface. Similarly, a user interface may send and
receive signals from a controller. In some embodiments, signal transmission between a controller
and another device may be referred to as the controller operating the device.         For example,
interaction between a controller and a valve may be referred to as the controller: operating the
valve; placing the valve in an open position, a closed position, or a metering position; or opening
the valve, closing the valve, or metering the valve.

                                                - 12
[0055]     A controller may be a computing device or system, such as a programmable logic
controller, or a data processing system, for example. In some embodiments, a controller may be
configured to receive input from one or more devices, such as a user interface, a sensor, or a flow
meter, for example. In some embodiments, a controller may receive input, such as an electrical
signal, from an alternative source, such as through an electrical port, for example.
[0056]     In some embodiments, a controller may be a data processing system.                     A data
processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code may include at least one
processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory
elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk
storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in
order to reduce the number of times code is retrieved from bulk storage during execution.
[0057]     In some embodiments, a controller may be a programmable logic controller (PLC). A
PLC may be a digital computer configured to receive one or more inputs and send one or more
outputs in response to the one or more inputs.          A PLC may include a non-volatile memory
configured to store programs or operational instructions. In some embodiments, the non-volatile
memory may be operationally coupled to a battery-back up so that the non-volatile memory retains
the programs or operational instructions if the PLC otherwise loses power. In some embodiments,
a PLC may be configured to receive discrete signals and continuous signals and produce discrete
and continuous signals in response.
[0058]     The therapy device 104 may also include a power source. A power source may be a
device that supplies electric power to an electric load. A power source may include a battery, a
direct current (DC) power supply, an alternating current (AC) power supply, a linear regulated
power supply, or a switched-mode power supply, for example.              A power supply may supply
electric power to a controller, a sensor, a flow meter, a valve, a user interface, or a pump, for
example.
[0059]     A tissue interface, such as the manifold 110, can be generally adapted to contact a
tissue site. A tissue interface may be partially or fully in contact with a tissue site. If a tissue site
is a wound, for example, a tissue interface may partially or completely fill the wound, or may be
placed over the wound.      A tissue interface may take many forms, and may have many sizes,
shapes, or thicknesses depending on a variety of factors, such as the type of treatment being

                                                 - 13
implemented or the nature and size of a tissue site. For example, the size and shape of a tissue
interface may be adapted to the contours of deep and irregular shaped tissue sites.
[0060]    Generally, a manifold, such as the manifold 110, for example, is a substance or
structure adapted to distribute or remove fluids across a tissue site. A manifold may include flow
channels or pathways providing multiple openings that distribute fluids provided to and removed
from a tissue site around the manifold.      In one illustrative embodiment, the flow channels or
pathways may be interconnected to improve uniformity of distribution of fluids provided to or
removed from a tissue site. For example, open-cell foam, porous tissue collections, and other
porous material such as gauze or felted mat generally include structural elements arranged to
form flow channels. Liquids, gels, and other foams may also include or be cured to include flow
channels.
[0061]    In one illustrative embodiment, the manifold 110 may be a porous foam pad having
interconnected cells adapted to distribute reduced pressure across a tissue site. The foam may
be either hydrophobic or hydrophilic. In one non-limiting example, the manifold 110 can be an
open-cell, reticulated polyurethane foam, such as GranuFoam* dressing available from Kinetic
Concepts, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas.
[0062]    In an example in which the manifold 110 may be made from a hydrophilic material, the
manifold 110 may also wick fluid away from a tissue site, while continuing to distribute reduced
pressure across the tissue site. The wicking properties of the manifold 110 may draw fluid away
from a tissue site by capillary flow or other wicking mechanisms. An example of a hydrophilic
foam is a polyvinyl alcohol, open-cell foam such as V.A.C. WhiteFoam® dressing available from
Kinetic Concepts, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas. Other hydrophilic foams may include those made
from polyether.    Other foams that may exhibit hydrophilic characteristics include hydrophobic
foams that have been treated or coated to provide hydrophilicity.
[0063]    A tissue interface may further promote granulation at a tissue site when pressure within
the sealed therapeutic environment is reduced.        For example, any or all of the surfaces of the
manifold 110 may have an uneven, coarse, or jagged profile that can induce microstrains and
stresses at a tissue site if reduced pressure is applied through the manifold 110.

                                                 - 14
[0064]     In one embodiment, a tissue interface may be constructed from bioresorbable materials.
Suitable bioresorbable materials may include, without limitation, a polymeric blend of polylactic
acid (PLA) and polyglycolic acid (PGA). The polymeric blend may also include, without limitation,
polycarbonates, polyfumarates, and capralactones. The tissue interface may further serve as a
scaffold for new cell-growth, or a scaffold material may be used in conjunction with a tissue
interface to promote cell-growth.      A scaffold is generally a biodegradable or biocompatible
substance or structure used to enhance or promote the growth of cells or formation of tissue, such
as a three-dimensional porous structure that provides a template for cell growth.        Illustrative
examples of scaffold materials include calcium phosphate, collagen, PLA/PGA, coral hydroxy
apatites, carbonates, or processed allograft materials.
[0065]     The drape 108 is an example of a sealing member.           A sealing member may be
constructed from a material that can provide a fluid seal between two components or two
environments, such as between a therapeutic environment and a local external environment. A
sealing member may be, for example, an impermeable or semi-permeable, elastomeric film that
can provide a seal adequate to maintain a reduced pressure at a tissue site for a given reduced
pressure source. For semi-permeable materials, the permeability of gas generally should be low
enough that a desired reduced pressure may be maintained. An attachment device may be used
to attach a sealing member to an attachment surface, such as undamaged epidermis, a gasket, or
another sealing member.        An attachment device may take many forms.          For example, an
attachment device may be a medically-acceptable, pressure-sensitive adhesive that extends
about a periphery, a portion, or an entire sealing member. Other example embodiments of an
attachment device may include a double-sided tape, paste, hydrocolloid, hydrogel, silicone gel,
organogel, or an acrylic adhesive.
[0066]     A "container," such as the container 112 broadly includes a canister, pouch, bottle, vial,
or other fluid collection apparatus.    The container 112 for example, can be used to manage
exudates and other fluids withdrawn from a tissue site. In some embodiments, the container 112
may include substances to manage fluid in the container 112, such as isolyzers or absorbents, for
example.     In many environments, a rigid container may be preferred or required for collecting,
storing, and disposing of fluids. In other environments, fluids may be properly disposed of without
rigid container storage, and a re-usable container could reduce waste and costs associated with
reduced-pressure therapy.

                                                  - 15
[0067]      A "cartridge," such as the cartridge 114, is representative of another container, canister,
pouch, or other storage component, which can be used to manage fluids, such as instillation
solution, that can be supplied to the tissue site. In many environments a rigid container may be
preferred or required for delivering, storing, and supplying of the instillation solution.       In other
environments, instillation solution may be provided in a non-rigid container. A re-usable container
could reduce waste and costs associated with instillation.
[0068]      In general, reduced-pressure therapy can be beneficial for wounds of all severity, but the
cost and complexity of reduced-pressure therapy systems often limit the application of reduced
pressure therapy to large, highly-exudating wounds present on patients undergoing acute or
chronic care, as well as other severe wounds that are not readily susceptible to healing without
application of reduced pressure. Instillation of a fluid to a wound may further aid in healing of a
wound. Instillation may include the slow introduction of a solution to the wound, for example. The
solution may be used to provide moisture to the wound, to provide warmth or cold to the wound, to
provide a drug to the wound, or to provide another substance to the wound. Often, each type of
instillation therapy may require a different type of instillation fluid to achieve a desired effect. For
example, a first type of fluid may provide moisture to the wound. A different type of fluid may
supply a drug to the wound. Many times, the need for different fluid types to treat the wound may
make instillation therapy time consuming to administer.
[0069]      Some patients may experience improved outcomes with a combined treatment that
includes using both reduced-pressure therapy and instillation therapy. Existing therapy systems
that provide instillation or irrigation of a tissue site as well as reduced-pressure therapy can be
complicated to use and setup. Multiple tubes, clamps, and interfaces may often be needed to
properly apply both reduced pressure and fluid to the tissue site. For example, to set up a therapy
system having both reduced-pressure therapy and instillation therapy, components for both
systems may be placed proximate to a patient. The reduced-pressure therapy portion may need
at least one tube set extending from the tissue site to the therapy system. In addition, floor space
near the patient may be taken up by a separate collection container that may also require a
separate tube set extending between the tissue site and/or the therapy device.
[0070]      The instillation therapy system may need at least one intravenous pole to be placed
near the patient. Another intravenous pole may be needed to support additional therapy devices.
At least one, and often multiple, intravenous bags may be hung from the intravenous pole. Each

                                                     - 16
bag hung from the intravenous pole may contain a different type of instillation fluid to apply a
particular type of instillation fluid to the tissue site to achieve a desired effect. Each bag may need
a separate tube set leading from the bag to the therapy device and from the therapy device to the
tissue site. Each bag may also need clamps and valves for each tube set. As multiple bags, tube
sets, clamps, and valves are added to the therapy system, the complexity increases.                   The
increased complexity increases set up time for a caregiver and increases the likelihood that the
caregiver administering therapy may incorrectly administer therapy.
[0071]     As disclosed herein, the therapy system 100 can overcome these shortcomings and
others by providing a combined solution pump and solution storage system.                 In addition, the
therapy device 104 may place all components pertinent to the volumetric delivery of fluid into a
single disposable assembly. The disposable assembly may interface with the therapy device 104
automatically if the disposable assembly engages the therapy device 104.
[0072]     Figure 2 is a perspective view of the therapy device 104 illustrating details that may be
associated with some embodiments. The therapy device 104 may have a base member, such as
a body 116, a user interface panel, such as a panel 118, and a pole support, such as a support
120.   The body 116 may be a housing, container, or other member configured to enclose
components of the therapy device 104. In some embodiments, the body 116 may have an interior
space into which pumps, tube, valves, electronics, controllers, regulators, metering devices, or
sensors, for example, may be contained. The devices may be similar to and operate as described
above to provide reduced-pressure therapy and/or instillation therapy. The body 116 may also
include a handle 115. The handle 115 may be a portion of the body 116 configured to permit a
caregiver to grip and carry the therapy device 104.
[0073]     In some embodiments, the therapy device 104 may include the cartridge 114 and the
container 112. Both the container 112 and the cartridge 114 may insert into the therapy device
104. In some embodiments, the container 112 and the cartridge 114 may placede into a front
portion of the therapy device 104.         As shown in Figure 2, the therapy device 104 may include a
tube 107 and a coupling 123. The tube 107 may protrude from a front of the therapy device 104
proximate to the cartridge 114. The coupling 123 may be fluidly coupled to the tube 107.
[0074]     Figure 3 is a side view of the therapy device 104 illustrating additional details that may
be associated with some embodiments.               The support 120 may be a device configured for

                                                  - 17
mounting of the therapy device 104 to a support, intravenous pole, or other device.           In some
embodiments, the support 120 may be configured to mount to an intravenous pole, such as a pole
119, for example. The support 120 may include a clamping device 121.           In some embodiments,
the clamping device 121 may be a threaded bolt having a handle. The bolt may be screwed into
the support 120 so that an end of the threaded bolt of the clamping device 121 may be pressed
against the pole 119. The clamping device 121 may compress the pole 119 against the support
120, preventing the support 120, and the therapy device 104, from moving relative to the pole 119.
In other embodiments, the support 120 may include other devices to secure the therapy device
104 to the pole 119, such as latching mechanisms, tying mechanisms, or fusing mechanisms, for
example.
[0075]     Figure 4 is a perspective view of the therapy device 104 illustrating additional details that
may be associated with some embodiments. As shown, the cartridge 114 has been removed from
the therapy device 104. In some embodiments, the therapy device 104 may include a cartridge
receptacle 122. The cartridge receptacle 122 may be a cavity or other recessed portion of the
therapy device 104. The cartridge receptacle 122 may be extend into the body 116 from a front of
the body 116. In some embodiments, the cartridge receptacle 122 may have at least a bottom
surface 127, a rear surface 131, and a side surface 133.          In some embodiments, the bottom
surface 127, the rear surface 131, and the side surface 133 are perpendicular to each other. In
some embodiments, the cartridge receptacle 122 may be configured to receive the cartridge 114.
For example, the cartridge receptacle 122 may have a size and shape so that the cartridge 114
may at least partially fit within the cartridge receptacle 122. In some embodiments, the cartridge
114 and the cartridge receptacle 122 may be sized so that if the cartridge 114 is inserted into the
cartridge receptacle 122, an exterior surface of the cartridge 114 may be flush with an exterior of
the therapy device 104 as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.
[0076]     Referring to Figure 4, in some embodiments, a key 124 may be positioned within the
cartridge receptacle 122 on the side surface 133. In some embodiments, the key 124 may be
disposed near a center of a height of the side surface 133. The key 124 may have a length equal
to the length of the side surface 133 so that the key 124 extends from the front of the therapy
device 104 to the rear surface 131.      In some embodiments, the key 124 may protrude from the
side surface 133 of the cartridge receptacle 122. In some embodiments, the key 124 may also
include an opening 126. The opening 126 may be configured to receive a mating component of
the cartridge 114, such as a latch, for example.       In other embodiments, the mating component

                                                 - 18
may be a tube component, a venting component, a sensing component, or a pump component, for
example.
[0077]     In some embodiments, a pump head 128 may be positioned within the cartridge
receptacle 122. The pump head 128 may be positioned on the side surface 133 between the
bottom surface 127 and the key 124. In some embodiments, the pump head 128 may be rotary
delivery pump head having a rotor with one or more rollers 129. As described above, the rollers
129 may be configured to engage a tube segment to move fluid through the tube segment using
peristalsis. The pump head 128 may be coupled to operating components disposed within the
body 116 of the therapy device 104.        In some embodiments, the operating components may
include motors, linking devices, or power sources, for example. The pump head 128 and the
associated operating components may be disposed within the body 116 of the therapy device 104
and may be operatively or communicatively coupled to the panel 118. In some embodiments, the
panel 118 may be manipulated by a caregiver to activate the pump head 128, causing the pump
head 128 to rotate in a plane parallel to the side surface 133. As described above, rotation of the
pump head 128 may move instillation solution from the cartridge 114 to the tissue site.
[0078]     Figure 5 is a perspective view of the cartridge 114 illustrating additional details that may
be associated with some embodiments. Figure 6 is a side elevation of the cartridge 114 in Figure
5. The cartridge 114 may include a keyway 113. The keyway 113 may be a recessed portion of
the cartridge 114. In some embodiments, the keyway 113 may be a slot or channel having a
shape configured to receive the key 124 of the cartridge receptacle 122. In some embodiments,
the keyway 113 may have a pentagonal shape to match the key 124.               The keyway 113 may
extend from a front 109 of the cartridge 114 to a back 111 of the cartridge 114.
[0079]     The cartridge 114 may also include a tube housing 117. The tube housing 117 may be
a recessed portion of the cartridge 114 extending from the back 111 of the cartridge 114 toward
the front 109 of the cartridge 111. The tube housing 117 may be a generally rectangularly-shaped
recess having a rounded end proximate to the front 109 of the cartridge 114. The rounded end of
the tube housing 117 may be shaped to accommodate the tube 107. The tube 107 may have an
end 105 fluidly coupled to an interior of the cartridge 114. The tube 107 may also have an elbow
103. In some embodiments, the elbow 103 may be a U-shaped elbow. In some embodiments,
the tube housing 117 may be sized to receive the pump head 128. If the cartridge 114 is inserted
into the cartridge receptacle 122, the pump head 128 may engage the tube 107 and be operable

                                                  - 19
to compress the tube 107 against the tube housing 117 for peristaltic movement of fluid through
the tube 107.
[0080]     In some embodiments, the cartridge 114 may also include a tube channel 134. The
tube channel 134 may be another recessed portion of the cartridge 114 that may be positioned
between the tube housing 117 and a bottom of the cartridge 114. In some embodiments, the tube
channel 134 may extend from the front 109 of the cartridge 114 to the back 111 of the cartridge
114. The tube channel 134 may be configured to accommodate at least a portion of a tube, such
as the tube 107. In some embodiments, the elbow 103 may turn the tube 107 so that the tube 107
can be routed from the tube housing 117 to the tube channel 134 and protrude from the front 109
of the cartridge 114. In some embodiments, the tube 107 may be fluidly coupled to a union, such
as the coupling 123, for example. The coupling 123 may be a device configured to fluidly couple
the tube 107 to the tissue site. For example, the coupling 123 may be configured to be fluidly
coupled to a tube that is fluidly coupled to the tissue site.
[0081]     In operation, the cartridge 114 may be inserted into the therapy device 104.     If the
cartridge 114 is inserted into the cartridge receptacle 122, the key 124 and the keyway 113 may
be aligned so that the key 124 may insert into the keyway 113. Alignment of the key 124 and the
keyway 113 may align the tube housing 117 and the pump head 128. The pump head 128 may
engage the tube 107 if the cartridge 114 is fully seated in the cartridge receptacle 122 of the
therapy device 104. Operation of the pump head 128 may move fluid through the tube 107 from
an interior of the cartridge 114 through the coupling 123.
[0082]     Figure 7 is an elevation view of a cartridge 214 illustrating details that may be
associated with some embodiments. The cartridge 214 may be configured to engage a therapy
device, for example a therapy device 204. In some embodiments, the therapy device 204 may be
similar to and include the components of the therapy device 104. The therapy device 204 may be
configured to receive the cartridge 214. For example, the therapy device 204 may include a ledge
232 configured to support the cartridge 214 and one or more retainers 234 configured to limit
lateral motion of the cartridge 214. In some embodiments, the cartridge 214 may include a fluid
container 215 and a carrier 216. Generally, the fluid container 215 may interface with the carrier
216. The carrier 216 may interface with the therapy device 204 to secure the fluid container 215
to the therapy device 204 to provide instillation therapy. In some embodiments, the carrier 216

                                                  - 20
may be an integral component of the therapy device 204. In other embodiments, the carrier 216
may be an independent component of the therapy device 204.
[0083]      Figure 8 is a perspective view of the cartridge 214 illustrating additional details that may
be associated with some embodiments. In some embodiments, the fluid container 215 may be a
container configured to receive and store a fluid, such as an instillation fluid.               In some
embodiments, the fluid container 215 may be a refillable bottle or other device.                In some
embodiments, the fluid container 215 may be a pre-manufactured fluid container configured to
engage the carrier 216. The fluid container 215 may have an open end and a closed end (not
shown) opposite the open end. The open end of the fluid container 215 may be configured to
receive a cap, coupling, or other similar device.      In some embodiments, the fluid container 215
may have a port 218 coupled to the open end of the fluid container 215. The port 218 may be a
device coupled to the open end of the fluid container 215 and configured to be selectively opened.
In some embodiments, the port 218 may include a seal, such as a seal 217. The seal 217 may be
a device configured to seal the fluid container 215 to another device or component. The seal 217
may be formed of a material, such as a rubber or other material configured to prevent fluid flow
across the seal 217.        In some embodiments, the seal 217 may be an O-ring.                 In some
embodiments, the seal 217 may be separated from an end of the port 218. In other embodiments,
the seal 217 may be proximate to an end of the port 218.
[0084]      The carrier 216 may include a base housing 220 and a tube housing 226. The base
housing 220 may be a rectangular body having a receptacle 222 and a venting spike 224
disposed in the receptacle 222. The receptacle 222 may be a recess disposed in a center of the
base housing 220 that extends from a top of the base housing 220 toward a bottom of the base
housing 220.       In the illustrated embodiment, the receptacle 222 is cylindrical.             In other
embodiments, the receptacle 222 may have other sizes and shapes. Generally, the receptacle
222 may have a size, shape, and depth configured to mate with the port 218 so that the port 218
fits within the receptacle 222. The seal 217 may be configured to seal to the receptacle 222 if the
port 218 is disposed in the receptacle 222.     In other embodiments, the receptacle 222 may have
a size, shape, and depth such that non-specific ports of other fluid containers may be inserted into
the receptacle 222 to engage with the base housing 220 of the carrier 216.
[0085]      In some embodiments, the tube housing 226 may couple to the base housing 220. The
tube housing 226 may be a C-channel shaped piece coupled to a side of the base housing 220.

                                                - 21
In some embodiments, the tube housing 226 may form a wall perpendicular to the base housing
220 that extends upward beyond the surface of the base housing 220 in which the receptacle 222
is formed. An inner portion of the tube housing 226 may face away from the base housing 220.
An upper end of the tube housing 226 may form an archway 211 between two sidewalls 213 of the
channel-shaped piece. The inner portion may be disposed between the archway 211 and the two
sidewalls 213 of the channel-shaped piece. In some embodiments, the tube housing 226 may
have an open end opposite the archway 211.
[0086]     The inner portion of the tube housing 226 may be configured to receive a tube 228. The
tube 228 may have a first end and a second end opposite the first end. The ends of the tube 228
may be proximate to the open end of the tube housing 226. In some embodiments, the tube 228
may conform to the archway 211 of the tube housing 226. In some embodiments, the tube 228
may be in contact with the two sidewalls 213 and the archway 211 of the tube housing 226 along
a length of the tube 228. The tube 228 may be coupled to the base housing 220 via elbow
couplings 230. The elbow couplings 230 may be in fluid communication with the receptacle 222
or venting spike 224 and the tissue site.
[0087]     Figure 9A is a sectional view of the carrier 216 illustrating additional details that may be
associated with some embodiments. As shown, an elbow 227 may be fluidly coupled to the elbow
coupling 230 and the tube 228. The elbow 227 may provide a fluid coupling for another tube (not
shown) that may be fluidly coupled to the tissue site. Fluid flowing from the fluid container 215
into the tube 228 in response to operation of the therapy device 204 may flow through the elbow
coupling 230, the elbow 227, and to the tissue site.
[0088]     Figure 9B is another sectional view of the carrier 216 illustrating additional details that
may be associated with some embodiments. Figure 9B may be a reverse sectional view of the
carrier 216 of Figure 9A. The base housing 220 may include a coupling cavity 229 extending into
the base housing 220 from a surface opposite the receptacle 222. In some embodiments, the
coupling cavity 229 may have a major dimension, such as a diameter, that is greater than a major
dimension of the receptacle 222.      In some embodiments, the receptacle 222 and the coupling
cavity 229 may be coaxial.
[0089]     In some embodiments, the venting spike 224 may be disposed within the receptacle
222. The venting spike 224 may extend outwardly from an inner surface of the receptacle 222. In

                                                  - 22
some embodiments, the venting spike 224 may have a wider portion where the venting spike 224
joins a surface of the receptacle 222 and tapers to a narrower portion at a distal end of the venting
spike 224. The venting spike 224 may be configured to penetrate the port 218 if the port 218 of
the fluid container 215 is inserted into the receptacle 222. For example, if the fluid container 215
 is inverted and fitted into the receptacle 222 of the base housing 220, and the base housing 220 is
secured to the therapy device 204, the venting spike 224 may breach the port 218.                In some
embodiments, the venting spike 224 may have a conduit 223. The conduit 223 may be in fluid
communication with the coupling cavity 229. In some embodiments, the receptacle 222 may have
a fluid passage 231 in fluid communication with an elbow 233. The elbow 233 may be fluidly
coupled to the coupling 230 so that the elbow 233 is in fluid communication with the tube 228. In
operation, the port 218 may be fitted into the receptacle 222 so that the venting spike 224
 breaches into the port 218, and the conduit 223 may permit the flow of ambient air pressure into
the fluid container 215. The venting spike 224 may form fluid paths in the port 218 adjacent to the
venting spike 224.      Fluid may flow from the fluid container 215 through the port 218 into the
 receptacle 222 around the venting spike 224. The fluid may flow through the fluid passage 231
 into the elbow 233 and the tube 228 in response to operation of the therapy device 204. Ambient
air pressure may flow through the conduit 223 into the fluid container 215 to prevent formation of a
vacuum in the fluid container 215 during operation of the therapy device 204.
 [0090]     Figure 9C is a sectional view of the carrier 216 illustrating additional details that may be
associated with other embodiments. In other embodiments, the conduit 223 of the venting spike
224 may be fluidly coupled to an elbow 225. The elbow 225 may be fluidly coupled to the elbow
coupling 230 so that the elbow 225 may be in fluid communication with the tube 228. Operation of
the therapy device 204 may move fluid from the fluid container 215 through the conduit 223 of the
venting spike 224, through the elbow 225 and the elbow coupling 230 and into the tube 228. In
still other embodiments, the venting spike 224 may include multiple lumens to allow for both
venting of the fluid container 215 and flow of the solution in the fluid container 215 into the therapy
device 204.
 [0091]     Figure 9D is a plan view of the port 218 illustrating additional details that may be
associated with some embodiments. The port 218 may include a channel 219. The channel 219
 may be an area of the port 218 configured to be breached by the venting spike 224. In some
embodiments, the channel 219 may include tear lines 221. The tear lines 221 may be portions of

                                                 - 23
the port 218 configured to open for flow of fluid if the venting spike 224 punctures the channel 219.
In some embodiments, the tear lines 221 may be perforations in the port 218.
[0092]     Figure 10 is a side elevation view of the therapy device 204 illustrating additional details
that may be associated with some embodiments. As shown, the cartridge 214 has been removed
from the therapy device 204.       In some embodiments, the therapy device 204 may include a
cartridge receptacle and a pump head. The cartridge receptacle may be formed by a ledge 232
and retainers 234. The ledge 232 may be a portion of the therapy device 204 extending away
from the therapy device 204. The ledge 232 may provide a location onto which at least a portion
of the cartridge 214 may be rested while the cartridge 214 is engaged with the therapy device 204.
The retainers 234 may be elongated portions of the therapy device 204 that protrude from
opposite sides of the therapy device 204.        The retainers 234 may limit lateral motion of the
cartridge 214 if the cartridge 214 is engaged with the therapy device 204. The pump head 236
may be a rotary-delivery pump head similar to the pump head 128 described above. The pump
head 236 may include rollers or lobes 238 that may be configured to engage the tube 228 if the
cartridge 214 is engaged with the therapy device 204. The pump head 236 may be positioned
relative to the ledge 232 so that if the cartridge 214 is engaged with the therapy device 204, the
pump head 236 and the lobes 238 engage the tube 228. In operation, the pump head 236 may be
rotated, causing fluid to flow from the venting spike 224 or the receptacle 222 through the tube
228 and to the tissue site.
[0093]     Figure 11 is an exploded view of a cartridge 314 illustrating details that may be
associated with some embodiments. The cartridge 314 may include a body 316 and a lid 318.
The body 316 may be a rigid member having a rectangular shape as shown.                       In other
embodiments, the body 316 may not be rigid and may have other shapes, such as triangular,
circular, or amorphous shapes. In some embodiments, the body 316 may have a back 317 and
walls 319. The body 316 may have a fluid reservoir 320 formed by the back 317 and the walls
319. The lid 318 may enclose the fluid reservoir 320. In some embodiments, the fluid reservoir
320 may be configured to receive and store instillation solution or other fluid for use with a therapy
device, such as the therapy device 104 or the therapy device 204.
[0094]     The body 316 may include a port 322 in one of the walls 319 of the body 316. In some
embodiments, the port 322 may be a tubular body that mounts to one of the walls 319. The port
322 may have a central channel 323 that extends through the wall 319 so that the channel 323 is

                                                     - 24
in fluid communication with the fluid reservoir 320. A cap mount 324 may be coupled to the port
322. In some embodiments, the cap mount 324 may be a rim coupled to the port 322 to provide a
mounting surface for a cap 326. The cap 326 may be coupled to the cap mount 324 to prevent
fluid communication through the port 322. The cap 326 may be coupled to the cap mount 324
following the filling of the fluid reservoir 320.         In some embodiments, the cap 326 may be
threaded, secured with adhesive, or otherwise latched to the cap mount 324.                      In some
embodiments, the cap 326 may be a heat seal. A heat seal may be a cap welded to the cap
mount 324 following filling of the fluid reservoir 320. The port 322, the cap mount 324, and the
cap 326 may allow a manufacturer or pharmacist to fill the fluid reservoir 320 and then seal the
fluid reservoir 320 for transport.
[0095]     The lid 318 may be configured to mount and seal to the body 316 to form the fluid
reservoir 320. The lid 318 may include a port 328. The port 328 may be a tubular body extending
into the fluid reservoir 320 if the lid 318 is mounted to the body 316. The port 328 may include a
channel 329 in fluid communication with the fluid reservoir 320. In some embodiments, a vent cap
330 may be coupled to the port 328.             In some embodiments, a therapy device, such as the
therapy device 104 or the therapy device 204, may include a venting spike 332. The vent cap 330
may block fluid flow through the port 328 until the cartridge 314 is engaged with a therapy device.
[0096]     The lid 318 may also include a latch 336. The latch 336 may be disposed on the lid 318
so that the latch 336 is on an opposite side of the lid 318 from the fluid reservoir 320. The latch
336 may be configured to mate with a corresponding component on a therapy device, such as the
key 124 of the therapy device 104, for example. If the latch 336 mates with the corresponding
component of a therapy device, the latch 336 secures the cartridge 314 to the therapy device. In
this manner, the cartridge 314 may be securely positioned on a therapy device while the therapy
device instills an instillation solution or fluid from the fluid reservoir 320 to a tissue site.
[0097]      In some embodiments, a tube assembly 338 may be coupled to the lid 318. The tube
assembly 338 may include a first mount 340, a second mount 342, and a tube 344. The first
mount 340 may be coupled to the lid 318 and include one or more channels providing a fluid path
through the lid 318.       If the lid 318 is mounted to the body 316, the channels may be in fluid
communication with the fluid reservoir 320. A first barb 348 may be coupled to the first mount
340. The first barb 348 may be a tubular body having a channel in fluid communication with the
channels of the first mount 340. The tube 344 may be a flexible tube having at least one lumen.

                                                 - 25
The first barb 348 may be configured to be inserted into a first end of the tube 344 so that the tube
344 may be fluidly coupled to the first mount 340. A retaining collar 346 may be mounted on the
tube 344. The retaining collar 346 may be placed over the portion of the tube 344 into which the
first barb 348 was inserted. If the first barb 348 is inserted into the first end of the tube 344, the
first end of the tube 344 may be expanded to accommodate the first barb 348.               Thus, if the
retaining collar 346 is placed over the portion of the tube 344 into which the first barb 348 was
inserted, the retaining collar 346 may exert a frictional force on the tube 344 clamping the tube
344 to the first barb 348.
[0098]     In some embodiments, the second mount 342 may be coupled to the lid 318 and include
one or more channels providing a fluid path through the lid 318. If the lid 318 is mounted to the
body 316, the channels may be in fluid communication with the fluid reservoir 320. A second barb
350 may be coupled to the second mount 342. The second barb 350 may be a tubular body
having a channel in fluid communication with the channels of the second mount 342. The second
barb 350 may be configured to be inserted into a second end of the tube 344 so that the tube 344
may be fluidly coupled to the second mount 342. A retaining collar 347 may be mounted on the
tube 344. The retaining collar 347 may be placed over the portion of the tube 344 into which the
second barb 350 was inserted. If the second barb 350 is inserted into the second end of the tube
344, the second end of the tube 344 may be expanded to accommodate the second barb 350.
Thus, if the retaining collar 347 is placed over the portion of the tube 344 into which the second
barb 350 was inserted, the retaining collar 347 may exert a frictional force on the tube 344
clamping the tube 344 to the second barb 350.
[0099]     The tube 344 may arc between the first mount 340 and the second mount 342 so that a
pump head, such as the pump head 128 of the therapy device 104, may be disposed under the
tube 344 to engage the tube 344.        If actuated by a therapy device, the pump head 128 may
engage in peristalsis as described above to move fluid from the fluid reservoir 320 through the first
mount 340, the tube 344, and the second mount 342 for fluid communication with a tissue site.
[00100]    The second mount 342 may also include a valve connector 352. The valve connector
352 may be in fluid communication with the second mount 342 and the tube 344 through the
second barb 350. The valve connector 352 may be configured to receive a tube that is in fluid
communication with the tissue site. In some embodiments, the valve connector 352 may include a
valve member that is positionable to selectively block fluid flow through the valve connector 352.

                                                - 26
In some embodiments, the valve connector 352 may be a check valve configured to permit fluid
flow out of the second mount 342 and block fluid flow through the valve connector 352 into the
second mount 342.
[00101]      The second mount 342 may also include a pressure diaphragm 354 coupled to an
outward facing portion of the second mount 342. The pressure diaphragm 354 may be a device
configured to engage a corresponding sensor on a therapy device. The pressure diaphragm 354
may communicate a pressure in the second mount 342 to a therapy device.                    In some
embodiments, a therapy device may receive a pressure signal from the pressure diaphragm 354
and, in response, adjust therapy.
[00102]      Figure 12 is a sectional view of the venting spike 332 and the port 328 illustrating
additional details that may be associated with some embodiments. The venting spike 332 may
have a conical portion 333 and a base portion 335. The conical portion 333 may have a central
channel 337 extending through the conical portion 333. The conical portion 333 may be coupled
to the base portion 335. The conical portion 333 may have a wider portion adjacent to the base
portion 335. The conical portion 333 may taper from the base portion 335 to a distal end. The
conical portion 333 may be configured to penetrate the vent cap 330 if the vent cap 330 of the lid
318 is placed proximate to the venting spike 332, for example, if the cartridge 314 is engaged with
a therapy device.
[00103]      The base portion 335 may be a generally tubular body having a central channel having a
filter 334 disposed within the channel. The filter 334 and the central channel 337 may be in fluid
communication so that fluid may flow through the venting spike 332. The base portion 335 may
include a first flange 339 and a second flange 341.        The first flange 339 may be conical and
extend away from the venting spike 332. The first flange 339 may be coupled to the venting spike
332 adjacent to a base of the conical portion 333. The second flange 341 may be coupled to a
center of the base portion 335. The second flange 341 may have a conical surface proximate to
the first flange 339 and a planar surface opposite the first flange 339.
[00104]      In some embodiments, the port 328 may include one or more detents. For example, the
port 328 may include a first detent 343, and a second detent 345. The first detent 343 may be an
annular member disposed on an interior surface of the port 328 proximate to the vent cap 330.

                                                 - 27
The second detent 345 may also be an annular member disposed on the interior surface of the
port 328 between the first detent 343 and an end of the port 328 opposite the vent cap 330.
[00105]     Figure 13 is a sectional view of the port 328 and the venting spike 332 illustrating
additional details that may be associated with some embodiments. As shown in Figure 13, the
first flange 339 and the second flange 341 may be configured to engage with the first detent 343
and the second detent 345 if the venting spike 332 is inserted into the port 328.             In some
embodiments, the conical portion 333 may pierce the vent cap 330, allowing fluid communication
across the vent cap 330 through the venting spike 332. In some embodiments, the venting spike
332 may serve as a pathway for flow of ambient air pressure into the fluid reservoir 320 to prevent
formation of a vacuum in the fluid reservoir 320 during operation of the therapy device.
[00106]     Figure 14 is a plan view of the vent cap 330 illustrating additional details that may be
associated with some embodiments. The vent cap 330 may include a channel 331.                 In some
embodiments, the channel 331 may form a cross extending parallel to respective diameters of the
vent cap 330. The channel 331 may be aligned with the venting spike 332 if the venting spike 332
is disposed within the port 328. The channel 331 may be a portion of the vent cap 330 that is
more susceptible to penetration than remaining portions of the vent cap 330.                 In some
embodiments, the channel 331 may be a portion of the vent cap 330 having a thickness that is
less than a thickness of the remainder of the vent cap 330. In other embodiments, the channel
331 may be a portion of the vent cap 330 that has been treated to make the channel 331 more
susceptible to penetration compared to the remaining portions of the vent cap 330.
[00107]     Figure 15 is a side elevation view of a therapy device 304 illustrating additional details
that may be associated with some embodiments. As shown in Figure 15, the venting spike 332
may be coupled to the therapy device 304. In some embodiments, the venting spike 332 may be
positioned on the therapy device 304 so that if the cartridge 314 is engaged with the therapy
device 304, the venting spike 332 may engage the port 328. The therapy device 304 may also
include a striker 370.      The therapy device 304 may also include a recessed portion 372
surrounding the striker 370. In some embodiments, the recessed portion 372 may be configured
to receive at least a portion of the latch 336, so that the latch 336 and the striker 370 may engage
one another if the cartridge 314 is engaged with the therapy device 304.

                                                 -28
[00108]    The therapy device 304 may also include a pump head 374 having one or more lobes
376. The pump head 374 may be similar to and operate as described above with respect to the
pump head 128, and the pump head 236. Similarly, the lobes 376 may be similar to and operate
as described above with respect to the rollers 129 and the lobes 238. In some embodiments, the
pump head 374 may be positioned on the therapy device 304 so that the pump head 374 may
engage the tube 344 if the cartridge 314 is engaged to the therapy device 304. The therapy
device 304 may also include a pressure sensor 378. The pressure sensor 378 may be a sensor
configured to engage the pressure diaphragm 354 to determine a pressure in the second mount
342. In some embodiments, the therapy device 304 may include a sensor 380 and a sensor 382.
The sensor 380 and the sensor 382 may be positioned on the therapy device 304 to communicate
with optional sensors that may be included on the cartridge 314 .
[00109]    Figure 16 is an exploded view of a lid 418 illustrating details that may be associated with
some embodiments of the cartridge 314 of Figure 11. The lid 418 is similar to the lid 318 and may
include the components thereof, modified as described below. The lid 418 may include a port 428
similar to the port 328. The port 428 may operate in a manner similar to the port 328. In some
embodiments, the port 428 may be configured to receive the venting spike 332 as described
above.
[00110]    The lid 418 may also have a tube assembly 438. The tube assembly 438 may include a
tube 450 and a plurality of couplings 440. The tube 450 may have a first end configured to pass
through an aperture 452 formed in the lid 418. In some embodiments, the aperture 452 may be
positioned on an end of the lid 418 proximate to the port 428. In some embodiments, the aperture
452 may be disposed in a recessed portion of the end of the lid 418. In some embodiments, the
aperture 452 may be sized to accommodate the tube 450 while providing a seal to the tube 450.
In some embodiments, the tube 450 may be in fluid communication with the fluid reservoir 320
through the aperture 452 in the lid 418. The tube 450 may include a segment (not shown) that
extends from the aperture 452 to an end of the lid 418 that is opposite the aperture 452 so that an
end of the tube 450 may be located proximate to a bottom of the fluid reservoir 320. The tube 450
may be have a lining of polyethylene. Lining the tube 450 with polyethylene may reduce reactions
with fluid stored in the fluid reservoir 320. In some embodiments, additional tubes may be lined
with polyethylene.

                                                - 29
[00111]    The tube assembly 438 may also include a tube 444, an ultra-sonic inspection segment
446, a load cell segment 448, and a tube 454. In some embodiments, the tube 450 is fluidly
coupled to the load cell segment 448 with a coupling 440 so that fluid in the tube 450 may flow
into the load cell segment 448.      A load cell, such as the load cell segment 448, may be a
transducer that converts a force into an electrical signal. A force applied through a load cell may
deform a strain gauge, changing the electrical resistance of the strain gauge which may be
interpreted by a controller or other device as an amount of force applied. In some embodiments,
the load cell segment 448 may be configured to communicate with a corresponding sensor on a
therapy device.      For example, in some embodiments, the load cell segment 448 may
communicate with the sensor 380 or the sensor 382 of the therapy device 304.                In some
embodiments, the load cell segment 448 may be configured to communicate with the sensor 380
if the cartridge 314, having the lid 418, is engaged with the therapy device 304.      If fluid flows
through the load cell segment 448, the fluid may exert a force on the load cell segment 448 that
may generate a corresponding signal in the sensor 380. In this manner, the therapy device 304
may determine if there is fluid in the fluid reservoir 320.    In some embodiments, the load cell
segment 448 may also detect occlusion situations (blockages).
[00112]    The load cell segment 448 may be fluidly coupled to the tube 444 through another
coupling 440. In some embodiments, the coupling 440 may be an elbow coupling, such as the
coupling 440 between the load cell segment 448 and the tube 444. The tube 444 may be fluidly
coupled to the ultra-sonic inspection segment 446 with yet another coupling 440. The tube 444
may be positioned to form an arc so that the tube 444 may receive a pump head, such as the
pump head 374 of the therapy device 304. If actuated by a therapy device 304, the pump head
374 may engage in peristalsis to move fluid from the fluid reservoir 320 through the tube 444 for
fluid communication with a tissue site as described above.
[00113]    In some embodiments, the ultra-sonic inspection segment 446 may be a device
configured to use ultrasound to monitor the fluid reservoir 320.         The ultra-sonic inspection
segment 446 may be configured to communicate with a therapy device, such as the therapy
device 304.    For example, if the cartridge 314 having the lid 418 is engaged with the therapy
device 304, the ultra-sonic inspection segment 446 may be in communication with the sensor 382.
The ultra-sonic inspection segment 446 may also detect occlusion situations (blockages).

                                                 - 30
[00114]    The ultra-sonic inspection segment 446 may be fluidly coupled to another tube 454 with
another coupling 440. The tube 454 may have a coupling on an end of the tube 454 opposite the
ultra-sonic inspection segment 446. In this manner, the tube 454 may be used to fluidly couple
the cartridge 314 having the lid 418 to a dressing and a tissue site.
[00115]    The lid 418 includes a recess 456 molded into the lid 418. The recess 456 may be
shaped to accommodate the connection of the tube assembly 438 so that the tube assembly 438
is flush with, or at least partially recessed from an exterior surface of the lid 418. A portion of
recess 456 may be sized to receive a pump head, such as the pump head 374 of the therapy
device 304 so that the exterior surface of the lid 418 is flush with the therapy device if the cartridge
314 is engaged with the therapy device 304.
[00116]    Figure 17 is an elevation of another example embodiment of a cartridge 514 that may be
used with a therapy device, such as the therapy device 104, the therapy device 204, or the
therapy device 304, modified as described below. The cartridge 514 may be similar in many
respects to the cartridge 114, the cartridge 214, and the cartridge 314. The cartridge 514 may
include a shell 516. In some embodiments, the shell 516 is at least partially ovoid-shaped having
a rounded end and a flattened end opposite the rounded end. In some embodiments, the rounded
end is a lower end configured to engage a portion of a therapy device to at least partially secure
the cartridge 514 to the therapy device.       The shell 516 also may include notches 521.           The
notches 521 may be molded recesses formed in a portion of the shell 516 proximate to the
flattened end. The notches 521 may provide a handle portion configured to allow a person to grip
the cartridge 514 for engagement and disengagement with a therapy device.
[00117]    In some embodiments, the shell 516 may include an aperture 517 through the flattened
end of the shell 516. The aperture 517 can provide fluid communication between an exterior of
the cartridge 514 and an interior of the cartridge 514. The cartridge 514 may also include a port
522.    In some illustrative embodiments, a filter may be disposed in the port 522 to prevent
bacteria, viruses, and other undesirable materials from entering the cartridge 514.
[00118]    In some embodiments, the cartridge 514 also has a tube assembly 538, which may be
similar to the tube assembly 338 or the tube assembly 438. The tube assembly 538 may include
suitable connectors, such as an elbow 540, and a tube 544. In some embodiments, the tube
assembly 538 may be fluidly coupled to a conduit 508, which may be adapted for coupling to a

                                                 -31
dressing. As illustrated, the tube 544 may extend across a raceway 546. The tube assembly 538
is configured to engage a pump head of a therapy device, so that the pump head may cause
instillation solution disposed within the cartridge 514 to flow through the tube assembly 538 and
the conduit 508 to a tissue site as described above.
[00119]     Figure 18 is an elevation of a second side of the cartridge 514 illustrating additional
details that may be associated with some embodiments. In some embodiments, the raceway 546
may be a cavity in the shell 516 adapted to receive a circumferential edge of a rotary-delivery
pump head (not shown). In some embodiments, the raceway 546 may be a portion of a mount
545. The mount 545 may be a device coupled to the shell 516 and configured to position the tube
assembly 538 to receive a pump head. The mount 545 may also include a latch 506. The latch
506 may be positioned adjacent to the flattened end of the shell 516. The latch 506 may be
configured to engage a portion of a therapy device to secure the cartridge 514 to the therapy
device.
[00120]     Figure 19 is a cross-sectional view of the cartridge 514 illustrating additional details that
may be associated with some embodiments. The shell 516 may form a fluid reservoir 520, similar
to the fluid reservoir of the cartridge 114, the fluid container 215, and the fluid reservoir 320. In
some embodiments, the shell 516 may include mounting locations 523 configured to receive
fasteners 527 to secure the shell 516 to the mount 545. The fasteners 527 may seal to the shell
516 to prevent leakage of fluid through the mounting locations 523.
[00121]     The cartridge 514 may be positioned to engage with and interact with a pump head.
The raceway 546 may be a semicircular cavity, and tube 544 may be suspended across the
cavity. In more particular embodiments, the raceway 546 may be a cavity with an arc of about 180
degrees. For example, the tube 544 and the raceway 546 may be aligned with and disposed on a
circumferential edge of a rotary-delivery pump head. Thus, the tube 544 is disposed between
raceway 546 and the edge of a pump head. The tube 544 may be stretched and pressed into and
against raceway 546 by a pump head.
[00122]     In some embodiments, the latch 506 may be a spring loaded mechanism configured to
engage a mating component of a therapy device.           In some embodiments, the latch 506 may
include buttoning mechanisms, threaded mechanisms, clip mechanisms, or friction engagement
mechanisms, for example. In some embodiments, the latch 506 may be disposed on the cartridge

                                                - 32
514 and engage a mating element, such as a notch, clip, or threaded coupler, for example, on a
therapy device.
[00123]    Figure 20 is a side elevation of a therapy device 504 illustrating details that may be
associated with some embodiments. Figure 21 is a partial front elevation of the therapy device
504 illustrating additional details that may be associated with some embodiments. The therapy
device 504 may be similar to the therapy device 104, the therapy device 204, and the therapy
device 304, modified as described herein. The therapy device 504 may have outer dimensions
similar to the outer dimensions of the cartridge 514 proximate to the mount 545.           In some
embodiments, if the cartridge 514 is engaged with the therapy device 504, the edges of the
therapy device 504 may be flush with the edges of the cartridge 514. In some embodiments, the
therapy device 504 may include a recess 505. The recess 505 may have a shape configured to
receive the mount 545. In some embodiments, the recess 505 may include a counterpart to the
latch 506 proximate to a flattened end of the therapy device 504 that is configured to engage the
latch 506.
[00124]    In some embodiments, the therapy device 504 may also include a pump head 507
having one or more lobes 509. The pump head 507 may be similar to the pump head 128, the
pump head 236, and the pump head 374. In some embodiments, the pump head 507 may be
oriented perpendicular to a plane containing a side surface of the therapy device 504. In this
manner, the pump head 507 may protrude from the recess 505 of the therapy device 504.
[00125]    In operation, the therapy device 504 may rotate the pump head 507, and the lobes 509
attached to the external circumference of the pump head 507 may cyclically engage and
compress the tube 544. As the pump head 507 turns, the part of the tube 544 under compression
is occluded, which can force fluid through the tube 544. Additionally, as the tube 544 opens after a
lobe 509 passes, fluid may be drawn into the tube 544 from the fluid reservoir 520 through the port
522 and elbow 540. Thus, in the illustrative embodiment of Figures 17-21, fluid may be cyclically
drawn in from a bottom portion of the fluid reservoir 520 and pumped upwards through tube
assembly 538 to conduit 508.
[00126]    The systems and methods described herein may provide significant advantages, some
of which have already been mentioned. For example, the therapy system 100 minimizes usability
problems in clinical care settings by replacing hanging irrigation bags and bottles on intravenous

                                                 -33
poles.     The system provides the instillation solution via a solution cartridge that minimizes
intravenous bags and the confusion associated with the device placement and setup of the same.
Still further the system can decrease the amount of time required to setup and change canisters.
The system can also provide volumetric delivery of instillation solution (via a solution cartridge)
with a negative wound pressure therapy device. Specifically, the system allows for a rotary
delivery pump (located on the device) to engage a disposable cartridge that contains an instillation
solution.
