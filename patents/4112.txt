                                        Anti-FcRn Antibodies
   The entire disclosure in the complete specification of our Australian Patent Application No.
   2013298924 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present specification.
   The disclosure relates to antibodies specific to FcRn, formulations comprising the same, use
 5 of each in therapy, processes for expressing and optionally formulating said antibody, DNA
   encoding the antibodies and hosts comprising said DNA.
   FcRn is a non-covalent complex of membrane protein FcRn a chain and P2 microglobulin
   (p2M). In adult mammals FcRn plays a key role in maintaining serum antibody levels by
   acting as a receptor that binds and salvages antibodies of the IgG isotype. IgG molecules are
10 endocytosed by endothelial cells, and if they bind to FcRn, are recycled transcytosed out into,
   for example circulation. In contrast, IgG molecules that do not bind to FcRn enter the cells
   and are targeted to the lysosomal pathway where they are degraded. A variant IgGI in which
   His435 is mutated to alanine results in the selective loss of FcRn binding and a significantly
   reduced serum half-life (Firan et al. 2001, International Immunology 13:993).
15 It is hypothesised that FcRn is a potential therapeutic target for certain autoimmune disorders
   caused at least in part by autoantibodies. The current treatment for certain such disorders
   includes plasmapheresis. Sometimes the plasmapheresis is employed along with
   immunosuppressive therapy for long-term management of the disease. Plasma exchange
   offers the quickest short-term answer to removing harmful autoantibodies. However, it may
20 also be desirable to suppress the production of autoantibodies by the immune system for
   example by the use of medications such as prednisone, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine,
   mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab or a mixture of these.
   Examples of diseases that can be treated with plasmapheresis include: Guillain-Barr6
   syndrome; Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; Goodpasture's syndrome;
25 hyperviscosity syndromes; cryoglobulinemia; paraproteinemia; Waldenstr6m
   macroglobulinemia; myasthenia gravis; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
   (TTP)/hemolytic uremic syndrome; Wegener's granulomatosis; Lambert-Eaton Syndrome;
   antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS or APLS); microscopic polyangiitis; recurrent
   focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis in the transplanted kidney; HELLP syndrome;
30 PANDAS syndrome; Refsum disease; Behcet syndrome; HIV-related neuropathy; Graves'
                                                    1
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   disease in infants and neonates; pemphigus vulgaris; multiple sclerosis, rhabdomyolysis and
   alloimune diseases.
   Plasmapheresis is sometimes used as a rescue therapy for removal of Fc containing
   therapeutics, for example in emergencies to reduced serious side effects.
 5 Though plasmapheresis is helpful in certain medical conditions there are potential risks and
   complications associated with the therapy. Insertion of a rather large intravenous catheter can
   lead to bleeding, lung puncture (depending on the site of catheter insertion), and, if the
   catheter is left in too long, it can lead to infection and/or damage to the veins giving limited
   opportunity to repeat the procedure.
10 The procedure has further complications associated with it, for example when a patient's
   blood is outside of the body passing through the plasmapheresis instrument, the blood has a
   tendency to clot. To reduce this tendency, in one common protocol, citrate is infused while
   the blood is running through the circuit. Citrate binds to calcium in the blood, calcium being
   essential for blood to clot. Citrate is very effective in preventing blood from clotting;
15 however, its use can lead to life-threateningly low calcium levels. This can be detected using
   the Chvostek's sign or Trousseau's sign. To prevent this complication, calcium is infused
   intravenously while the patient is undergoing the plasmapheresis; in addition, calcium
   supplementation by mouth may also be given.
   Other complications of the procedure include: hypotension; potential exposure to blood
20 products, with risk of transfusion reactions or transfusion transmitted diseases, suppression of
   the patient's immune system and bleeding or hematoma from needle placement.
   Additionally facilities that provide plasmapheresis are limited and the procedure is very
   expensive.
   An alternative to plasmapheresis is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which is a blood
25 product containing pooled polyclonal IgG extracted from the plasma of over one thousand
   blood donors. The therapy is administered intravenously and lasts in the region of 2 weeks to
   3 months.
                                                       2
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   Complications of the IVIG treatment include headaches, dermatitis, viral infection from
   contamination of the therapeutic product, for example HIV or hepatitis, pulmonary edema,
   allergic reactions, acute renal failure, venous thrombosis and aseptic meningitis.
   Thus there is a significant unmet need for therapies for autoimmune disorders which are less
 5 invasive and which expose the patients to less medical complications.
   Thus there is a significant unmet need for therapies for immunological disorders and/or
   autoimmune disorders which are less invasive and which expose the patients to less medical
   complications.
   Accordingly agents that block or reduce the binding of IgG to FcRn may be useful in the
10 treatment or prevention of such autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Anti-FcRn
   antibodies have been described previously in W02009/131702, W02007/087289 and
   W02006/118772.
   However, there remains a need for improved anti-FcRn antibodies.
   It is to be understood that if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such reference does
15 not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common general
   knowledge in the art in Australia or any other country.
   Summary of the Disclosure
   Thus in one aspect there is provided an anti-FcRn antibody or binding fragment thereof
   comprising a heavy chain or heavy chain fragment having a variable region, wherein said
20 variable region comprises one, two or three CDRs independently selected from SEQ ID NO:
    1, SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 3, for example wherein CDR HI is SEQ ID NO: 1, CDR
   H2 is SEQ ID NO: 2 and CDR H3 is SEQ ID NO: 3.
   In another aspect there is provided an antibody or fragment comprising a sequence or
25 combinations of sequences as defined herein, for example a cognate pair variable region.
   The antibodies of the disclosure block binding of IgG to FcRn and are thought to be useful in
   reducing one or more biological functions of FcRn, including reducing half-life of circulating
   antibodies. This may be beneficial in that it allows the patient to more rapidly clear
   antibodies, such as autoantibodies.
                                                     3
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   Importantly the antibodies of the present invention are able to bind human FcRn at both pH6
   and pH7.4 with comparable and high binding affinity. Advantageously therefore the
   antibodies are able to continue to bind FcRn even within the endosome, thereby maximising
   the blocking of FcRn binding to IgG, see Figure 10 for an illustration of the mechanism.
 5 In one embodiment the antibodies or binding fragments according to the present disclosure
   comprise a light chain or light chain fragment having a variable region, for example
   comprising one, two or three CDRs independently selected from SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID
   NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6, in particular wherein CDR LI is SEQ ID NO: 4, CDR L2 is SEQ
   ID NO: 5 and CDR L3 is SEQ ID NO: 6.
10 In one embodiment the antibodies or binding fragments according to the present disclosure
   comprise CDR sequences of SEQ ID NOs: I to 6, for example wherein CDR HI is SEQ ID
   NO: 1, CDR H2 is SEQ ID NO: 2, CDR H3 is SEQ ID NO: 3, CDR LI is SEQ ID NO: 4,
   CDR L2 is SEQ ID NO: 5 and CDR L3 is SEQ ID NO: 6.
   The disclosure also extends to a polynucleotide, such as DNA, encoding an antibody or
15 fragment as described herein.
   Also provided is a host cell comprising said polynucleotide.
   Methods of expressing an antibody or fragment are provided herein as are methods of
   conjugating an antibody or fragment to a polymer, such as PEG.
   The present disclosure also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said
20 antibodies and fragments.
   In one embodiment there is provided a method of treatment comprising administering a
   therapeutically effective amount of an antibody, fragment or composition as described herein.
   The present disclosure also extends to an antibody, fragment or composition according to the
   present disclosure for use in treatment, particularly in the treatment of an immunological
25 and/or autoimmune disorder.
   Thus the present disclosure provides antibodies, fragments thereof and methods for removal
   of pathogenic IgG, which is achieved by accelerating the body's natural mechanism for
   catabolising IgG.
                                                   4
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   In essence the antibodies and fragments according to the disclosure block the system that
   recycles IgG in the body.
   The present therapy is likely to provide a replacement or supplement for certain diseases
   where plasmapheresis is a therapy or IVIg therapy, which is advantageous for patients.

   Details of the Disclosure
25 FcRn as employed herein refers to the non-covalent complex between the human IgG
   receptor alpha chain, also known as the neonatal Fc receptor, the amino acid sequence of
   which is in UniProt under number P55899 together with P2 microglobulin (p2M), the amino
   acid sequence of which is in UniProt under number P61769.
30 Antibody molecule as employed herein refers to an antibody or binding fragment thereof.
                                                               6
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or
   variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify
   the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further
 5 features in various embodiments of the invention.
   The term 'antibody' as used herein generally relates to intact (whole) antibodies i.e.
   comprising the elements of two heavy chains and two light chains. The antibody may
   comprise further additional binding domains for example as per the molecule DVD-Ig as
10 disclosed in WO 2007/024715, or the so-called (FabFv)2Fc described in W02011/030107.
   Thus antibody as employed herein includes bi, tri or tetra-valent full length antibodies.
   Binding fragments of antibodies include single chain antibodies (i.e. a full length heavy chain
   and light chain); Fab, modified Fab, Fab', modified Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, Fab-Fv, Fab-dsFv,
15 single domain antibodies (e.g. VH or VL or VHH), scFv, bi, tri or tetra-valent antibodies,
   Bis-scFv, diabodies, tribodies, triabodies, tetrabodies and epitope-binding fragments of any
   of the above (see for example Holliger and Hudson, 2005, Nature Biotech. 23(9):1126-1136;
   Adair and Lawson, 2005, Drug Design Reviews - Online 2(3), 209-217). The methods for
   creating and manufacturing these antibody fragments are well known in the art (see for
20 example Verma et al., 1998, Journal of Immunological Methods, 216, 165-181). The Fab-Fv
   format was first disclosed in W02009/040562 and the disulphide stabilised versions thereof,
   the Fab-dsFv was first disclosed in W02010/035012, see also Figure 25 herein. Other
   antibody fragments for use in the present invention include the Fab and Fab' fragments
   described in International patent applications W02005/003169, W02005/003170 and
25 W02005/003171. Multi-valent antibodies may comprise multiple specificities e.g. bispecific
   or may be monospecific (see for example WO 92/22583 and WO05/113605). One such
   example of the latter is a Tri-Fab (or TFM) as described in W092/22583.
   A typical Fab' molecule comprises a heavy and a light chain pair in which the heavy chain
30 comprises a variable region VH, a constant domain CHI and a natural or modified hinge
   region and the light chain comprises a variable region VL and a constant domain CL.
                                                    7
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   In one embodiment there is provided a dimer of a Fab' according to the present disclosure to
   create a F(ab')2 for example dimerisation may be through the hinge.
   In one embodiment the antibody or binding fragment thereof comprises a binding domain. A
 5 binding domain will generally comprises 6 CDRs, three from a heavy chain and three from a
   light chain. In one embodiment the CDRs are in a framework and together form a variable
   region. Thus in one embodiment an antibody or binding fragment comprises a binding
   domain specific for antigen comprising a light chain variable region and a heavy chain
   variable region.
10
   It will be appreciated that one or more (for example 1, 2, 3 or 4) amino acid substitutions,
   additions and/or deletions may be made to the CDRs or other sequences (e.g variable
   domains) provided by the present invention without significantly altering the ability of the
   antibody to bind to FcRn. The effect of any amino acid substitutions, additions and/or
15 deletions can be readily tested by one skilled in the art, for example by using the methods
   described herein, in particular in the Examples, to determine FcRn.
   In one or more (for example 1, 2, 3 or 4) amino acid substitutions, additions and/or deletions
   may be made to the framework region employed in the antibody or fragment provided by the
20 present invention and wherein binding affinity to FcRn is retained or increased.
   The residues in antibody variable domains are conventionally numbered according to a
   system devised by Kabat et al. This system is set forth in Kabat et al., 1987, in Sequences of
   Proteins of Immunological Interest, US Department of Health and Human Services, NIH,
25 USA (hereafter "Kabat et al. (supra)"). This numbering system is used in the present
   specification except where otherwise indicated.
   The Kabat residue designations do not always correspond directly with the linear numbering
   of the amino acid residues. The actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or
   additional amino acids than in the strict Kabat numbering corresponding to a shortening of,
30 or insertion into, a structural component, whether framework or complementarity
   determining region (CDR), of the basic variable domain structure. The correct Kabat
                                                   8
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment of residues of
   homology in the sequence of the antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered sequence.
   The CDRs of the heavy chain variable domain are located at residues 31-35 (CDR-H1),
   residues 50-65 (CDR-H2) and residues 95-102 (CDR-H3) according to the Kabat numbering
 5 system. However, according to Chothia (Chothia, C. and Lesk, A.M. J. Mol. Biol., 196, 901
   917 (1987)), the loop equivalent to CDR-H1 extends from residue 26 to residue 32. Thus
   unless indicated otherwise 'CDR-H1' as employed herein is intended to refer to residues 26
   to 35, as described by a combination of the Kabat numbering system and Chothia's
   topological loop definition.
10 The CDRs of the light chain variable domain are located at residues 24-34 (CDR-L1),
   residues 50-56 (CDR-L2) and residues 89-97 (CDR-L3) according to the Kabat numbering
   system.
   Antibodies and fragments of the present disclosure block FcRn and may thereby prevent it
   functioning in the recycling of IgG. Blocking as employed herein refers to physically
15 blocking such as occluding the receptor but will also include where the antibody or fragments
   binds an epitope that causes, for example a conformational change which means that the
   natural ligand to the receptor no longer binds. Antibody molecules of the present invention
   bind to FcRn and thereby decrease or prevent (e.g. inhibit) FcRn binding to an IgG constant
   region.
20 In one embodiment the antibody or fragment thereof binds FcRn competitively with respect
   to IgG.
   In one example the antibody or binding fragment thereof functions as a competitive inhibitor
   of human FcRn binding to human IgG. In one example the antibody or binding fragment
   thereof binds to the IgG binding site on FcRn. In one example the antibody or binding
25 fragment thereof does not bind p2M.
   Antibodies for use in the present disclosure may be obtained using any suitable method
   known in the art. The FcRn polypeptide/protein including fusion proteins, cells
   (recombinantly or naturally) expressing the polypeptide (such as activated T cells) can be
   used to produce antibodies which specifically recognise FcRn. The polypeptide may be the
30  'mature' polypeptide or a biologically active fragment or derivative thereof. The human
                                                   9
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   protein is registered in Swiss-Prot under the number P55899. The extracellular domain of
   human FcRn alpha chain is provided in SEQ ID NO:94. The sequence of $2M is provided in
   SEQ ID NO:95.
   In one embodiment the antigen is a mutant form of FcRn which is engineered to present
 5 FcRn on the surface of a cell, such that there is little or no dynamic processing where the
   FcRn is internalised in the cell, for example this can be achieved by making a mutation in the
   cytoplasmic tail of the FcRn alpha chain, wherein di-leucine is mutated to di-alanine as
   described in Ober et al 2001 Int. Immunol. 13, 1551-1559.
   Polypeptides, for use to immunize a host, may be prepared by processes well known in the art
10 from genetically engineered host cells comprising expression systems or they may be
   recovered from natural biological sources. In the present application, the term
   "polypeptides" includes peptides, polypeptides and proteins. These are used interchangeably
   unless otherwise specified. The FcRn polypeptide may in some instances be part of a larger
   protein such as a fusion protein for example fused to an affinity tag or similar.
15 Antibodies generated against the FcRn polypeptide may be obtained, where immunisation of
   an animal is necessary, by administering the polypeptides to an animal, preferably a non
   human animal, using well-known and routine protocols, see for example Handbook of
   Experimental Immunology, D. M. Weir (ed.), Vol 4, Blackwell Scientific Publishers, Oxford,
   England, 1986). Many warm-blooded animals, such as rabbits, mice, rats, sheep, cows,
20 camels or pigs may be immunized. However, mice, rabbits, pigs and rats are generally most
   suitable.
   Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by any method known in the art such as the
   hybridoma technique (Kohler & Milstein, 1975, Nature, 256:495-497), the trioma technique,
   the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., 1983, Immunology Today, 4:72) and
25 the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy,
   pp77-96, Alan R Liss, Inc., 1985).
   Antibodies for use in the invention may also be generated using single lymphocyte antibody
   methods by cloning and expressing immunoglobulin variable region cDNAs generated from
   single lymphocytes selected for the production of specific antibodies by, for example, the
30 methods described by Babcook, J. et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93(15):7843

   Screening for antibodies can be performed using assays to measure binding to human FcRn
   and/or assays to measure the ability to block IgG binding to the receptor. An example of a
 5 binding assay is an ELISA, in particular, using a fusion protein of human FcRn and human
   Fc, which is immobilized on plates, and employing a secondary antibody to detect anti-FcRn
   antibody bound to the fusion protein. Examples of suitable antagonistic and blocking assays
   are described in the Examples herein.
   Humanised antibodies (which include CDR-grafted antibodies) are antibody molecules
10 having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from a non-human species
   and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule (see, e.g. US 5,585,089;
   W091/09967). It will be appreciated that it may only be necessary to transfer the specificity
   determining residues of the CDRs rather than the entire CDR (see for example, Kashmiri et
   al., 2005, Methods, 36, 25-34). Humanised antibodies may optionally further comprise one
15 or more framework residues derived from the non-human species from which the CDRs were
   derived. The latter are often referred to as donor residues.
   Specific as employed herein is intended to refer to an antibody that only recognises the
   antigen to which it is specific or an antibody that has significantly higher binding affinity to
   the antigen to which it is specific compared to binding to antigens to which it is non-specific,
20 for example at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times higher binding affinity. Binding affinity may be
   measured by techniques such as BlAcore as described herein below. In one example the
   antibody of the present invention does not bind P2 microglobulin (p2M). In one example the
   antibody of the present invention binds cynomolgus FcRn. In one example the antibody of
   the present invention does not bind rat or mouse FcRn.
25 The amino acid sequences and the polynucleotide sequences of certain antibodies according
   to the present disclosure are provided in the Figures.
   In one embodiment the antibody or fragments according to the disclosure are humanised.
   As used herein, the term 'humanised antibody molecule' refers to an antibody molecule
   wherein the heavy and/or light chain contains one or more CDRs (including, if desired, one
30 or more modified CDRs) from a donor antibody (e.g. a non-human antibody such as a murine
                                                    11

   monoclonal antibody) grafted into a heavy and/or light chain variable region framework of an
   acceptor antibody (e.g. a human antibody). For a review, see Vaughan et al, Nature
   Biotechnology, 16, 535-539, 1998. In one embodiment rather than the entire CDR being
   transferred, only one or more of the specificity determining residues from any one of the
 5 CDRs described herein above are transferred to the human antibody framework (see for
   example, Kashmiri et al., 2005, Methods, 36, 25-34). In one embodiment only the specificity
   determining residues from one or more of the CDRs described herein above are transferred to
   the human antibody framework. In another embodiment only the specificity determining
   residues from each of the CDRs described herein above are transferred to the human antibody
10 framework.
   When the CDRs or specificity determining residues are grafted, any appropriate acceptor
   variable region framework sequence may be used having regard to the class/type of the donor
   antibody from which the CDRs are derived, including mouse, primate and human framework
   regions.
15 Suitably, the humanised antibody according to the present invention has a variable domain
   comprising human acceptor framework regions as well as one or more of the CDRs provided
   specifically herein. Thus, provided in one embodiment is blocking humanised antibody
   which binds human FcRn wherein the variable domain comprises human acceptor framework
   regions and non-human donor CDRs.
20 Examples of human frameworks which can be used in the present invention are KOL,
   NEWM, REI, EU, TUR, TEI, LAY and POM (Kabat et al., supra). For example, KOL and
   NEWM can be used for the heavy chain, REI can be used for the light chain and EU, LAY
   and POM can be used for both the heavy chain and the light chain. Alternatively, human
   germline sequences may be used; these are available at: http://vbase.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk/
25 In a humanised antibody of the present invention, the acceptor heavy and light chains do not
   necessarily need to be derived from the same antibody and may, if desired, comprise
   composite chains having framework regions derived from different chains.
   One such suitable framework region for the heavy chain of the humanised antibody of the
   present invention is derived from the human sub-group VH3 sequence 1-3 3-07 together with
30 JH4 (SEQ ID NO: 56).
                                                   12
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   Accordingly, in one example there is provided a humanised antibody comprising the
   sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 1 for CDR-H1, the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 2 for
   CDR-H2 and the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 3 for CDRH3, wherein the heavy chain
   framework region is derived from the human subgroup VH3 sequence 1-3 3-07 together with
 5 JH4.
   The sequence of human JH4 is as follows: (YFDY)WGQGTLVTVS (Seq ID No: 70). The
   YFDY motif is part of CDR-H3 and is not part of framework 4 (Ravetch, JV. et al., 1981,
   Cell, 27, 583-591).
   In one example the heavy chain variable domain of the antibody comprises the sequence
10 given in SEQ ID NO: 29.
   A suitable framework region for the light chain of the humanised antibody of the present
   invention is derived from the human germline sub-group VK1 sequence 2-1-(1) A30 together
   with JK2 (SEQ ID NO: 54).
   Accordingly, in one example there is provided a humanised antibody comprising the
15 sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 4 for CDR-L1, the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 5 for
   CDR-L2 and the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 6 for CDRL3, wherein the light chain
   framework region is derived from the human subgroup VK1 sequence 2-1-(1) A30 together
   with JK2.
   The JK2 sequence is as follows: (YT)FGQGTKLEIK (Seq ID No: 71). The YT motif is part
20 of CDR-L3 and is not part of framework 4 (Hieter, PA., et al., 1982, J. Biol. Chem., 257,
    1516-1522).
   In one example the light chain variable domain of the antibody comprises the sequence given
   in SEQ ID NO: 15.
   In a humanised antibody of the present invention, the framework regions need not have
25 exactly the same sequence as those of the acceptor antibody. For instance, unusual residues
   may be changed to more frequently-occurring residues for that acceptor chain class or type.
   Alternatively, selected residues in the acceptor framework regions may be changed so that
   they correspond to the residue found at the same position in the donor antibody (see
   Reichmann et al., 1998, Nature, 332, 323-324). Such changes should be kept to the
                                                  13
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   minimum necessary to recover the affinity of the donor antibody. A protocol for selecting
   residues in the acceptor framework regions which may need to be changed is set forth in
   W091/09967.
   Thus in one embodiment 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 residues in the framework are replaced with an
 5 alternative amino acid residue.
   Accordingly, in one example there is provided a humanised antibody, wherein at least the
   residues at each of positions 3, 24, 76, 93 and 94 of the variable domain of the heavy chain
   (Kabat numbering) are donor residues, see for example the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:
   29.
10 In one embodiment residue 3 of the heavy chain variable domain is replaced with an
   alternative amino acid, for example glutamine.
   In one embodiment residue 24 of the heavy chain variable domain is replaced with an
   alternative amino acid, for example alanine.
   In one embodiment residue 76 of the heavy chain variable domain is replaced with an
15 alternative amino acid, for example asparagine.
   In one embodiment residue 93 of the heavy chain is replaced with an alternative amino acid,
   for example alanine.
   In one embodiment residue 94 of the heavy chain is replaced with an alternative amino acid,
   for example arginine.
20 In one embodiment residue 3 is glutamine, residue 24 is alanine, residue 76 is aspargine,
   residue 93 is alanine and residue 94 is arginine in the humanised heavy chain variable region
   according to the present disclosure.
   Accordingly, in one example there is provided a humanised antibody, wherein at least the
   residues at each of positions 36, 37 and 58 of the variable domain of the light chain (Kabat
25 numbering) are donor residues, see for example the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 15
   In one embodiment residue 36 of the light chain variable domain is replaced with an
   alternative amino acid, for example tyrosine.
                                                   14
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   In one embodiment residue 37 of the light chain variable domain is replaced with an
   alternative amino acid, for example glutamine.
   In one embodiment residue 58 of the light chain variable domain is replaced with an
   alternative amino acid, for example valine.
 5 In one embodiment residue 36 is tyrosine, residue 37 is glutamine and residue 58 is valine, in
   the humanised heavy chain variable region according to the present disclosure.
   In one embodiment the disclosure provides an antibody sequence which is 80% similar or
   identical to a sequence disclosed herein, for example 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%
   96%, 97%, 98% or 99% over part or whole of the relevant sequence, for example a variable

   one embodiment the relevant sequence is SEQ ID NO: 15. In one embodiment the relevant
   sequence is SEQ ID NO: 29.

 5 The antibody molecules of the present invention may comprise a complete antibody molecule
   having full length heavy and light chains or a fragment thereof and may be, but are not
   limited to Fab, modified Fab, Fab', modified Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, single domain antibodies (e.g.
   VH or VL or VHH), scFv, bi, tri or tetra-valent antibodies, Bis-scFv, diabodies, triabodies,
   tetrabodies and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above (see for example Holliger and
10 Hudson, 2005, Nature Biotech. 23(9):1126-1136; Adair and Lawson, 2005, Drug Design
   Reviews - Online 2(3), 209-217). The methods for creating and manufacturing these
   antibody fragments are well known in the art (see for example Verma et al., 1998, Journal of
   Immunological Methods, 216, 165-181). Other antibody fragments for use in the present
   invention include the Fab and Fab' fragments described in International patent applications
15 W02005/003169, W02005/003170 and W02005/003171. Multi-valent antibodies may
   comprise multiple specificities e.g bispecific or may be monospecific (see for example WO
   92/22853, WO05/113605, W02009/040562 and W02010/035012).
   In one embodiment the antibody molecule of the present disclosure is an antibody Fab'
   fragment comprising the variable regions shown in SEQ ID NOs: 15 and 29 for example for
20 the light and heavy chain respectively. In one embodiment the antibody molecule has a light
   chain comprising the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:22 and a heavy chain comprising the
   sequence given in SEQ ID NO:36.
   In one embodiment the antibody molecule of the present disclosure is a full length IgGI
   antibody comprising the variable regions shown in SEQ ID NOs: 15 and 29 for example for
25 the light and heavy chain respectively. In one embodiment the antibody molecule has a light
   chain comprising the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:22 and a heavy chain comprising the
   sequence given in SEQ ID NO:72.
   In one embodiment the antibody molecule of the present disclosure is a full length IgG4
   format comprising the variable regions shown in SEQ ID NOs: 15 and 29 for example for the
30 light and heavy chain respectively. In one embodiment the antibody molecule has a light
                                                   17

   chain comprising the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:22 and a heavy chain comprising the
   sequence given in SEQ ID NO:87.
   In one embodiment the antibody molecule of the present disclosure is a full length IgG4P
   format comprising the variable regions shown in SEQ ID NOs: 15 and 29 for example for the
 5 light and heavy chain respectively. In one embodiment the antibody molecule has a light
   chain comprising the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:22 and a heavy chain comprising the
   sequence given in SEQ ID NO:43.
   IgG4P as employed herein is a mutation of the wild-type IgG4 isotype where amino acid 241
   is replaced by proline see for example where serine at position 241 has been changed to
10 proline as described in Angal et al., Molecular Immunology, 1993, 30 (1), 105-108.
   In one embodiment the antibody according to the present disclosure is provided as FcRn
   binding antibody fusion protein which comprises an immunoglobulin moiety, for example a
   Fab or Fab' fragment, and one or two single domain antibodies (dAb) linked directly or
   indirectly thereto, for example as described in W02009/040562, W02010035012,
15 W02011/030107, W02011/061492 and W02011/086091 all incorporated herein by
   reference.
   In one embodiment the fusion protein comprises two domain antibodies, for example as a
   variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) pairing, optionally linked by a disulphide bond.
   In one embodiment the Fab or Fab' element of the fusion protein has the same or similar
20 specificity to the single domain antibody or antibodies. In one embodiment the Fab or Fab'
   has a different specificity to the single domain antibody or antibodies, that is to say the fusion
   protein is multivalent. In one embodiment a multivalent fusion protein according to the
   present invention has an albumin binding site, for example a VH/VL pair therein provides an
   albumin binding site. In one such embodiment the heavy chain comprises the sequence given
25 in SEQ ID NO:50 and the light chain comprises the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:46 or
   SEQ ID NO:78. This Fab-dsFv format is illustrated in Figure 25 herein.
   In one embodiment the Fab or Fab' according to the present disclosure is conjugated to a
   PEG molecule or human serum albumin.

   CA170_01519g57 and 1519 and 1519.g57 are employed inchangeably herein and are used to
   refer to a specific pair of antibody variable regions which may be used in a number of
   different formats. These variable regions are the heavy chain sequence given in SEQ ID
   NO:29 and the light chain sequence given in SEQ ID NO:15 (Figure 1).
 5 The constant region domains of the antibody molecule of the present invention, if present,
   may be selected having regard to the proposed function of the antibody molecule, and in
   particular the effector functions which may be required. For example, the constant region
   domains may be human IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM domains. In particular, human IgG
   constant region domains may be used, especially of the IgGI and IgG3 isotypes when the
10 antibody molecule is intended for therapeutic uses and antibody effector functions are
   required. Alternatively, IgG2 and IgG4 isotypes may be used when the antibody molecule is
   intended for therapeutic purposes and antibody effector functions are not required. It will be
   appreciated that sequence variants of these constant region domains may also be used. For
   example IgG4 molecules in which the serine at position 241 has been changed to proline as
15 described in Angal et al., Molecular Immunology, 1993, 30 (1), 105-108 may be used. It
   will also be understood by one skilled in the art that antibodies may undergo a variety of
   posttranslational modifications. The type and extent of these modifications often depends on
   the host cell line used to express the antibody as well as the culture conditions. Such
   modifications may include variations in glycosylation, methionine oxidation,
20 diketopiperazine formation, aspartate isomerization and asparagine deamidation. A frequent
   modification is the loss of a carboxy-terminal basic residue (such as lysine or arginine) due to
   the action of carboxypeptidases (as described in Harris, RJ. Journal of Chromatography
   705:129-134, 1995). Accordingly, the C-terminal lysine of the antibody heavy chain may be
   absent.
25 In one embodiment the antibody heavy chain comprises a CHI domain and the antibody light
   chain comprises a CL domain, either kappa or lambda.
   In one embodiment the light chain has the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:22 and the heavy
   chain has the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:43.
   In one embodiment the light chain has the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:22 and the heavy
30 chain has the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:72.

   In one embodiment a C-terminal amino acid from the antibody molecule is cleaved during post
   translation modifications.
   In one embodiment an N-terminal amino acid from the antibody molecule is cleaved during
   post-translation modifications.
 5 Also provided by the present invention is a specific region or epitope of human FcRn which is
   bound by an antibody provided by the present invention, in particular an antibody comprising
   the heavy chain sequence gH20 (SEQ ID NO:29) and/or the light chain sequence gL20 (SEQ
   ID NO:15).
   This specific region or epitope of the human FcRn polypeptide can be identified by any suitable
10 epitope mapping method known in the art in combination with any one of the antibodies
   provided by the present invention. Examples of such methods include screening peptides of
   varying lengths derived from FcRn for binding to the antibody of the present invention with the
   smallest fragment that can specifically bind to the antibody containing the sequence of the
   epitope recognised by the antibody. The FcRn peptides may be produced synthetically or by
15 proteolytic digestion of the FcRn polypeptide. Peptides that bind the antibody can be identified
   by, for example, mass spectrometric analysis. In another example, NMR spectroscopy or X-ray
   crystallography can be used to identify the epitope bound by an antibody of the present
   invention. Once identified, the epitopic fragment which binds an antibody of the present
   invention can be used, if required, as an immunogen to obtain additional antibodies which bind
20 the same epitope.

20 In one example the present invention provides an anti-FcRn antibody molecule which binds an
   epitope of human FcRn which comprises or consists of residues 100, 105 to 109, 115 to 124 and
    129 to 133 of SEQ ID NO: 94.
   Antibodies which cross-block the binding of an antibody molecule according to the present
   invention in particular, an antibody molecule comprising the heavy chain sequence given in
25 SEQ ID NO:29 and the light chain sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 15 may be similarly useful
   in blocking FcRn activity. Accordingly, the present invention also provides an anti-FcRn
   antibody molecule, which cross-blocks the binding of any one of the antibody molecules
   described herein above to human FcRn and/or is cross-blocked from binding human FcRn by
   any one of those antibodies. In one embodiment, such an antibody binds to the same epitope
30 as an antibody described herein above. In another embodiment the cross-blocking
                                                  22
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   neutralising antibody binds to an epitope which borders and/or overlaps with the epitope
   bound by an antibody described herein above.
   Cross-blocking antibodies can be identified using any suitable method in the art, for example
   by using competition ELISA or BlAcore assays where binding of the cross blocking antibody
 5 to human FcRn prevents the binding of an antibody of the present invention or vice versa.
   Such cross blocking assays may use isolated natural or recombinant FcRn or a suitable fusion
   protein/polypeptide. In one example binding and cross-blocking is measured using
   recombinant human FcRn extracellular domain (SEQ ID NO:94). In one example the
   recombinant human FcRn alpha chain extracellular domain is used in a complex with P2
10 microglobulin (p2M) (SEQ ID NO:95).
   In one embodiment there is provided an anti-FcRn antibody molecule which blocks FcRn
   binding to IgG and which cross-blocks the binding of an antibody whose heavy chain
   comprises the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:29 and whose light chain comprises the
   sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 15 to human FcRn. In one embodiment the cross-blocking
15 antibodies provided by the present invention inhibit the binding of an antibody comprising the
   heavy chain sequence given in SEQ ID NO:29 and the light chain sequence given in SEQ ID
   NO:15 by greater than 80%, for example by greater than 85%, such as by greater than 90%,
   in particular by greater than 95%.
   Alternatively or in addition, anti-FcRn antibodies according to this aspect of the invention
20 may be cross-blocked from binding to human FcRn by an antibody comprising the heavy
   chain sequence given in SEQ ID NO:29 and the light chain sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 15.
   Also provided therefore is an anti-FcRn antibody molecule which blocks FcRn binding to
   IgG and which is cross-blocked from binding human FcRn by an antibody comprising the
   heavy chain sequence given in SEQ ID NO:29 and the light chain sequence given in SEQ ID
25 NO: 15. In one embodiment the anti-FcRn antibodies provided by this aspect of the invention
   are inhibited from binding human FcRn by an antibody comprising the heavy chain sequence
   given in SEQ ID NO:29 and the light chain sequence given in SEQ ID NO:15 by greater than
   80%, for example by greater than 85%, such as by greater than 90%, in particular by greater
   than 95%.
30 In one embodiment the cross-blocking antibodies provided by the present invention are fully
   human. In one embodiment the cross-blocking antibodies provided by the present invention
                                                 23
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   are humanised. In one embodiment the cross-blocking antibodies provided by the present
   invention have an affinity for human FcRn of 100pM or less. In one embodiment the cross
   blocking antibodies provided by the present invention have an affinity for human FcRn of
   50pM or less. Affinity can be measured using the methods described herein below.
 5 Biological molecules, such as antibodies or fragments, contain acidic and/or basic functional
   groups, thereby giving the molecule a net positive or negative charge. The amount of overall
   "observed" charge will depend on the absolute amino acid sequence of the entity, the local
   environment of the charged groups in the 3D structure and the environmental conditions of
   the molecule. The isoelectric point (pI) is the pH at which a particular molecule or solvent
10 accessible surface thereof carries no net electrical charge. In one example, the FcRn antibody
   and fragments of the invention may be engineered to have an appropriate isoelectric point.
   This may lead to antibodies and/or fragments with more robust properties, in particular
   suitable solubility and/or stability profiles and/or improved purification characteristics.
   Thus in one aspect the invention provides a humanised FcRn antibody engineered to have an
15 isoelectric point different to that of the originally identified antibody. The antibody may, for
   example be engineered by replacing an amino acid residue such as replacing an acidic amino
   acid residue with one or more basic amino acid residues. Alternatively, basic amino acid
   residues may be introduced or acidic amino acid residues can be removed. Alternatively, if
   the molecule has an unacceptably high pI value acidic residues may be introduced to lower
20 the pI, as required. It is important that when manipulating the pI care must be taken to retain
   the desirable activity of the antibody or fragment. Thus in one embodiment the engineered
   antibody or fragment has the same or substantially the same activity as the "unmodified"
   antibody or fragment.
   Programs such as ** ExPASY http://www.expasy.ch/tools/pi tool.html, and
25 http://www.iut-arles.up.univ-mrs.fr/w3bb/d abim/compo-p.html, may be used to predict the
   isoelectric point of the antibody or fragment.
   The antibody molecules of the present invention suitably have a high binding affinity, in
   particular in the nanomolar range. Affinity may be measured using any suitable method
   known in the art, including BlAcore, as described in the Examples herein, using isolated
30 natural or recombinant FcRn or a suitable fusion protein/polypeptide. In one example
                                                     24
   104129701 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   affinity is measured using recombinant human FcRn extracellular domain as described in the
   Examples herein (SEQ ID NO:94). In one example affinity is measured using the
   recombinant human FcRn alpha chain extracellular domain (SEQ ID NO:94) in association
   with P2 microglobulin (p2M) (SEQ ID NO:95). Suitably the antibody molecules of the
 5 present invention have a binding affinity for isolated human FcRn of about lnM or lower. In
   one embodiment the antibody molecule of the present invention has a binding affinity of
   about 500pM or lower (i.e. higher affinity). In one embodiment the antibody molecule of the
   present invention has a binding affinity of about 250pM or lower. In one embodiment the
   antibody molecule of the present invention has a binding affinity of about 200pM or lower.
10 In one embodiment the present invention provides an anti-FcRn antibody with a binding
   affinity of about 100pM or lower. In one embodiment the present invention provides a
   humanised anti-FcRn antibody with a binding affinity of about 100pM or lower. In one
   embodiment the present invention provides an anti-FcRn antibody with a binding affinity of
   50pM or lower.
15 Importantly the antibodies of the present invention are able to bind human FcRn at both pH6
   and pH7.4 with comparable binding affinity. Advantageously therefore the antibodies are
   able to continue to bind FcRn even within the endosome, thereby maximising the blocking of
   FcRn binding to IgG, see Figure 10 for an illustration of the mechanism.
   In one embodiment the present invention provides an anti-FcRn antibody with a binding
20 affinity of 100pM or lower when measured at pH6 and pH7.4.
   The affinity of an antibody or binding fragment of the present invention, as well as the extent
   to which a binding agent (such as an antibody) inhibits binding, can be determined by one of
   ordinary skill in the art using conventional techniques, for example those described by
   Scatchard et al. (Ann. KY. Acad. Sci. 51:660-672 (1949)) or by surface plasmon resonance
25 (SPR) using systems such as BlAcore. For surface plasmon resonance, target molecules are
   immobilized on a solid phase and exposed to ligands in a mobile phase running along a flow
   cell. If ligand binding to the immobilized target occurs, the local refractive index changes,
   leading to a change in SPR angle, which can be monitored in real time by detecting changes
   in the intensity of the reflected light. The rates of change of the SPR signal can be analyzed
30 to yield apparent rate constants for the association and dissociation phases of the binding
                                                     25
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   reaction. The ratio of these values gives the apparent equilibrium constant (affinity) (see, e.g.,
   Wolff et al, Cancer Res. 53:2560-65 (1993)).
   In the present invention affinity of the test antibody molecule is typically determined using
   SPR as follows. The test antibody molecule is captured on the solid phase and human FcRn
 5 alpha chain extracellular domain in non-covalent complex with p2M is run over the captured
   antibody in the mobile phase and affinity of the test antibody molecule for human FcRn
   determined. The test antibody molecule may be captured on the solid phase chip surface
   using any appropriate method, for example using an anti-Fc or anti Fab' specific capture
   agent. In one example the affinity is determined at pH6. In one example the affinity is
10 determined at pH7.4.
   It will be appreciated that the affinity of antibodies provided by the present invention may be
   altered using any suitable method known in the art. The present invention therefore also
   relates to variants of the antibody molecules of the present invention, which have an
   improved affinity for FcRn. Such variants can be obtained by a number of affinity
15 maturation protocols including mutating the CDRs (Yang et al., J. Mol. Biol., 254, 392-403,
    1995), chain shuffling (Marks et al., Bio/Technology, 10, 779-783, 1992), use of mutator
   strains of E. coli (Low et al., J. Mol. Biol., 250, 359-368, 1996), DNA shuffling (Patten et al.,
   Curr. Opin. Biotechnol., 8, 724-733, 1997), phage display (Thompson et al., J. Mol. Biol.,
   256, 77-88, 1996) and sexual PCR (Crameri et al., Nature, 391, 288-291, 1998). Vaughan et
20 al. (supra)discusses these methods of affinity maturation.
   In one embodiment the antibody molecules of the present invention block human FcRn
   activity. Assays suitable for determining the ability of an antibody to block FcRn are
   described in the Examples herein. Suitable assays for determining whether antibodies block
   FcRn interaction with circulating IgG molecules as described in the Examples herein. A
25 suitable assay for determining the ability of an antibody molecule to block IgG recycling in
   vitro is described herein below.
   If desired an antibody for use in the present invention may be conjugated to one or more
   effector molecule(s). It will be appreciated that the effector molecule may comprise a single
   effector molecule or two or more such molecules so linked as to form a single moiety that
30 can be attached to the antibodies of the present invention. Where it is desired to obtain an
   antibody fragment linked to an effector molecule, this may be prepared by standard chemical
                                                    26
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   or recombinant DNA procedures in which the antibody fragment is linked either directly or
   via a coupling agent to the effector molecule. Techniques for conjugating such effector
   molecules to antibodies are well known in the art (see, Hellstrom et al., Controlled Drug
   Delivery, 2nd Ed., Robinson et al., eds., 1987, pp. 623-53; Thorpe et al., 1982 , Immunol.
 5 Rev., 62:119-58 and Dubowchik et al., 1999, Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 83, 67-123).

   92/22583, WO 89/00195, WO 89/01476 and WO 03/031581. Alternatively, where the
   effector molecule is a protein or polypeptide the linkage may be achieved using recombinant
   DNA procedures, for example as described in WO 86/01533 and EP0392745.

15 Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent

   emitting metals (for use in positron emission tomography), and nonradioactive paramagnetic
   metal ions. See generally U.S. Patent No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated
   to antibodies for use as diagnostics. Suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase,

25 nuclides include                               and    Tc.
   In another example the effector molecule may increase the half-life of the antibody in vivo,
   and/or reduce immunogenicity of the antibody and/or enhance the delivery of an antibody
   across an epithelial barrier to the immune system. Examples of suitable effector molecules of
   this type include polymers, albumin, albumin binding proteins or albumin binding
30 compounds such as those described in WO05/117984.
                                                                28
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   In one embodiment a half-life provided by an effector molecule which is independent of
   FcRn is advantageous.
   Where the effector molecule is a polymer it may, in general, be a synthetic or a naturally
   occurring polymer, for example an optionally substituted straight or branched chain
 5 polyalkylene, polyalkenylene or polyoxyalkylene polymer or a branched or unbranched
   polysaccharide, e.g. a homo- or hetero- polysaccharide.
   Specific optional substituents which may be present on the above-mentioned synthetic
   polymers include one or more hydroxy, methyl or methoxy groups.
   Specific examples of synthetic polymers include optionally substituted straight or branched
10 chain poly(ethyleneglycol), poly(propyleneglycol) poly(vinylalcohol) or derivatives thereof,
   especially optionally substituted poly(ethyleneglycol) such as methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol)
   or derivatives thereof.
   Specific naturally occurring polymers include lactose, amylose, dextran, glycogen or
   derivatives thereof.
15 In one embodiment the polymer is albumin or a fragment thereof, such as human serum
   albumin or a fragment thereof.
   "Derivatives" as used herein is intended to include reactive derivatives, for example thiol
   selective reactive groups such as maleimides and the like. The reactive group may be linked
   directly or through a linker segment to the polymer. It will be appreciated that the residue of
20 such a group will in some instances form part of the product as the linking group between the
   antibody fragment and the polymer.
   The size of the polymer may be varied as desired, but will generally be in an average
   molecular weight range from 50ODa to 50000Da, for example from 5000 to 40000Da such as
   from 20000 to 40000Da. The polymer size may in particular be selected on the basis of the
25 intended use of the product for example ability to localize to certain tissues such as tumors or
   extend circulating half-life (for review see Chapman, 2002, Advanced Drug Delivery
   Reviews, 54, 531-545). Thus, for example, where the product is intended to leave the
   circulation and penetrate tissue, for example for use in the treatment of a tumour, it may be
   advantageous to use a small molecular weight polymer, for example with a molecular weight
                                                  29
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   of around 5000Da. For applications where the product remains in the circulation, it may be
   advantageous to use a higher molecular weight polymer, for example having a molecular
   weight in the range from 20000Da to 40000Da.
   Suitable polymers include a polyalkylene polymer, such as a poly(ethyleneglycol) or,
 5 especially, a methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or a derivative thereof, and especially with a
   molecular weight in the range from about 15000Da to about 40000Da.
   In one example antibodies for use in the present invention are attached to
   poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) moieties. In one particular example the antibody is an antibody
   fragment and the PEG molecules may be attached through any available amino acid side
10 chain or terminal amino acid functional group located in the antibody fragment, for example
   any free amino, imino, thiol, hydroxyl or carboxyl group. Such amino acids may occur
   naturally in the antibody fragment or may be engineered into the fragment using recombinant
   DNA methods (see for example US 5,219,996; US 5,667,425; W098/25971,
   W02008/038024).                    In one example the antibody molecule of the present invention is a
15 modified Fab fragment wherein the modification is the addition to the C-terminal end of its
   heavy chain one or more amino acids to allow the attachment of an effector molecule.
   Suitably, the additional amino acids form a modified hinge region containing one or more
   cysteine residues to which the effector molecule may be attached. Multiple sites can be used
   to attach two or more PEG molecules.
20 Suitably PEG molecules are covalently linked through a thiol group of at least one cysteine
   residue located in the antibody fragment. Each polymer molecule attached to the modified
   antibody fragment may be covalently linked to the sulphur atom of a cysteine residue located
   in the fragment. The covalent linkage will generally be a disulphide bond or, in particular, a
   sulphur-carbon bond. Where a thiol group is used as the point of attachment appropriately
25 activated effector molecules, for example thiol selective derivatives such as maleimides and
   cysteine derivatives may be used. An activated polymer may be used as the starting material
   in the preparation of polymer-modified antibody fragments as described above. The
   activated polymer may be any polymer containing a thiol reactive group such as an a
   halocarboxylic acid or ester, e.g. iodoacetamide, an imide, e.g. maleimide, a vinyl sulphone
30 or a disulphide. Such starting materials may be obtained commercially (for example from
   Nektar, formerly Shearwater Polymers Inc., Huntsville, AL, USA) or may be prepared from
                                                              30
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   commercially available starting materials using conventional chemical procedures. Particular
   PEG molecules include 20K methoxy-PEG-amine (obtainable from Nektar, formerly
   Shearwater; Rapp Polymere; and SunBio) and M-PEG-SPA (obtainable from Nektar,
   formerly Shearwater).
 5 In one embodiment, the antibody is a modified Fab fragment, Fab' fragment or diFab which
   is PEGylated, i.e. has PEG (poly(ethyleneglycol)) covalently attached thereto, e.g. according
   to the method disclosed in EP 0948544 or EP1090037 [see also "Poly(ethyleneglycol)
   Chemistry, Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications", 1992, J. Milton Harris (ed), Plenum
   Press, New York, "Poly(ethyleneglycol) Chemistry and Biological Applications", 1997, J.

   and A. Dent, Grove Publishers, New York; Chapman, A. 2002, Advanced Drug Delivery
   Reviews 2002, 54:531-545]. In one example PEG is attached to a cysteine in the hinge
   region. In one example, a PEG modified Fab fragment has a maleimide group covalently
15 linked to a single thiol group in a modified hinge region. A lysine residue may be covalently
   linked to the maleimide group and to each of the amine groups on the lysine residue may be
   attached a methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) polymer having a molecular weight of
   approximately 20,000Da. The total molecular weight of the PEG attached to the Fab
   fragment may therefore be approximately 40,000Da.
20 Particular PEG molecules include 2-[3-(N-maleimido)propionamido]ethyl amide of N,N'
   bis(methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) MW 20,000) modified lysine, also known as
   PEG2MAL40K (obtainable from Nektar, formerly Shearwater).

   the structure below is 5) and GL2-400MA (where m is 2) and n is approximately 450:

   invention, respectively and suitable signal sequences. In one example the vector comprises
   an intergenic sequence between the heavy and the light chains (see W003/048208).
10 General methods by which the vectors may be constructed, transfection methods and culture
   methods are well known to those skilled in the art. In this respect, reference is made to
   "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology", 1999, F. M. Ausubel (ed), Wiley Interscience,
   New York and the Maniatis Manual produced by Cold Spring Harbor Publishing.
   Also provided is a host cell comprising one or more cloning or expression vectors comprising
15 one or more DNA sequences encoding an antibody of the present invention. Any suitable
   host cell/vector system may be used for expression of the DNA sequences encoding the
   antibody molecule of the present invention. Bacterial, for example E. coli, and other
   microbial systems may be used or eukaryotic, for example mammalian, host cell expression
   systems may also be used. Suitable mammalian host cells include CHO, myeloma or
20 hybridoma cells.
   Suitable types of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) for use in the present invention may
   include CHO and CHO-KI cells including dhfr- CHO cells, such as CHO-DG44 cells and
   CHO-DXB1 1 cells and which may be used with a DHFR selectable marker or CHOKI-SV
   cells which may be used with a glutamine synthetase selectable marker. Other cell types of
25 use in expressing antibodies include lymphocytic cell lines, e.g., NSO myeloma cells and
   SP2 cells, COS cells.
   The present invention also provides a process for the production of an antibody molecule
   according to the present invention comprising culturing a host cell containing a vector of the
   present invention under conditions suitable for leading to expression of protein from DNA
30 encoding the antibody molecule of the present invention, and isolating the antibody molecule.

   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   The antibody molecule may comprise only a heavy or light chain polypeptide, in which case
   only a heavy chain or light chain polypeptide coding sequence needs to be used to transfect
   the host cells. For production of products comprising both heavy and light chains, the cell
   line may be transfected with two vectors, a first vector encoding a light chain polypeptide and
 5 a second vector encoding a heavy chain polypeptide. Alternatively, a single vector may be
   used, the vector including sequences encoding light chain and heavy chain polypeptides.
   The antibodies and fragments according to the present disclosure are expressed at good levels
   from host cells. Thus the properties of the antibodies and/or fragments are conducive to
   commercial processing.
10 Thus there is a provided a process for culturing a host cell and expressing an antibody or
   fragment thereof, isolating the latter and optionally purifying the same to provide an isolated
   antibody or fragment. In one embodiment the process further comprises the step of
   conjugating an effector molecule to the isolated antibody or fragment, for example
   conjugating to a PEG polymer in particular as described herein.
15 In one embodiment there is provided a process for purifying an antibody (in particular an
   antibody or fragment according to the invention) comprising the steps: performing anion
   exchange chromatography in non-binding mode such that the impurities are retained on the
   column and the antibody is eluted.
   In one embodiment the purification employs affinity capture on an FcRn column.
20 In one embodiment the purification employs cibacron blue or similar for purification of
   albumin fusion or conjugate molecules.
   Suitable ion exchange resins for use in the process include Q.FF resin (supplied by GE
   Healthcare). The step may, for example be performed at a pH about 8.
   The process may further comprise an intial capture step employing cation exchange
25 chromatography, performed for example at a pH of about 4 to 5, such as 4.5. The cation
   exchange chromatography may, for example employ a resin such as CaptoS resin or SP
   sepharose FF (supplied by GE-Healthcare). The antibody or fragment can then be eluted
   from the resin employing an ionic salt solution such as sodium chloride, for example at a
   concentration of 200mM.
                                                   36
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   Thus the chromatograph step or steps may include one or more washing steps, as appropriate.
   The purification process may also comprise one or more filtration steps, such as a
   diafiltration step.
   Thus in one embodiment there is provided a purified anti-FcRn antibody or fragment, for
 5 example a humanised antibody or fragment, in particular an antibody or fragment according
   to the invention, in substantially purified from, in particular free or substantially free of
   endotoxin and/or host cell protein or DNA.
   Purified form as used supra is intended to refer to at least 90% purity, such as 91, 92, 93, 94,
   95, 96, 97, 98, 99% w/w or more pure.
10 Substantially free of endotoxin is generally intended to refer to an endotoxin content of 1 EU
   per mg antibody product or less such as 0.5 or 0.1 EU per mg product.
   Substantially free of host cell protein or DNA is generally intended to refer to host cell
   protein and/or DNA content 400pg per mg of antibody product or less such as 100pg per mg
   or less, in particular 20pg per mg, as appropriate.
15 The antibody molecule of the present invention may also be used in diagnosis, for example in
   the in vivo diagnosis and imaging of disease states involving FcRn.
   As the antibodies of the present invention are useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of a
   pathological condition, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical or diagnostic
   composition comprising an antibody molecule of the present invention in combination with
20 one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier. Accordingly,
   provided is the use of an antibody molecule of the invention for the manufacture of a
   medicament. The composition will usually be supplied as part of a sterile, pharmaceutical
   composition that will normally include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A
   pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may additionally comprise a
25 pharmaceutically-acceptableexcipient.
   The present invention also provides a process for preparation of a pharmaceutical or
   diagnostic composition comprising adding and mixing the antibody molecule of the present
   invention together with one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or
   carrier.
                                                   37
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   The antibody molecule may be the sole active ingredient in the pharmaceutical or diagnostic
   composition or may be accompanied by other active ingredients including other antibody
   ingredients or non-antibody ingredients such as steroids or other drug molecules, in particular
   drug molecules whose half-life is independent of FcRn binding.
 5 The pharmaceutical compositions suitably comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the
   antibody of the invention. The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein refers
   to an amount of a therapeutic agent needed to treat, ameliorate or prevent a targeted disease
   or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or preventative effect. For any antibody,
   the therapeutically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or
10 in animal models, usually in rodents, rabbits, dogs, pigs or primates. The animal model may
   also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration.
   Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in
   humans.
   The precise therapeutically effective amount for a human subject will depend upon the
15 severity of the disease state, the general health of the subject, the age, weight and gender of
   the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction
   sensitivities and tolerance/response to therapy. This amount can be determined by routine
   experimentation and is within the judgement of the clinician. Generally, a therapeutically
   effective amount will be from 0.01 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg, for example 0.1 mg/kg to 200
20 mg/kg, such as 100mg/Kg. Pharmaceutical compositions may be conveniently presented in
   unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of an active agent of the invention per
   dose.
   Therapeutic doses of the antibodies according to the present disclosure show no apparent
   toxicology effects in vivo.
25 In one embodiment of an antibody or fragment according to the invention a single dose may
   provide up to a 70% reduction in circulating IgG levels.
   The maximal therapeutic reduction in circulating IgG may be observed about 1 week after
   administration of the relevant therapeutic dose. The levels of IgG may recover over about a
   six week period if further therapeutic doses are not delivered.
                                                    38
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   Advantageously, the levels of IgG in vivo may be maintained at an appropriately low level by
   administration of sequential doses of the antibody or fragments according to the disclosure.
   Compositions may be administered individually to a patient or may be administered in
   combination (e.g. simultaneously, sequentially or separately) with other agents, drugs or
 5 hormones.
   In one embodiment the antibodies or fragments according to the present disclosure are
   employed with an immunosuppressant therapy, such as a steroid, in particular prednisone.
   In one embodiment the antibodies or fragments according to the present disclosure are
   employed with Rituximab or other B cell therapies.
10 In one embodiment the antibodies or fragments according to the present disclosure are
   employed with any B cell or T cell modulating agent or immunomodulator. Examples
   include methotrexate, microphenyolate and azathioprine.
   The dose at which the antibody molecule of the present invention is administered depends on
   the nature of the condition to be treated, the extent of the inflammation present and on
15 whether the antibody molecule is being used prophylactically or to treat an existing
   condition.
   The frequency of dose will depend on the half-life of the antibody molecule and the duration
   of its effect. If the antibody molecule has a short half-life (e.g. 2 to 10 hours) it may be
   necessary to give one or more doses per day. Alternatively, if the antibody molecule has a
20 long half life (e.g. 2 to 15 days) and/or long lasting pharmacodynamics (PD) profile it may
   only be necessary to give a dosage once per day, once per week or even once every 1 or 2
   months.
   In one embodiment the dose is delivered bi-weekly, i.e. twice a month.
   Half life as employed herein is intended to refer to the duration of the molecule in circulation,
25 for example in serum/plasma.
   Pharmacodynamics as employed herein refers to the profile and in particular duration of the
   biological action of the molecule according the present disclosure.
                                                    39
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier should not itself induce the production of antibodies
   harmful to the individual receiving the composition and should not be toxic. Suitable carriers
   may be large, slowly metabolised macromolecules such as proteins, polypeptides, liposomes,
   polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid
 5 copolymers and inactive virus particles.
   Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used, for example mineral acid salts, such as
   hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates and sulphates, or salts of organic acids, such as
   acetates, propionates, malonates and benzoates.
   Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers in therapeutic compositions may additionally contain
10 liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as
   wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering substances, may be present in such
   compositions. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated as
   tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries and suspensions, for ingestion
   by the patient.
15 Suitable forms for administration include forms suitable for parenteral administration, e.g. by
   injection or infusion, for example by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Where the
   product is for injection or infusion, it may take the form of a suspension, solution or emulsion
   in an oily or aqueous vehicle and it may contain formulatory agents, such as suspending,
   preservative, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the antibody molecule may
20 be in dry form, for reconstitution before use with an appropriate sterile liquid.
   Once formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered directly to the
   subject. The subjects to be treated can be animals. However, in one or more embodiments
   the compositions are adapted for administration to human subjects.
   Suitably in formulations according to the present disclosure, the pH of the final formulation
25 is not similar to the value of the isoelectric point of the antibody or fragment, for example if
   the pI of the protein is in the range 8-9 or above then a formulation pH of 7 may be
   appropriate. Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory it is thought that this may ultimately
   provide a final formulation with improved stability, for example the antibody or fragment
   remains in solution.

   In one example the pharmaceutical formulation at a pH in the range of 4.0 to 7.0 comprises: 1
   to 200mg/mL of an antibody molecule according to the present disclosure, I to 100mM of a
   buffer, 0.001 to 1% of a surfactant, a) 10 to 500mM of a stabiliser, b) 10 to 500mM of a
   stabiliser and 5 to 500 mM of a tonicity agent, or c) 5 to 500 mM of a tonicity agent.
 5 The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by any number of
   routes including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial,
   intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal, transcutaneous (for example, see
   W098/20734), subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, enteral, topical, sublingual,
   intravaginal or rectal routes. Hyposprays may also be used to administer the pharmaceutical
10 compositions of the invention. Typically, the therapeutic compositions may be prepared as
   injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or
   suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection may also be prepared.
   Direct delivery of the compositions will generally be accomplished by injection,
   subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or intramuscularly, or delivered to the
15 interstitial space of a tissue. The compositions can also be administered into a lesion. Dosage
   treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule.
   It will be appreciated that the active ingredient in the composition will be an antibody
   molecule. As such, it will be susceptible to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, if
   the composition is to be administered by a route using the gastrointestinal tract, the
20 composition will need to contain agents which protect the antibody from degradation but
   which release the antibody once it has been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
   A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers is available in Remington's
   Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Company, N.J. 1991).
   In one embodiment the formulation is provided as a formulation for topical administrations
25 including inhalation.
   Suitable inhalable preparations include inhalable powders, metering aerosols containing
   propellant gases or inhalable solutions free from propellant gases. Inhalable powders
   according to the disclosure containing the active substance may consist solely of the
   abovementioned active substances or of a mixture of the abovementioned active substances
30 with physiologically acceptable excipient.
                                                    41
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   These inhalable powders may include monosaccharides (e.g. glucose or arabinose),
   disaccharides (e.g. lactose, saccharose, maltose), oligo- and polysaccharides (e.g. dextranes),
   polyalcohols (e.g. sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol), salts (e.g. sodium chloride, calcium carbonate)
   or mixtures of these with one another. Mono- or disaccharides are suitably used, the use of
 5 lactose or glucose, particularly but not exclusively in the form of their hydrates.
   Particles for deposition in the lung require a particle size less than 10 microns, such as 1-9
   microns for example from 1 to 5 [tm. The particle size of the active ingredient (such as the
   antibody or fragment) is of primary importance.
   The propellent gases which can be used to prepare the inhalable aerosols are known in the
10 art. Suitable propellent gases are selected from among hydrocarbons such as n-propane, n
   butane or isobutane and halohydrocarbons such as chlorinated and/or fluorinated derivatives
   of methane, ethane, propane, butane, cyclopropane or cyclobutane. The abovementioned
   propellent gases may be used on their own or in mixtures thereof.
   Particularly suitable propellent gases are halogenated alkane derivatives selected from among
15 TG 11, TG 12, TG 134a and TG227. Of the abovementioned halogenated hydrocarbons,
   TG134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) and TG227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) and
   mixtures thereof are particularly suitable.
   The propellent-gas-containing inhalable aerosols may also contain other ingredients such as
   cosolvents, stabilisers, surface-active agents (surfactants), antioxidants, lubricants and means
20 for adjusting the pH. All these ingredients are known in the art.
   The propellant-gas-containing inhalable aerosols according to the invention may contain up
   to 5 % by weight of active substance. Aerosols according to the invention contain, for
   example, 0.002 to 5 % by weight, 0.01 to 3 % by weight, 0.015 to 2 % by weight, 0.1 to 2 %
   by weight, 0.5 to 2 % by weight or 0.5 to 1 % by weight of active ingredient.
25 Alternatively topical administrations to the lung may also be by administration of a liquid
   solution or suspension formulation, for example employing a device such as a nebulizer, for
   example, a nebulizer connected to a compressor (e.g., the Pari LC-Jet Plus(R) nebulizer
   connected to a Pari Master(R) compressor manufactured by Pari Respiratory Equipment, Inc.,
   Richmond, Va.).

   The antibody of the invention can be delivered dispersed in a solvent, e.g., in the form of a
   solution or a suspension. It can be suspended in an appropriate physiological solution, e.g.,
   saline or other pharmacologically acceptable solvent or a buffered solution. Buffered
   solutions known in the art may contain 0.05 mg to 0.15 mg disodium edetate, 8.0 mg to 9.0
 5 mg NaCl, 0.15 mg to 0.25 mg polysorbate, 0.25 mg to 0.30 mg anhydrous citric acid, and
   0.45 mg to 0.55 mg sodium citrate per 1 ml of water so as to achieve a pH of about 4.0 to 5.0.
   A suspension can employ, for example, lyophilised antibody.
   The therapeutic suspensions or solution formulations can also contain one or more excipients.
   Excipients are well known in the art and include buffers (e.g., citrate buffer, phosphate
10 buffer, acetate buffer and bicarbonate buffer), amino acids, urea, alcohols, ascorbic acid,
   phospholipids, proteins (e.g., serum albumin), EDTA, sodium chloride, liposomes, mannitol,
   sorbitol, and glycerol. Solutions or suspensions can be encapsulated in liposomes or
   biodegradable microspheres. The formulation will generally be provided in a substantially
   sterile form employing sterile manufacture processes.
15 This may include production and sterilization by filtration of the buffered solvent/solution
   used for the formulation, aseptic suspension of the antibody in the sterile buffered solvent
   solution, and dispensing of the formulation into sterile receptacles by methods familiar to
   those of ordinary skill in the art.
   Nebulizable formulation according to the present disclosure may be provided, for example, as
20 single dose units (e.g., sealed plastic containers or vials) packed in foil envelopes. Each vial
   contains a unit dose in a volume, e.g., 2 mL, of solvent/solutionbuffer.
   The antibodies disclosed herein may be suitable for delivery via nebulisation.
   It is also envisaged that the antibody of the present invention may be administered by use of
   gene therapy. In order to achieve this, DNA sequences encoding the heavy and light chains
25 of the antibody molecule under the control of appropriate DNA components are introduced
   into a patient such that the antibody chains are expressed from the DNA sequences and
   assembled in situ.
   The present invention also provides an antibody molecule (or compositions comprising same)
   for use in the control of autoimmune diseases, for example Acute Disseminated
30 Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis, Addison's
                                                    43

   Thus there is provided an anti-FcRn antibody or binding fragment for use as a reagent for
   such uses as:
          1) purification of FcRn protein (or fragments thereof) - being conjugated to a matrix and
                used as an affinity column, or (as a modified form of anti-FcRn) as a precipitating
25              agent (e.g. as a form modified with a domain recognised by another molecule, which

                conjugate, such as addition of a fluorescent tag used for the purposes of detection).
 5       3) purification or sorting of FcRn-bearing cells labeled by binding to candidate modified

   Also provided by the present invention is provided an assay suitable for assessing the ability
   of a test molecule such as an antibody molecule to block FcRn activity and in particular the
   ability of the cells to recycle IgG. Such an assay may be useful for identifying inhibitors of
10 FcRn activity, such as antibody molecules or small molecules and as such may also be useful
   as a batch release assay in the production of such an inhibitor.

20         e) detecting the amount of IgG recycled by the cells by determining the amount of IgG

   Suitable cells include Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) II cells. Transfection of
   MDCKII cells with human FcRn alpha chain and human P2 microglobulin (p2M) has
   previously been described by Claypool et al., 2002, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277, 31,
25 28038-28050. This paper also describes recycling of IgG by these transfected cells.
   Media for supporting the cells during testing includes complete media comprising MEM
   (Gibco #21090-022), 1 x non-essential amino acids (Gibco 11140-035), 1 x sodium pyruvate
   (Gibco #11360-039), and L-glutamine (Gibco # 25 030-024).
   Acidic wash can be prepared by taking HBSS+ (PAA #H15-008) and adding IM MES until a
30 pH 5.9 +/- 0.5 is reached. BSA about 1% may also be added (Sigma # A9647).

   A neutral wash can be prepared by taking HBSS+ (PAA #H15-008) and adding 1OM Hepes
   pH 7.2 +/- 0.5 is reached. BSA about 1% may also be added (Sigma # A9647).
   Washing the cells with acidic buffer removes the unbound test antibody and unbound IgG
   and allows further analysis to be performed. Acidic conditions used in step (b) encourage the
 5 binding of the IgG to FcRn and internalisation and recycling of the same.
   The amount of test antibody or fragment and IgG on only the surface of the cells may be
   determined by washing the cells with neutral wash and analysing the supernatant/washings to
   detect the quantity of test antibody or IgG. Importantly a lysis buffer is not employed. To
   determine the amount of IgG internalised by the cells the antibody may first be removed from
10 the surface of the cell with a neutral wash and the cells lysed by a lysis buffer and then the
   internal contents analysed. To determine the amount of IgG recycled by the cells the cells
   are incubated under neutral conditions for a suitable period of time and the surrounding
   buffer analysed for IgG content. If the surface and internal antibody content of the cell is
   required then the cell can be washed with acid wash to maintain the antibody presence on the
15 cell surface, followed by cell lysis and analysis of the combined material.
   Where it is desired to measure both internalisation and recycling of the IgG samples are run
   in duplicate and testing for internalisation and recycling conducted separately.
   A suitable lysis buffer includes 150mM NaCl, 20mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, 1mM
   EGTA, 1% Triton-X 100, for each 10ml add protease inhibitors/phosphate inhibitors as
20 described in manufacturer's guidelines.
   Typically the IgG to be recycled is labelled, in one example a biotinylated human IgG may
   be used. The IgG can then be detected employing, for example a streptavidin sulfo-tag
   detection antibody (such as MSD # r32ad-5) 25mL at 0.2ug/mL of MSD blocking buffer.
   Blocking buffer may comprise 500mM Tris, pH7.5. 1.5M NaCl and 0.2% Tween-20 and
25  1.5% BSA.
   Alternatively the IgG may be pre-labelled with a fluorophore or similar label.
   In one embodiment a suitable surface is a plastic plate or well such as a 96 well plate or
   similar, a glass slide or a membrane. In one example cells are coated onto the surface at a
   density that results in the formation of a monolayer.

   EXAMPLES
   The following immunizations were performed in order to generate material for B cell culture
   and antibody screening:
15 Sprague Dawley rats were immunized with three shots of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts co
   expressing mutant human FcRn (L320A; L321A) (Ober et al., 2001 Int. Immunol. 13, 155 1
    1559) and mouse p2M with a fourth final boost of human FcRn extracellular domain.
   Sera were monitored for both binding to mutant FcRn on HEK-293 cells and for its ability to
   prevent binding of Alexafluor 488-labelled human IgG. Both methods were performed by
20 flow cytometry. For binding, phycoerythrin (PE)-labelled anti mouse or rat Fc specific
   secondary reagents were used to reveal binding of IgG in sera.
   B cell cultures were prepared using a method similar to that described by Zubler et al. (1985).
   Briefly, B cells at a density of approximately 5000 cells per well were cultured in bar-coded
   96-well tissue culture plates with 200 pl/well RPMI                         1640 medium (Gibco BRL)
25 supplemented with 10% FCS (PAA laboratories ltd), 2% HEPES (Sigma Aldrich), 1% L
   Glutamine (Gibco BRL), 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Gibco BRL), 0.1%
   mercaptoethanol (Gibco BRL), 2-5% activated rabbit splenocyte culture supernatant and
   gamma-irradiated EL-4-B5 murine thymoma cells (5x10 4 /well) for seven days at 37 0 C in an
   atmosphere of 5% C02.
30 The presence of FcRn-specific antibodies in B cell culture supernatants was determined using
   a homogeneous                      fluorescence-based binding  assay using HEK-293        cells   transiently
   transfected with mutant FcRn (surface-stabilised) as a source of target antigen. 10 ul of
                                                              53

   supernatant was transferred from barcoded 96-well tissue culture plates into barcoded 384
   well black-walled assay plates containing 5000 transfected HEK-293 cells per well using a
   Matrix Platemate liquid handler. Binding was revealed with a goat anti-rat or mouse IgG Fcy
   specific Cy-5 conjugate (Jackson). Plates were read on an Applied Biosystems 8200 cellular
 5 detection system. From 3800 x 96-well culture plates, representing 38 different immunized
   animals, 9800 anti-human FcRn binders were identified. It was estimated that this
   represented the screening of approximately 2.5 billion B cells.
   Following primary screening, positive supernatants were consolidated on 96-well bar-coded
   master plates using an Aviso Onyx hit-picking robot and B cells in cell culture plates frozen
10 at -80C. Master plates were then screened in a Biacore assay in order to identify wells
   containing antibodies of high affinity and those which inhibited the binding of human IgG to
   FcRn (see below).
   Biomolecular interaction analysis using surface plasmon resonance technology (SPR) was
   performed on a BlAcore T200 system (GE Healthcare). Goat anti-rat IgG, Fc gamma
15 (Chemicon International Inc.) in 10mM NaAc, pH 5 buffer was immobilized on a CM5
   Sensor Chip via amine coupling chemistry to a capture level of approx. 19500 response units
   (RU) using HBS-EP+ as the running buffer. 50mM Phosphate, pH6 + 150mM NaCl was used
   as the running buffer for the affinity and blocking assay. B cell culture supernatants were
   diluted 1 in 5 in 200mM Phosphate, pH6 +150mM NaCl. A 600s injection of diluted B cell
20 supernatant at 5pl/min was used for capture by the immobilized anti-rat IgG,Fc. Human
   FcRn at 100nM was injected over the captured B cell culture supernatant for 180s at
   30pl/min followed by 360s dissociation. Human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was
   injected over for 60s with 180s dissociation at 30pl/min.
   The data was analysed using T200 evaluation software (version 1.0) to determine affinity
25 constants (KD) of antibodies and determine those which blocked IgG binding.
   As an alternative assay, master plate supernatants were also screened in a cell-based human
   IgG blocking assay. 25 ul of B cell culture supernatant from master plates were added to 96
   well U-bottomed polypropylene plate. Mutant hFcRn-transfected HEK-293 cells (50,000
   cells per well in 25 ul PBS pH6/1% FCS) were then added to each well and incubated for 1
30 hour at 4'C. Cells were washed twice with 150 ul of PBS media. Cells were then
   resuspended in 50 ul/well PBS/FCS media containing human IgG labelled with Alexafluor
   488 or 649 at 7.5ug/ml and incubated 1 hour at 4'C. Cells were then washed twice with 150
                                                  54

   ul of media and then resuspended in 35 ul / well of PBS/FCS media containing 1%
   formaldehyde as fixative. Plates were then read on a FACS Canto 2 flow cytometer.
   Example data is given in Figure 11.
   To allow recovery of antibody variable region genes from a selection of wells of interest, a
 5 deconvolution step had to be performed to enable identification of the antigen-specific B
   cells in a given well that contained a heterogeneous population of B cells. This was achieved
   using the Fluorescent foci method. Briefly, Immunoglobulin-secreting B cells from a positive
   well were mixed with streptavidin beads (New England Biolabs) coated with biotinylated
   human FcRn and a 1:1200 final dilution of a goat anti-rat or mouse Fcy fragment-specific
10 FITC conjugate (Jackson). After static incubation at 37'C for 1 hour, antigen-specific B cells
   could be identified due to the presence of a fluorescent halo surrounding that B cell. These
   individual B cells, identified using an Olympus microscope, were then picked with an
   Eppendorf micromanipulator and deposited into a PCR tube. Fluorescent foci were generated
   from 268 selected wells.
15 Antibody variable region genes were recovered from single cells by reverse transcription
   polymerase chain reaction (RT)-PCR using heavy and light chain variable region-specific
   primers. Two rounds of PCR were performed on an Aviso Onyx liquid handling robot, with
   the nested 2' PCR incorporating restriction sites at the 3' and 5' ends allowing cloning of the
   variable regions into a mouse y1 IgG (VH) or mouse kappa (VL) mammalian expression
20 vector. Paired heavy and light chain constructs were co-transfected into HEK-293 cells using
   Fectin 293 (Invitrogen) and cultured in 48-well plates in a volume of 1 ml. After 5-7 days
   expression, supernatants were harvested and antibody subjected to further screening.
   PCR successfully recovered heavy and light chain cognate pairs from single B cells from 156
   of the selected wells. DNA sequence analysis of the cloned variable region genes identified a
25 number of unique families of recombinant antibody. Following expression, transient
   supernatants were interrogated in both human IgG FACS blocking (described above) and IgG
   recycling assays. In some cases, purified mouse y1 IgG was produced and tested (data labeled
   accordingly).
   The recycling assay used MDCK II cells (clone 34 as described in Examples 4 and 5 below)
30 over-expressing human FcRn and beta 2 microglobulin plated out at 25,000 cells per well of
   a 96 well plate. These were incubated overnight at 37'C, 5% C02. The cells were washed
   with HBSS+ Ca/Mg pH 7.2+1% BSA and then incubated with 50pl of varying
                                                  55

   concentrations of HEK-293 transient supernatant or purified antibody for 1 hour at 37'C, 5%
   CO 2 . The supernatant was removed and 500ng/ml of biotinylated human IgG (Jackson) in
   50pl of HBSS+ Ca/Mg pH 5.9 +1%BSA was added to the cells and incubated for 1 hour at
   37'C, 5% CO2. The cells were then washed three times in HBSS+ Ca/Mg pH 5.9 and 100pl
 5 of HBSS+ Ca/Mg pH 7.2 added to the cells and incubated at 37'C, 5% CO2 for 2 hours. The
   supernatant was removed from the cells and analysed for total IgG using an MSD assay with
   an anti-human IgG capture antibody (Jackson) and a streptavidin-sulpho tag reveal antibody
   (MSD). The inhibition curve was analysed by non-linear regression to determine IC50
   values.
10 Based on performance in these assays a family of antibodies was selected comprising the six
   CDRs given in SEQ ID NOs 1 to 6. Antibody CA170_01519 had the best activity and was
   selected for humanisation.
   Example 1                  Humanisation Method
15 Antibody CA170_01519 was humanised by grafting the CDRs from the rat antibody V
   regions onto human germline antibody V-region frameworks. In order to recover the activity
   of the antibody, a number of framework residues from the rat V-regions were also retained in
   the humanised sequence. These residues were selected using the protocol outlined by Adair et
   al. (1991) (Humanised antibodies W091/09967). Alignments of the rat antibody (donor) V
20 region sequences with the human germline (acceptor) V-region sequences are shown in
   Figures 2A and 2B, together with the designed humanised sequences. The CDRs grafted
   from the donor to the acceptor sequence are as defined by Kabat (Kabat et al., 1987), with the
   exception of CDR-H1 where the combined Chothia/Kabat definition is used (see Adair et al.,
    1991 Humanised antibodies. W091/09967). Human V-region VK1 2-1-(1) A30 plus JK2 J
25 region (V BASE, http://vbase.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk/) was chosen as the acceptor for the light
   chain CDRs. Human V-region VH3 1-3 3-07 plus JH4 J-region (V BASE, http://vbase.mrc
   cpe.cam.ac.uk/) was chosen as the acceptor for the heavy chain CDRs.
   Genes encoding a number of variant heavy and light chain V-region sequences were designed
   and these were constructed by an automated synthesis approach by Entelechon GmbH.
30 Further variants of both heavy and light chain V-regions were created by modifying the VH
   and VK genes by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. These genes were cloned into a
   number of vectors to enable expression of humanised 1519 Fab' in mammalian and E. coli
   cells. The variant chains, and combinations thereof, were assessed for their expression in E.

   coli, their potency relative to the parent antibody, their biophysical properties and suitability
   for downstream processing, leading to the selection of the gL20 light chain graft and gH20
   heavy chain graft. The final selected gL20 and gH20 graft sequences are shown in Figures
   2A and 2B, respectively. This V-region pairing was named 1519.g57.
 5 The light chain framework residues in graft gL20 are all from the human germline gene, with
   the exception of residues 36, 37 and 58 (Kabat numbering), where the donor residues Leucine
   (L36), Phenylalanine (F37) and Isoleucine (158) were retained, respectively. Retention of
   these three residues was essential for full potency of the humanised Fab'. The heavy chain
   framework residues in graft gH20 are all from the human germline gene, with the exception
10 of residues 3, 24, 76, 93 and 94 (Kabat numbering), where the donor residues Proline (P3),
   Valine (V24), Serine (S76), Threonine (T93) and Threonine (T94) were retained,
   respectively. Retention of these five residues was important for full potency of the humanised
   Fab'.
   For expression in E. coli, the humanised heavy and light chain V-region genes were cloned
15 into the UCB expression vector pTTOD, which contains DNA encoding the human C-kappa
   constant region (K1m3 allotype) and the human gamma-i CHI-hinge region (G1m17
   allotype). The E.coli FkpA gene was also introduced into the expression plasmid, as co
   expression of this chaperone protein was found to improve the yield of the humanised Fab' in
   E. coli strain MXE016 (disclosed in W02011/086136) during batch-fed fermentation, using
20 IPTG to induce Fab' expression. The 1519 Fab' light and heavy chains and FkpA polypeptide
   were all expressed from a single multi-cistron under the control of the IPTG-inducible tac
   promoter.
   For expression in mammalian cells, the humanised light chain V-region genes were cloned
   into the UCB-Celltech human light chain expression vector pMhCK, which contains DNA
25 encoding the human Kappa chain constant region (Km3 allotype). The humanised heavy
   chain V-region genes were cloned into the UCB-Celltech human gamma-4 heavy chain
   expression vector pMhg4P FL, which contains DNA encoding the human gamma-4 heavy
   chain constant region with the hinge stabilising mutation S241P (Angal et al., Mol Immunol.
    1993, 30(1):105-8). Co-transfection of light and heavy chain vectors into HEK293
30 suspension cells was achieved using 293 Fectin (12347-019 Invitrogen), and gave expression
   of the humanised, recombinant 1519 antibodies.

   30078) which was prepared in reduction buffer. To the albumin solution cysteamine
   hydrochloride was added at 10 fold molar excess and then incubated at 37 0 C water bath for
25 30 minutes. Following reduction the solution was desalted using PD10 columns (GE
   Healthcare Cat. No: 17-0851-01) to remove any excess reducing agent.
   Addition of BMH linker:
   A stock solution of 1,6-bismaleimidohexane was prepared in glass vial using
30 dimethylformamide. The solution was vortexed to ensure complete dissolution of BMH.
   BMH solution was added to the desalted reduced albumin solution at 10 fold molar excess
   with respect to albumin concentration. The solution was then incubated at 37 0 C for 30
                                                   58

   minutes followed by overnight incubation at room temperature on a roller to ensure proper
   mixing. A white precipitate was seen which was spun down using bench top centrifuge.
   After the completion of the reaction the solution was desalted using PD10 columns.
 5 Reduction of 1519.g57 Fab'
    1519.g57 Fab' was reduced using freshly prepared cysteamine hydrochloride (Sigma cat no:
   30078) which was prepared in reduction buffer. To the 1519.g57 Fab' solution cysteamine
   hydrochloride was added at 10 fold molar excess and then incubated at 37 0 C water bath for
   30 minutes. Following reduction the solution was desalted using PD10 columns (from GE
10 Healthcare Cat. No: 17-0851-01) to remove any excess reducing agent.
   Mixing of reduced Fab and albumin-BMH
   Equal amounts (in molar terms) of the reduced Fab' and albumin-linker was added and
   incubated at room temperature overnight on a roller mixer.
15
   Affinity purification:
   The above mix was then affinity purified using Blue Sepharose which bound to albumin-Fab
   conjugate and free albumin. Purification was carried out according to manufacturer's
   instruction which is briefly described here:
20 Blue sepharose was reconstituted in DPBS pH7.4 and washed thrice with PBS. Following
   washing the mixture of Fab and linker linked albumin was added and incubated at room
   temperature for 1 hour on a roller mixer. After incubation the matrix was washed again with
   PBS to remove any unbound materials and then eluted with PBS7.4 containing 2M KCl.
25 Size exclusion purification:
   The affinity purified material contained albumin conjugated to Fab along with some
   unreacted HSA. This required further clean-up and this was achieved using size exclusion
   chromatography (S200 16X60 from GE Healthcare). The final pooled fractions were
   presented in DPBS pH7.4.
30 The final 1519.g57Fab-HSA conjugate was concentrated up to 20mg/ml in DPBS pH7.4 and
   analyzed on analytical size exclusion chromatography (Agilent Zorbax GF250 and GF450 in
   tandem) and was found to be predominantly monomeric conjugate. Endotoxin assay was also
                                                  59
   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   carried out and the sample was found to be below the specified lower limit of endotoxin
   content.
   Example 2 Screening of Fab' & Fab'PEG candidate molecules in the IgG recycling
                               assay
 5 To determine the ability of the candidate Fab'PEG molecules to block FcRn activity in a
   functional cell assay, the molecules were screened in the IgG recycling assay (described in
   more detail in Example 5). Briefly, MDCK II clone 34 cells were pre-incubated with
   candidate Fab' or Fab'PEG before addition of biotinylated human IgG in an acidic buffer.
   The cells were washed to remove all excess IgG and then incubated in a neutral pH buffer to
10 facilitate release of IgG into the supernatant. The amount of IgG released into the supernatant
   was measured by MSD assay and EC5 o values calculated. The EC5o values of humanised
   Fab' and Fab'PEG candidate molecules that inhibit IgG recycling are shown in the table
   below .Upon PEGylation there is a loss of potency for all candidate antibodies, however the
   extent of this varies depending on candidate.

   at 25,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate and incubated overnight at 370 C, 5% C02. The
20 cells were incubated with candidate Fab' or Fab'PEG in HBSS* (Ca/Mg) pH 5.9 + 1% BSA
   for 1 hour at 370 C, 5% C02 before addition of 500 ng/ml of biotinylated human IgG
   (Jackson) and incubation for a further 1 hour. The cells were washed with HBSS* pH 5.9 and
   then incubated at 370 C, 5% C02 for 2 hours in HBSS* pH 7.2. The supernatant was removed
   from the cells and analysed for total IgG using an MSD assay (using an anti-human IgG
25 capture antibody (Jackson) and a streptavidin-sulpho tag reveal antibody (MSD)). The
   inhibition curve was analysed by non-linear regression (Graphpad Prism) to determine the
   EC 5o. Table 1 represents combined data from 2 to 7 experiments.

   Example 3                  Affinity for hFcRn binding
   Biomolecular interaction analysis using surface plasmon resonance technology (SPR) was
   performed on a Biacore T200 system (GE Healthcare) and binding to human FcRn
   extracellular domain determined. Human FcRn extracellular domain was provided as a non
 5 covalent complex between the human FcRn alpha chain extracellular domain (SEQ ID
   NO:94) and P2 microglobulin (p2M) (SEQ ID NO:95). Affinipure F(ab')2 fragment goat anti
   human IgG, F(ab')2 fragment specific (for Fab'-PEG capture) or Fc fragment specific (for
   IgGI or IgG4 capture) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab, Inc.) in 10mM NaAc, pH 5 buffer
   was immobilized on a CM5 Sensor Chip via amine coupling chemistry to a capture level
10 between 4000 - 5000 response units (RU) using HBS-EP (GE Healthcare) as the running
   buffer.
   50mM Phosphate, pH6 + 150mM NaCl + 0.05%P20 or HBS-P, pH7.4 (GE Healthcare) was
   used as the running buffer for the affinity assay. The relevant antibody, either anti-hFcRn
   Fab'-PEG, IgGI or IgG4P was diluted to 5pg/ml (Fab'-PEG), 0.3pg/ml (IgGI) or 4pg/ml
15 (IgG4) in running buffer. A 60s injection of Fab'-PEG or IgGI or IgG4 at 10IPl/min was used
   for capture by the immobilized anti-human IgG, F(ab')2 . Human FcRn extracellular domain
   was titrated from 20nM to 1.25nM over the captured anti-FcRn antibody (Fab'-PEG, IgGI or
   IgG4) for 300s at 30pl/min followed by 1200s dissociation. The surface was regenerated by 2
   x 60s 50mM HCl at 10pl/min.
20 The data was analysed using T200 evaluation software (version 1.0).

   Example 4                  Cell-based potency
   Cell-based assays were performed using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) II cells
   which had been stably transfected with a human FcRn and human B2M double gene vector
   with a Geneticin selection marker. A stable cell clone was selected that was able to recycle
10 and transcytose human IgG and this was used for all subsequent studies. It will be referred to
   as MDCK II clone 34.
   Cell based Affinity of CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG for human FcRn
   Quantitative flow cytometry experiments were performed using MDCK II clone 34 cells and
15 AlexaFluor 488-labelled CA17001519.g57 Fab' or CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG. Specific
   binding of antibody to FcRn across a range of antibody concentrations was used to determine
   KD. The analyses were performed in both neutral and acidic buffers to determine whether
   environmental pH comparable to that found in blood plasma (pH7.4) or endosomes (pH6)
   had any effect on the antibody binding.
20 Figure 3 shows representative binding curves for CA170_01519.g57 Fab'(Figure 3A) and
   Fab'PEG (Figure 3B). The mean KD values (n = 2 or 3) were 1.66nM and 6.5nM in neutral

   MDCK II clone 34 cells were incubated in Facs buffer (PBS with 0.2% w/v BSA, 0.09% w/v

 5 or Fab'PEG for 1 hour in Facs buffer at either pH 7.4 or pH 6. The final antibody
   concentrations ranged from 931nM to 0.002nM. The cells were washed in ice cold Facs
   buffer then analysed by flow cytometry using a Guava flow cytometer (Millipore, UK).
   Titration data sets were also produced for isotype control antibodies for each antibody format
   to determine non-specific binding. The number of moles of bound antibody was calculated
10 using interpolated values from a standard curve generated from beads comprised of differing
   amounts of fluorescent dye. Geometric mean fluorescence values were determined in the
   flow cytometric analyses of cells and beads. Non-specific binding was subtracted from the
   anti-FcRn antibody values and the specific binding curve generated was analysed by non
   linear regression using a one-site binding equation (Graphpad Prism) to determine the KD.
15 Data is representative of 2 or 3 experiments.
   CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG can bind human FcRn expressed on cells at both acidic and
   neutral pH and the determined KD values are approximately 3.5 to 4 fold below the
   equivalent Fab' molecule.
   Example 5 Functional cell based assays
20 CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG inhibits the recycling of human IgG
   FcRn expression is primarily intracellular (Borvak J et al. 1998, Int. Immunol., 10 (9) 1289
   98 and Cauza K et al. 2005, J. Invest. Dermatol., 124 (1), 132-139), and associated with
   endosomal and lysosomal membranes. The Fc portion of IgG binds to FcRn at acidic pH
   (<6.5), but not at a neutral physiological pH (7.4) (Rhagavan M et al. 1995) and this pH
25 dependency facilitates the recycling of IgG.
   Once it is taken up by pinocytosis and enters the acidic endosome, IgG bound to FcRn will be
   recycled along with the FcRn to the cell surface, whereas at the physiologically neutral pH
   the IgG will be released. (Ober RJ et al. 2004, The Journal of Immunology, 172, 2021-2029).
   Any IgG not bound to FcRn will enter the lysosomal degradative pathway.
30 An in vitro assay was established to examine the ability of CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG or
   Fab' to inhibit the IgG recycling capabilities of FcRn. Briefly, MDCK II clone 34 cells were
   incubated in the presence or absence of CA170_015 19.g57 Fab' or CA170_01519.g57
                                                  64

   Fab'PEG before addition of biotinylated human IgG in an acidic buffer (pH 5.9) to allow
   binding to FcRn. All excess antibody was removed and the cells incubated in a neutral pH
   buffer (pH 7.2) which allows release of surface-exposed, bound IgG into the supernatant. The
   inhibition of FcRn was followed using an MSD assay to detect the amount of IgG recycled
 5 and thus released into the supernatant.
   Figure 4                    shows CA170_01519.g57 inhibits IgG recycling in MDCK II clone 34 cells.
   MDCK II clone 34 cells were plated at 25,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate and incubated
   overnight at 37 0 C, 5% C02. The cells were incubated with CA170_01519.g57 Fab' or
10 Fab'PEG in HBSS* (Ca/Mg) pH 5.9 + 1% BSA for 1 hour at 37 0 C, 5% Co              2 before addition
   of 500 ng/ml of biotinylated human IgG (Jackson) and incubation for a further 1 hour. The
   cells were washed with HBSS* pH 5.9 then incubated at 37 0 C, 5% C02 for 2 hours in HBSS*
   pH 7.2. The supernatant was removed from the cells and analysed for total IgG using an
   MSD assay (using an anti-human IgG capture antibody (Jackson) and a streptavidin-sulpho
15 tag reveal antibody (MSD)). The inhibition curve was analysed by non-linear regression
   (Graphpad Prism) to determine the EC5 o. The graph represents combined data from 6 or 7
   experiments.
   As shown in Figure.4 CA170_01519.g57 Fab' and CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG inhibit IgG
   recycling in a concentration dependent manner with mean EC5 o values (n= 6 or 7) of
20 1.937nM and 6.034nM respectively. Hence the CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG is
   approximately 3 fold less potent than CA170_01519.g57 Fab' in inhibiting IgG recycling.
   CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG inhibits the transcytosis of human IgG
   FcRn can traffic IgG across polarised epithelial cell layers in both the apical to basolateral
25 and basolateral to apical directions and thus plays an important role in permitting IgG to
   move between the circulation and lumen at mucosal barriers (Claypool et al. 2004 Mol Biol
   Cell 15(4):1746-59).
   An in vitro assay was established to examine the ability of CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG to
   inhibit FcRn dependent IgG transcytosis. Briefly, MDCK II clone 34 cells were plated in a 24
30 well transwell plate and allowed to form monolayers over 3 days. The cells were then pre
   incubated with CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG on the apical surface before the addition of
   biotinylated human IgG in an acidic buffer which facilitates binding to FcRn. The human IgG
   is transcytosed through the cells from the apical to basolateral side and released into a neutral
                                                         65

   buffer in the lower chamber. Levels of IgG on the basolateral side were then measured using
   an MSD assay.
   Figure 5 shows CA170_015 19.g57 Fab'PEG inhibits apical to basolateral IgG transcytosis
   in MDCK II clone 34 cells.
 5 MDCK II clone 34 cells were plated at 500,000 cells per well of a 24 well transwell plate
   and incubated for 3 days at 370 C, 5% C02 until monolayers were formed. The pH of the
   apical compartment was adjusted to 5.9 and the basolateral side to 7.2 in a HBSS*(Ca/Mg)
   buffer + 1%BSA. Cells on the apical compartment were pre-incubated with
   CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG for 1 hour before addition of 2.5pg/ml biotinylated human IgG
10 (Jackson) at the indicated concentrations for 4 hours at 370 C, 5% C02. The basolateral
   medium was then collected and total IgG measured by MSD assay (using an anti-human IgG
   capture antibody (Jackson) and a streptavidin-sulpho tag reveal antibody (MSD)). The
   inhibition curve was analysed by non-linear regression (Graphpad Prism) to determine the
   EC 5o. The graph represents combined data from 3 experiments.
15 In summary Figure 5 shows that CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG can inhibit the apical to
   basolateral transcytosis of human IgG in a concentration dependent manner with an EC5 o

20 CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG inhibits both IgG recycling and transcytosis. The EC 5 oof 6nM
   achieved in the IgG recycling assay is comparable to the cell affinity binding data in which
   KD values of 6.5nM in neutral buffer and 5.42nM in acidic buffer were obtained.
   CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG does show a slight reduction in potency compared to the Fab'
   alone, but compared to many of the other candidate molecules assessed showed the lowest
25 drop in potency between the two formats (see supra). In the IgG transcytosis assay an EC5o
   of 25.5nM was obtained.
   The data in this section have clearly shown that CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG can inhibit
   human FcRn function.

   Example 6 Cross reactivity of CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG with non-human primate
   FcRn.
   To validate the use of CA1 70_01519.g57 Fab'PEG in a non-human primate PK/PD study and
   pre-clinical toxicology, its relative affinity and functional potency with cynomolgus macaque
 5 FcRn was examined. MDCK II cells stably transfected with cynomolgus macaque FcRn and
   B2M (MDCKII (cm)) were used for the following studies alongside the previously described
   MDCK II cells stably transfected with human FcRn and B2M (MDCK II clone 34).
   Cell based affinity of CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG for cynomolgus monkey FcRn
10 To determine the cell based binding affinity of CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG for cynomolgus
   monkey FcRn, quantitative flow cytometry experiments were performed using MDCK II
   (cm) cells and AlexaFluor 488-labelled CA170_01519.g57 Fab' or Fab'PEG. Specific
   binding of antibody to cynomolgus macaque FcRn across a range of antibody concentrations
   was used to determine KD. Antibody binding was performed in both neutral and acidic pH to
15 determine the effect of binding FcRn in neutral blood plasma or acidic endosomes and to
   therefore determine any effect pH may have on CA170_01519.g57 binding to cynomolgus
   macaque FcRn.
   Figure 6- shows CA170_01519.g57 Fab' (A) and CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG (B) binding
   on MDCK II (cm) cells in acidic and neutral pH.
20 MDCK II (cm) cells were incubated in Facs buffer (PBS with 0.2% w/v BSA, 0.09% w/v
   NaN3) for 30 mins prior to the addition of Alexa-fluor 488 labelled CA170_01519.g57 Fab'
   or Fab'PEG for 1 hour in Facs buffer at either pH 7.4 or pH 6. The final antibody
   concentrations ranged from 931nM to 0.002nM. The cells were washed in ice cold Facs
   buffer then analysed by flow cytometry using a Guava flow cytometer (Millipore, UK).
25 Titration data sets were also produced for isotype control antibodies for each antibody format
   to determine non specific binding. The number of moles of bound antibody was calculated by
   using interpolated values from a standard curve generated from beads carrying varying
   amounts of fluorescent dye. Geometric mean fluorescence values were determined in the
   flow cytometric analyses of cells and beads. Non-specific binding was subtracted from the
30 anti-FcRn antibody values and the specific binding curve generated was analysed by non
   linear regression using a one-site binding equation (Graphpad Prism) to determine the KD.
   Data is representative of between 2 and 3 experiments.

   Figure 6 shows representative binding curves for CA17001519.g57 Fab' (Figure 6A) and

   for CA17001519.g57 Fab' and Fab'PEG are shown in Table 5. These values are comparable
   to the KD values obtained for CA170_01519.g57 Fab' and Fab'PEG binding to human FcRn
   (see table 4)
   CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG inhibits the recycling of cynomolgus monkey IgG
10 To determine if CA70_ 01519.g57 Fab'PEG is functionally active in blocking cynomolgus
   monkey FcRn, MDCK II (cm) cells were used to examine the ability of CA170_01519.g57
   Fab'PEG to inhibit the recycling of cynomolgus macaque IgG as described previously for the
   human FcRn assay. The assay was run alongside representative human assays to allow for a
   comparison between the two.
15 Briefly, MDCK II cells (clone 34 or cm) were pre-incubated with CA170_01519.g57
   Fab'PEG before addition of biotinylated human (h) or cynomolgus macaque (c) IgG in an
   acidic buffer to allow binding to FcRn. All excess CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG and
   biotinylated IgG were removed and the cells incubated in a neutral pH buffer to allow release
   of IgG into the supernatant. The inhibition of FcRn was assessed by detecting the amount of
20 IgG present in the supernatant by MSD assay and percent inhibition calculated.
   As shown in Figure 7, CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG can inhibit both human and cynomolgus
   macaque IgG recycling in a concentration dependent manner, with EC5o values of 8.448nM
   and 5.988nM respectively. Inhibition of FcRn by CA170_01519.g57 Fab'PEG in the human
   and cynomolgus macaque assays are comparable, although it appears slightly more potent
25 against the cynomolgus FcRn.

15 Example 7 Effect of 01519g Fab PEG in cynomolgus monkey
   This was a study of the effect of the administration of 01519g Fab PEG in cynomolgus
   monkeys, in single, intermittent or repeated dosing regimens. 01519g Fab PEG was
   administered by intravenous infusion, as a single dose or in repeat doses to groups of four
   cynomolgus monkeys as indicated in Table 7. Plasma IgG and the pharmacokinetics of the
20 01519g Fab PEG were monitored by immunoassay (see Table 7A for immunoassay methods)
   and LC-MS/MS. Assay of plasma albumin was conducted at Covance.

   Immunoassay and LC-MS/MS plasma IgG data were in good agreement. Plasma IgG was
   reduced by the administration of Fab PEG (see Fig 12 and Figure 14). For both Phase I dose
 5 groups, a single dose of Fab PEG reduced plasma IgG by approximately 70-80%, reaching a
   nadir at approximately 7 days and returning to pre-dosing levels by day 63. Redosing at day
   67 achieved similar results.
   For both Phase II dose groups, 4 weekly doses of the Fab PEG reduced plasma IgG by
   approximately 70-80%, again reaching a nadir at about 7 days after the first dose. The results
10 are shown in Figure 13.

 5 Effect on plasma IgG concentration.
   Immunoassay and LC-MS/MS plasma IgG data were in good agreement. Plasma IgG was
   reduced by the administration of anti-FcRn Fab'PEG or anti-FcRn IgG4P (see Figures 15 and
    16 and Figures 17 and 18 respectively; see Figure 19 for control). For both anti-FcRn entities,
   a single dose reduced plasma IgG by approximately 70-80%, reaching a nadir at
10 approximately 7 days and returning to pre-dosing levels by day 62. Redosing at day 63 or day
   65, as described achieved similar results.

   10412970_1 (GHMatters) P98231.AU.1

   Repeated dosing of anti-FcRn Fab'PEG or IgG4P reduced plasma IgG by approximately 60
   80% and maintained the level of IgG for the duration of the dose period. Again, the nadir was
   reached at about 7 days after the first dose. The results are shown in Figure 16 and 18.

   results and are shown in Figures 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 respectively. The single doses of
   active compound were as shown in the Figures. In order to detect their effects on the
   clearance of human IgG (IVIG), the mice were injected with 500mg/kg human IVIG which
15 was quantified by LCMSMS in serial plasma samples withdrawn from the tails of the mice at
   intervals. Blocking of hFcRn by each of the different antibody formats tested resulted in
   accelerated clearance of hIVIG and lower concentrations of total IgG were observed
   compared to control mice.
20 Anti-FcRn treatment enhances the clearance of hIgG in hFcRn transgenic mice
   Humanised FcRn transgenic mice (B6.Cg-Fcgrtm1DcrTg(FCGRT)32Dcr/DcrJ, JAX Mice)
   were infused intravenously with 500mg/kg human IgG (Human IgI 10% Gamunex-c,
   Talecris Biotherapeutics). 24 hours later animals were dosed with vehicle control (PBS) or
   anti-FcRn intravenously as a single dose. Tail tip blood samples were taken at -24, 8, 24, 48,
25 72, 144 and 192 hours relative to anti-FcRn treatment. Serum levels of human IgG in the
   hFcRn mouse and the pharmacokinetics of FcRn inhibitors were determined by LC-MS/MS.
   Data presented in figures 20 to 24 are mean  SEM with 3-6 mice per treatment group.

20 The crystal structure of 1519g57 Fab' and deglycosylated human FcRn extracellular domain
   (alpha chain extracellular domain (SEQ ID NO:94) in association with beta2 microglobulin
   SEQ ID NO:95) was determined, with the FcRn oligsaccharide excluded in order to facilitate
   crystallization. 1519.g57 Fab' was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of N-ethyl maleimide to
   prevent formation of diFab' and any existing diFab' removed by SEC (S200 on Akta FPLC).
25 Human FcRn extracellular domain was treated by PNGaseF to remove N-linked sugars. For
   this, the FcRn sample concentration was adjusted using PBS (pH7.4) to 5mg/ml and a total
   volume of 1ml. 200 units of PNGaseF (Roche) was added to this solution of human FcRn.
   This was incubated at 37'C for -18 hours, following which the extent of deglycosylation was
   checked using SDS PAGE. Upon completion of the reaction the deglycosylated FcRn was
30 buffer exchanged into 50mM Sodium Acetate, 125mM NaCl, pH6.0.

   There was no obvious change in FcRn structure upon binding of 1519g57 Fab' (comparing
   this complex with published structures of FcRn). From the crystal structure it the secondary
   structure content was calculated to be: a-helix 9.4%; p-sheet 45.2%; 3-10 turn 2.5%.
 5 The residues interacting with 1519g57 Fab'were all in the FcRn a chain (not p2M) and are
   indicated below in bold. The residues concerned encompass all but 1 of the residues critical
   for binding Fc.                1519g57 binds in a region that overlays the Fc-binding region, suggesting
   that blockade of FcRn by 1519g57 Fab' is by simple competition, the anti-FcRn being
   effective by virtue of its superior affinity.
