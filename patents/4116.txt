                         FRONTAL PROTECTION ASSEMBLY
TECHNICAL FIELD
The invention relates to bull-bars, nudge bars and other vehicle frontal protection
assemblies for guarding or shielding erected on and in front of a vehicle to protect
the vehicle in the event of a frontal collision/impact with an obstruction (such as but
not limited to an animal).
BACKGROUND
Bull-bars and nudge bars have been known for many years and typically comprise a
fabricated product which is mounted onto the vehicle body work and sits in front of
the bumper or replaces the vehicles bumper. A frontal protection assembly typically
consists of vertical (or upward angled) and horizontal components on the forward
most projection of the assembly. The upwardly extending (near vertical) components
are positioned on either side of the vehicle radiator and usually a horizontally
extending elongate component (or tube) which connects with the two vertical
components. The horizontal components may wrap around from the front to the
sides of the vehicle at its ends. Whilst vehicles sold by manufacturers are provided
with crash protection within bumpers at least in some instances the bumpers alone
are not sufficient to provide the required degree of protection.
Some modern cars have factory installed front facing cameras and motion sensors
that are usually mounted en in or behind the front grille or within the bumper of the
vehicle. By way of example, one of the more recent image processing systems in
modern cars combines image feeds from tiny cameras mounted within the front

                                           2
grille, tailgate and both door mirrors to project an overhead 360 degree 'bird's eye
view' of the area around the vehicle onto a screen positioned on the dashboard. The
system uses complex image processing software to generate the overhead image,
and gives the impression that the camera is positioned directly above the vehicle.
One of the problems associated with such cars is that installation of currently
available frontal protection systems and assemblies such as bull-bars and nudge
bars-presents an obstruction in the field of view of the front cameras installed within
the front grille or bumper of such vehicles. As a result, currently available bull-bars,
nudge bars and other frontal protection assemblies are unsuitable for use in vehicles
equipped with front cameras and there is a need for providing an improved bull-bar
orland nudge bar which addresses this problem. It is also desirable to provide a
frontal protection assembly that alleviates the need of the camera being removed or
relocated     which   is against   engineering    recommendations     of  the   vehicle
manufacturer.
Any references to methods, apparatus or documents of the prior art are not to be
taken as constituting any evidence or admission that they formed, or form part of the
common general knowledge.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Referring to Figures 1 to 6, a first embodiment of a frontal protection assembly in the
form a nudge bar assembly 100 is illustrated. The nudge bar assembly 100 is
provided for protecting a front end of a vehicle from being damaged in the event of a
collision. The nudge bar assembly 100 comprises a pair of slanting upwardly
extending tubular members 110 and 120 extending in a generally upwardly direction
relative to the vehicle's front bumper. Each of the upwardly extending tubular
members 110 and 120 includes a respective bent upper portion 112 and 122
respectively. Each of these upper portions 112 and 122 further includes a respective
cross member 130 and 140 that extend in mutually opposite directions across the
vehicle's front bumper. A recessed number plate mounting section 150 is provided in
between the cross members 130 and 140. It is important to note that the number
plate mounting section 150 comprises a flattened profile (as shown clearly in Figure
3). The number plate mounting section 150 is recessed in an inwardly direction
towards the vehicle's front bumper relative to an outwardly facing portion of the cross
members 130 and 140. The recessed configuration allows the number plate
mounting section 150 to be positioned such that the planar back face of the number
plate mounting section 150 lies along a front of the bumper without any spacing or
with minimal spacing. The inventor has found that providing a nudge bar 100 with the
recessed number plate mounting section 150 by positioning the number plate
mounting section of the nudge bar to be in close proximity with the front of the

                                           9
vehicle's bumper allows the vehicle's factory fitted front facing camera(s) to function
normally without presenting any obstacles in the field of view of the front facing
cameras.
The number plate mounting section 150 further comprises a fastening arrangement
to fasten the number plate mounting section 150 to the vehicle frame to position the
vehicle's front bumper in between the vehicle frame and the number plate mounting
section   150.   The   number     plate  mounting   section    150  is  provided   with
openings/apertures 154 that are adapted for receiving fasteners such as bolts for
fastening the number plate mounting section 150 to the vehicle frame (located
behind the front bumper). In at least some embodiments, spacers may be optionally
positioned in between the number plate mounting section 150 and the front bumper.
Optional mounting accessories may also be used in combination with the number
plate mounting section 150 for supporting the number plate mounting section 150 in
a substantially upright configuration. The number plate mounting section 150 is also
provided with screw receiving apertures 156 for allowing a number plate (not shown)
to be mounted on the planar surface of the number plate mounting section 150.
The number plate mounting section 150 is generally elongate and extends between
two lateral ends. The recessed number plate mounting section 150 is flanked by
cross members 130 and 140 on either side. Joining members 132 and 142 are
provided for joining the number plate mounting section 150 to the cross members
130 and 150 in the aforementioned recessed configuration. Each of the joining
members 132 and 142 extends inwardly from cross members 130 and 140
respectively towards the number plate mounting section 150. Each joining member
132 and 142 is provided with an inwardly extending surface that extends from the
end portion of the cross members 130 and 140 respectively towards the adjacently

                                           10
 located lateral end of the recessed number plate mounting section 150. The inwardly
directed configuration of each joining member is structured to allow a number plate
mounted on the number plate mounting section 150 to be visible within all areas
described by an arc extending at an angle of 45 degrees forward from the edge
 portions along each end of the number plate mounting section 150 as illustrated in
 Figure 5. The inwardly extending configuration of the joining members 132 and 142
allows the number plate (mounted on the number plate mounting section 150) to be
easily viewed within the 45 degree arc. It may be understood that in at least some
embodiments, the angle of inclination of the joining members 132 and 142 may be
varied to allow the number plate to be viewed in a larger arc with an angle of less
than 45 degrees forward from the edge portions along each end of the number plate
mounting section 150. In the preferred embodiment, a plane of each of the inwardly
extending surfaces on the respective joining members 132 and 142 is inclined at an
angle 45 degrees relative to a plane of the number plate mounted on the number
 plate mounting section in order to provide the desired visibility of the mounted
 number plate (N), as previously discussed. However, it must be understood that the
 invention is not limited by the shape of the surface of the joining members 132 and
 142. By way of example, in some alternative embodiments, the surfaces for the
joining members 132 and 142 may be inwardly curved for achieving the desired
visibility of the mounted number plate (N). In other embodiments, the inwardly
directed surface of both joining members 132 and 142 may not be provided in the
form of a continuous surface and could have openings or discontinuities for reducing
the amount of material used for forming the joining members 132 and 142.
The nudge bar 100 also includes a downwardly located cross member 160 that
extends below the cross members 130 and 140 and is positioned to protect a lower

                                           11
frontal portion of the vehicle's front bumper. The downwardly located cross member
160 is attached to a lower portion of said upwardly extending members 110 and 120.
The downwardly located cross member 160 is provided with a channel 162
extending along a middle portion of the cross member 160. A lighting arrangement
comprising one or more LED lights may be optionally housed within the channel 162
for providing driving lights L (See Figure 6). The middle portion of the downwardly
located cross member 160 extends outwardly and forwardly relative to the lower
portions of the upwardly extending members 110 and 120. End portions of the
downwardly located cross member 160 extend back towards the lower portion of the
upwardly extending members 110 and 120.
Referring to Figure 3, the upwardly extending members 110 and 120 are angled
forwardly in a direction away from the vehicle's front bumper. The angle of forwardly
directed bending of the upwardly extending members 110 and 120 may vary
depending on the shape or structure of the vehicle and/or the vehicle front bumper.
in at least some embodiments, the upwardly extending members 110 and 120 are
angled forwardly at an angle in the range of 100 to 400 relative to a vertical plane of
the number plate mounted on the number plate mounting section 150.
The upwardly extending members 110 and 120 are shown to be convergent towards
a central portion of the front bumper of the vehicle (as shown in Figure 6). However,
such a feature is not limiting and the upwardly extending members
The nudge bar assembly 100 also includes brackets 180 that are positioned along
the upwardly extending members 110 and 120. The brackets 180 are adapted for
affixture to the vehicle frame and allow the nudge bar assembly 100 to be positioned
in a useable configuration. In the present embodiment, the brackets 180 are

                                            12
preferably welded onto the respective upwardly extending members 110 and 120.
However, the brackets 180 may be attached to the upwardly extending members
110 and 120 without departing from the invention.
It is also important to appreciate that in the preferred embodiment shown in Figures
1 to 6, each of the cross members 130 and 140 is integrally formed with their
connected upwardly extending tubular members 110 and 120. By way of example,
the upwardly extending member 110 and the cross member 130 may be formed by
bending a tube made of a suitable metal or alloy. However, the nudge bar assembly
100 may also be formed using non-metallic materials such as injection moulded
polymeric materials that possess suitable impact resistance properties.
Referring to Figures 7 and 8 a second embodiment of a frontal protection assembly
in the form of another nudge bar assembly 200 is illustrated. The nudge bar
assembly 200 is also provided for protecting a front end of a vehicle from being
damaged in the event of a collision. The nudge bar assembly 200 comprises a pair
of slanting upwardly extending tubular members 210 and 220 extending in a
generally upwardly direction relative to the vehicle's front bumper. Each of the
upwardly extending tubular members 210 and 220 includes a respective bent upper
portion 212 and 222 respectively. Each of these upper portions 212 and 222 further
includes a respective cross member 230 and 240 that extend in mutually opposite
directions across the vehicle's front bumper. A recessed number plate mounting
section 250 is provided in between the cross members 230 and 240. As previously
described in the earlier sections, the number plate 250 also comprises a flattened
configuration (as shown clearly in Figure 8) and is recessed in an inwardly direction
towards the vehicle's front bumper and allows the vehicle's factory fitted front facing

                                            13
camera(s) to function normally without presenting any obstacles in the field of view of
the front facing cameras.
The number plate mounting section 250 also comprises a fastening arrangement to
fasten the number plate mounting section 250 to the vehicle frame. The number
plate mounting section 250 is provided with openings/apertures 254 that are adapted
for receiving fasteners such as bolts for fastening the number plate mounting section
250 to the vehicle frame (located behind the front bumper).
The main difference between nudge bar assembly 200 when compared with
previously described nudge bar assembly 100 relates to the configuration of the
upwardly extending members 210 and 220. Unlike the upwardly extending members
110 and 120 of the previously described nudge bar assembly 100, the upwardly
extending members 210 and 220 are relatively inclined at a smaller angle and
substantially upright.
Referring to Figures 9 and 10, further embodiments of the frontal protection
assembly in the form of bulbar assembly 300 and a nudge bar assembly 400 have
been illustrated.
The bull-bar assembly 300 is also provided for protecting a front end of a vehicle
from being damaged in the event of a collision. The bull-bar assembly 300 comprises
a pair of slanting upwardly extending tubular members 310 and 320 extending in a
generally upwardly direction relative to the vehicle's front bumper. Each of the
upwardly extending tubular members 310 and 320 is welded to respective cross
members 330 and 340 that extend in mutually opposite directions across the
vehicle's front bumper. A recessed number plate mounting section 350 is provided in
between the cross members 330 and 340. As previously described in the earlier

                                          14
sections, the number plate mounting section 350 also comprises a flattened
configuration (as shown clearly in Figure 8) and is recessed in an inwardly direction
towards the vehicle's front bumper and allows the vehicle's factory fitted front facing
camera(s) to function normally without presenting any obstacles in the field of view of
the front facing cameras. The bull-bar assembly 300 further comprises an upper
cross member 390 located above the mutually opposed cross members and
extending across the front bumper or a radiator grille of the vehicle.
Figure 10 illustrates yet another embodiment of a nudge bar assembly 400. The
nudge bar assembly 400 is also provided for protecting a front end of a vehicle from
being damaged in the event of a collision. The nudge bar assembly 400 comprises a
pair of slanting upwardly extending tubular members 410 and 420 extending in a
generally upwardly direction relative to the vehicle's front bumper. Each of the
upwardly extending tubular members 410 and 420 further includes a respective
cross member 430 and 440 that extend in mutually opposite directions across the
vehicle's front bumper. A recessed number plate mounting section 450 is provided in
between the cross members 430 and 440. As previously described in the earlier
sections, the number plate 450 also comprises a flattened configuration (as shown
clearly in Figure 8) and is recessed in an inwardly direction towards the vehicle's
front bumper and allows the vehicle's factory fitted front facing camera(s) to function
normally without presenting any obstacles in the field of view of the front facing
cameras.
The number plate mounting section 450 also comprises a fastening arrangement to
fasten the number plate mounting section 450 to the vehicle frame. The number
plate mounting section 450 is provided with openings/apertures that are adapted for

                                           15
receiving fasteners such as bolts for fastening the number plate mounting section
250 to the vehicle frame (located behind the front bumper).
The main difference between nudge bar assembly 400 when compared with
previously described nudge bar assemblies 100 and 200 relates to the configuration
of the upwardly extending members 410 and 420. Unlike the upwardly extending
members 110 and 120 of the previously described nudge bar assembly 100, the
upwardly extending members 410 and 420 include a lower divergent portion which
diverge away from the lower cross member 460 and upper convergent portions that
converges inwardly towards a central portion of the car's front bumper.
In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or
less specific to structural or methodical features. The term "comprises" and its
variations, such as "comprising" and "comprised of" is used throughout in an
inclusive sense and not to the exclusion of any additional features.
It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to specific features shown or
described since the means herein described comprises preferred forms of putting the
invention into effect.
The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the
proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted by those skilled in the
art.
