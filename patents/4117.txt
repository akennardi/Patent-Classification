AUTOMATIC DAIRY ANIMAL MILKER UNIT BACKFLUSHER AND
TEAT DIP APPLICATOR SYSTEM AND METHOD
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australia Patent Application No.
2015227478, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[000 1a] This invention relates generally to teat dip applicators and backflushing systems for
dairy animal milker units, and more particularly to automatic milker unit backflushing systems,
teat dip applicators, related components, and methods for safely and efficiently applying dips
and backflushing milker units.
[0002] Dairy milking systems as they relate to the present invention include a cluster of teat
cups, each of which is matched with a flexible teat cup liner that is attached to a teat of a dairy
animal with a vacuum. Vacuum is applied in pulses between the shell and liner to facilitate
movement of the flexible liner to milk the dairy animals. Milk flows from the cow through each
flexible liner and then through a short milk tube to a milker unit collecting bowl assembly,
which collects milk from all of the animal's teats. This combination of elements is known as a
milker unit and can be used to milk cows, sheep, goats and other dairy animals. Each milker unit
is used to milk multiple animals so it must be sanitized, at least, periodically, to prevent
transmission of dirt and germs into the milk, and to help prevent transmission of diseases from
animal to animal.
[0003] Milk from individual animals flows from each collecting bowl assembly through a long
milk tube and into a milk line that receives milk from all of the milker units in the dairy. The
milk is then chilled and stored in a milk tank. The milk lines and storage systems must not be
contaminated with dirt, debris, chemicals, pathogens, or contaminated milk.
[0004] Various methods have been used to clean milker units. For example, milker units have
been immersed into a bucket filled with a disinfectant solution for cleaning. In a simple
automated variation, milker units are pulled through a so-called "disinfection trough" or multiple
troughs filled with disinfectant solution. Other systems include automatic rinsing that is usually

                                                    2
done from the downstream end of the long milk tube and cleans the entire length of the long
milk tube as well as the milker unit. This latter method involves very high consumption of water
and cleaning chemicals, and can waste milk that is in the long milk tube that is otherwise
salable. In all cases, a practically complete removal of the disinfectant solution from the milker
unit must take place before it is applied to the next cow, so thorough rinsing and/or backflushing
are necessary.
[0005] In addition, dairy animal teats have broadened milk ducts after milking that make them
especially susceptible to new infection from mastitis pathogens. To combat these pathogens, the
teats can be treated with a disinfectant solution that adheres well to the teats and which usually
also contains a skin-care component. The application of this disinfectant solution is called
dipping and can be done with a hand-held dipping cup into which the individual teats are
introduced. Dip can also be applied using manual spray devices and foam applicators. Dipping
with a cup is especially labor-intensive, but generally has a better success rate and a lower
consumption of dipping solution than manual spraying methods.
[0006] Some spraying methods are automated to spray dip from a dipping arm or dipping bar.
Automated sprayers are not precise and tend to consume much more dipping solution than
manual dipping methods. Other early automatic teat dipping applicator systems applied dip
upward from the short milk tube toward the bottom of a teat at the end of milking, but before
detachment from the milker unit. This arrangement provided some protection, but it did not coat
the entire teat uniformly. See U.S. Patent No. 7,290,497. Others have suggested automated
systems that apply dip to an upper teat portion, but most of these failed to provide: uniform dip
coverage on teats; consistent volumes of dip application over time; and protection of
downstream milk system components from being contaminated by dip and other chemicals.
[0007] In particular, most prior automatic teat dip applicators and milker unit cleaner systems
fail to adequately ensure that teat dip compositions and backflushing fluids do not enter the long
milk tube and contaminate the dairy milk lines. This problem can be caused by a number of
factors, but one possible cause for contamination results from differential pressures that develop
in dipping and backflushing devices that are connected to milk lines. Differential pressures
between the milk lines, and dipping and backflushing devices can cause seepage even through
closed valves and tight seals, so it is difficult to design, build, install, maintain, and use

                                                 3
automated teat dip applicators and milker unit backflushing systems that are safe and prevent
contamination of dairy systems.
[0008] Thus, there is a need to provide backflushing and teat dip application automatically and
in a conveniently arranged system that also ensures that the dip solutions and backflushing
fluids do not contaminate the dairy system and milk supply.
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0009] It is the object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
one or more of the above disadvantages or to provide a useful alternative.

water supply, and the backflush fluid supply; and
      a safety valve in fluid communication with the stall control, and the safety valve is in fluid
communication with and adjacent to a downstream portion of the milker unit, and the safety
valve comprises a backflush piston for movement between a milking position and a backflush
position.
[0009d] There is also disclosed herein a system for cleaning a dairy animal milker unit, and for
applying dip to a dairy animal, the system comprising:
      a main control;
      a first air supply in fluid communication with the main control;
      a water supply in fluid communication with the main control;
      a backflush fluid supply in fluid communication with the main control;
      a dip supply in fluid communication with the main control;
      a stall control in fluid communication with the first air supply, a second air supply, the
water supply, the backflush fluid supply, and the dip supply;
      a dip applicator in fluid communication with the dip supply; and
      a safety valve in fluid communication with the stall control, and the safety valve is in fluid
communication with and adjacent to a downstream portion of the milker unit, and the safety
valve comprises:
      a backflush piston for movement between a milking position and a backflush position; and
      a dip valve piston for movement between a milking position and a dipping position, and in
communication with the dip supply and the dip applicator.
[0010] The present invention is directed to systems and methods that automatically backflush
milker units and can automatically apply teat dip to dairy animal teats. Generally, when dip
application is to be performed with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it occurs
automatically near the end of milking, when milk flow through the milker unit diminishes and

                                                  5
vacuum is about to be shut off to detach the milker unit from a dairy animal. Before detachment
from the animal, preferred embodiments of the invention isolates the milker unit from the rest of
the dairy system and delivers teat dip near the top of an animal's teats. A dip applicator in
accordance with a preferred embodiment can include; a dip supply, a pump, suitable conduits,
valves, and a manifold that directs substantially uniform volumes of dip to each animal teat.
Embodiments of the invention can be adjusted to properly time dip delivery, teat coverage, and
dip rinsing for most types of teat dips.
[0011] After dip application, backflushing is performed by continuing to seal off the milker unit
from the downstream dairy system components. Valves are operated and backflushing
chemicals, water, and air are used to sanitize the milker unit. The backflushing operation begins
near a downstream portion of the milker unit and is directed upstream toward the teat cups and
liners. Cleaning the milker unit with a preferred embodiment of the invention is more thorough
than cleaning just the cup liner and yet it does not waste milk in the long milk tube. The milker
unit and a preferred embodiment of the invention itself can be rinsed with clean water after
backflushing.
[0012] Automatically backflushing milker units cleans out milk and teat dipping solution and
prepares the milker unit for the next animal with minimal or no operator effort. Reduced
operator effort results in more consistent dipping and milker unit cleaning and improved dairy
herd health.
[0013] In embodiments, the synchronization of the dipping and backflushing operations and the
protection of downstream milk system components can be performed by a system that includes;
a main control, delivery hoses, an air supply, a water supply, a backflushing fluid supply, a dip
supply, a stall control, and a safety valve to seal the downstream end of a milker unit from the
rest of the dairy system. The system can also include valve and controls to deliver backflushing
fluids, water, and air through the safety valve and into the milker unit. The dairy system
downstream from the milker unit includes the long milk tube and the rest of the dairy milk
collecting, chilling, and storage devices, and these are protected from contamination by the
safety valve and other system components.
[0014] One main control per milking parlor can be used and comprises an electronic control,
storage units and preparation of the dipping and disinfectant solution. The main control can also

                                                  6
monitor overall system safety and can generate appropriate warning signals or shut-down
signals. There can also be more than one main control, where each controls a number of stalls
within the overall dairy.
[0015] A stall control unit controls the system at each related milking station. It can control the
time and sequence of the dipping, backflushing, and rinsing operations for individual milking
stations. The stall control can also store dipping solution in a dosing valve in preparation for
each dipping process. The dip amount to be applied can be adjusted to accommodate variations
in teat dips, weather conditions, herd health, and any other relevant conditions using a dosing
valve in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention.
[0016] A safety valve in accordance with an embodiment of the invention can be formed
integrally with a milker unit collection bowl or be mounted on or near a downstream portion of
the milker unit. The safety valve automatically isolates the milker unit and dairy system from
the dipping and backflushing devices during milking. The safety valve also automatically
isolates the milker unit from the rest of the milking system during the dipping and backflushing
processes to ensure that no dip or backflush fluids can flow into the milking system downstream
from the milker unit. The safety valve and a dip valve can be formed in a single valve unit. A
preferred embodiment of the invention can be installed as an automatic backflush system or dip
applicator only, or it can include both. Also, an automatic backflush system can be installed
initially and later have an automatic teat dip applicator added. The safety valve can also be
added to most existing milker unit types and styles.
[0017] As stated above, the teat dip applicator applies dipping solution after milking and before
the milker unit is released from the animal. Dip travels from the dip valve components in the
safety valve to the liners through dip channels that are mounted either inside or outside of the
teat cups (or shells). Consumption of teat dip with a preferred embodiment of the present
invention is comparable to the low consumption realized during manual dipping with a dipping
cup. The dip can be distributed through the head of the teat shell liner, whereby the disinfectant
solution can be distributed all around by dome flow controllers formed in the inside of the head
of the shell liners such as those disclosed in U.S. Application Nos. 12/215,706 and 12/157,924,
U.S. Patent 7,401,573, and Provisional Application 60/578,997 the disclosures of which are
incorporated herein by reference. In this way, a single introduction of teat dip to the shell liner is
sufficient to distribute the dip uniformly in the area inside the liner head and onto the teat, and

                                                  7
then it is wiped on the length of the teat as the teat cup is removed. Gravity, pressure
differential, and the wiping action of the liner during detach all ensure full coverage of the teat
from top to bottom. Controlling dip flow this way also reduces dip spray out of the milker liner
as the milker unit falls from an animal.
[0018] The milker unit safety valve ensures that disinfectant and teat dip cannot flow
downstream from the safety valve and into the milk line, despite differential pressures in the
milk lines and safety valve. To prevent seepage past valves and seals, a safety valve in
accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention can include a type of valve
arrangement known as "block-bleed-block." Standard valves and seals can fail or allow seepage
due to differential pressure on opposite sides of seals used in milk, teat dip, and backflushing
lines. The block-bleed-block function of a preferred embodiment of the invention prevents
migration of disinfectant and teat dip through valves and seals into the milk lines by supplying a
pair of spaced apart valves and a vent or "bleed" to atmosphere, with the vent being disposed
between two seals. Multiple block-bleed-block arrangements can be used in embodiments of the
invention to provide redundancy and added safety.
[0019] Also in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a
valve block that joins air, water, and backflushing supply lines and channels them to a common
outlet for efficiency. The valve block also provides a pressure bleeding vent between a pair of
seals to further protect milk lines from contamination.
[0020] Also, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a teat dip manifold
can be used to ensure more equal and consistent distribution of the dipping solution to
individual teat cups. The manifold can be disposed on or near the milker unit or safety valve The
teat dip manifold can also include a valve arrangement that isolates each liner head dip tube or
pairs of liner head dip tubes from the others in the milker unit to prevent adverse pressure
differentials in the various tubes during milking. Adverse pressure differentials in these tubes
can affect critical milking vacuum levels in the milker unit liner head, and a preferred
embodiment of the present invention may eliminate or reduce these pressure differentials.
[0021] A method for backflushing a milker unit, in accordance with an embodiment of the
present invention, includes the steps of: closing a safety valve to substantially seal off a
downstream portion of the milker unit from a dairy pipeline system; pumping backflush fluid

                                                 8
through a safety valve and the milker unit; pumping water through the safety valve and milker
unit; forcing air through the safety valve and the milker unit; and opening the safety valve so
that the milker unit is in fluid communication with the dairy pipeline system.
[0022] The step of closing the safety valve can include the step of: moving a backflushing piston
from a milking position to a backflushing position, which can include the step of: forcing air
into the safety valve to move a backflush piston from a milking position to a backflushing
position.
[0023] The method for backflushing a milker unit can also include the step of: bleeding the
safety valve at a safety valve vent, wherein the vent is disposed between an upstream seal and a
downstream seal when the safety valve is in the milking position and/or the backflushing
position, and the vent can be disposed between a backflush fluid supply in fluid communication
with the safety valve and the downstream portion of the milker unit when the safety valve is in a
milking position.
[0024] A preferred embodiment of the present invention can perform the above steps for
backflushing a milker unit in conjunction with a method for dipping dairy animal teats is
performed. The method for dipping dairy animal teats can include the steps of: moving the
backflushing piston to a backflushing position; and moving a dip valve piston to a dipping
position to allow dip to flow from a supply of pressurized dip to a dip channel that is in fluid
communication with an upper portion of a teat shell liner, and this step is performed before
and/or during detachment of a milker unit from an animal.

facility 22, in accordance with the present invention.
[0095] The teat dip applicator and milker unit backflushing system 20 is referred to
herein as "the system 20" and preferably includes: a main control 26; a compressed
air supply 25; a backflush chemical supply 28; a water supply 29; a teat dip supply
30; a conduit 31 for housing appropriate hoses and piping 32; stall controls 36 for
each milking stall; a stall supply hose 38; a milker unit 40 for each stall, and a safety
valve 60 for each milker unit 40. The main control 26 and other controls are
connected to an appropriate electrical power supply (not illustrated).
[0096] The milker unit 40 (Figs. IA, 2A, 2B, and 2C) includes: a milker bowl
collector 44; four short milk tubes 46; four teat cups 48; four teat cup liners 50
disposed in the teat cups 48; a milker unit safety valve 60 for controlling fluid flow
for teat dipping and backflushing operations; and teat dip delivery channels 62 (Fig.
2A) for delivering teat dip to upper portions of an animal's teats. The teat cups 48
with liners 50 are attached to a dairy animal's teats and alternating vacuum
(pulsation) through hoses (not illustrated) is applied to milk the animal. Milk flows
from the liners 50, through the short milk tubes 46, into the bowl and claw collector
44, and through the long milk tube 41 to the main dairy milk lines.
[0097] The system 20 preferably combines teat dipping and backflushing processes,
but the system 20 can be within the scope of the present invention by including only
a milker unit backflushing feature without a teat dip applicator or vice versa. Having
only a backflushing feature is useful for automatically backflushing each milker unit
40 after each milking or at least periodically to ensure optimum hygiene of the
                                     15

milker units 40. In a preferred embodiment, the teat dip applicator is a part of the
same unit as the backflusher, but the teat dip applicator components can be added to
the backflusher even after the safety valve 60 has been installed on a milker unit 40.
The system 20 of the present invention can be used in dairy harvesting facilities of
any configuration including rotary milking parlors.
[0098] Fig. lB illustrates another teat dip and backflushing system that includes an
applicator 831 that applies dip to a cow or other dairy animal teat. The applicator
831 includes a control panel 832 and a dip manifold 834. A teat cup shell 836, a
liner 838, a first backflush valve 840, a short milk tube 842, a milker unit collection
bowl 844, milk line 846, and a second backflush valve 848 are also provided to work
as part of or in conjunction with the applicator 831.
[0099] The control panel 832 remotely controls operation of the teat dip application
system 830. It can be automated with suitable manual overrides or it can be operated
by manually engaging various control buttons in response to audible and/or visual
signals reflecting the stage of a milking and backflush operation.
[0100] The control panel 832 controls the flow of air 837, water 839, teat dip 841,
and any appropriate three-way valve ventilation that may be necessary. A vent 845
is also provided. The control panel 832 can remotely control valves elsewhere within
the system 830 or it can incorporate valves and hose connections for controlling air,
water, teat dip, and valve ventilation.
[0101] The control panel 832 is in fluid communication with the dip manifold 834
via a manifold hose 850. The dip manifold 834 is illustrated as feeding a single teat
dip applicator and milker unit combination, but the manifold 834 preferably serves a
number of liners 838 and milker unit combinations. The dip manifold 834 is in fluid
communication with each teat dip liner 838 via a dip hose 852.
                                      16

 [0102] The dip hose 852 preferably tracks along the short milk tube 842, the first
backflush valve 840, and passes into the teat cup shell 836 where it is protected from
damage. Alternatively, the dip hose 852 could travel an alternate route to the teat
cup shell 836. The dip hose 852 can also be routed on the exterior of the teat cup
shell 836, or be part of an integral duct (not illustrated) formed in the teat cup shell
836. The dip hose 852 forms part of a fluid conduit through which teat dips, air, and
water pass.
[0103] Once a sufficient amount of dip is applied, the dip manifold 834 shuts off the
flow of dip. Dip cannot be left inside the liner 838 because it may contaminate milk
from the next cow. Backflushing of the liner 838 is therefore desirable. There are at
least two options to backflush the liner 838. In one option, the second backflush
valve 848 is opened to deliver a backflushing fluid 859 such as water or a suitable
chemical into the milk line 846, through the milker unit 844, the short milk tube 842,
the first backflush valve 840 (if present), and out of the liner 838. In a second option,
the first backflushing valve 840 is used, and only the liner 838 is backflushed while
the milk line 846 is isolated by the backflushing valve 840.
[0104] Automatic operation of the system 830 relies on an end-of-milking signal
from a milk sensor (not illustrated) that activates the control panel 832 to shut off
vacuum to the milker unit 844. The first backflush valve 840 is then closed to isolate
the liner head nozzle 864 from the milker line 846 to protect the milk line 846 from
being exposed to dip and backflushing fluid 859. Preferably, only the second
backflush valve 848 is used, and it is activated by the control panel 832 to shut off
the milk line 846 from the milker unit collection bowl 844..
[0105] The control panel 832 then operates a three-way valve to connect the control
panel 832 to the manifold hose 850 and delivers dip into the manifold hose 850,
                                      17

manifold 834, dip hose 852, liner head chamber 862, and liner head opening 864.
The amount and pressure of the dip 851 is controlled by the valves and the pressure
of the source of dip.
[0106] Air is then forced through the manifold hose 850, manifold 852, dip hose
852, and liner head chamber 862 to force dip out of the liner head opening 864. As
the milker unit 844 then begins detachment via a standard detacher mechanism (not
illustrated), the liner head 860 mouth wipes dip down the teat sides and deposits an
excess dip amount on the teat end.
[0107] Next, normal backflush cycles are used as described above to sanitize the
liner between milkings and rinse out any teat dip residue. The system 830 is now
ready to repeat the cycle.
                                Main Control
[0108] Referring to the system 20 in more detail, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 3, the
main control 26, the air supply 25, the water supply 29, the dip supply 30, and the
backflush chemical container 28 are preferably in a room separate from where the
milker units 40 and milking operations are located. This is a preferred arrangement
for safety and hygiene considerations, but other system configurations are possible.
[0109] Fig. 3 illustrates more details of the main control 26 that delivers air, water,
dip (when included as part of the system), and backflush solution in a precise
controlled manner to the stall controls 36 located in the dairy parlor 22. The main
control 21 is preferably contained within a housing or cabinet for protection against
harsh dairy conditions. The main control 26 includes a programmable device 21 that
can, for example, store information, control operation sequences, monitor
operations, receive data regarding the condition of the system 20, analyze possible
problems, generate maintenance prompts, and provide critical control in case of
                                     18

problems. If such problems arise, the main control 26 can be programmed to
generate an appropriate signal, such as sound, light or written display.
[0110] The main control programmable device 21 is preferably programmed to
monitor and control all of the functions of the devices associated with the main
control 26, as well as, communicate with, respond to and/or control; stall controls
36, computers, other data input devices, including sensors and manual controls. For
example, the main control 26 can monitors a number of system parameters such as:
1) dip application pressure; 2) water pressure; and 3) air pressure of one or more air
supplies, and adjust these parameters by modifying operational controls or adjust
one or more pressure regulators 68. The programmable device 21 is preferably an
I/O 88 PCB circuit board used as an electronic monitoring device, but other types of
devices can be used to accommodate particular dairy installations and needs. There
can also be mounted on the main control an on/off switch, indicator lights, signal
lights, sound alarms, key pads, other input devices, signaling devices and/or any
other type of interactive device. Grommets for wire/cable connectors can be part of a
housing for the programmable device 21, as well.
[0111] The dip application pressure should be kept relatively constant to maintain a
consistent dipping process with minimum lag time, air bubbles, or other
inconsistencies. Dip from dip supply 30 (not to scale in Fig. 3) is pumped by a dip
pump 33 and controlled by a regulator 35. Dip pressure can be monitored at various
locations and adjusted to account for pressure drops/increases through the dip
application components, including a dip filter 39, mounted on the main control 26.
The dip supply 30 can store a premixed dip, a dip concentrate, dry dip ingredient, or
other dip ingredient, to be mixed automatically by the main control 26. It can
include more than one container and can include a water source for in situ mixing of
                                     19

dip.
[0112] Backflush fluids can be drawn from multiple sources including the backflush
chemical container 28 which is not shown to scale, but is representative of a single
chemical supply either premixed or concentrated, a liquid or solid chemical mixer,
multiple chemical supplies or any other source of chemicals that may be desired for
use in backflushing milker units. A backflushing flow or dosing meter and/or pump
53 is preferably used to mix a concentrate from chemical container 28 with water
and to control flow of backflushing chemicals to the stall control or directly to a
safety valve 60. When concentrates are used, mixing with water or other fluids can
take place at or be controlled by the main control 26. Various types of mixing
controls and vessels can be used, but a Dosatron, Model D25RE2 available from
Dosatron International Inc. of Clearwater, Florida 33765, U.S.A, is preferred.
Appropriate filters, sensing devices, and sampling devices for all of the supplies can
be used as well.
[0113] Air and water pressures should not be allowed to drift outside of
predetermined ranges because insufficient air and water pressures can result in
ineffective valve operations and inconsistent cleaning and/or teat dip application. If
an unacceptable condition occurs, normal operation of the invention can be shut
down and/or alarms can be initiated.
[0114] Air pressure is generated by one or more compressors (not illustrated) and
regulated by a regulator 37, controlled by an air monitoring switch 45, and filtered
by an air coalescing filter 47. The air supply 25 is set at an appropriate outlet
pressure, preferably between about 50 to 70 psi, to operate related components.
Optimum air pressure will depend on a number of factors, including the number of
milker units 40 being served and hose length from the air compressor 28 to the
                                     20

milker units 40. More than one air supply line can be used and controlled by the
main control 26.
  [0 115] Water inlet pressure can be generated by local sources or a pump used as
part of the system 20. Water inlet pressure is monitored by switch 49 and be filtered.
The water supply 29 can be any suitable source of water with temperatures, pH, and
chemical properties that are compatible with the system 20 and related chemical
solutions such as teat dip concentrates, backflushing chemical concentrates, or
simply as a final rinse of milker units 40 after a backflushing operation. A
conditioning system (not illustrated) can be included if the pH or other properties of
the local water source is incompatible with the necessary chemical solutions and/or
to minimize corrosion of system components.
 [0 16]In a preferred embodiment, one dip line, one water line and one backflush
solution line extend between the main control 26 and the stall control 36 and can be
combined as depicted with the hose combination such as the hose combination 38
illustrated in Figs. 8A and 8B. Two air lines are preferred because one air supply is
used for reliable safety valve, valve block, and dosing valve, and the second air
supply is used for slugging backflushing fluids through the safety valve and milker
unit. A single air line can communicate pressurized air from the main control 26 to a
convenient location in the dairy before splitting that line into two separate lines. The
split should be at a location that results in each air supply line having pressurized air
that is not adversely influenced by pressure fluctuations in the other air supply line.
The lines are preferably "pass through" types that allow for arrangement of the stall
controls in "series" to reduce the number of hoses leaving the main control 26.
 [0 117]A liquid level assembly 57 is preferably used for the dip and backflush
solution supply drums to provide information to the main control 26 regarding status
                                      21

of liquid levels. The assembly 57 preferably includes a draw tube 59 with inlet
screen/filter, a standard drum interface connector, and a reed switch 61. The reed
switch 61 provides a signal to the main control 26 and to parlor management
software, if desired, indicating when the supply drum is nearly empty. An example
of such an assembly is illustrated in the drum 30 in Fig. 3.
                                     Supply Conduits
[0118] The pipelines and hoses 32 are sized and configured to meet the
requirements of individual dairy harvesting facility. They may be routed together
through the conduit 31 for protection and efficiency and to accommodate the pass
through supplies described above. The conduit 31 can be plastic, such as PVC, metal
or other suitable material.
                                       Stall Control
[0119] A stall control 36 is dedicated to each milking stall (See Figs. 4A, 4B, 5A,
and 5B) in the dairy harvesting facility 22. The stall control 36 can be mounted
using a base unit 101 in any convenient location near its respective stall, including
under a platform in a milking parlor as depicted in Figs. 4A and 4B. Visual
confirmation of the physical safety features within the safety valve 60 and other
components is preferred, and appropriate positioning of the components is,
therefore, desired. The stall control 36 can also be mounted to a wall, under the curb
54 or on top of the vacuum lines in swing-over parlor applications.
[0120] The stall control 36 is responsible for initiating a teat dip application and/or
backflushing at the end of milking. Other milking operations can also be controlled
at each stall control 36. Electrical power is supplied through a separate conduit (not
illustrated). Figure 4A illustrates a milking position and Fig. 4B illustrates a
backflushing position. The stall control 36 is preferably located under the parlor curb
                                      22

 54 (in Figs. 4A and 4B) where it is out of the way, yet readily visible to an operator.
 [0121] Preferably, the electronic control 80 includes a protective housing or cabinet
 and a stall control card 86 such as a programmable circuit board ("PCB") for storing
 control parameters, monitoring, and signaling is provided. A suitable control card 86
 is an I/O 88 PCB circuit board. Other types of programmable controls can also be
 used. The stall control 36 preferably includes an interface for a computer 55 or other
programming device, sensors or monitoring devices. The computer 55 can also be
 used to program and monitor data from the main control 26. The electronic control
 80 can also include grommets for connecting'wires and cables, and it can include
signaling lights, key pads, or other interactive components.
  [0122] Referring to Figs. 5A and 5B, the stall control 36 activates the backflushing
and/or dipping operations after sensing that milk flow from the animal has ended or
after a detacher is activated to remove the milker unit 40 from an animal. The
operations begin with the safety valve 60 being activated to close downstream milk
lines, such as the long milk tube 41 and protect the milk supply. A dose of teat dip
will be pushed preferably with an air operated piston for speed, reliability and
reduced foaming from a dosing valve 84 through a manifold 540, delivery channels
62 and a dome of a milker unit liner 50, and applied to an animal's teats.
[0123] The stall control 36 illustrated in Figs. 5A and 5B preferably includes three
primary components: an electronic control 86, a valve block 610, and a dosing
valve 84 (when a dip applicator is included). Each stall has a control 86 and all are
preferably programmed identically to provide a sequence of safety valve operation
that is necessary to perform dipping and backflush or backflush only functions. The
electronic control 80 can include a circuit board such as a standard eight input eight
output circuit board at each stall to interface with a milking control (not illustrated)
                                      23

so the dipping and backflush processes are performed at a proper time and in a
proper sequence. There are several variables that allow the sequence of operation to
be varied within predetermined safe ranges, including: dip viscosity and
composition, backflush chemical viscosity and composition, the amount of available
time to perform each task, and ambient conditions.
[0124] Further, some variables can be adjusted to customize the sequence based on
particular equipment or operation needs, however all stalls are preferably set
similarly within any particular operation to ensure uniform treatment of all milker
units 40 and all dairy animals. Variables such as hose size, hose length, distance of
stalls from the main control 26, dip types, individual animal needs, condition of the
equipment, ambient conditions, and many other variables can be considered and
programmed into the electronic control 80 to provide consistent operation and
optimum dairy animal health. Further, monitoring devices can be used at various
points in the system 20 to signal the stall control cards 86 to adjust appropriate
parameters. "Fuzzy logic" controllers can be used to continually adjust parameters
as conditions change in a dairy and/or with the dairy animals.
[0125] The valve block 610, programmable device 86, and the adjustable dosing
valve 84 ensure that equal and consistent amounts of backflush fluids and dip are
used in each operational cycle. The manifold 540 is attached to a milker unit 40 and
is desirable to ensure that each dose of dip is divided equally for each animal teat.
[0126] The stall control 36 controls delivery of air, water, and chemicals to the
milker unit 40 through a hose or hoses 38. These hoses 38 are of any suitable size
and length and are preferably made of a material that is suitable for use in a harsh
dairy environment, yet flexible enough to not influence the milker unit 40 while on a
dairy animal. Using combined hoses 38 minimizes the number of hose assemblies
                                     24

necessary to operate the system and facilitates a flexible bundling of hoses. A notch
can be made in a hose bundle web forjoining of all hoses using a standard plastic tie
or other suitable means in an organized yet flexible way. Further, the hoses 38 are
preferably arranged next to a long milk tube 41 through which milk flows from the
milker unit 40 to the dairy harvesting facilities main milk lines. This arrangement
reduces the chances of the hose 38 from being damaged by a dairy animal and it
makes attachment of the milker unit 40 easier because the hoses 38 will not interfere
a with an operator's movements.
[0127] The stall control 36 can be equipped with a manual ON/OFF-Reset switch 99
which can shut down the dipping and/or backflush processes for a given stall in case
of problem. Power for the stall control 36 can be wired directly from a source or be
relayed from the main control 26.
                                      Valve Block
[0128] Figs. 6A through 6D illustrate a valve block 610 in which a number of valves
are provided for supplying multiple medias (air, water, and backflush fluids) through
a common outlet 637 to a backflush inlet 186 on the safety valve 60 (Fig. 14A). The
valve block 610 includes a housing 613 that defines an axial chamber 619 in which a
spool 621 is disposed to slide between a milking position (Fig. 6C) and a
backflushing position (Fig. 6D). The axial chamber 619 includes an upper bell
portion 623 and a lower bell portion 625.
[0129] The housing 613 is preferably oriented vertically, as depicted, to provide
drainage of fluids through a drain 634 (Fig. 6B), but other orientations can be used.
Preferably, the valve block 610 housing 613 is made of Radel R5000 from Piedmont
Plastics, Inc. of Charlotte, North Carolina and available from distributors throughout
the United States, or other translucent plastic or glass material to provide superior
                                     25

chemical resistance and clarity for operation and maintenance inspections. The valve
block 610 housing 613 is preferably arranged and molded as an integral piece as
depicted. Other materials can be used for the valve block 610 and related
components, and the valve block 610 can be formed from one or more parts. Flanges
609 or other connectors can be joined to or molded integrally with the valve housing
613 to permit convenient mounting with snap-in features, screws, or other suitable
fasteners.
[0130] The valve block housing 613 includes several pass-through inlets 614 though
which air, water or backflushing fluids flow. Pass though inlets 614 are used so that
a number of valve blocks can be arranged in series and supplied with air, water, or
backflushing fluids from a common source. Other arrangements can be used, but
arranging valve blocks in series requires fewer hoses for air, water, and backflushing
fluids and less demand on pumps and other supply components. Flow through the
pass through inlets 614 can be in either direction to accommodate a variety of dairy
layouts.
[0131] Most of the pass-through inlets 614 communicate with a corresponding and
dedicated block inlet 614a that is controlled by its respective valve to permit entry of
a predetermined fluid into a chamber 619 through conduits 614b. One exception is
the pass through inlet 614 for the second air valve 612, which communicates with
the lower bell portion 625 of the axial chamber 619 at a position under the spool 621
via passages 635a and 635b so that pressurized air can force the spool 621 into the
backflushing position (Fig. 6D), when desired.
[0132] Preferably, the valve block 610 includes five valves, as depicted in Fig. 6A
including: a first air valve 611 that provides air directly to operate the milker unit
milk safety valve 60 for dipping and backflushing; a second air valve 612 that
                                      26

moves a valve block safety spool 621 into place and provides air pressure to push
dip in the teat dip delivery tubes 62 between the safety valve 60 and the liner 50 onto
a teat; a third air valve 620 provides air for slugging backflush fluids and for
complete surface rinsing and vigorous scrubbing of interior safety valve 60 surfaces;
a water valve 622 that provides water to be used to rinse the milker unit 40 after
backflushing and the safety valve 60 in a self-rinse cycle; and a backflush solution
valve 624 that provides one or more chemical solutions for backflushing the milker
unit 40.
[0133] All valves are preferably solenoid valves, including the third air valve 620,
which is preferably a pilot operated valve that ensures air flow for backflush
slugging. Also preferably, the backflush valve 624 is made of stainless steel or other
material that resists corrosion from the backflushing fluids. For ease of reference,
each valve is joined to the valve block 610 at a seat and each seat is designated in
Figs. 6B and 6C with a numeral matching its respective valve and including the
suffix "a", so that valve 620 is mounted on seat 620a, for example.
[0134] The first air valve 611 is reserved for only operating the safety valve 60 only
to help ensure complete, independent, and safe operation of the safety valve 60. The
first air valve 611 operates independently from the other backflush valves on the
valve block 610 because the safety valve 60 must operate during dipping operations,
and before and during backflushing operations. The independent operation also
avoids pressure fluctuations that could result in from sharing air supply pressure
with other system components. The air from air valve 611 exits the valve block 610
through a separate outlet 615 for this reason. The first air valve 611 could be
separate from the valve block 610 and mounted elsewhere in the system because it
does not use the common outlet 637. Nonetheless, the valve block 610 provides a
                                     27

convenient mounting location and helps keep all of the hoses for the pass-through
 inlets 614 organized.
[0135] The second air valve 612 supplies air to the dosing valve 84 (described
below) through an outlet 617. The air inlet 614a preferably receives air from the
same air source that supplies valve 611 and the safety valve 60. Air from this air
supply can be supplied through suitable hoses, conduits, or the like. A single air
supply for the safety valve 60, the valve block 610, and the dosing valve 84 is
adequate because of the low air pressure demands of these devices.
  [0136]The spool 621 (Figs. 6C and 6D) includes an upper valve head 626 and a
lower valve head 628. The upper valve head 626 and the lower valve head 628 each
define an annular groove in which seals 626a and 628a are disposed, respectively.
The seals 626a and 628a are preferably u-cup seals oriented as depicted to provide a
sealing function in one direction each. U-cup seals provide satisfactory sealing
properties and reduce friction between the seals and the central housing 613 so that
the spool 621 moves relatively easily with a relatively low air pressure.
The seals 626a and 628a oppose each other to seal the axial chamber 619 at their
respective ends. This seal orientation can permit fluid to pass into the axial chamber
619. The spool 621 can be made of any suitable material such as stainless steel,
stable plastic, or other material. The seals 626a and 628a can be made of Viton
(FKM) or any rubber, silicone or other suitable material or the seals can be formed
integrally with the spool 621.
[0137] A valve block spring 630 biases the spool 621 toward the milking position
(Fig. 6C). The valve block spring 630 engages a seat 631 on the upper valve head
626 and is contained within cap 633. An alignment rod 639 extending from the
upper valve head 626 of the spool 621 fits in socket 641 (Fig. 6C) formed in a cap
                                     28

633 to maintain proper alignment of the spool 621 when moving between the
milking position (Fig. 6C) and the backflushing position (Fig. 6D).
 [0138] In the milking position (Fig. 8C), the spool 621 is forced by the valve block
spring 630 to engage the upper valve head seal 626a with the walls of the axial
chamber 619 to seal the common outlet 637 from the chamber 619 with an end seal
627. The lower valve head 628 is forced down into the lower bell portion 625 and
does not engage the walls of the axial chamber 619, but the lower valve head 628
includes a recess 629 that fits around and seals the air outlet 617 while permitting
drainage of residual fluids through drain 634. In the milking position, there is a
space between the spool 621 and the walls of the axial chamber 619 that extends
between most of the length of the axial chamber 619. The drain (or vent) 634 is in
communication with the axial chamber 619 to "bleed" any differential pressure
between the valves and the milk line thereby minimizing migration of dips and
backflush fluids into the milk lines. The drain 634 is preferably located near the
bottom of the axial chamber 619 to provide a drain for any fluids in the axial
chamber 619 when the spool 621 is in the milking position.
[0139] The valve block 610 is preferably controlled by the stall control 36 to move
to the backflushing position after the dipping operation. In the backflushing position
(Fig. 6D), the spool 621 is forced (upward as illustrated) against the bias of the valve
block spring 630 by pressurized air entering the inlet 635 to move the lower valve
head 628 into sealing engagement with the walls of the axial chamber 619 to seal the
vent 634 and open the air outlet 617 to the dosing valve 84. In the backflush
position, the upper seal head 628 does not seal anything because it is disposed in the
upper bell portion 623, and opens the axial chamber 619 to the common outlet 637.
[0140] The inlets for the air valve 620, the water valve 622, and the backflushing
                                     29

fluid valve 624 all communicate with the axial chamber 619 through inlets 614a, so
that all of these fluids can flow through the axial chamber 619 and out of common
outlet 637 when their respective valves are opened and the spool 621 is in the
backflushing position. The fluids do not typically flow together, instead the various
valves fire in a predetermined sequence to supply air, water or backflushing fluid at
the specific time needed by the safety valve 60, as described below. All hose
connections to the valve block 610 and other components of the system 20 can be
made with any suitable connection, including a John Guest fitting, as depicted in
outlet 617.
                                       Dosing Valve
[0141] When the system 20 includes a teat dipping option, it is preferred that one or
more dosing valves 84 be used at each stall. Figs. 7A to 7E illustrate an example of a
dosing valve 84 for use in the present invention is preferably pre-wired to and
mounted on the stall control 36. The dosing valve 84 is filled with dip after each
completed dipping operation in preparation for the next dipping operation. Each
dosing valve setting should be adjusted to provide substantially the same amount of
dip at each stall for consistent treatment of animals. The amount of dip desired will
depend on the type of dip used and operator preference with regard to the amount of
dip that will be visible on the teat after dipping.
[0142] Further, more than one dosing valve 84 can be used to apply different dips,
dip concentrations, medicaments, and the like to individual teats. When this latter
option is desired, the various controls, especially the stall control 36, can receive
cow identification information from automated cow identification systems, and
provide specialized teat dip applications to individual animals.
[0143] The dosing valve 84 includes a housing 432, a dip inlet 434, a dip feed 436, a
                                       30

dip outlet 438, a chamber adjustment mechanism 440, a solenoid valve 444, and an
air chase outlet 446. The dosing valve 84 operates electronically and pneumatically.
The housing 432 is preferably made of a translucent plastic material such as Radel
R5000 or any FDA approved material, so that visual confirmation of the adjustment
mechanism 440 position, the presence or absence of teat dip, and maintenance are all
simplified.
[0144] The housing 432 defines a chamber 450 (Figs. 7B, 7C, and 7D) in which teat
dip is measured and stored prior to being pumped to the safety valve 60. Generally,
the volume of the chamber 450 can be changed by adjusting the chamber adjustment
mechanism 440 in or out of the chamber 450. The volume of the chamber 450 is
preferably set by comparing the adjustment screw 440 position to embossments 451
(Fig. 7A) on the side of the housing 432, in amounts from about six to about
fourteen milliliters, for example. Other types of measuring markings or devices can
be used.
[0145] The dip inlet 434 is connected via a hose (not illustrated) to a pressurized
source of dip at the main control panel 26. The dip outlet 438 is connected to the
safety valve 60 via a hose or other suitable device. The housing 432 also defines a
vent hole 439, to vent air as dip enters the chamber 450 and to prevent air from
getting into dip in case an internal seal leaks, which would reduce the volume of dip
delivered to teats.
[0146] The dip feed 436 is connected via a hose to an adjacent stall's dosing valve
84, so that the dosing valves 84 are arranged in series to receive pressurized dip
from the main control 26. Such an arrangement reduces the number and lengths of
dip hoses from the main control 26, and between stall controls 36.
[0147] The chamber adjustment mechanism 440 preferably includes a screw
                                      31

housing 458, a threaded shaft 460, a shaft head portion 462 Fig. 7B), a head seal
464, and a hollow conduit 466 that extends through the length of the threaded shaft
460.
[0148] The screw housing 458 has a u-shaped portion 467 (Fig. 7E) with a recess
469 that mates with an upper rim 468 of the dosing valve housing 432 to connect the
two housings together. The screw housing 458 further includes flanges 472 with
notches or holes 474 through which screws can be inserted to mount the dosing
valve 84 to a wall or plate near the stall control 36.
[0149] The housing 432 rim 468 is inserted laterally into a back side of the screw
housing 458 so that the dosing valve 84 is unable to become disconnected when the
screw housing 458 is mounted to a support surface with screws. Additionally, the
threaded shaft 460 itself acts to prevent disconnection because the two housings are
unable to move laterally relative to one another when the threaded shaft 460 extends
into the chamber 450.
[0150] A lower end of the threaded shaft 460 is formed with or joined to the head
portion 462. The head portion 462 is preferably sized to mate with the chamber 450.
A seal 464 is used to substantially seal an annular surface of the head portion 462
with the housing chamber 450. The seal is preferably a u-cup seal.
[0151] The threaded shaft 460 includes exterior threads that mate with interior
threads in the screw housing 458. The exterior threads 480 are preferably
discontinuous 480 to reduce tooling cost. The threaded shaft 460 also includes an
upper knurled portion 482 to facilitate manual adjustment even when the operator is
wearing gloves or the surfaces are wet. The knurl 482 also connects to an air line
used to operate the dosage valve 84 to push a spool-shaped piston 500 down and the
dip out of the dosing valve 84.
                                     32

[0152] As illustrated in Fig. 7C and 7D, the spool-shaped piston 500 is disposed
inside the housing chamber 450. The spool-shaped piston 500 includes upper and
lower seals 502 that slidably seal a central portion 503 of the spool-shaped piston
500 with the inside of the chamber 450. Pressurized dip is allowed into the chamber
450 through the dip inlet 434 by the valve 444. The pressurized dip forces the spool
shaped piston 500 to slide toward the threaded shaft 460 where it is stopped to
define a predetermined volume defined in the chamber 450 between the spool piston
500 and the dip outlet 438. This is a "dip ready" position.
[0153] To apply dip, pressurized air is fed from the second air valve 612 in the valve
block 610 (Fig. 6A) to enter the hollow conduit 466 and push the spool-shaped
piston 500 toward the dip outlet 438 to force dip out of the outlet 438 toward the
safety valve 60. The dip outlet 438 preferably extends into the chamber 450, as
illustrated, to act as stop for the spool-shaped piston 500. An air hose between the
second air valve 612 in the valve block 610 is not illustrated in Figs. 6A-7E, but see
Figs. 8A and 8B for a representative hose example.
[0154] When the spool 500 reaches the bottom of the chamber 450, the dosing valve
is in a "the dip empty" position. With the spool piston 500 in this position, the air
chase outlet 446 is no longer blocked, and pressurized air that moved the spool 500
now exits the chamber 450 through the chase outlet 446 and moves through a hose,
and enters the safety valve 60 to provide an air chase for the dip moving from the
safety valve 60 to the milker unit. Thus, the same source of pressurized air used to
feed a pressurized volume of dip also, in precise sequence, provides a desired air
chase for that dip without using controllers, extra valves or other devices.
[0155] After an appropriate air chase interval, the solenoid valve 444 operates to
allow dip to flow through the dip feed inlet 436 to fill the chamber 450 and push the
                                       33

spool-shaped piston 500 to a "dip ready" position (Fig. 7C). The solenoid valve 444
includes electrical contacts 449. After filling the chamber 450 with dip, the solenoid
valve 444 closes to prevent pressurized dip from the main control 26 from damaging
seals inside the dosing valve 84.
[0156] In the overall system of the present invention, other forms of dosing valve
mechanisms can be used, and dosing valves are not absolutely necessary.
Nonetheless, the above-described dosing valve 84 is particularly effective, simple,
and reliable for providing a consistent amount of dip and chase air in a timely
fashion.
                                 Hose to Safety Valve
[0157] As stated above, automatic teat dip applicator installations preferably include
one set (or bundle) of four hoses 140 (Figs. 8A and 8B) to connect the stall control
36 to the safety valve 60. A backflush hose 142 provides air pressure to move the
milk safety valve 60 into position during dipping and backflushing operations. The
second hose 144 provides the large capacity connection for backflush solution.
[0158] A teat dip hose 146 provides dip to the milker unit 40 and a second small
tube 148 for providing a fluid "dip chase" that is preferably air. As stated above, the
dip chase 148 reduces the amount of dip required and more completely utilizes the
dip required for each milking because once the dosing valve 84 has pushed the dip to
the safety valve 60 and on to the liner 50, any dip that remains in the hose between
the safety valve 60 and the liner 50 would otherwise be flushed and wasted in the
backflush process. The teat dip hose 146 is preferably emptied before milking to
prevent any residual dip from getting into the milk.
                               Milker Unit
[0159] As depicted in Figs. 2, 2B, and 2C, the milker unit 40 can be used with the
                                     34

collection bowl 44 as depicted in WO 2009/077607 Al, WO 2008/138862 A2, US
2009/0050062 Al, US 2008/0276871 Al, as well as, other bowl and claw
arrangements. The system 20 and/or any of the individual components of the system
can be retrofitted to existing milker units 40 by connecting the safety valve 60
downstream from the milker unit 40, and preferably near the milker unit 40 because
any milk upstream from the safety valve 60 will be flushed out in the backflushing
operation.
[0160] In Figs. I and 4A, the milker unit 40 is depicted in a milking position with
the bowl 44 on the lower portion and the teat cups 48 and liners 50 directed
upwardly. This is the position of the milker unit 40 during automatic teat dip
application. The backflushing operation will take place when the milker unit 40 is
disconnected from a dairy animal (Fig. 4B) and the teat cups 48 and liners 50 are
opened sideways or downward for draining backflushing fluids. It is preferred that
the entire milker unit 40 be upside down during backflushing for complete drainage.
Alternatively, a vacuum purge method may be employed whereby the remaining
backflush solution in the milk bowl 44 is drawn back through the backflush supply
circuit to the stall control 36 with vacuum and then retained for future use or purged
from the system 20.
                                 Safety Valve
Safety Valve Overview
[0161] The safety valve 60 of the present invention is situated on or near a milker
unit to seal and protect downstream dairy milk lines from teat dip and cleaning
fluids that are fed through the safety valve to upstream milker unit components. All
of the fluids, including dip, cleansers, water, and air pass through the safety valve
60.
                                      35

[0162] The safety valve 60 has a housing with various inlets, outlets, and vents
through which the fluids flow. These fluid flows are controlled by several moving
parts including two pistons and a connector between the two pistons, all of which are
moved by springs and an air-actuated operation plate. A set of three umbrella valves
is also used inside the housing to control the flow of some of the fluids. A number of
special seal and vent arrangements are used in the housing to prevent unwanted
seepage of fluids through the safety valve.
Safety Valve DetailedDescription
[0163] The milker unit safety valve 60 is placed at or near the downstream end of
the milker unit 40, milk remaining in the long milk tube will not be flushed.
In new milker units 40, the safety valve 60 can be joined to or molded integrally
with the milker unit collection bowl so that the backflushing operation flushes out
the milker unit 40 including the collection bowl 44, the short milk tubes 46, and the
liners 50. (Figs. 2A, 2B.) Further, a system 20 installed with only a backflushing
function can later have an automatic teat dipping feature added, as described in more
detail below.
[0164] Short milk tubes 46 are also flushed and they can be of any design because
none of the system 20 components connects to or passes through the short milk
tubes 46. Nonetheless, the backflushing operation begins downstream from the short
milk tubes 46, so any milk or other material in the short milk tubes 46 will be
cleaned out in the backflushing operation.
[0165] The safety valve 60 is depicted separate from any milker unit in Figs. 9A
through 9F. Generally, the safety valve 60 ensures that backflushing fluids and teat
dip do not contaminate milk in the dairy components downstream from the milker
unit 40. The safety valve 60 also dispenses backflushing fluid and teat dip at
                                     36

appropriate intervals, and is capable of flushing and rinsing itself to ensure proper
hygiene at all points in the system. The safety valve 60 can be made integrally with
the collection bowl 44 of a milker unit 40 or be a separate unit connected to an outlet
of the milker unit 40 or be joined with a short section of milk tube 61 between the
milker unit 40 and the safety valve 60. (See: Fig. 2C.) Dip passes through a tube 65
to the manifold 170.
[0166] The safety valve 60 must move between a milking position (Fig. 9A) and a
backflushing position (Fig. 9B) to prevent contamination of the milk supply. It is
noted that the terms "milking position" and "backflushing position" are used to
designate the position of a backflush piston 120, and that functions other than
milking and backflushing can take place when the backflush piston 120 is in these
positions.
[0167] Due to pressure differentials between milk lines, backflush lines, dip lines,
and atmospheric pressure, it is desirable to do more than simply seal such lines from
the milk supply because fluids can seep or migrate past valves and seals when seals
are used alone. With the present invention, the pressure differentials are avoided
with vents exposed to atmospheric pressure to "bleed off' any pressure differential
that may cause unwanted seepage past a seal. In this manner, pressures on each side
of the safety valve 60 are isolated from one another and migration of chemicals, air,
and other fluids into the milk supply is prevented.
[0168] Generally in the present invention, the vents that "bleed" the pressure
differentials are disposed between pairs of seals. This arrangement results in a block
at one seal, a bleed at the vent, and another block at the other seal for a "block
bleed-block" feature that prevents seepage and ensures safety of the milk supply
from backflushing and dipping fluids.
                                      37

 [0169] As depicted in Figs. 9A through 9F, the safety valve 60, a preferred
embodiment generally includes a housing that is assembled from a lower housing
70, and an upper housing 74, and the upper housing 74 is covered by a cap 76. These
elements are secured to one another with screws 78 (Fig. 9E), or any other suitable
connectors, including but not limited to snap fittings, threaded housing components
or being molded integrally with one another. Separate housing portions are preferred
for ease of manufacture and assembly, but other housing arrangements are possible.
Also, the safety valve 60 can be joined to the milker unit 40 with a suitable
connector such as a screw 81.
[0170] Preferably, the lower housing 70, upper housing 74, and cap 76 are made of a
translucent material such as Radel R5000 formulation poly-phenylsulfone material,
or FDA and 3A approved material to provide for visual inspection without
disassembly of the safety valve 60. Further, translucent materials provide visual
indication of a leak and/or if the leaked material exits a vent. It is preferred that any
leakage will exit a vent that an operator can see.
[0171] The lower housing 70 includes a milk inlet 62, a milk outlet 64, a pair of
pulsation conduits 82, a pulsation outlet 83, and a hanger 66. The milk inlet 62 is
sized and shaped as necessary to mate with and be secured by a screw 81 to a milker
unit 40's downstream outlet. Alternatively, the milk inlet 62 of the safety valve 60
can be connected to a short section of tube 61 (Fig. 2C) disposed between the safety
valve 60 and the milker unit 40. The short tube section 61 in such an embodiment is
preferably short so that the safety valve 60 is close to the milker unit 40. This
arrangement places the safety valve 60 downstream from the milker unit 40 so that
the milker unit 40 is backflushed after each milking operation, but the long milk tube
41 or only a small portion of the long milk tube 41 is backflushed to minimize the
                                      38

quantity of milk that will be rinsed out of the long milk tube. The safety valve 60
can also be an integral part of the milker unit 40 by molding, bolting, screwing,
gluing or otherwise attaching the safety valve 60 to the milker unit 40.
[0172] It is noted that the terms "upstream" and "downstream" refer to the direction
milk flows (right to left and identified as "M" in Figs. 9A and 9B), from the dairy
animal to the milker unit 40, through the long milk tube 41, and to the dairy milk's
collecting, chilling, and storing facilities. During backflushing operations,
backflushing and rinsing fluids flow upstream in the opposite direction of the milk
flow. Dip does not pass through the path M because dip travels through a separate
tube toward the dip manifold.
[0173] The pulsation conduits 82 and outlets 83 mate with a pulsation port on the
milker unit 40 to provide vacuum pulsation for the milking operation. This pass
through of vacuum is not necessary in the Fig. 2c embodiment because there is
adequate clearance between the milker unit 40 and the safety valve 60 to feed
vacuum lines directly to the vacuum port 85 on the milker unit 40. The hanger 66
can be secured to a milker unit detacher mechanism (not illustrated) so that the
milker unit 40 is supported above the floor or deck when not attached to a dairy
animal. The hanger 66 may be unnecessary if the milker unit 40 includes such a
feature.
[0174] The lower housing 70 generally defines a chamber 90 that is preferably
shaped as a cylindrical cavity, but other shapes could be used to ensure proper
arrangement of parts. Milk flows through a lowermost portion of the chamber 90
during a milking operation, from the milk inlet 62 to the milk outlet 64.
[0175] The lower housing 70 also defines one or more (preferably three laterally
spaced apart) holes 92 to vent from the chamber 90 to atmosphere. The holes 92
                                      39

should be large enough to ensure adequate drainage and venting. The holes 92 are
depicted as being on a downstream side of the lower housing 70, but can be other
places as well. Positioning the holes 92, as depicted, on the downstream side of the
lower housing 70 prevents alignment with piston holes that are used to dispense
backflushing fluids.
[0176] Disposed in the lowermost portion of the chamber 90 is a seal insert 94. (See
Figs. I0A and 1OB) In a preferred embodiment, the seal insert 94 includes an upper
ring-shaped portion 96 and a lower u-shaped portion 98. The upper ring-shaped
portion 96 and lower u-shaped portion 98 are preferably formed as an integral unit
made of silicone or other elastomeric material such as (EPDM), but they could be
separate seals, if desired.
[0177] The upper ring-shaped portion 96 is disposed against an interior chamber 90
surface, and is preferably supported by a seat 102 f (Figs. 9G and 9H) formed in the
interior of the lower housing 70. When in the milking position, the upper ring
shaped portion 96 forms a seal with a lower portion of the backflush piston 120 to
seal the milk flow outlet 64 from backflushing and dip valve components. See Figs.
9A and 9G, for example.
[0178] The lower u-shaped portion 98 of the seal insert 94 is disposed transversely
to the flow of milk from the milk inlet 62 to the milk outlet 64. As best seen in Figs.
9G and 1OB, an interior surface of the lower u-shaped portion 98 includes an
upstream flange 104 and a downstream flange 106 joined to and spaced apart by a
web 108. The lower u-shaped portion 98 can be supported by a mating recess in the
lower housing 70 chamber 90 wall (Fig. 9E). The functions of these components are
explained in detail below in connection with the operation of the backflush piston
120, but the space defined between the upstream flange 104, the downstream flange
                                    40

 106, the web 108, the backflush piston 120, and necked-down portion 130 (when in
the backflush position) is a vent that communicates with one or more of the vent
holes 92 to provide a double seal or "block" and a space between for "bleeding" to
atmosphere.
 [0179] In addition, the use of seal flanges 104 and 106 as the only contact with the
backflush piston 120 reduces sticking to one another in a way that would impede
operation. Also, debris such as bedding material, dirt, and sand that moves through
the milker unit 40 is less likely to prevent the backflush piston 120 forming a seal
with the seal insert 94. It also provides clearance for the backflush piston 120 which
helps reduce damage to the backflush piston 120.
[0180] The seal insert 94 is preferably secured to the lower housing 70 with a screw
 109 and a reinforcing plate 110, which is preferably molded integrally with the seal
insert 94.
[0181] Referring to Figs. 9A-E, disposed in the lower housing 70 chamber 90, is the
backflush piston 120. The backflush piston 120 is sized and shaped to move up and
down (in the illustrated orientation) between a milking position (Figs. 9A and C) and
a backflushing position (Fig. 9B, 9D and 9E). The backflushing piston 120 operates
during both backflushing and dipping operations, so its name and lower position are
to be understood as generic terms for a piston and a closed position, respectively. As
seen in Figs. 1IA to I IC, the backflush piston 120 is substantially cylindrically
shaped, but it can have other cross-sectional shapes to ensure that it is inserted into
the chamber 90 with the proper orientation, for example. Also preferably, the
backflush piston 120 is closed at its lower end 122, open at its upper end 124, and
has a flange 126 extending radially outwardly from its upper end 124. The flange
126 has gaps 128 to permit cleaning solution to flow past for enhanced cleaning of

the seal.
[0182] Essentially, the backflush piston 120 is used to divide the chamber 90 and
seal the portion above from the portion below and to at least partially define a flow
path for backflushing fluids into the milker unit 40. Also, the backflush piston 120 is
in the backflushing position when applying teat dip and when backflushing, but not
when the safety valve 60 is self-cleaning.
[0183] As best seen in Figs. 1 A to 1 IC, the backflush piston 120 has an exterior
shape that includes an annular necked-down portion 130 adjacent to the flange 126.
The necked-down portion 130 preferably has an outside diameter that is smaller than
the outside diameter of the lower portion of the backflush piston 120, and extends at
least partially around the backflush piston 120.
[0184] The exterior surface of the backflush piston 120 further includes two piston
by-pass vents 134 on opposite sides of the backflush piston 120. The piston by-pass
vents 134 are essentially indented portions arranged transversely to the milk flow
path from the milk inlet 62 to the milk outlet 64, and are positioned high enough on
the backflush piston 120 so that a lower portion of the backflush piston 120 can mate
and seal with the upper ring-shaped portion 98 of the seal insert 94 when in the
milking position, and mate and seal with upstream and downstream flanges 104 and
106 of the lower u-shaped portion of the seal insert 94. The by-pass vents 134 do not
seal with the upper ring-shaped portion 96 when in the backflush piston 120 is in the
backflush position. This arrangement provides a vent for the chamber 90 to bleed off
differential pressure.
[0185] Next, the backflush piston 120 includes one or more (preferably two laterally
spaced) holes 138 oriented radially to the backflush piston 120. The holes 138 are
formed or machined into the backflush piston 120 so that they are directed toward
                                     42

the milk inlet 62 when the backflush piston 120 is in the backflushing (lowered)
position (Figs. 9B and 9D), and are above the upper ring-shaped portion 96 of the
seal insert 94 when the backflushing piston 120 is in a milking (raised) position (Fig.
9A). With this arrangement, the holes 138 are sealed from the milk supply by the
upper-ring shaped portion 96 of the seal insert 94.
[0186] As best seen in Fig. 1IC, inside the backflush piston 120, and adjacent to,
but not blocking the holes 138, are two longitudinally oriented and inwardly
extending flow vanes 142 that ensure that the backflush fluids flow through the
holes 138 in a desired direction. The flow direction is typically selected based on the
shape and/or configuration of the milker collection bowl 44 of the milker unit 40.
This arrangement permits the backflush piston 120 to be part of a backflush fluid
conduit that extends through the safety valve 60.
[0187] Also formed on the interior surface of the backflush piston 120 are two pairs
of longitudinally and inwardly extending key ribs 144 (Figs. I 1A and 1IC). Each
pair of key ribs 144 is disposed opposite the other. When the backflush piston 120 is
disposed in the lower housing 70, the key ribs 144 are arranged on interior sides of
the backflush piston 120 that are transverse to the direction of milk flow, and
slidably engage an upwardly extending connector 160, described below.
[0188] Disposed in the lower housing 70 chamber 90 between the seal insert's 94
interior surface and an underside of the flange 126 of the backflush piston 120, is a
piston return spring 150. The piston return spring 150 acts between the flange 126 of
the backflush piston 120 and the upper ring-shaped portion 96 of the seal insert 94.
Preferably, a metal ring 152 is positioned between the piston return spring 150 and
the top of the upper ring-shaped portion 96 of the seal insert 94 to transfer spring
loads without undue pressure or abrasion on the seal insert 94.
                                     43

[0189] The piston return spring 150 is arranged to bias the backflush piston 120
upward toward the milking position (Figs. 9A and 9C). The piston return spring 150
can be made of metal, plastic or other material, and preferably has just enough force
that can move the backflush piston 120 over friction with the seal insert 94, but can
be overcome by pressurized air to move the backflush piston 120 downward. The
piston return spring 150 and the other springs described herein can be any type of
biasing device.
[0190] To compress the piston return spring 150 and move the backflush piston 120
toward the backflush position (Figs. 9B and 9D), compressed gas, such as air, is fed
into the safety valve 60, via an air inlet 184, which applies pressure to a backflush
operation plate 230 (described in detail below) that, in turn, applies pressure to the
backflush piston 120. The piston return spring 150 is designed to yield to the
pressure exerted by the compressed pressurized air/gas, but to also quickly return the
backflushing piston 120 to the milking position (Figs. 9A and 9C).
[0191] Also as stated, the backflush operation plate 230 transmits air pressure to the
backflush piston 120, when the pressurized gas is vented or removed by the piston
spring 150. One embodiment of a backflush operation plate 230 in accordance with
the present invention is illustrated in Figs. 12A and 12B has a central opening 231
positioned around a central shaft 198 of the upper housing 74. The backflush
operation plate 230 is essentially a disk defining a recess 238 for receiving the lip
239 of the top of the backflush piston 120 so that the backflush piston flange 126 is
in bearing contact with a lower rim 242 of the backflush operation plate 230.
[0192] An outer u-cup seal 234 (Figs. 12A and 12B) fits on a mating seat 244 of the
backflush operation plate 230. Alternatively, the u-cup seal 234 could be replaced
with a seal formed integrally with the backflush operation plate 230. The outer u-cup
                                      44

seal 234 extends radially outwardly from the outer diameter of the backflush
operation plate 230 for sliding and sealing engagement with the inner surface of the
lower housing 70. An inner stem seal 236 is disposed in an inner annular recess 246
on the backflush operation plate 230 and extends inwardly to be in sliding and
sealing engagement with the upper housing central shaft 198.
[0193] When in the milking position, pressurized air can flow from the air inlet 184
of the upper housing 74 to force the backflush operation plate 230 downward against
the force of the piston return spring 150, and move the backflush piston 120 into the
backflushing position (Fig. 9B, 9C, and 9D), while also preventing backflush fluids
from flowing upward into the upper housing 74.
[0194] A second embodiment of a backflush operation plate 230 is illustrated in
Figs. 9A, 913, 12C and 12D, and has a central opening 231 and a recess 238 for
receiving the lip 239 of the backflush piston 120. Reinforcing ribs 233 are formed
above and below a wall 232.
[0195] This embodiment of the backflush operation plate 230 includes integrally
molded seals 235 and 237 around the outer annular surface and an integrally molded
seal 239 and 241 around the inner annular surface. This design is less costly,
requires fewer parts, and is easier to assemble and replace.
[0196] The upper seals 235 and 239 seal air pressure to move the backflush piston
120 into a backflush position. The lower seals 237 and 241 wipe dirt and debris from
mating surfaces when moving to the backflushing position, and seal out water during
a self-cleaning cycle.
[0197] Extending though the central opening 23 1 of the backflush operation plate
230, is a central shaft 198 of the upper housing 74 (described in detail below).
Extending through the central shaft 162, is a connector 162 that engages the
                                      45

 backflush piston 120 with the dip valve piston 268. As illustrated in Fig. 13, the
connector 160 includes a central shaft 162, a shaft key 164 at the top of the central
 shaft 162, and a pair of tabs 166. The shaft key 164 joins to the dip valve piston 268
and the shaft tabs 166 to slidably fit into the piston connection rib pairs 144 formed
on the inside of the backflush piston 120. This allows for differential movement
between the dip valve piston 268 and the backflush piston 120. The bottom of the
connector 160 bears on the inside of the lower end 122 of the backflush piston 120.
 [0198] When pressurized air is applied to move the backflush piston 120 downward,
the connector 160 is not pulled down because of their sliding relationship, as
described above. Instead, the backflush operation plate 230 continues to move down
even after the backflush piston 120 engages and slightly compresses the seal insert
flanges 104 and 106 to close off the milk passage. This additional downward
movement results in the backflush operation plate 230 engaging the tops 169 of the
connector tabs 166 to force the connector 160 downward. When the connector 160
moves downward, the dip valve piston 268 is pulled down to open the dip valve
piston 268 due to the fixed connection between the two to release dip.
[0199] The sequence of the differential movement between the backflush piston 120
and the dip valve piston 268 ensures that the backflush piston 120 has sealed off the
milk line before any possibility of the dip valve piston 268 opening. In addition, the
backflush piston 120 requires a relatively large movement to close off the milk
passage, but the dip valve piston 268 needs to move only a relatively small amount
to open. For example, the backflush piston 120 moves about .75 inches, and the dip
valve piston 268 moves about .15 inches. This differential movement is not
absolutely necessary, but it reduces the overall height of the safety valve 60, and
provides to above-described safety factors.
                                     46

[0200] The connector tabs 166 upper portions are spaced radially apart from the
central shaft 198 so that when the connector 160 is in a milking position, the tabs
166 will not engage the central shaft 198 of the upper housing 74.
 [0201] When dipping and backflushing operations are finished, air pressure applied
to the backflush operation plate 230 is released, and the dip valve spring 326
(explained in more detail below) urges the dip valve piston 268 (upward as seen in
the figures). Due to their sliding relationship, the connector 160 does not pull the
backflush piston 120 back up. Instead, the sliding relationship between the connector
160 and the backflush piston 120 leaves only the piston return spring 150 to urge the
backflushing piston 120 back to a milking position, and when the backflush piston
120 approaches the top of its movement, it can engage the connector 160 to provide
a redundant force against the dip valve piston 268..
[0202] The central shaft 162 of the connector 160 defines a longitudinal channel 168
through which backflushing fluid flows down, into the backflush piston 120, and out
the backflush piston 120 holes 138. A lower end of the longitudinal channel 168 also
mates with the flow vanes 142 in the backflush piston 120 to define a backflush fluid
conduit for flow efficiency.
[0203] The central shaft 162 also defines a slot 172 in an upper portion of the central
shaft 162 through which cleaning fluid flows during backflushing and self-cleaning.
[0204] The connector 160 extends upward, out of the lower housing 70, and into the
upper housing 74 for connection to components described below.
                                      Upper Housing
[0205] As depicted in Figs. 9A through 14A, for example, the upper housing 74
preferably includes connecting shafts 180, two air inlets 184, 185, a backflush inlet
186, a teat dip inlet 188, a teat dip outlet 190, and a guard 192 for protecting the
                                       47

inlets from damage.
[0206] The air inlet 184 enters the upper housing 74 and turns downward (Fig. 14B)
to operate the safety valve 60 by acting on the backflush operation plate 230, and it
is connected via a hose or other suitable fluid communication device to valve 611
and outlet 615 on the valve block 610 (Figs. 6A to 6D). Air through the air inlet 185
enters the upper housing 74, turns upward and through an umbrella valve 253a (Fig.
 14D) to "slug" dip and other fluids through the safety valve 60, related dip delivery
tubes, and chambers. The air inlet 185 is in communication with the air chase outlet
446 on the dosage valve 84. The backflush inlet 186 is in fluid communication with
valve block outlet 637 on the valve block 610 to feed backflush fluid, water, and air
to the safety valve 60. The backflush inlet 186 enters the upper housing 74 and the
flow is diverted into two paths. One flow path turns upward and enters through
umbrella valve 253b to clean the dip components. The other flow path extends into
the central shaft 198 and then flows down to clean the safety valve 60 and milker
unit 40. The dip inlet 188 is in communication with the dosage valve outlet 438, and
enters the upper housing 74 where it turns up through umbrella valve 253c. The rest
of the dip flow path is described below.
[0207] Generally, the interior of the upper housing 74 defines a longitudinally
extending air conduit in the hollow central shaft 198, a backflush chamber 200, a dip
inlet chamber 204, and a dip outlet chamber 206. A transverse wall 210 divides the
upper housing 74 and at least partially forms some of the chambers 200, 204, 206.
[0208] Like the lower housing 70, the upper housing 74 is preferably made of the
same translucent plastic described above for the upper housing 74, and for the same
reasons. The upper housing 74 is sized and shaped to mate with and be connected to
the lower housing 70, preferably using screws 78, bolts, and/or bushings, but they
                                     48

can also be formed integrally with one another. A ring seal 214 is provided in an
annular recess formed in the lower end of the upper housing 74 to seal the interface
between the lower housing 70 and the upper housing 74.
[0209] As best seen in Fig. 14B, the first air inlet 184 communicates with the air
conduit in the central shaft 198 to feed compressed air against the backflush
operation plate 230 and into the lower housing 70 to force the backflush piston 120
into the backflushing position (Figs. 9B).
[0210] As depicted in Figs. 14C and 14D, the second air inlet 185 is in
communication with the dip inlet chamber 204 via a hole 218 to provide pressurized
air from the dosage valve 84 outlet 446 that purges cleaning fluids from the safety
valve 60 and any related hoses, lines, and dip manifold, liner mouth piece (lipped
portion in liner head), and dip channels.
[0211] The backflush inlet 186 extends radially inwardly to the upper housing 74
and communicates with the central shaft 198 and the longitudinal channel 168 in the
connector 160 (see Fig. 13) to supply backflush fluid to the backflush piston 120,
and out of the backflush piston holes 138. Preferably, the backflush inlet 186 is
arranged asymmetrically (slightly tangential) to the central shaft 198 to allow for
adequate connection space for all of the hoses and to generate some beneficial
cleaning turbulence when the safety valve 60 is cleaning itself.
[0212] As seen in Fig. 14F, the dip inlet 188 extends into the upper housing 74 and
turns upwardly through a third opening 224 into the dip inlet chamber 204.
[0213] As described above, there is a backflush operation plate 230 that acts to
move the backflush piston 120 down. The backflush operation plate 230 is disposed
in the lower housing 70, but slides on the central shaft 198 of the upper housing 74
because the central shaft 198 extends downward into the lower housing 70.
                                     49

 [0214] Should the safety valve 60 only be used for backflushing or washing animal
 teats, there is only a need for the above-described items, and the cap 76 mates with
the upper housing 74 and the safety valve 60 functions to seal and backflush the
 milker unit 40. If teat dip application functions are desired, the items described
 below are included.
                                  Dip Valve Components
 [0215] When teat dipping is used as an option, Figs. 14E, 14F, 15, 16A, 16B, 16C,
and 16D for example, show that the safety valve 60 have in its upper housing 74 dip
valve components that include; the dip inlet 188, the dip outlet 190, the dip inlet
chamber 204, the dip outlet chamber 208, as well as the elements described below.
The dip inlet 188 is connected by a hose to be in fluid communication with the
dosage valve outlet 438, and the dip outlet 190 is connected to a dip delivery
channel (described below). The safety valve 60 includes a top plate 262, a top plate
seal 264, a dip valve piston 268 disposed in the top plate 262 for sliding movement
between a dip position (down as viewed in Fig. 14F and a milking position (up as
viewed in Fig. 9A), and a dip piston seal 270.
[0216] The backflush inlet 186, the dip inlet 188, and the second air inlet 185 are
each closed with flexible valves 253a, 253b and 253c that are preferably an
"umbrella valve" made of silicone, and connected together at 254 for ease of
manufacture and installation. (See: Fig. 17) The valves 253a-c are one-way valves
that are opened by air, water, or dip pressure to allow air, water, or dip to enter, but
the valves 253a-c restrict flow in the opposition direction because the valves 253a-c
are resilient and close when there is no dip, air or water pressure to keep them open.
The valves essentially function as suction cups when no pressure is there to open
them. Also, pressure from other fluids entering other valves contributes to keeping
                                       50

the valves 253a-c closed.
[0217] As depicted in Figs. 16A to 16D, the top plate 262 includes a cylindrical cup
portion 272 with a transverse bottom wall 273 for slidably receiving the dip valve
piston 268. The top plate 262 also includes fastening tabs 274 through which screws
78 can extend to fasten the top plate 262 to the top of the upper safety valve housing
74. The top plate 262 includes an outer annular seat 276 on which the cap 76 is
positioned. The top plate 262 can be made of any suitable material including Radel
R5000, other plastic or stainless steel. The materials used for the various parts of the
safety valve 60 are preferably the same or at least have similar properties such as
coefficient of thermal expansion and chemical resistance.
[0218] The top plate 262 and the top plate seal 264 are preferably formed together to
reduce expense, avoid an assembly step, and to ensure alignment of the various
holes. Alternatively, aligning these parts can be done with two seal alignment pins
extending downward from the top plate 262 that are preferably of a different shape
and/or orientation and/or spacing from one another and other functional components.
Regardless of which method is used, the seals 324 and 325 must match with holes
288 and 289 in the bottom wall 273.
[0219] In the bottom wall 273 of the top plate 262 there is an upstream dip opening
288, a downstream dip opening 289, and a central opening 290 through which the
connector 160 extends for connection to the dip valve piston 268.
[0220] Inside the cylindrical cup portion 272 of the top plate 262 and the top surface
294 of the bottom wall 273 defines a dip flow channel 296 with the bottom on the
dip valve piston 268. An additional recess can be formed in any of these surfaces to
help control dip flow, but the space between the dip valve piston 268 and the top
surface 294 of the bottom wall 273 is adequate between 312 and top 262. The dip
                                     51

flow channel 296 can be any shape that provides efficient flow characteristics for
dip, with the dip flow channel 296 extending between the dip openings 288 and 289.
Dip flows up through the upstream dip opening 288, across and down through the
downstream dip opening 289.
[0221] The dip valve piston 268 is depicted in Figs. 9F, 14C, 14F and 15, and is
sized to be slidably disposed in the top plate 262 cylindrical cup portion 272, and
includes a head 298 defining an outer annular seal recess 300 with a seal 301, a
central connector post 302 extending downward, a downwardly extending upstream
dip valve pin 304, a downwardly extending downstream dip valve pin 305, a number
of notches 308 that provides better rinsing of u-cup, and a grab point for assembly,
an upper recess portion 310, and a bifurcated post 312 that extends upward above
the surface of the head 298 to form a stop. The post 312 is also preferably bifurcated
for improved fluid flow for cleaning.
[0222] The central connector post 302 of the dip valve piston 268 is hollow and
includes at its lower end a receptacle 316 that mates with the connector 160
preferably in a snap relationship. The receptacle 3 16 is open at one side and to
receive the top end of the connector 160 by engaging a connector slot 318.
[0223] A dip valve spring 326 (Fig. 9E) is disposed in the central shaft 198 of the
upper housing 74 and is prevented from extending downward and out of the central
shaft 198 by one or more spring seats 328. The dip valve spring 326 is also
positioned around the central shaft 162 of the connector 160 to bias the connector
160 and the dip valve piston 268 (upward) toward a milking position.
[0224] The backflush piston return spring 150 biases the backflush piston 120
upward and the dip valve spring 326 biases the dip valve piston 268 upward despite
the use of the connector 160 joining these two pistons 150, 268. The force of two
                                     52

springs 150, 326 is not necessary to move the pistons 150, 268 upward, but they
provide a redundancy that ensures safe operation of the safety valve 60.
[0225] The dip valve pins 304, 305 each include a stem 320 and a valve head 322.
The valve heads 322 are sized and shaped to substantially close and seal the dip
openings 288 and 289 (with seals 324 and 325) in the bottom wall 273 of the top
plate 262 when the dip valve piston 268 is in the milking (or closed) position (Figs.
9A and 9C).
[0226] The dip openings 288 and 289 are sealed when the dip valve piston 268 is
closed. On opposite sides of these seals, there may be differential pressures that
could cause dip to seep past the seals 324 and 325. Accordingly, a vent between the
dip openings 288 and 289 and seals 324 and 325 is provided for the desired block
bleed-block feature that ensures safe operation of the invention.
[0227] To provide a suitable vent, there is a skirt 277 extending downward from the
bottom wall 273 of the top plate 262. The plate seal 264 is disposed within the skirt
277. Formed in both the plate seal 264 and/or the skirt 277 are two slotted vents 282
that extend radially outwardly and vent/bleed to atmosphere at vent holes 279. The
slotted vents 282 and vent holes 279 are positioned between the upstream dip
opening 288 and the downstream dip opening 289 to provide a block-bleed-block
arrangement.
[0228] As seen in Fig. 9F, two dip hole seals 324 and 325 enhance the seal between
the dip openings 288 and 289 and the dip valve heads 322, and provide initial and
secondary seals or "blocks" In between the seals 324 and 325, the top plate 262 is
vented in two places. The first vent is B5 that passes down and past the dip piston
post 302 to vent/bleed the top plate 262 out of the lower housing vents 92 described
above. The second vent is B6 that vents upward and out of the cap 76 vents 334.
                                     53

Thus, the blocks 324 and 325 are spaced apart with two bleeds B5 and B6 disposed
in between to provide important block-bleed-block functions.
[0229] When the dip valve piston 268 is in the dipping position (Fig. 14F), the dip
valve heads 322 move downward and no longer seal the dip openings 288 and 289
because the stems 320 of the dip valve pins 304 are smaller than the dip openings
288 and define annular openings through which dip flows. Dip flows up through the
upstream dip openings 288, across to the other side, and down through the

[0230] The cap 76 of the safety valve 60 is best depicted in Fig. 18. The cap 76 is
cup-shaped with four screw holes 330 for securing the cap 76 to the other portions of
the safety valve 60. Preferably, the cap 76 is made of a translucent plastic, such as
Radel R5000 for the reasons stated above.
[0231] The cap 76 also includes a pair of cap vents 334 that are formed by gaps 336
in the cap 76 and vent hoods 338. The vent hoods 338 extend downwardly from the
cap 76 and ensure that the cap 76 is vented to atmospheric pressure.
[0232] A bottom edge 332 of the cap 76 rests on the top plate 262 of the dip safety
valve 260 when present or onto the upper housing 74 when the dip safety valve 260
is not included. No seal is needed between the bottom edge 332 of the cap 76. The
cap 76 preferably includes an interior key 339 (Fig. 18) that mates with a key-way
on the upper housing 74 to ensure proper alignment and orientation of the vents 334.
                                Safety Valve Operation
[0233] As stated above, the safety valve 60 must move between a milking position
(Fig. 9A) and a backflushing position (Fig. 9B) to prevent contamination of the milk
supply by the teat dip or backflushing fluids. Due to pressure differentials on
                                     54

opposite sides of the safety valve 60, it is desirable to do more than simply seal off
chemical, air, or other fluid lines from the milk supply. With the present invention,
the pressure differential on each end of the safety valve 60 is avoided with vents
exposed to atmospheric pressure to "bleed" off any pressure differential that may
cause unwanted seepage past a seal. In this manner, pressures on each side of the
safety valve 60 are isolated from one another and seepage of chemicals, air, and
other fluids into the long milk tube and milk supply is prevented. Generally, seals
are provided in pairs with a vent to atmosphere disposed between the seals of each
pair. This arrangement provides a "block-bleed-block" function to ensure that fluid
that seeps past one seal cannot seep past the other seal.
[0234] As seen in Fig. 9C, to achieve the "block-bleed-block" function when the
safety valve 60 is in the milking position (Figs. 9A and 9C), a block is formed by the
seal insert 94, and specifically by the upper ring-shaped part 96 of the seal insert 94.
The upper ring-shaped part 96 seals an annular gap between the interior surface of
the chamber 90 and a lower cylindrical portion of the backflush piston 120.
[0235] The bleed function in the milking position (Figs. 9A and 9C) is performed by
two different paths between the safety valve chamber 90 and the atmosphere outside
of the safety valve 60 and the milker unit 40. It is only necessary to have one such
"bleed" path, but the illustrated embodiment provides a bleed redundancy for added
safety.
[0236] The first bleed path is illustrated in Fig. 9C and is designated as B1. This
first bleed path B11 is a path from the chamber 90 through backflush piston holes
138, and through holes 92 in the lower housing 70. The second bleed path B2 is
from the chamber 90 of lower housing 70 through a space between the central
connector post 302 of the dip safety valve piston 268 and central opening 290 of the
                                      55

top plate 262, through the cylinder 272 of the top plate 262, past the outer annular
seat 276 of the dip valve piston 268, up into an interior portion of the safety valve
cap 76, and out cap vents 334. The second line of "block" function is performed by
seals in the valve block 610 that controls the flow of backflushing fluids, air, water
and teat dip into the safety valve 60. Also, the valve block 110 includes a block
bleed-block feature, as described above as a redundant safety feature.
[0237] As seen in Figs. 9B, 9D, and 9E, the safety valve 60 is in the backflushing
position with the backflush piston 120 in its lowermost position with a lower surface
of the backflush piston 120 engaging the u-shaped 98 portion of the seal insert 94.
More specifically, the lower surface of the backflush piston 120 is in contact with
the upstream flange 104 and the downstream flange 106 of the u-shaped 98 portion
of the seal insert 94. This arrangement provides a double block between the safety
valve 60, milk inlet 62, and milk outlet 64.
[0238] Between the upstream flange 104 and the downstream flange 106 is the web
108 of the seal insert 94. The web 108 is spaced apart from the lower surface of the
backflush piston 120 to define part of a "bleed" path B3 (Fig. 9E) that by-passes the
upper portion of the backflush valve 120 and the upper ring-shaped portion 96 of the
seal insert 94 through the piston by-pass vents 134, and through the holes 92 in the
lower housing 70. This block-bleed-block arrangement prevents backflushing fluid
and teat dip from entering the milk supply because any seepage past either seal will
drain through the gap 111, which is a bleed path. (Fig. 9E).
[0239] The teat dip block-bleed-block function is performed by the upstream dip
valve pin 304 in connection with a dip opening 288 in the top plate 262, and the
corresponding dip hole seal 324 of the top plate seal 264. A second block is formed
by the downstream dip valve pin 305 in connection with a dip opening 288 in the top
                                     56

plate 262 and the corresponding dip hole seal 324 of the top plate seal 264.
[0240] In this arrangement, there are at least two bleed paths. Bleed path B5 in Fig.
9F is defined by a space between the dip valve piston 268 and the interior portion of
the top plate 262 cylindrical cup portion 272. B5 is further defined by a space
between the dip piston central connector post 302 and the central opening 290 of the
top plate 262, the lower housing chamber 90, and the three openings 220, 222, and
224.
[0241] Another bleed path B6 (Fig. 9F) is defined by the space between the dip
valve piston 268 and the interior portion of the top plate cylindrical cup portion 272,
upward into the cap 76 and out of the cap vent hoods 338.
[0242] Yet another bleed path is formed in the valve block housing 613 by the spool
621, so that differential pressure cannot pass the valves and into any of the feed lines
to the safety valve 120.
[0243] When it is desired to apply teat dip, the dip safety valve 260 is operated by
compressed gas such as air or other suitable fluid, mechanical device or electrical
device to move the dip valve piston 268 downward against the force of the dip valve
return spring 326 so that the dip valve pins 304 and 305 no longer seal the dip valve
holes 288, 289.
[0244] As seen in Figs. 14A and 14E, teat dip is pushed through the dip inlet 188 in
the upper housing 74. The dip flows under pressure through the dip inlet chamber
204, up through upstream dip hole 288, through the flow channel 238, through the
downstream dip hole 289, through the dip outlet chamber 208, out through the dip
outlet 190, through tube 345 joined to the dip outlet 190 with an elbow 580 and
toward the dip manifold 170.
[0245] When backflushing fluid (such as wash chemicals, rinse chemicals, water,
                                     57

and/or air) are to be pumped from the safety valve 60 upstream into the milker unit
40, the following operation takes place. It should be understood that during a
backflush operation, the milker unit 40 will not be upright as illustrated in most of
the drawings. Instead, the milker unit 40 will be upside down or at some generally
downward angle, and hanging from a detacher mechanism as in Fig. 4B. This
position aids in draining backflush liquids from the milker unit 40 in addition to a
final "air slug" that is pumped through the safety valve 60 and the milker unit 40.
[0246] Backflushing fluid enters the upper housing 74 backflush inlet 186, down
through the central stem 168, down through the backflush piston 120, out of the
holes 138 in the backflush piston 120 and "upstream" through the milk inlet 62 and
into the milker unit 40. The safety valve components as described define a backflush
fluid conduit extending through the safety valve 60 between the backflush fluid inlet
 186 and the milk inlet 62.
[0247] When desired to clean and rinse the safety valve 60, there can be alternating
pulses of air and water for any desired number of sequences after the backflushing
piston 120 returns to the milking position. Preferably, there are more than one pulse
of both air and water to provide agitation, and efficient and thorough cleaning.
Water used in rinsing the safety valve 60 also lubricates the seals for less friction
and resistance in moving the various pistons and valves. For this reason, it is also
desirable to wash or rinse the safety valve 60 prior to start-up.
[0248] Also, it is preferred to clean the safety valve 60 with the backflush piston 120
in its milking position because some milk may enter the bleed area next to the
backflush piston 120 when the backflush piston 120 is in the upper position. This
will clean backflush chemicals, teat dips, and residual milk from the safety valve 60.
This process is done automatically by blowing water and air through the safety valve
                                     58

60 before attaching the milker unit 40 to another animal.
[0249] Below are Control Operation charts that illustrate a sequence of all the
various elements that take place in a typical single cycle of the safety valve 60.
Charts A, B, and C are each a portion of a complete backflush and dip application
cycle. Chart A is a dipping and backflushing portion of the cycle, Chart B identifies
additional steps in the backflush operation, and Chart C shows the steps of a dosing
valve recharged in preparation for the next dipping procedure. (The abbreviation
"BF" in the charts refers to backflush.) From the end of milking, closing off the milk
line, dipping a cow, backflushing the milker unit, and self-cleaning of the safety
valve, to being ready for a next milking operation is about forty-five seconds, in the
preferred embodiment. Chart D illustrates steps in the system 20 operation and the
function the each step serves.

                                      Dip Manifold
[0250] A teat dip manifold 170 is preferably included to separate the dip dose into
four substantially equal quantities. The dip manifold 170 also isolates vacuum in
each liner head 172 from vacuum in other liner heads 172 (See Figs. 19A-E).
Preferably, a four quarter milker unit system includes a backflushing safety valve 60
pre-assembled to the milker unit 40. When adding the dipping function to an
existing system, the dip manifold 170 can be secured to a four quarter milker unit 40
with an air divider 174, which is part of a liner securing device or it can be loosely
attached in any convenient location. In the embodiment of Fig. IA, the manifold 834
is mounted on the milker unit collection bowl 844.
[0251] Two manifold designs are shown in Figs. 19A-E and 19F-H respectively
The primary functions in both embodiments are to prevent air flow from one teat
cup 48 to the other during milking, and provide even distribution of dip to all teats,
and to distribute substantially even volumes of dip to each teat.
[0252] The manifold 540 depicted in Figs. 19A-E includes a base 542, a cover 544,
alignment pins 546 in the base 542, four outlets 550, one inlet 552, a bladder seal
554, and outlet guards 556.
[0253] The base 542 and cover 544 are preferably molded from plastic, but could be
any suitable material. They are assembled by aligning the alignment pins 546 of the
base 542 with recesses in the cover 544. The base 542 and the cover 544 are joined
by welding, adhesive, or mechanical fastener.
[0254] As seen in Figs. 19A through 19E, the base 542 includes a manifold channel
560 in fluid communication between the inlet 552 and the four outlets 550. The
manifold channel 560 in Figs. 19C and 19D is preferably bifurcated adjacent to the
                                     64

 inlet 552 to divert dip flow to each side of the manifold 540, and then bifurcated
 again at each side of the manifold 540 for a total of four substantially equal doses of
 dip to flow through corresponding outlets 550.
 [0255] The alternate manifold channel 560 illustrated in Figs. 19F and 19G is also
 bifurcated adjacent to the inlet 552, but in this embodiment, there is no other
 bifurcation in the flow channel 560. Other flow channel designs are also possible.
 [0256] The base 542 further includes mounting tabs 564 (Fig. 14) that are used to
join the manifold 540 to any suitable location. Other mounting methods are also
 possible.
 [0257] The manifold 540 also includes the flexible bladder 554 made of silicone or
other elastomer, and disposed between the base 542 and the cover 544 to seal the
 interface between the two, but to also serve as a check valve for individual outlets
 550. The bladder 554 includes alignment holes 570 to ensure proper alignment with
the base 542 and cover 544 during assembly, and is joined to the base 542 with
 screws 545 or other suitable fasteners.
 [0258] The bladder 554 includes flexible vacuum isolation diaphragm seals 576
each of which is disposed in the channel 550 adjacent to a corresponding outlet 550
so that flow through the outlet 550 is possible in only one direction. This
arrangement of bladder vacuum isolation diaphragm seals 576 adjacent to the outlets
550 blocks pressure differentials in individual dip outlets 550 from adversely
affecting dip flow through other dip channels 550.
 [0259] The manifold 540 depicted in Figs. 19A through 19E has four independent
diaphragm seals 576 that each seal a separate outlet 550. The manifold 540 depicted
 in Figs. 19F and 19G has two independently operating diaphragm seals 576 that
each seal a pair of outlets 550. In both embodiments, the seal channel 560 is sized
                                      65

and shaped to receive a matching diaphragm seal 576, which are preferably formed
as embossments on the bladder 554.
[0260] Each of the two vacuum isolation diaphragm seals 576 includes a pair of dip
outlets to prevent pressure differentials between pairs of dip outlets 550 from
affecting dip flow through neighboring pairs of dip outlets 550.
[0261] Dip flows into the manifold 540, through the inlet 552, the manifold channel
560, and urges the diaphragm seals 576 upward against their natural bias toward a
closed position. Once the diaphragm seals 576 are open, dip flows out individual
outlets 550.
[0262] The base dip inlet 552, preferably has joined to or molded integrally with it,
a widened portion 580 to provide a gripping surface when attaching and detaching a
hose, for example.
                               Shell for Internal Dip Channel
[0263] Illustrated in Fig. 15 is an external teat dip delivery tube for delivering dip to
the liner is to pass the dip tube up along the inside of the teat cup 48.
[0264] Illustrated in Figs. 16 to 19 is an internal teat dip delivery tube 190 that is
disposed inside of a teat cup 48. The delivery tube 190 can be secured to the interior
wall of the teat cup 48 or it may simply extend through the teat cup 48 with no
connections.
 [0265] Depicted in Figs. 20A and 20B, are teat cup assemblies 700 for use with the
present invention or separately with other dip delivery systems. The teat cup
assemblies generally include a shell 702 and liner 704. The liner 704 can be the type
disclosed in Application No. 12/157,924 which is incorporated herein by reference.
The shell 702 is preferably a stainless sleeve with a TPR (thermal plastic rubber)
bottom end or cap 734. Stainless is preferred for the shell 702, but molded (clear,
                                       66

translucent or opaque) plastic or other materials can be used, making it a very simple
molded part that could include a dip channel 708 within the shell 702. This
embodiment of the teat cup assembly is preferred because it is easier to manufacture,
since the cap will be a simple injection molded piece with no welding required.
Nonetheless, other teat cup assemblies can be used with the other components of the
present invention.
[0266] The shell 702 is a simple tube. The only welding will be to tack weld the dip
delivery channel 708 onto the inside, as illustrated or outside in an alternate
embodiment described below. The dip delivery channel is well protected from top to
bottom, making the teat cup assembly 700 very robust. The dip channel 708
connects a liner fitting 720 to transmit dip to an internal dome in the liner. In Fig.
20A, the liner fitting 720 extends outside of the liner head 722, and in Fig. 20 B, the
liner fitting 720 is inside the liner head 722. These two options provide different
assembly methods and visibility while assembling the parts.
[0267] Positive keying of the liner 704 to the shell 702 is provided by two slots 712
and 714, one for the dip tube connection and one to force proper alignment, enabling
the dip channel 708 connection. Additional holes 716 will be used as snaps to help
hold the liner head 722 onto the shell 702 as cows may step on it.
[0268] A nipple 730 on the bottom ofthe shell 702 connects to a dip delivery tube
or a connection using individual fittings pressed into bosses within the TPR can be
used to provide flexibility from cow abuse with reduced breakage. The shell 702 is
snapped into the cap 734 to provide a solid one-piece feel, making liner 704 change
as easy as with a single piece shell 702.
 [0269] With the dip channel 708 on the inside, a triangular, square or manipulated
round liner is preferred, so the liner 704 will not collapse and contact the internal dip
                                       67

channel 708.
                         Shells for External Dip Channel
 [0270] Fig. 20C illustrates one embodiment for a dip passage 748 on the outside of
the shell 48. The dip passage 748 connects to the liner 704 when the liner 704 is
assembled to the shell 48 in the proper orientation. The dip passage 748 connects to
a liner fitting 724 in a manner similar to the embodiments of Figs. 20A and 20B.
 [0271] Fig. 20D illustrates another embodiment for a dip passage 766 on the outside
of a shell 742. The dip passage 766 connects to the liner 704 when the liner 704 is
assembled to the shell 48 in the proper orientation. The dip passage 766 connects to
a liner fitting 764 in a manner similar to the embodiments of Figs. 20A and 20B.
The external dip passage 766 is protected by a rubber, silicone, or other material
joined to the shell. The short milk tube 46 can be integral with the liner 704, and the
short milk tube 46 preferably terminates at a knob 770 that connects to a milk
collection bowl.
                                        Shell Liners
[0272] As stated earlier, preferred shell liners for use in the present invention are
disclosed in U.S. Application No. 12/215,706, which is incorporated herein by
reference. Figs. 21A, 21B, and 21C depict representative examples of a shell liner
920, from that application.
[0273] In Fig. 21A, there is depicted a milker unit liner 920 in accordance with the
present invention. The liner 920 includes a dome 922, a skirt 924, a barrel 926, and a
delivery channel 928. The skirt 924 extends downward from the dome 922 and is
spaced away from the barrel 926 to define a recess 927.
[0274] The liner 920 is sized and shaped to fit into a conventional outer shell or
"teat cup" (not illustrated) so that the top of the teat cup fits in the recess 927
                                       68

between the skirt 924 and the barrel 926, but other shell types and alignment aids
can be used. This relationship secures the liner 920 to the teat cup and forms a seal
for the vacuum. The liner barrel 926 may have any cross-sectional shape including
round, triangular, and square, or any other shape. Alternatively, a liner can comprise
a separate dome and barrel that are connected to each other directly or indirectly
using a teat cup or the other suitable device. The present invention is directed to a
dome 922 having an inner surface to which flow diverters are joined regardless of
the type, size, or shape of barrel. The liner 920 can be made of rubber, silicone, or
other suitable materials.
[0275] The delivery channel 928 can be formed integrally with the other liner
components or attached after the liner 920 is formed. The delivery channel 928 may
be any of the design types described above, or it can be a separate component so
long as it is attached to the liner 920 to act as a conduit for teat dip or cleaning fluids
being introduced into the dome 930 from the safety valve 60.
[0276] Fig. 21B illustrates an embodiment of a liner dome 930 in accordance with
the present invention, and that is removed from the other liner components and
inverted to show an inner surface 932. This dome 930 includes a teat opening 934,
and an annular recess 936 for mating with the top of a teat cup (not illustrated).
[0277] The liner dome 930 further includes a teat dip distribution structure having
an inlet 966 (not depicted in Fig. 21B, but see Fig. 21C), a first flow diverter which
is illustrated in this embodiment as a flow bifurcating vane 942, and a second flow
diverter which is illustrated as a pair of ridges 944. The inlet 966 is preferably an
opening that is the same diameter as the delivery channel 928, but it can be any size
or shape to obtain satisfactory flow characteristics or simply provide ease of
manufacturing. The inlet 966 could also include a nozzle in the form of a slit, for
                                      69

example, that is either molded into the dome 930 during manufacture or cut into the
dome 930 after molding. A slit shape acts as a one-way valve to inhibit the flow of
milk, teat dip 967 (Fig. 21C), cleaning fluid, and debris from flowing in the wrong
direction through the inlet 966.
[0278] The inlet 966 can also be a simple opening in the dome 930, and a delivery
tube may be used in combination with the inlet 966 so that the delivery tube defines
the flow characteristics or a valve and the inlet 966 simply provides an opening
through which teat dip passes into the dome 930. Regardless of its shape or size, the
inlet 966 is preferably joined to the dome 922 by being formed integrally in the liner
dome 922, but the inlet 966 can be joined to the dome 922 in any other suitable
manner.
[0279] The inlet 966 is connected via the delivery channel 928 to a teat dip source
and/or a backflushing source (not illustrated). In this manner, teat dip 967 (Fig. 21C)
is provided through the inlet 966 under pressure from a pump, air pressure or other
suitable device.
[0280] If left to flow directly toward a teat, most of the dip would be applied to the
side of the teat closest to the inlet 966, with some flow possibly reaching other sides
of the teat if the dosage quantity is high enough. It is unlikely in practice that dip
would reach all teat sides and even less likely that teat dip application would be
uniform as preferred.
[0281] To redirect the inward and radial flow, the flow bifurcating vane 942 is
disposed adjacent to the inlet 966 and in a flow path defined by the inlet 966. The
flow bifurcating vane 942 is shaped to split and redirect the upward flow from the
inlet 966 into a substantially annular flow path or pattern around the periphery of the
dome inner surface 902. As depicted, the flow bifurcating vane 942 splits the flow
                                       70

substantially evenly in each direction to define a pair of flow paths, but if other
inlets are used or other conditions warrant, the flow could be split in other
proportions or simply redirected in a desired flow path.
[0282] The inlet 966 preferably defines two ramped and arcuate surfaces 920 on
which the teat dip flows as it is being redirected. In this embodiment, a raised central
portion 922 is used to confine the flow so that teat dip is not flowing directly toward
the teat. In alternate embodiments, it is possible to permit some of the flow to be
applied directly to the teat without being substantially redirected. In such
embodiments, the central portion 922 may include openings, slots or ramps through
or over which teat dip can flow. It is even permissible for some of the dip to flow
over the bifurcating vane 912 and directly toward the teat. Further, the arcuate
surfaces 950 can be shaped so that teat dip flow is not directed around the periphery,
but instead through a flow pattern or radius that is smaller than the dome chamber's
902 periphery.
[0283] The flow ridges 954 preferably have arcuate shapes and contact surfaces that
are joined to the inner surface 902 of the dome 930 and arranged in the flow path.
The flow ridges 954 are shaped and sized to redirect the peripheral teat dip flow
inward toward a cow's teat. In a preferred embodiment, the flow ridges 954 have a
height dimension that redirects all the teat dip flowing from the flow bifurcating
vane 942. In alternate embodiments, the height of the flow ridges 954 could be
reduced to permit some of the flow to by-pass the flow ridges 954 and flow to the
part of the inner surface 902 opposite the flow bifurcating vane 912 or to other flow
diverters (as described below). Further, the flow ridges 914 are depicted as being
symmetrical, but they could be different sizes, shapes, positions, or orientations to
provide asymmetric flow, if desired.
                                     71

[0284] Most types of teat dip that would be flowing through the dome 930 have an
inherent surface tension that helps establish a desired flow characteristic by
remaining adjacent to the dome 930 surface and to the cow's teat so that the dip will
cover areas of the teat that are not in the direct flow path defined by the flow
diverters.
[0285] The flow diverters of the present invention are joined to the inner surface of
the dome by being molded integrally with the dome, or they may be joined to the
inner surface of the dome with glue or any other suitable means.
[0286] Fig. 21C is an alternate embodiment of the present invention illustrating a
cross-section of an upper portion of a liner 980 having a dome 982, a barrel 984, and
a teat opening 986. A teat delivery channel 990 is formed integrally with the dome
992. A hose, pipe, or tube (not illustrated) can be joined to the delivery channel 990
as a conduit between a source of teat dip and the delivery tube 990, as described
above. The delivery channel 990 has at its upper end an inlet 966 that may be the
same diameter of the delivery channel 990 or in the form of a nozzle or slit that is
either molded into the liner 980 or cut after the liner 980 is molded. Other types of
dip applicators can be used in the invention, but a dome with flow diverters is
preferred.
[0287] Illustrated in Fig. 21D, is a cross section of a shell 702 with an internal dip
delivery channel 708 and with the liner barrel 780 collapsed. Without special
precautions, a liner barrel can collapse, make contact with the dip delivery channel
708, and cause premature wear and failure of the liner. With the dip channel 708 on
the inside, a triangular, square or manipulated round liner is preferred to control the
shape orientation of the collapsed barrel, so the liner 704 will not collapse and
contact the internal dip channel 708.
                                      72

[0288] The liner barrel 780 in Fig. 21D is formed, machined or molded with slight
variations in wall thickness, such as a relatively thin wall at portions 786 and
relatively thick at portions 788, to control collapse of the liner barrel 780 into an
oval shape around a longitudinal axis 784 that is perpendicular to a transverse axis
786 on which the dip delivery channel 708 is disposed. This arrangement ensures
that the liner barrel 780 does not contact the dip delivery channel 708. Attachment
nubs 788 are shown in the head of the liner to secure it to the shell 702.
[0289] Preferably, the difference in wall thickness for the two portions 786, 788 is
only from about .005 inches to about .010 inches, and is created by increasing
thickness at portion 788. An elliptically machined mold can be used to create this
difference.
[0290] The present invention can have many benefits, including but not limited to,
one or more of the following: automate the dipping process to increase operator
efficiency and reduce operator fatigue; provide safe, individual disinfection of the
teats to reduce pathogenic organisms on the teat; prevent transfer of infection from
animal to animal, and thus improvement of udder health of the entire herd; reduce or
minimize chemical consumption (as opposed to spray or other automated dipping
systems); improve uniformity of teat dip application; prevent chemical
contamination of the milk and of the downstream milk system lines; reduce water
consumption during backflushing of the milker unit; and be retrofitted to nearly any
available milking unit.
