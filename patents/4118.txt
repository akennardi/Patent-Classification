                    TRANSPARENT PLASTIC SUBSTRATE AND PLASTIC LENS
                 This application                      is a divisional application  of Australian    Patent
Application No. 2014324967, the specification of which as originally filed are
incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.
Field of Invention
[0001]
                 The present invention relates to a transparent plastic substrate, a plastic
lens, and a transparent plastic member, and particularly relates to a transparent
plastic substrate and a plastic lens that have a high cut rate of blue light.
Background Art
[0002]
                 In a transparent plastic substrate and a plastic lens, the glare can be
reduced, and the visibility and the contrast can be enhanced, by cutting a light ray
in the blue region (having a wavelength range of from 380 to 500 nm).                                 With
respect to the health of eyes, a light ray in the blue region (380 to 500 nm) has
large energy and thus is said to be a factor damaging retina and the like.                             The
damage due to blue light is referred to as "blue light hazard", and light in the low
wavelength side around from 380 to 420 nm is the most dangerous, and the light
in the region is said to be desirably cut.
                 For solving the problem, for example, PTL 1 proposes a lens having a
multilayer film disposed on a convex surface of a plastic member, in which the
multilayer film has an average reflectance of from 2 to 10% in a wavelength range
of from 400 to 500 nm.                            However, the cut rate of blue light measured for the lens
is approximately 30%.
                 PTL 2 describes a polymerizable composition for a lens that contains a
benzotriazole ultraviolet ray absorbent and is enhanced in light cut rate.

Summary of Invention
Technical Problem
[0004]
         An object of the present invention is to provide a transparent plastic
substrate having a high cut rate of blue light, and a plastic lens and a transparent
plastic member, each containing the same.
Solution to Problem
[0005]
         As a result of earnest investigations made by the present inventors for
achieving the object, it has been found that the object can be achieved by adding
an ultraviolet ray absorbent containing a benzotriazole compound having a
particular structure containing a group imparting a mesomeric effect into a
transparent plastic substrate, and thus the present invention has been completed.

[0008]
        In the formula (1), X represents a group imparting a mesomeric effect.    It
is expected that the group imparting a mesomeric effect present on the
benzotriazole ring enhances the cut rate of blue light.
        The substitution position of X is preferably the 5-position of the triazole
ring.
        Examples of X include a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, a fluorine atom,
an iodine atom, a sulfo group, a carboxyl group, a nitrile group, an alkoxy group, a
hydroxyl group and an amino group, and among these, a chlorine atom, a bromine
atom and a fluorine atom are preferred, and a chlorine atom is more preferred.
        In the formula (1), R 2 represents an alkyl group having from 1 to 12
carbon atoms or an alkoxy group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and for each of
the alkyl group and the alkoxy group, the number of carbon atoms is preferably
from 1 to 8, more preferably from 2 to 8, and further preferably from 4 to 8.
        The alkyl group and the alkoxy group each may be branched or linear.
Among the alkyl group and the alkoxy group, the alkyl group is preferred.

1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl group is preferred, a n-butyl group, a sec-butyl group, a
tert-butyl group and a 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl group are more preferred, and a

atoms.    Among the groups, a methyl group and an ethyl group are preferred.        In
the case where R 1 is one of these groups, an excellent cut rate of blue light is
obtained.    In the case where the number of carbon atoms of R 1 is 4 or more (for
example, 2-(3,5-di-t-butyl-2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-chlorobenzotriazole), the compound
is a persistent compound, which has a large environment load and may bring
possible influence to human body, and thus may be designated as a manufacturing
prohibited substance in some cases.      However, the compound of the formula (1)
can be decomposed relatively easily, and also has an advantage of less influence
on human body.
        In the formula (1), m represents an integer of 0 or 1.

group and toluenediyl group, and among these, a methanediyl group is preferred.
