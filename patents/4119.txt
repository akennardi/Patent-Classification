                                        DESCRIPTION
Technical Field
[0001] The present disclosure relates to novel processes for producing sprouted whole grains
and products comprising the sprouted whole grains made by these processes. Various
embodiments according to the disclosure comprise steps of steeping at least one grain for a
period of time to a desired moisture content, optionally germinating the at least one grain, and
kilning the at least one grain to produce a sprouted grain. In further embodiments of the
disclosure, the sprouted whole grains may be used in whole wheat and refined flour. Yet
further embodiments relate to products comprising the sprouted whole grains, such as dough
products, baked goods, brewing applications, and non-alcoholic grain based beverages.
Background
[0002] Wheat and other grains, such as barley and sorghum, may be used for the production
of beverages, such as beer. For example, in the production of certain malted beverages, a
barley seed is subjected to a malting process, which increases enzymatic activity. The
enzymes, such as amylases, beta-glucanases and xylanases, degrade the starch and non
starchy components from the seeds. Thereafter, the malt may be used in processes such as
brewing, milling or other fermentation processes.
[0003] For example, in traditional malting processes for production of beer, water and barley
seeds may be added to a steep tank. The seeds soak up the water in the steep tank, where the
temperature of the water ranges from about 3'C to about 21'C thereby increasing the seed
moisture content. The presence of water and oxygen then triggers the growth of the plant
embryo. Traditionally, seeds are steeped to a moisture content ranging from about 35% to
                                                 1

 WO 2015/021025                                                              PCT/US2014/049739
about 45%, such as about 38% to about 45%. In a typical example of a traditional method
seeds are steeped in water for about 12 hours, aerated for about 8 hours, and then steeped
again in water for about an additional 6 hours. The seeds may be steeped for a period of time
ranging from about 20 hours to about 40 hours. Traditionally, about 100% of the seeds are
chitted after the steeping process.
[0004] After the steeping step, the seeds are germinated in a germination step. During
germination, biochemical reactions occur within the kernels leading to the activation of
enzymes, the breakdown of cell walls and proteins, and an increase in the bioavailability of
nutrients. The seed kernels "grow" over a period of about three to about four days during the
germination step. The grain may also be gently turned to sustain even growth and to prevent
the kernels from matting together. For example, the grain may be turned about every 8 to 10
hours. By the end of the germination step, rootlets have formed on the kernels, and the
moisture content of the seeds ranges from about 40% to about 47%, such as about 44 to about
47%, wherein the seeds may be sprayed with water as necessary during the germination step
to maintain the desired moisture content. Applied humidified air may be circulated to
maintain a temperature ranging from about 7'C to about 29C in the malt bed, depending on
the malting location and season of year. The germinated seeds, known as green malt,
traditionally will have an a-amylase activity ranging from as low as about 10 dextrinizing
units (DU), for example in Munich malt, to as great as about 130 DU, for example in
distiller's malt.
[0005] After the germination step, the germinated seeds are then put in a kiln for drying.
Kilning circulates warm air to dry the seeds, helps develop flavor and color in the seeds, and
arrests the biochemical reactions taking place in the seeds. After kilning, brittle rootlets
break off and may be easily removed. Traditionally, the kiln removes moisture from the seed
until the moisture content of the seed ranges from about 4% to about 6%, and the seeds are
kilned for about 24 hours at a low temperature, such as a temperature ranging from about
49C to about 85C or as high as about 93'C. After kilning, the resulting malt will also have
an a-amylase activity ranging from about 10 DU to about 130 DU. To the naked eye, the
malt looks similar to the original kernel. However, inside the kernel, changes have taken
place, and the malt is now ready to be stored or sent to a brewery or mill for further
processing.
[0006] Grains may also be used in the production of flour, such as for baked goods. For
example, wheat is traditionally cleaned and then tempered for several hours, such as about 18
                                                2

 WO 2015/021025                                                              PCT/US2014/049739
to about 24 hours, to soften and increase the moisture content of the wheat kernels.
Thereafter, the kernels are passed through a milling or grinding process to produce flour, and
the wheat grains are no longer considered "whole kernel," and if the flour is fractionated into
germ, bran and endosperm, the wheat flour no longer fits the definition of "whole grain."
[0007] It is also possible, however, to use malted grains wherein the grains are considered
"whole" in the production of flour. The malting process for grains in the production of flour
is substantially identical to the process described above, for beverage production. In flour
and food products produced using flour, however, whole grains are desirable for their
improved nutritional benefits. To be considered a whole grain food, the food product should
contain at least 8 grams of whole grain per 30 grams of product, according to American
Association of Cereal Chemists recommendations. Currently, traditional whole grain flours
and products made from these flours may have decreased palatability as the whole grain
concentration increases. However, consumers desire products, such as baked goods, that are
prepared from whole grain flours in order to achieve the nutritional benefits thereof, yet
maintain a desirable taste. As such, there is a need to produce whole grains and whole grain
food products with desirable taste and nutritional benefits.
[0008] Sprouting has been reported to increase key nutrients of whole grain, including
antioxidants, tocopherols, thiamin (B 1), riboflavin (B2), pantothenic acid (B5), biotin (B7),
folic acid (B9), and fiber. Sprouting of whole grains may also reduce anti-nutrients, such as
phytic acid. Phytic acid binds with important minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron,
and zinc and prevents these minerals from being absorbed in the intestine. Phytic acid also
chelates niacin making it unavailable for the body. Thus, sprouted whole grains can fill the
need to produce whole grains and whole grain food products with desirable taste and
nutritional benefits.
                                           SUMMARY

"sprouted whole grains"). Also disclosed is flour produced from sprouted whole grains
prepared according to embodiments of the disclosure, as well as products comprising
sprouted whole grains prepared according to embodiments of the disclosure, such as dough
products, baked goods, and beverages.
[0010] In certain embodiments, sprouted whole grains prepared according to embodiments of
the disclosure and products comprising the sprouted whole grains may be more palatable than

                    DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
[0014] Disclosed herein are processes for producing sprouted whole grains, and products
comprising the sprouted whole grains prepared according to said processes. In various
embodiments, processes for producing sprouted whole grains comprise steeping at least one
grain at a desired temperature for a period of time to achieve a desired moisture content,
optionally germinating the at least one grain, and kilning the at least one grain to produce a
sprouted grain.
[0015] Although not required, sprouted whole grains made according to at least certain
embodiments of the disclosure and products comprising the sprouted whole grains may have
more desirable taste and/or increased nutritional benefits compared to whole grains and
products comprising these whole grains that are not produced according to the disclosure. As
used herein, the phrase "sprouted whole grains" refers to grains containing substantially all of
the original bran, germ, and endosperm, and wherein nutrient values have not substantially
diminished. In certain embodiments of sprouted whole grains, the sprout (known as the
acrospire) growth is not greater than the kernel length.

 WO 2015/021025                                                              PCT/US2014/049739
[0016] According to various embodiments of the disclosure, the seeds first undergo a
steeping process. As used herein, the term "steeping" refers to wetting the seeds at a given
temperature and for a given period of time to yield seeds of a desired moisture content.
According to at least certain embodiments, the steeping takes place in an aqueous solution
comprising, consisting of, or consisting essentially of water. In addition to water, any
component typically used in a steeping process may be added to or present in the aqueous
solution. By way of non-limiting example only, gibberellic acid may also be added in the
steeping step to hasten metabolic activity.
[0017] As used herein the term "moisture content" refers to a proportion of dry weight over
hydrated weight. Moisture content may be measured by any method known in the art. By
way of example only, an oven, such as a convection, conduction or infrared oven, may be
used to determine moisture content. In at least certain exemplary embodiments, a sample
may be retrieved and weighed, and placed in the oven. In yet further exemplary
embodiments, the sample may be dried, for example with a towel, to remove surface moisture
before weighing and/or placing the sample in the oven. Further, the sample may be re
weighed after heating and weight loss calculated to determine moisture loss and moisture
content of the sample.
[0018] The steeping process may, according to various exemplary embodiments, comprise
one or more periods of time where the seeds are exposed to the aqueous solution (referred to
interchangeably as "wetting period" or "immersion period"). When more than one wetting
period is chosen, it may be desirable to have a period of time between wetting periods where
the seeds are optionally aerated.
[0019] The wetting period may comprise a step of exposing the seeds to the aqueous solution
by any method known. For example, the step may comprise one or more periods of
immersing the seeds in the aqueous solution and/or spraying the aqueous solution onto the
seeds.
[0020] Aeration of the seeds may also be achieved by any method known, such as the use of
fans or compressors, for example. During aeration, the CO 2 produced by the respiring grains
may be removed by pulling or pushing the C0 2 , for example with fans or compressors, and
thereby allowing for increased oxygen uptake.
[0021] The steeping process is performed to produce seeds having a moisture content ranging
from about 29% to about 38%. In various embodiments, the steeping process produces seeds
having a moisture content ranging, for example, from about 30% to about 38%, about 31% to
                                                5

 WO 2015/021025                                                               PCT/US2014/049739
about 38%, about 32% to about 38%, or about 33% to about 38%, about 34% to about 38%,
about 35% to about 38%, about 36% to about 38%, 29% to about 37%, about 30% to about
37%, about 31% to about 37%, about 32% to about 37%, about 33% to about 37%, about
34% to about 37%, about 35% to about 37%, about 36% to about 37%, about 29% to about
34%, about 30% to about 34%, about 31% to about 34%, about 32% to about 34%, about
33% to about 34%, about 29% to about 33%, about 29% to about 32%, about 29% to about
32%, about 29% to about 31%, about 29%, about 30%, about 31%, about 32%, about 33%,
about 34%, about 35%, about 36%, about 37%, or about 38%.
[0022] According to various embodiments, the steeping process may occur over period of
time ranging up to about 24 hours, such as about 2 hours to about 24 hours. By way of non
limiting example, the steeping process may occur for a period of time ranging from about 4
hours to about 23 hours, such as about 4 hours to about 22 hours, about 4 hours to about 21
hours, about 4 hours to about 20 hours, about 4 hours to about 19 hours, about 4 hours to
about 18 hours, about 4 hours to about 17 hours, about 4 hours to about 16 hours, about 4
hours to about 15 hours, about 4 hours to about 14 hours, about 4 hours to about 13 hours,
about 4 hours to about 12 hours, about 4 hours to about 11 hours, about 4 hours to about 10
hours, about 4 hours to about 9 hours, about 4 hours to about 8 hours, about 4 hours to about
7 hours, about 4 hours to about 6 hours, about 4 hours to about 5 hours, about 6 hours to
about 16 hours, about 6 hours to about 15 hours, about 6 hours to about 14 hours, about 6
hours to about 12 hours, about 6 hours to about 11 hours, about 6 hours to about 10 hours,
about 6 hours to about 9 hours, about 6 hours to about 8 hours, about 7 hours. As one skilled
in the art would recognize, the steeping time is dependent on the temperature of the aqueous
solution, which may depend upon such factors as the facility and ambient conditions such as
temperature and humidity. For example, in certain embodiments, the warmer the aqueous
solution, the shorter the steeping time, e.g. for the first immersion period. For example, in
certain embodiments, the colder the aqueous solution, the longer the steeping time, e.g., for
the first immersion period.
[0023] According to various exemplary embodiments, the steeping process may comprise a
step of wetting the seeds with the aqueous solution for a period of time, optionally followed
by a period of aerating the seeds, optionally followed by another step of wetting the seeds
with the aqueous solution, and so on. As such, additional aeration and wetting steps may be
performed, if desired. By way of non-limiting example only, a first immersion period may
range up to about 11 hours, such as about 8 hours to about 10 hours; a first aeration period
                                                  6

 WO 2015/021025                                                                PCT/US2014/049739
may range up to about 7 hours, such as about 5 to about 7 hours; and a second immersion
period may range up to about 5 hours, such as about 2 to about 4 hours.
[0024] In certain embodiments, the steeping process (wetting and/or aeration) may occur at a
temperature ranging from about 2'C to about 29'C, such as about 4'C to about 27 C, about
7'C to about 24'C, about 7'C to about 21C, about 7'C to about 18'C, about 7'C to about
16C, about 7'C to about 13C, about 10 0C/50'F to about 18C, about 10C to about 17C,
about 10C to about 16'C, about 10C to about 15C, about 10C to about 14C, about 10C
to about 13'C, about 10 C to about 12C, about 10 C to about 1IC, about 1 IC to about
18'C, about 12'C to about 18'C, about 13'C to about 18'C, about 14'C to about 18'C, about
15'C to about 18'C, about 16'C to about 18'C, about 17'C to about 18'C, about 13'C to
about 16C, about 14'C to about 16C, about 13'C to about 15C, about 13'C to about 14C,
about 1 IC, about 12'C, about 13'C, about 14C, about 15'C, or about 16C. In certain
embodiments, the temperature of the aqueous solution may remain relatively constant for a
first and a second or subsequent wetting and/or aeration period, although it is not required. It
is recognized that the aqueous solution exiting an immersion may be warmer than when the
immersion began, as the grains respire. Therefore, any method known for controlling the
temperature during wetting and/or aeration may be chosen. For example, additional aqueous
solution may be added to the steeping vessel to avoid over-heating the grain and to maintain
an ideal temperature of the aqueous solution. In various embodiments, the aeration
temperature may be higher or lower than the immersion temperature.
[0025] In certain exemplary embodiments, after the steeping process about 50% to about
100% of the seeds are chitted, such as about 50% to about 75% or about 75% to about 100%
of the seeds. As used herein, the term "chitted" refers to the first sign of germination from a
kernel, as may be visually observed by the acrospire. One skilled in the art will recognize
that different seed varieties have different chitting rates, and therefore the percentage of seeds
chitted may depend upon the variety of seed used. By way of non-limiting example only, a
steeping process for producing hard white sprouted wheat according to embodiments of the
disclosure may yield about 20% to about 50%, such as about 25% to about 40%, such as
about 30%, chitted seeds.
[0026] According to at least certain embodiments of the disclosure, compared to traditional
malting processes, the germination period is significantly reduced, and in some cases
substantially eliminated or eliminated altogether. For example, according to certain
embodiments, after steeping the seeds remain at about 29% to about 38% moisture, such as
                                                  7

 WO 2015/021025                                                                PCT/US2014/049739
about 34% to about 37% moisture, and undergo a kilning process less than about 2 days after
the steeping process is completed. By way of non-limiting example only, according to
certain embodiments disclosed herein, the germination period may last for less than about 24
hours, less than about 12 hours, or less than about 6 hours. In at least certain exemplary
embodiments, the germination period may last for less than about 4 hours, less than about 2
hours, or less than about 1 hour. In at least one exemplary embodiment, the germination
period is about 0 hours, i.e., the germination step is essentially eliminated from the process,
and the seeds go directly from the steeping process to the kilning process. In other words, the
steeped seeds are transferred from the steep vessel to the kiln vessel for kilning. By way of
non-limiting example only, according to certain embodiments disclosed herein, the time of
transfer is not more than 10 hours, such as about 2 hours to about 8 hours, about 2 hours to
about 7 hours, about 2 hours to about 6 hours, about 2 hours to about 5 hours, about 2 hours
to about 4 hours, about 2 hours to about 3 hours, about 3 hours to about 8 hours, about 4
hours to about 8 hours, about 5 hours to about 8 hours, about 6 hours to about 8 hours, about
7 hours to about 8 hours, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, about 6
hours, about 7 hours, about 8 hours, about 9 hours, or about 10 hours.
[0027] According to certain embodiments, after a germination period of less than about 2
days, the seeds having a moisture content ranging from about 29% to about 38% undergo a
kilning process. The kilning process involves heating the seeds for a period of time and at a
temperature to produce seeds having a specified moisture content and a-amylase activity.
During the kilning process, it may be desirable to control air circulation. By use of the phrase
"controlled air circulation" and variations thereof, it is meant recirculation of the heated and
humidified air. In various embodiments, in controlled air circulation, up to about 100% of
the air in the kilning vessel is recirculated, such as up to about 65%, to decrease the moisture
content of the seeds after steeping (which is from about 29% to about 38% moisture content)
to about 7% to about 16% moisture content after kilning. In various embodiments, from
about 65% to about 100% of the air is recirculated, and from about 0% to about 35% of the
air in the kilning vessel is exhausted. In other various embodiments, from about 75% to
about 100% of the air is recirculated, and from about 0% to about 25% of the air in the
kilning vessel is exhausted.
[0028] For example, one of skill in the art may optimize the convectional removal of the
aqueous solution and/or the conductional removal of the aqueous solution. One skilled in the
art may, for example, alter fan speeds to create drying air currents, circulation of air, and/or
                                                  8

 WO 2015/021025                                                                PCT/US2014/049739
applied temperature to manipulate enzymes and proteases for the desired end product
specification, such as moisture content and a-amylase activity. Understanding the biological
function of enzymes at difference moisture contents allows for manipulating the activity of
enzymes in the final product, for example, a-amylase is highly insensitive to heat at low
moistures but at higher moistures is sensitive to heat and will denature and become inactive.
Knowledge of kiln operation allows the controller to optimize surface moisture removal,
moisture content and grain temperature to meet product specifications. For example,
removing approximately 5% of the moisture, which is on the surface, but leaving the
moisture in the grain and applying heat without exhausting the air would deactivate a
amylase.
[0029] The kilning process may range in time up to about 20 hours, such as from about 6
hours to about 18 hours, about 8 hours to about 16 hours, about 10 hours to about 15 hours, or
about 12 hours to about 14 hours. In at least one exemplary and non-limiting embodiment,
the kilning process lasts about 14 hours. Further, the kilning process may occur at
temperatures ranging from about 49'C to about 93'C, such as about 49'C to about 88'C,
about 50'C to about 85'C, or about 66'C to about 88C.
[0030] In various embodiments, the seeds may be kilned for varying times and/or at varying
temperatures. For example, the kiln temperature may be stable for a period of time, after
which it is increased and then kept stable at the increased temperature for a subsequent period
of time, and so on. In certain embodiments, the kiln temperature may remain relatively stable
throughout the kilning process. In addition, it is not required that the temperature be kept
stable at any point during the kilning process; it is possible to increase the temperature, for
example gradually, throughout the process. Thus, any combination of time and temperature
may be chosen for the kilning process and is done so based on the desired final product
specifications, such as the desired moisture content, color, and enzyme activity.
[0031] By way of non-limiting example only, in an embodiment where four different
temperatures are chosen, the seeds may be kilned at a first temperature ranging from about
60'C to about 70'C, such as about 68'C, followed by kilning at a second temperature ranging
from about 71'C to about 77'C, such as about 71C, followed by kilning at a third
temperature ranging from about 77'C to about 82'C, such as about 79'C, followed by kilning
at a fourth temperature ranging from about 83'C to about 93'C, such as about 85'C. The
times that the kilning occurs at each temperature can range anywhere from a few minutes to a
few hours.

 WO 2015/021025                                                              PCT/US2014/049739
[0032] In at least certain embodiments, the kilning process includes exposing the seeds to a
high temperature shock process, which may be carried out at greater than about 77'C, such as
about 77'C to about 85'C, about 77'C to about 79'C, or about 85'C, for example. The high
temperature shock process may include a step of circulating air through the kiln, where the air
is humidified at increasing amounts greater than about 60%, such as greater than about 75%,
such as from about 75% to about 100%. Optionally, the high temperature shock process may
occur at the beginning of the kilning process.
[0033] According to various embodiments, once the kilning process is complete, the seeds
may have a final moisture content ranging from about 7% to about 16%, such as about 7% to
about 15%, about 7% to about 14%, about 7% to about 13%, about 7% to about 12%, about
7% to about 11%, about 7% to about 10%, about 7% to about 9%, about 7% to about 8%,
about 8% to about 16%, about 9% to about 16%, about 10% to about 16%, about 11% to
about 16%, about 12% to about 16%, about 13% to about 16%, about 14% to about 16%,
about 10% to about 14%, about 11% to about 14%, about 12% to about 14%, about 10% to
about 13%, about 10% to about 12%, about 11% to about 12%, about 7%, about 8%, about
9%, about 10%, about 11%, about 12%, about 13%, about 14%, about 15%, or about 16%.
[0034] Germination of a seed causes accelerated production of enzymes, such as a-amylase,
which is a starch degrading enzyme. Alpha-amylase acts to liquefy a starch. The rheological
impact of a-amylase and other enzymes on starch may be measured by the Falling Number
(FN). As used herein, FN refers to a method for measuring sprouting, typically pre-harvest,
and is correlated to the a-amylase activity in the kernels. The FNs referenced herein were
measured using a FN apparatus from Perten Instruments, Inc., Springfield, Illinois (FN 1900
1 1Ov, Serial Number 1473378) and the methodology provided by the American Association
of Cereal Chemists (AACC) International's Method 56-81.03 for the Determination of
Falling Number, which measures the time in seconds required to stir and allow the stirrer to
fall a measured distance through a hot aqueous flour or meal gel undergoing liquefaction. As
one skilled in the art would recognize, locations at an elevated altitude may obtain FN values
higher than those determined at sea level, and appropriate adjustments may be made when the
altitude is greater than 2000 feet.
[0035] Alpha-amylase activity may be associated with kernel sprouting (i.e., the degree of
sprouting in a kernel of grain and alpha-amylase activity can be quantified by the FN), and
both the a-amylase activity and the degree of kernel sprouting are inversely correlated with
the FN. In addition, it is known that a-amylase activity in flour affects bread quality and can
                                                10

 WO 2015/021025                                                                  PCT/US2014/049739
adversely affect the baking process. The FN can measure the a-amylase activity of flour.
Flour with a low FN will produce bread with poor texture, a sticky bread crumb and will be
difficult to process. Bread made from flour with a low FN can result in loaves with poor
volume and a dry bread crumb. The shelf life of the bread will also be adversely affected. It
is important, therefore, to use flour with the correct FN.
[0036] According to various embodiments, the processes disclosed herein allow for the
production of a stable sprouted whole grain. As used herein, the term "stable" refers to the
controlled activation and subsequent deactivation of enzymes, such as a-amylase and
proteases, such that when the sprouted whole grain is not immediately milled and held for a
period of time, such as, by way of example and without limitation, hours, days, weeks, or
even months, the FN does not significantly decrease and the gluten is not negatively impacted
as indicated by the Farinograph stability test method AACC 54-21.02 for flour (Brabender
Farinograph-E, Brabender GmbH & Co. KG, Germany). Dough stability, which is indicative
of gluten strength, is increased by about 50% using sprouted whole wheat flour compared to
unsprouted whole wheat flour.
[0037] According to certain embodiments, the resultant stable sprouted whole grain may be
used to make flour; dough and dough products; baked products, such as bread, pastries,
muffins, tortillas, bagels, pizzas, crackers, and the like; and beverages such as beer and non
alcoholic beverages, and the like, by any method known to those of skill in the art. It is
contemplated that any grain may be used in the processes described herein, such as wheat,
barley, rye, oats, hulled varieties, hull-less varieties, etc. In at least one embodiment, the
grain is wheat, and the wheat may be chosen from any wheat variety, including red wheat,
white wheat, soft wheat, hard wheat, spring wheat, winter wheat, and the like.
[0038] By way of non-limiting example only, the processes disclosed herein allow for
controlled activation and subsequent deactivation of enzymes, such as a-amylase, to produce
a stable sprouted whole wheat flour with a falling number ranging from about 220 to about
280, which is ideal for baking bread. Whole wheat flour with a FN greater than 300 seconds
is considered free of sprouted damage (i.e., no a-amylase present) while whole wheat flour
with a FN less than 160 seconds is considered unsuitable for bread making. In addition, it is
known that an increase in enzyme activity, such as a-amylase, leads to the degradation of
gluten (i.e., protein) and starch, which can negatively impact baking performance. From the
processes disclosed herein, a-amylase activity is controlled and, as such, sprouted whole
wheat flour can be more acceptable for use by the baking industry.

 WO 2015/021025                                                               PCT/US2014/049739
[0039] In addition to impacting a-amylase activity, malting grains, such as wheat, has an
effect on sugar content. For example, in certain varieties of wheat, the percentages of sugars
may increase with time and temperature. For example, for malted wheat, the total sugar
content may increase about 250% over the span of three days and about 500% over the span
of five days. As such, the sprouted whole wheat produced according to various embodiments
disclosed herein may be used in the production of products, such as baked goods, that
comprise less sugar than traditional formulations, and yet maintain a palatable taste. In yet
further embodiments, the sprouted whole wheat may be used in the production of goods that
comprise increased nutraceuticals compared to traditional formulations.
[0040] It is also noted that, in certain embodiments, the sprouted whole wheat produced from
embodiments disclosed herein may be used in the production of products, such as baked
goods, that require less yeast than traditional formulations and yet maintain a sufficient rise.
[0041] As used herein, the phrases "less sugar than traditional formulations," "less yeast than
traditional formulations," "increased nutraceuticals compared to traditional formulations,"
and variations thereof, including, for example, "reduced sugar content" and "reduced yeast
content," are meant to indicate formulations that are otherwise identical or substantially
identical (other than the amount of sugar and/or yeast used) to those made according to
embodiments of the disclosure, except that the whole grain is not prepared according to the
disclosure. According to various embodiments, the formulations may comprise up to about
60% less sugar or yeast than traditional formulations, such as up to about 50%, up to about
40%, up to about 30%, up to about 25%, up to about 20%, up to about 15%, up to about 10%,
up to about 5%, or up to about 2% less sugar and/or yeast.
[0042] Additionally, higher kilning temperatures may lower the a-amylase and/or protease
activity, and higher initial temperatures at the beginning of the kilning step may also lower
the a-amylase and/or protease activity. If the a-amylase content is too high, resultant baked
products, such as bread, may collapse.
[0043] As described herein, according to various embodiments, any of the timing,
temperature, and moisture content of any step throughout the process may differ from those
of traditional malting processes. One skilled in the art will recognize that times for each step
in the processes disclosed herein may be dependent on the temperature of the aqueous
solution and the ambient temperature at the sprouting facility.
[0044] Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers used in the specification and claims are to be
understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about," whether or not so stated. It

should also be understood that the precise numerical values used in the specification and
claims form additional embodiments of the disclosure, as do all ranges and subranges within
any specified endpoints. Efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of the numerical

contain certain errors resulting from the standard deviation found in its respective measuring
technique.

limited to "only one" unless explicitly indicated to the contrary.
[0046] It is to be understood that both the foregoing description and the following examples
are exemplary and explanatory only and are not intended to be restrictive. In addition, it will
be noted that where steps are disclosed, the steps need not be performed in that order unless
explicitly stated that such order is required.
[0047] The accompanying figures, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this
specification, are not intended to be restrictive, but rather illustrative of exemplary
embodiments of the disclosure.
[0048] Other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of

                                           EXAMPLES
[0049] The following examples are not intended to be limiting of the disclosure. The wheat
used in the following examples is available from Cargill, Incorporated, Wayzata, Minnesota.
The malting processes described in Examples 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed using a Joe White
Malting Systems Micromalter unit (Joe White Maltings Pty, Limited, Perth, Australia) while
Examples 5, 6, 7 and 8 were performed in a Cargill malting facility in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.
Example 1
[0050] 16 kg of Snowcrest Hard Spring White Wheat samples were malted. The kernels were
steeped in water at 130 C for 10 hours, followed by 6 hours of aeration, 4 hours of additional
steeping, and then 4 hours of additional aeration for a total of 24 hours steeping time. The
moisture content of the kernels following steeping was 36%. The kernels did not undergo a
traditional germination step, but rather were transferred to a kiln for 4 hours at 87'C (100%
recirculation), followed by 8 hours at 71'C (no recirculation), 2 hours at 77'C (no
                                                 13

 WO 2015/021025                                                               PCT/US2014/049739
recirculation), 2 hours at 85'C (no recirculation), and 1 hour at 38'C (no recirculation), for a
total kilning time of 17 hours.
[0051] Steeping occurred for around 24 hours. After kilning, the moisture content was 8.4%
and the FN was about 170 seconds, which is indicative of a high increase in a-amylase
activity. Therefore, this set of process conditions did not allow for the resulting sprouted
whole wheat kernel to be milled and used for baking.
Example 2
[0052] 8 kg of Snowcrest Wheat Select samples (250 g/compartment) were malted. The
kernels were steeped in water at 14'C for 9 hours, followed by 6 hours of aeration, followed
by a second steeping in water for 4 hours, and followed by 4 hours of aeration, for a total of
23 hours steeping time. The moisture content of the kernels following steeping was 31.6%.
The kernels did not undergo a traditional germination step, but rather were transferred to a
kiln for the following times and temperatures: 4 hours at 68'C (no recirculation), followed by
2 hours at 71 C (no recirculation), followed by 30 min at 79'C (no recirculation), and finally
followed by 1 hour at 85'C (no recirculation), for a total kilning time of 7.5 hours.
[0053] This trial resulted in the desired amount of a-amylase activity as indicated by the FN
of 250 seconds, and the moisture content was 12%. A portion of the resulting spouted whole
wheat kernel was immediately milled into flour, which was used in the baking experiments.
With another portion, it was held for 14 days and it was observed that the germ was still
viable because of the low enthalpy kilning conditions (i.e., no recirculated air) and 12%
moisture content, similar to raw wheat. Accordingly, the whole wheat kernel continued to
sprout and change, including the FN which fell to 81 seconds and thus indicative of high a
amylase activity, thus deeming the kernels unstable.
Example 3
[0054] 8 kg of Snowcrest Wheat Select samples (250 g/compartment) were malted. The goal
was to sprout and minimize the impact on gluten and a-amylase production, with a target
moisture content of greater than 10% for the finished malt. At a temperature of 14C, the
kernels were steeped for 10 hours, followed by aeration for 6 hours, followed by steeping for
4 hours, followed by aeration for 4 hours, for a total of 24 hours steeping time. The moisture
content of the kernels following steeping was 36%.

 WO 2015/021025                                                               PCT/US2014/049739
[0055] The kernels did not undergo a traditional germination step, but rather were transferred
to a kiln for the following times and temperatures:
Ramp 30 min to 40'C (no recirculation, fan 50%);
Plateau at 40'C for 1 hour (no recirculation);
Ramp 30 min to 50'C (no recirculation, fan 50%);
Plateau at 50'C for 1 hour (no recirculation);
Ramp 1 hour to 85'C (no recirculation);
Plateau for 4 hours, (50% recirculation, fan 75%);
Ramp 1 hour to 75'C (no recirculation);
Plateau for 4 hours (no recirculation, fan 75%);
Ramp 1 hour to 50'C (no recirculation); and
Plateau for 2 hours (no recirculation), for a total kilning time of 16 hours.
[0056] Steeping occurred for 24 hours. The resultant FN was 160, and therefore indicative
that too much a-amylase activity was created for the steeping temperature and length of
steeping. Therefore, this set of process conditions did not allow for the resulting sprouted
whole wheat kernel to be milled and used for baking.
Example 4
[0057] 8 kg of Snowcrest Wheat Select samples (250 g/compartment) were malted. The
kernels were steeped in water at 14'C for 10 hours, followed by 6 hours of aeration, and 3.75
hours steeping in water, for a total of 19.75 hours steeping time. The moisture content of the
kernels following steeping was 35%. The kernels did not undergo a traditional germination
step, but rather were transferred to a kiln for the following times and temperatures:
Ramp 30 minutes to 50'C (no recirculation, fan 50%);
Plateau at 50'C for 30 minutes (no recirculation);
Ramp 1.5 hours to 85'C (no recirculation);
Plateau for 2 hours (75% recirculation, fan 50%) (moisture tested);
Ramp to 85'C for 1.5 hours (no recirculation), for a total kilning time of 6 hours.
[0058] This trial resulted in the desired amount of a-amylase activity as indicated by the FN
of 250 seconds, and a moisture content of 11%, after kilning. The processing conditions
destroyed the germ viability while minimizing the impact to the gluten, which resulted in a
stable sprouted whole wheat kernel product.

Example 5
[0059] 102,058.3 kg of Snowcrest Wheat Select kernels were malted. The kernels were
steeped in water at 18'C for 6 hours and the moisture content of the kernels following
steeping was 37%. The kernels did not undergo a traditional germination step, but rather
were transferred over a period of 5 hours to a kiln for the following times and temperatures:
Ramp 30 minutes to 50'C (no recirculation, fan 50%);
Plateau at 50'C for 45 minutes (no recirculation);
Ramp 1.5 hours to 85'C (no recirculation);
Plateau for 2 hours (75% recirculation, fan 50%) (moisture tested), for a total kilning time of
4.75 hours.
[0060] This trial resulted in a FN of 290 seconds. The moisture content was 14.5% when the
kiln cycle ended, and further evaporation during transfer of the kernels to storage silos and
transportation to the mill for milling lowered the moisture content during transfer to 8%.
Example 6
[0061] 102,058.3 kg of Snowcrest Wheat Select samples were malted. The kernels were
steeped in water at 17'C for 6 hours and the moisture content of the kernels following
steeping was 35%. The kernels did not undergo a traditional germination step, but rather
were transferred over a period of 7 hours to a kiln for the following times and temperatures:
Ramp 30 minutes to 50'C (no recirculation, fan 50%);
Plateau at 50'C /122 F for 45 minutes (no recirculation);
Ramp 1.5 hours to 85'C (no recirculation);
Plateau for 2.5 hours (75% recirculation, fan 50%) (moisture tested), for a total kilning time
of 5.25 hours.
[0062] This trial resulted in a FN of 215 seconds, and the moisture content was 8.8%.
Example 7
[0063] 52,160 kg of Snowcrest Wheat Select samples were malted. The kernels were steeped
in water at 9'C for 16 hours and the moisture content of the kernels following steeping was
35%. The kernels did not undergo a traditional germination step, but rather were transferred
over a period of 5 hours to a kiln for the following times and temperatures:
Ramp 24 minutes to 50'C (no recirculation, fan 30%);
Plateau at 50'C for 45 minutes (no recirculation);

Ramp 1.5 hours to 85'C (no recirculation);
Plateau until the average temperature of the air coming out of the kiln bed was 63'C/ 145' F,
so total time was less than 1 hour (75% recirculation, fan 30%) (moisture tested), for a total
kilning time around 3.65 hours.
[0064] This trial resulted in a FN of 290 seconds, and the moisture content was 14.9%. This
batch was unique because of the reduced batch size than what is typically used in the facility
(i.e., from 102,058.3 kg to 52,160 kg), and thus the process was modified to deal with less
material and less moisture to remove.
Example 8
[0065] 102,058.3 kg of Snowcrest Wheat Select samples were malted. The kernels were
steeped in water at 14'C for 12 hours and the moisture content of the kernels following
steeping was 36%. The kernels did not undergo a traditional germination step, but rather
were transferred over a period of 8 hours to a kiln for the following times and temperatures:
24 minutes to 50'C (no recirculation, fan 50%);
Plateau at 50'C for 45 minutes (no recirculation);
Ramp 1.5 hours to 85'C (no recirculation);
Plateau for 2 hours (75% recirculation, fan 50%) (moisture tested), for a total kilning time of
4.65 hours.
[0066] This trial resulted in a FN of 260 seconds, and the moisture content was 15.5%.

[0068] A control loaf of bread was also baked using traditional (i.e., non-sprouted) white
flour using the same ingredients but at different water percentage to make the control dough
at the same moisture content as the sprouted whole wheat dough.
[0069] Figures 1A and 1B are photographs of the resultant loaves, showing, from left to
right, the control loaf prepared with traditional white flour; the loaf prepared with sprouted
whole wheat white flour and full sugar; the loaf prepared with sprouted whole wheat white
flour and 25% reduced sugar; and the loaf prepared with sprouted whole wheat white flour
and 50% reduced sugar. Compared to the control loaf, the loaves made with sprouted whole
wheat white flour have increased bread volume. The flour utilized for the three loaves was
created very soon after the sprouted whole wheat kernel was produced by the process
described in Example 2 and milled (and thus destroying the biochemical machinery to
synthesize more enzymes like a-amylase). In other words, once the sprouted whole wheat
kernel was milled, the flour had a stable FN and was used to make loaves, but subsequent
processing of that sprouted whole wheat kernel resulted in a FN of 162 seconds, suggesting
the kernel had increasing a-amylase activity.
[0070] Table 1 below notes the observations recorded for each loaf for the sponge, the dough
off the mixer, and the dough during make up and after proofing. It was further observed that
the color of the crust got lighter with the amount of sugar taken out, such that the loaf
containing 50% reduced sugar had the lightest crust. The control and sprouted whole wheat
white flour bread with full sugar were similar in color.

activity can be used to make whole wheat bread that is similar in structure to traditional
whole wheat bread, with the benefits described herein, including less sugar addition and less
