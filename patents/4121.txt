                                        Abstract
The invention of using microcontroller integrated circuit board with embedded IMU
algorithms for sport equipment (ball) traction. Usage of inexpensive components as
gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer injected into the ball acquires readings
during ball motions. Embedded processor performs calculations of ball's orientation
and earth referenced acceleration. Wireless data transmission reduces the need of
physical connection between microcontroller and requestor's equipment. In this context
the equipment is any device which supports wireless data transmission like
smartphone, personal computer and smart-watch. Each round or ball feed takes
recording and processes the data for a short period of time (no more than 30 seconds).
During this period the human which interacts with the invention performs relevant
action by feeding the ball. Each round is transmitted back to the client to represent
relevant information about the flight: velocity, flight time, revolution rate, flight distance.

This document describes the principle of providing inexpensive real time spot analytical system with the
reference to the Cricket game. The solution has been developed to track flight trajectory, revolution
rate, and velocity with a set of sensors embedded in the ball. The model is not tied to the Cricket in
particular therefore the same approach can be used in the similar areas like baseball, tennis or golf.
The overall solution diagram provided in the Figure 1 (see drawing document)
The prototype has been developed with the following key components Figure 2 (see drawing document)

Mathematical model
Position and rotation matrix
According to Euler's rotation theorem [1][3] the rotation of a rigid body (or three-dimensional
coordinate system with the fixed origin) is described by a single rotation about some axis. Such a
rotation may be uniquely described by a minimum of three real parameters. However, for various
reasons, there are several ways to represent it. Many of these representations use more than the
necessary minimum of three parameters, although each of them still has only three degrees of freedom.
An example where rotation representation is used is in computer vision, where an automated observer
needs to track a target. Let's consider a rigid body, with three orthogonal unit vectors fixed to its body
(representing the three axes of the object's local coordinate system). The basic problem is to specify the
orientation of these three unit vectors, and hence the rigid body, with respect to the observer's
coordinate system, regarded as a reference placement in space. The ultimate goal is to describe the 3D
trajectory and ball's telemetry in the 6 degrees of freedom (6Dof) as per Figure 3 (see drawings
document)
In order to do that the best way is to use quaternion. Quaternions, that form a four-dimensional vector
space, have proven very useful in representing rotations due to several advantages above the classical
Euler representations mentioned above [2]. Given that Euler vector [3] usage might lead to the Gimbal
lock. A quaternion representation of rotation is written as a vector (normalized quaternion)
                                                                 Eqq
                                                  Equation 1

The above-mentioned triad of unit vectors is also called a basis. Specifying the coordinates
(components) of vectors of this basis in its current (rotated) position, in terms of the reference (non
rotated) coordinate axes, will completely describe the rotation. The three unit vectors that form the
rotated basis each consist of 3 coordinates, yielding a total of 9 parameters. The orthogonal matrix
(post-multiplying a column vector) corresponding to a clockwise/left-handed (looking along positive axis
to origin) rotation by the unit quaternion
                                           S= qO+ iqi + jq2 + k93
                                                    Equation 2
where qO, is equivalent to qi, q1 is qj, q2, etc. The solution is using Sebastian Madgwick [5][8] algorithm
to derive the quaternion which is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis
gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also
include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion
compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and
magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimized gradient descent algorithm to
compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has
been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference
measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also
benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based [6][7] algorithm of orientation sensor. In the
algorithm the quaternion needs to be converted back to Euler angles to be presented in the client
device. Euler angles $ , 6 and $, in the so called aerospace sequence describe an orientation of frame
achieved by the sequential rotations

                                                    Equation 3
Given by the inhomogeneous expression the rotation matrix can be described as follows
                             1- 2(q      + q)      2(qiq2 -q q3)        2(qoq2 + qiq3)

                                                    Equation 4
Where R is the rotation matrix.

Earth referenced acceleration
Using the equation 4 it's possible to subtract gravity acceleration and get Earth referenced acceleration.
The accelerometer comprised a tri-axial accelerometer with a dynamic range of g. (g=9.81 m*sA2). The
static condition no movement, vector magnitude      =  1 g should indicate the Z axis as 9.81 m*s-2 and the
remaining axis's are 0. Rotating accelerometer upside-down will show Z acceleration becomes negative
as -9.81 m*sA2. Rotating accelerometer with a slight tilt on one side will spread the gravity across X, Y
and Z axis. In order to get pure side acceleration it's required to apply rotation matrix on top of raw
reading from the sensor. Given the quaternion is derived the earth referenced acceleration can be
calculated as per below
Xearth = (1 - 2(q2 +     qi)) x Xraw + (2(q   1 q2 - qoq 3 )) X Yraw + (2(qoq    2 + q1 q3 )) X Zraw
 Earth = (2(q    1q2 + qoqs)) X Xraw + (1 - 2(ql + q)) x Yraw +          (2(q 2 q3 -  goq 1 )) x Zraw
Zearth = ((2(qiq3 - qoq     2 )) X Xraw + (2(qoq 1 + q2 q3 )) X Yraw+(1 -2(q           +q2)) xZraw)       9-81
                                                   Equation 5
Where Xraw, Yraw and Zraw are values from accelerometer sensor. Xearth, Yearth and Zearth are
calculated earth referenced acceleration excluding tilts from all three axes.
Virtual gyroscope
The gyroscope is the critical component in the Madgwick's [8] orientation algorithm. Gyroscopes are
very sensitive and accurate. However there is a limitation in commercially popular sensors at around 6
revolutions per second (rps). 2000 dps (degree per second on each axis) [4]. Meanwhile even an
amateur player can throw the ball at much higher revolution rate. It is also important mentioning the
limitation usually manifested only at one axis. Roughly the diagram below is showing phases of the ball
motion with the mapping to the diagram of a typical profile of gyroscope sensors output. Figure 4 (see
drawings document)
At each given measurement the limit of gyroscope is on one axis. In order to get the most accurate
orientation during the flight period the virtual gyro is used when sensor hits the limit of 2000 deps. For
other two axes the real gyro data is used. The method below describes how to get approximate values
of angels for each side.
The sensor accelerometer, Gp, and magnetometer, Bp, readings measured after the three rotations
Rz($ ) then Ry(6) and finally Rx($) are described by the equations:

                      G, =),(#)R,()R( yrJ)G,                 R,($)R,(&)R(y)       0

                                                                                 $in o
                                                   Equation 6
The tilt-compensated virtual algorithm first calculates the roll and pitch angles $, and 0 from the
accelerometer reading by pre-multiplying Equation 6 by the inverse roll and pitch rotation matrices.
Where the vector contains the three components of gravity measured by the accelerometer.

compensated sensor heading.
The method above is used to derive approximate rotation rate of the axis which is experiencing high
revolution rate during the ball flight.
Client software
On the client side the data is received as an array of
    1) Earth Referenced acceleration for each of three-axis
    2)  Converted Euler angles from the quaternion
    3)   Milliseconds passed from the moment microcontroller started
Integrating of each side the java-script software is plotting the ball 3D trajectory till the moment ball
touches the ground. The touch down point is derived as a spike in the acceleration. Figure 5 (see
