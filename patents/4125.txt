                                             Abstract
The idea behind this device is to allow automation and combination of information and data cap
tured from aerial sensors such as a drone, and ground based sensors. By using GNSS information
in an Airborne target with automatic feature identification and recognition, as well as soil mea
surement sensors underneath the device, and combining this with a multi-spectral sensor infor
mation, the combined airborne and ground sensors will give a much more accurate analysis of
the overall condition of the land.
The devices are comprised of a target, visible from aerial imagery, which has an onboard Li GNSS
receiver capable of receving correction information in post processing to allow centimetre level
positioning, as wel as an on board companion computer to log the GNSS information. Also con
nected to the companion computer on board are an array of soil measurement senors, capable
of measuring PH, Nitrogen, Moisture contect, Electrical conductivity and any other relevant infor
mation. All devices will have lOT connectivityto send data backto a central server, includingGNSS
location and soil measurements at any given time. This data will be combined with drone flyover
information to generate an accurate reporting tool for land owners and agronomists.

Combined Aerial Target/Soil Sensor/GNSS Receiver/lOT Device
 The following statement is a full description of this invention,
          including the best method of performing it
                         known to me:
                                                                  Page 2

                             National Drones Patent Information
Currently, drones are being utilized increasingly in farming applications and agriculture, to capture
imagery of various descriptions for further analysis to be completed from a desktop, and to allow
farmers and agronomists a high level overview of conditions on their property. Typical analysis is
completed using multispectral cameras, which provide useful data for analysis and can help iden
tify areas which need attention.
One of the challenges with only collecting airborne sensor imagery, is that the area of interest still
needs to be ground truthed, or soil tested in certain areas. This patent application and invention
aims to automate that process.
In the world of aerial surveying, ground targets are often used from airborne imagery to identify the
location of surveyed markers on the ground. This allows control points to tie in the photogram
metry processes, and ensure the captured airborne imagery aligns with the real position of these
surveyed targets on the ground.
This idea proposes to utilize ground based sensors for soil measurement, connected directly be
neath aerial targets on a property so that not only is the airborne sensor data used for reporting
and analyis, but each location on the property (there could be hundreds) with a target soil mea
surement values attached to it, to also give more accurate reporting and analysis.
The aerial target will be solar powered, and have an on-board L1 GNSS receiver, to log a constant
GPS position. It will record raw GNSS information such as pseudorange and carrier phase infor
mation. This can then be compared to a nearby L1/L2 receiver and post processed to give cen
timetre level precision information for each target/sensor. Within the target itself will be a com
panion computer such as a raspberry pi, or intel edison for logging of GNSS data running custom
software. The top of the target will have a specific pattern such as a OR code, which means it will
automatically be identifable from the aerial imagery. The target/sensor will also incorporate a
light sensor, to measure the amount of sunlight at any given time.
Underneath this aerial target, will be a digital soil sensor/probe. This soil sensor will have the ability
to measure moisture, nitrogen, PH, salt levels, electrical conductivity, and temperature. This data
will also be logged at regular intervals on board the companion computer in the aerial target
above. All of these targets/sensors will have lOT connectivity and the ability to network between
each other.
The smarts occur after the drone flyover, where the aerial target is captured in the imagery and
timestamped. During the photogrametric reconstruction of the orthophoto, software will iden
tify the aerial targets and match the corresponding soil values to each location. This will give a
more accuracte overall picture of the land quality, especially when combined with the multi
spectral imagery from above. Meteorological station information such as rainfall, wind, sunlight
and other information can also be incorporated into the data for futher analysis.
                                                                                             Page 3

                              National Drones Patent Information
By capturing this al| of this data, the ability to run predictive analytics around yield information
year on year may be possible. The more data is captured and referenced, the better that ma
chine learning becomes at analyising this data, especially when coupled with meteorlogical
information on a yearly basis.
All information from ground based and aerial sensors (multispectral camera) will automatically
be uploaded to a central server for data processing and analysis. This will be custom software,
which can then link out through API's to farm machinery such as tractors for application of fertil
izers/herbicides or anything else that is deemed necessary by the algorithms.
The patent is to protect the development of the hardware, and the software used to create the
aerial target/soil sensor, as well as the software running on each device, and the automation in
the software processing of the combination of all of this relevant data.
The critical elements and design features of this patent are
1) Combined solar powered aerial target with onboard computer/GNSS receiver/Internet of
things connectivity for data transmission and telemetry and soil sensors underneath.
2) Pattern on top for automatic software target location and identification through software
3) Dual Frequency GNSS receiver nearby for correction of target location to the centimetre level
4) Automatic data upload to central processing server upon flight completion
4) Software Algorithms and code to allow reporting on multi-spectral imagery as well as auto
mated soil analysis of the location of each aerial target.
Figure 1 depicts how the ecosystem will work as a whole.
Figure 2 depicts a side view of the combined soil sensor/aerial target schematic.
Figure 3 depicts a top down view of the potential pattern/OR code for image recognition, howev
er alternative methodology may be used (such as barcodes)
Figure 4 depicts a typical target layout on farmland. The targets are not to scale. Due to the GNSS
measurment and the associated soil measurement underneath, along with the pattern recog
nition the Geo-location of each target is known. As each soil sensor/sampler is connected to a
target directly above it, the soil measurement for this location can also be correctly identified. As
each target will have telemetry and internet connectivity, this information will automatically be
sent to a central server for processing, along with the drone multispectral imagery.
                                                                                            Page 4

                       The claims definining the invention are as follows.
1) The Targets are proposed to be made of waterproof, weatherproof high density foam, have
on board GNSS receivers, as well as solar for power, and a companion computer for data pro
cessing and logging. They will also utilize a distinctive pattern on top which can be automatically
recognised by post processing /image recognition software, and associated via GNSS location
with their appropriate soil sensor underneath
2) The targets may have a proximity reading RFID sensor to 'awaken' them when the drone flies
over. They will record and upload soil levels consistently, along with their own internal battery
levels.
3)The aerial targets will have attached soils probe underneath for different measurements as
well as on board battery for data logging and storage. They will also have the ability for multiple
soil probes to be connected if necessary. The targets will have a built in light sensor, to measure
the amount of sunlight at any given time. Multiple probes can be used under the device to take
measurements at different soil depths.
4) The targets and probes will all be part of an interconnected network of lOT Devices, constant
ly logging data back to a central server, along with drone recorded multispectral and RGB imag
ery from regular flyovers. All of this data will be combined for accurate reporting and analysis of
crops.
5) The software used for processing all of the ground based and airborne information will run
custom algorithms, capable of producing prescription reports which link out to custom API's for
other farm equipment to complete application of products.
