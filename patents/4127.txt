Problem : When the banks / agencies issue new card / replacement card to the customer for any
reason, al! the direct debits for the old card won't work. This leads to the declining transactions
which inurn results into the penalties to the customer OR disconnecting the services. So, the
customer need to run around the merchants / service providers to update the details of the new
carci. Sometimes customers will not know untii the transactions decline and penalties apphled. This is
not a good customer experience. There are 25 million Australians each holding atleast 2 to 3 cards
wil have the trouble of running around the merchants / service providers when new card is issued.
Objective : To improve the customer experience of automatically switching the direct debits when
dhe r7w 'ard / replacement card is issued.
Solution: The software product, will be implemented at banks and agencies, that captures all the
direct. ebit details of the customer of the old card and informs the corresponding merchants /
f;erice: providers with the new card details seamlessly so that the direct debits will go through
successfUlly without the customer intervention.
