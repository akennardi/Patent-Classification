25                        Detailed Description of the Invention
            As used herein "allopregnanolone" also encompasses pharmaceutically
   acceptable, pharmacologically active derivatives including individual
   enantiomers (dextrogyral and levrogyral enantiomers) and their
30 pharmaceutically acceptable salts, mixtures of enantiomers and their
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and active metabolites and their
                                           53

   pharmaceutically acceptable salts, unless otherwise noted. It is understood that
   in some cases dosages of enantiomers, derivatives, and metabolites may need to
   be adjusted based on relative activity of the racemic mixture of
   allopregnanolone.
 5          As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to derivatives
   of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by
   making the acid-addition or base-addition salts thereof. Example of
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not limited to mineral or
   organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of
10 acidic residues such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts
   include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of
   the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic
   acids. Such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic
   acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and
15 nitric acids; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic,
   succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic,
   hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2
   acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, tolunesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, methanesulfonic,
   ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic salts.
20          Delayed release dosage form: A delayed release dosage form is one that
   releases a drug (or drugs) at a time other than promptly after administration.
            Extended release dosage form: An extended release dosage form is one
   that allows at least a twofold reduction in dosing frequency as compared to the
   drug presented as a conventional dosage form (e.g. as a solution or prompt drug
25 releasing, conventional solid dosage form).
            Modified release dosage form: A modified release dosage form is one for
   which the drug release characteristics of time, course and/or location are chosen
   to accomplish therapeutic or convenience objectives not offered by conventional
   dosage forms such as solutions, ointments, or promptly dissolving dosage forms.
30 Delayed release and extended release dosage forms and their combinations are
   types of modified release dosage forms.
                                            54

            Matrix-forming materials: Matrix forming materials are materials which
   form strong, viscous gels upon hydration and provide control of drug diffusion
   and release. In hydrophilic matrix systems, matrix forming materials are
   uniformly incorporated throughout the tablet. Upon contact with water, the
 5 outer tablet layer is partially hydrated, forming a gel layer. The rate of diffusion
   of the drug(s) out of the gel layer and the rate of erosion of the gel layer
   determine overall tablet dissolution and drug delivery rates. Examples of matrix
   forming materials include cellulose ethers that are water-soluble such as
   methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.
10          "Alkyl", as used herein, refers to the radical of saturated or unsaturated
   aliphatic groups, including straight-chain alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl groups,

   for branched chain), more preferably 20 or fewer carbon atoms, more preferably
   12 or fewer carbon atoms, and most preferably 8 or fewer carbon atoms. In
   certain embodiments, alkyl groups contain between 1 and 6, more preferably
20 between 1 and 4 carbon atoms. Likewise, preferred cycloalkyls have from 3-10
   carbon atoms in their ring structure, and more preferably have 5, 6 or 7 carbons
   in the ring structure. The ranges provided above are inclusive of all values
   between the minimum value and the maximum value.
           The alkyl groups may also be substituted with one or more groups
25 including, but not limited to, halogen, hydroxy, amino, thio, ether, ester,
   carboxy, oxo, and aldehyde groups. The alkyl groups may also contain one or
   more heteroatoms within the carbon backbone. Preferably the heteroatoms
   incorporated into the carbon backbone are oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and
   combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the alkyl group contains between
30 one and four heteroatoms.

   iodine.
            The term "substituted" as used herein, refers to all permissible
   substituents of the compounds described herein. In the broadest sense, the
   permissible substituents include acyclic and cyclic, branched and unbranched,
10 carbocyclic and heterocyclic, aromatic and nonaromatic substituents of organic
   compounds. Illustrative substituents include, but are not limited to, halogens,
   hydroxyl groups, or any other organic groupings containing or comprising any
   number of carbon atoms, preferably 1-14 carbon atoms, and optionally include
   one or more heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen grouping in linear,

   any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which
   satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. It is understood that "substitution" or
30 "substituted" includes the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance
   with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the
                                           57

   substitution results in a stable compound, i.e. a compound that does not
   spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization,
   elimination, etc.
            A therapeutically effective treatment is one that results in alleviation of
 5 one or more symptoms of the injury, such as improved morphological recovery
   (i.e., enhanced tissue viability) and/or behavioral recovery. The improvement
   can be characterized as an increase in either the rate and/or the extent of
   behavioral and/or anatomical recovery following the traumatic CNS injury.
   Neurodegeneration is the progressive loss of neurons in the central nervous
10 system. As used herein, "neuroprotection" is the arrest and/or reverse
   progression of neurodegeneration following a traumatic central nervous system
   injury. Multiple physiological events lead to the neurodegeneration of the CNS
   tissues following a traumatic CNS injury. These events include, for example,
   cerebral edema, destruction of vascular integrity, increase in the immune and
15 inflammatory response, demyelinization, and lipid peroxidation. The
   formulation may be useful in reducing and/or preventing the physiological
   events leading to neurodegeneration, including reducing or eliminating neuronal
   cell death, edema, ischemia, and enhancing tissue viability following a traumatic
   injury to the central nervous system.

                 Modified Release Neuroactive steroid Formulations
            A.     Neuroactive Steroids
            Neuroactive steroids (or neurosteroids) are natural, synthetic, or semi
25 synthetic steroids that rapidly alter neuronal excitability through interaction with
   neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. Neuroactive steroids effect binding to
   membrane-bound receptors such as those for inhibitory and (or) excitatory
   neurotransmitters including GABAA, NMDA, and sigma receptors.
            The steroids that may be classified into functional groups according to
30 chemical structure and physiological activity and include estrogenic hormones,
   progestational hormones, and androgenic hormones. Of particular interest are
                                           58

   progestational hormones, referred to herein as "progestins" or "progestogens",
   and their derivatives and bioactive metabolites. Members of this broad family
   include steroid hormones disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,
   Gennaro et al., Mack Publishing Co. (18th ed. 1990), 990-993. As with all other
 5 classes of steroids, sterioisomerism is of fundamental importance with the sex
   hormones. As used herein, a variety of progestins (i.e., progesterone) and their
   derivatives, including both synthetic and natural products, can be used, as well
   as progestin metabolites such as progesterone.
           The term "progesterone" as used herein refers to a member of the
10 progestin family and includes a 21 carbon steroid hormone. Progesterone is also
   known as D4-pregnene-3,20-dione; A4-pregnene-3,20-dione; or pregn-4-ene
   3,20-dione. As used herein a "synthetic progestin" is a molecule whose
   structure is related to that of progesterone, is synthetically derived, and retains
   the biologically activity of progesterone (i.e., treats a traumatic CNS injury).
15         Representative synthetic progestins include, but are not limited to,
   substitutions at the 17-position of the progesterone ring to introduce a hydroxyl,
   acetyl, hydroxyl acetyl, aliphatic, nitro, or heterocyclic group, modifications to
   produce 17a-OH esters (i.e., 17 a-hydroxyprogesterone caproate), as well as
   modifications that introduce 6-methyl, 6-ene, and 6-chloro substituents onto
20 progesterone (i.e., medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and
   chlomadinone acetate), and which retains the biologically activity of
   progesterone (i.e., treats a traumatic CNS injury). Such progestin derivatives
   include 5-dehydroprogesterone, 6-dehydro-retroprogesterone (dydrogesterone),
   allopregnanolone (allopregnan-3a, or 3p-ol-20-one), ethynodiol diacetate,
25 hydroxyprogesterone caproate (pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 17-(1 -oxohexy)oxy);
   levonorgestrel, norethindrone, norethindrone acetate (19-norpregn-4-en-20-yn
   3-one, 17-(acetyloxy)-,(17a)-); norethynodrel, norgestrel, pregnenolone, and
   megestrol acetate.

   4-pregnene- 17a,20p,21 -triol-3-one, and pregnenolone methyl ether. Further
   progestin derivatives include esters with non-toxic organic acids such as acetic
   acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, malic acid, caproic acid, and citric acid and
10 inorganic salts such as hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate and carbonate
   salts. Other suitable progestins include alphaxalone, alphadolone, hydroxydione,
   and minaxolone.

30          In particular embodiments, the steroids are one or more of a series
   sedative-hypnotic 3 alpha-hydroxy ring A-reduced pregnane steroids that
                                            61

   include the major metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, 3 alpha
   hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone) and 3 alpha,21-dihydroxy
   5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (allotetrahydroDOC), respectively. These 3 alpha
   hydroxysteroids do not interact with classical intracellular steroid receptors but
 5 bind stereoselectively and with high affinity to receptors for the major inhibitory
   neurotransmitter in the brain, gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA).
           In certain embodiments, the neuroactive steroids are progesterone,
   allopregnanolone or other progesterone analogs. In a particular embodiment, the
   neuroactive steroid is allopregnanolone or a derivative thereof. Exemplary
10 derivatives include, but are not limited to, (20R)-l7beta-(1-hydroxy-2,3
   butadienyl)-5alpha-androstane-3alpha-ol (HBAO). Additional derivatives are
   described in WO 2012/127176.
           The lipophilic nature of allopregnanolone can make it different to
   formulate for in vivo administration. As discussed above, allopregnanolone can
15 be formulated with a host, such as a cyclodextrin to improve the solubility.
   Alternatively, or additionally, allopregnanolone can be modified in an attempt to
   improve the solubility. For example, polar groups can be introduced onto
   position 16a with the goal of increasing water solubility, brain accessibility, and
   potency of neuroactive steroids as described in Kasal et al., J. Med. Chem.,
20 52(7), 2119-215 (2009).
           As used herein "neuroactive steroid" also encompasses pharmaceutically
   acceptable, pharmacologically active derivatives of neuroactive steroids
   including both individual enantiomers of neuroactive steroids (dextrogyral and
   levrogyral enantiomers) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, mixtures of
25 neuroactive steroid enantiomers and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and
   active metabolites of neuroactive steroid and their pharmaceutically acceptable
   salts, unless otherwise noted. It is understood that in some cases dosages of
   enantiomers, derivatives, and metabolites may need to be adjusted based on
   relative activity of the racemic mixture of neuroactive steroid.
30         As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to derivatives
   of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by
                                           62

   making the acid-addition or base-addition salts thereof. Example of
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not limited to mineral or
   organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of
   acidic residues such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts
 5 include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of
   the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic
   acids. Such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic
   acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and
   nitric acids; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic,
10 succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic,
   hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2
   acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, tolunesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, methanesulfonic,
   ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic salts.
           The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds can be
15 synthesized from the parent compound, which contains a basic or acidic moiety,
   by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by
   reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric
   amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a
   mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate,
20 ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are
   found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th ed., Lippincott Williams &
   Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, 2000, p. 704.
           The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to
   those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are,
25 within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the
   tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation,
   allergic response, or other problems or complications commensurate with a
   reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
           Neuroprotective steroids generally contain one or more chiral centers,
30 and thus exist as one or more stereoisomers. Such stereoisomers can be
                                            63

   prepared and/or isolated as a single enantiomer, a mixture of diastereomers, or a
   racemic mixture.
           As used herein, the term "stereoisomers" refers to compounds made up
   of the same atoms having the same bond order but having different three
 5 dimensional arrangements of atoms which are not interchangeable. The three
   dimensional structures are called configurations. As used herein, the term
   "enantiomers" refers to two stereoisomers which are non-superimposable mirror
   images of one another. As used herein, the term "optical isomer" is equivalent
   to the term "enantiomer". As used herein the term "diastereomer" refers to two
10 stereoisomers which are not mirror images but also not superimposable. The
   terms racematee", racemicc mixture" or "racemic modification" refer to a
   mixture of equal parts of enantiomers. The term "chiral center" refers to a
   carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. Choice of the
   appropriate chiral column, eluent, and conditions necessary to effect separation
15 of the pair of enantiomers is well known to one of ordinary skill in the art using
   standard techniques (see e.g. Jacques, J. et al., "Enantiomers, Racemates, and
   Resolutions", John Wiley and Sons, Inc. 1981).
            B.     Dosage and Pharmacokinetics
20         The compositions including the therapeutically effective concentration of
   progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin may be administered
   using any acceptable method known in the art. For example, the pharmaceutical
   composition including progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin
   can be administered by any method, including intramuscular (IM) injection,
25 subcutaneous (SC) injection, intrathecal administration, or via the pulmonary,
   nasal or mucosal routes of administration. The formulation is designed to mimic
   the intra-CNS levels achieved with progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a
   synthetic progestin administered by infusion over a period of about 1 to about
   120 hours, more preferably over a period of about 24 to about 72 hours, over a
30 period of about 48 to about 96 hours, or over a period of about 24 to about 120
   hours.
                                          64

            In one embodiment, progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic
   progestin is administered in a dose equivalent to parenteral administration of
   about 0.1 ng to about 100 g per kg of body weight, about 10 ng to about 50 g per
   kg of body weight, about 100 ng to about 1 g per kg of body weight, from about
 5 1tg to about 100 mg per kg of body weight, from about 1 tg to about 50 mg per
   kg of body weight, from about 1 mg to about 500 mg per kg of body weight; and
   from about 1 mg to about 50 mg per kg of body weight. Alternatively, the
   amount of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin administered
   to achieve a therapeutic effective dose is about 0.1 ng, 1 ng, 10 ng, 100 ng, 1 tg,
10 10 tg, 100 tg, 1 mg, 1.5mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7 mg, 8 mg, 9 mg,
   10 mg, 11 mg, 12 mg, 13 mg, 14 mg, 15 mg, 16 mg, 17 mg, 18 mg, 19 mg, 20
   mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 90 mg, 100 mg, 500 mg per kg
   of body weight or greater.
            Although the progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin
15 may be administered once or several times a day, and the duration of the
   treatment may be once per day for a period of about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days or
   more, it is more preferably to administer either a single dose in the form of an
   individual dosage unit or several smaller dosage units or by multiple
   administration of subdivided dosages at certain intervals.     For instance, a
20 dosage unit can be administered from about 0 hours to about 1 hr, about 1 hr to
   about 24 hr, about 1 to about 72 hours, about 1 to about 120 hours, or about 24
   hours to at least about 120 hours post injury. Alternatively, the dosage unit can
   be administered from about 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
   15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 30, 40, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours or longer post
25 injury. Subsequent dosage units can be administered any time following the
   initial administration such that a therapeutic effect is achieved. For instance,
   additional dosage units can be administered to protect the subject from the
   secondary wave of edema that may occur over the first several days post-injury.
   The therapy with the progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin
30 can instead include a multi-level progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic
   progestin dosing regimen wherein the progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a
                                           65

   synthetic progestin is administered during two or more time periods, preferably
   having a combined duration of about 12 hours to about 7 days, including, 1, 2, 3,
   4, or 5 days or about 15, 15, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95,
   100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, or 144 hours or about I to 24 hours,
 5 about 12 to 36 hours, about 24 to 48 hours, about 36 to 60 hours, about 48 to 72
   hours, about 60 to 96 hours, about 72 to 108 hours, about 96 to 120 hours, or
   about 108 to 136 hours. In one embodiment, the two-level progesterone,
   allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin dosing regimen has a combined
   duration of about 1 day to about 5 days; in other embodiments, the two-level
10 progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin dosing regimen has a
   combined duration of about 1 day to about 3 days.
            In one embodiment, the total hourly dose of progesterone,
   allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin that is to be administered during the
   first and second time periods of the two-level progesterone, allopregnanolone, or
15 a synthetic progestin dosing regimen is chosen such that a higher total dose of
   progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin per hour is given during
   the first time period and a lower dose of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a
   synthetic progestin per hour is given during the second time period. The
   duration of the individual first and second time periods of the two-level
20 progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin dosing regimen can
   vary, depending upon the health of the individual and history of the traumatic
   injury. Generally, the subject is administered higher total dose of progesterone,
   allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin per hour for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12
   or 24 hours out of the 1 day to 5 day two-level progesterone, allopregnanolone,
25 or a synthetic progestin dosing regimen. The length of the second time period
   can be adjusted accordingly, and range for example, from about 12 hrs, 24 hrs,
   36 hrs, 48 hrs, 60 hrs, 72 hrs, 84 hrs, 96 hrs, 108 hrs, 120 hrs or about 12 to
   about 36 hrs, about 24 to about 36 hrs, about 24 to about 48 hrs, about 36 hrs to
   about 60 hours, about 48 hrs to about 72 hrs, about 60 hrs to about 84 hours,
30 about 72 hrs to about 96 hrs, or about 108 hrs to about 120 hrs. Thus, for
   example, where the two-level progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic
                                            66

   progestin dosing regimen has a combined duration of 3 days, the higher total
   doses of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin could be
   administered for the first hour, and the lower total hourly dose of progesterone,
   allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin could be administered for hours 2 to
 5 72.
           Area under the curve (AUC) refers to the area under the curve that tracks
   the serum concentration (nmol/L) of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a
   synthetic progestin over a give time following the IV administration of the
   reference progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin standard. By
10 "reference progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin standard" is
   intended the formulation of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic
   progestin that serves as the basis for determination of the total hourly
   progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin dose to be administered
   to a human subject with a traumatic central nervous system injury to achieve the
15 desired positive effect, i.e., a positive therapeutic response that is improved with
   respect to that observed without administration of progesterone,
   allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin. In an embodiment, the dose of
   progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin to be administered
   provides a final serum level of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic
20 progestin of about 100 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml, about 1100 ng/ml to about
   1450 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml to about 250 ng/ml, about 200 ng/ml to about 350 ng/ml,
   about 300 ng/ml to about 450 ng/ml, about 350 ng/ml to about 450 ng/ml, about
   400 ng/ml to about 550 ng/ml, about 500 ng/ml to about 650 ng/ml, about 600
   ng/ml to about 750 ng/ml, about 700 ng/ml to about 850 ng/ml, about 800 ng/ml
25 to about 950 ng/ml, about 900 ng/ml to about 1050 ng/ml, about 1000 ng/ml to
   about 1150 ng/ml, about 100 ng/ml to about 1250 ng/ml, about 1200 ng/ml to
   about 1350 ng/ml, about 1300 ng/ml to about 1500 ng/m. In specific
   embodiments, the serum level of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic
   progestin is about 100 ng/ml, 250 ng/ml, 300 ng/ml, 350 ng/ml, 360 ng/ml, 370
30 ng/ml, 380 ng/ml, 390 ng/ml, 400 ng/ml, 410 ng/ml, 420 ng/ml, 430 ng/ml, 440
   ng/ml, 450 ng/ml, 500 ng/ml, 750 ng/ml, 900 ng/ml, 1200 ng/ml, 1400 ng/ml, or
                                             67

   1600 ng/ml.
           In other embodiments, the constant progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a
   synthetic progestin therapy or the two-level progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a
   synthetic progestin therapy includes a final time period in which the
 5 administration of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin is
   tapered. By "tapered administration" is meant an administration protocol which
   reduces the dose of administration to the patient and thereby produces a gradual
   reduction and eventual elimination of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a
   synthetic progestin, either over a fixed period of time or a time determined
10 empirically by a physician's assessment based on regular monitoring of a
   therapeutic response of a subject to a traumatic CNS injury. The period of the
   tapered progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin administration
   can be about 12, 24, 36, 48 hours or longer. Alternatively, the period of the
   tapered progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin administration
15 can range from about 1 to 12 hours, about 12 to about 48 hours, or about 24 to
   about 36 hours.
           The drug taper employed could be a "linear" taper. For example, a "10%
   linear taper from 500 mg would go 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100,
   50. Alternatively, an exponential taper could be employed which, if the program
20 outlined above is used as an example, the exponential taper would be, e.g., 500,
   450, 405, 365, 329, 296, 266,239, etc. Accordingly, about a 5%, 10%,
   20%,30%, or 40% linear or exponential taper could be employed in the methods
   of the invention. In addition, a linear or exponential taper of about 1% to 5%,
   about 6% to 10%, about 11 % to 15%, about 16% to 20%, about 21% to 25%,
25 about 26% to 30%, about 31% to 35%, about 36% to 40% could be employed.
           Where a subject undergoing therapy exhibits a partial response, or a
   relapse following completion of the first cycle of the therapy, subsequent
   courses of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin therapy may
   be needed to achieve a partial or complete therapeutic response. Thus,
30 subsequent to a period of time off from a first treatment period, which may have
   included a constant progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin
                                           68

   dosing regimen or a two-level progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic
   progestin dosing regimen, a subject may receive one or more additional
   treatment periods including either constant or two-level progesterone,
   allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin dosing regimens. Such a period of
 5 time off between treatment periods is referred to herein as a time period of
   discontinuance. It is recognized that the length of the time period of
   discontinuance is dependent upon the degree of subject response (i.e., complete
   versus partial) achieved with any prior treatment periods of the progesterone,
   allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin therapy.
10          These multiple treatment sessions are referred to herein as maintenance
   cycles, where each maintenance cycle includes a completed constant or two
   level progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic progestin dosing regimen.
   By "completed two-level progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a synthetic
   progestin dosing regimen" is intended the subject has been administered both the
15 first period and the second period of progesterone, allopregnanolone, or a
   synthetic progestin dosing. The necessity for multiple maintenance cycles can be
   assessed by monitoring the physiological and behavioral improvement of the
   patient. The duration between maintenance cycles can be about 1 hr, 15 hr, 1
   day, 2 day, 3 day, 4 day, 5 day, 6 day or other such time periods falling within
20 the range of about 1 day to about 14 days.
            As used herein, "about" means approximately plus or minus ten percent.
            C.     Formulations
            Formulations of neuroactive steroids contain one or more neuroactive
25 steroids in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable
   excipients. In some cases, formulations contain just one neuroactive steroid. In
   other cases, the formulations include a mixture of two or more neuroactive
   steroids. The neuroactive steroids can be incorporated in the formulations
   described below as neutral compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salts,
30 and/or prodrugs or metabolites.
                                          69

   Pharmaceutical formulations can be designed for immediate release, sustained
   release, delayed release and/or burst release of one or more neuroactive steroids
   in a therapeutically effective amount. In an embodiment, the formulation
   provides an initial burst release of a "loading dosage", followed by a sustained
 5 release to maintain the therapeutically effective dosage. This can be
   accomplished using a delayed and/or extended release formulation.
                    1.     Solubilization of Neuroactive Steroids
            Many neuroactive steroids possess limited aqueous solubility. In order
   to provide formulations capable of delivering therapeutically effective dosages,
10 a variety of methods can be employed to enhance the solubility and
   bioavailability of neuroactive steroids. See, for example, "Water-Insoluble Drug
   Formulation", 2nd Edition, edited by Rong Liu (CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL,
   2008). Using the techniques described below, a solubilized formulation of one
   or more neuroactive steroids can be prepared. These solubilized formulations
15 can be further incorporated into the parenteral and non-parenteral formulations
   described in sections 2 and 3
                            a.     Inclusion Complexes
            The solubility of neuroactive steroids can be improved by inclusion
   complexation (i.e., host-guest formulations). Inclusion complexes are formed
20 when a nonpolar molecule (i.e., the guest, such as a drug with poor aqueous
   stability) or portion of a molecule inserts into a nonpolar cavity of another
   molecule or group of molecules (i.e., the host). If the host molecule or
   molecules exhibit water good solubility, the solubility of the host-guest complex
   will be greater than the solubility of the guest alone.
25          Inclusion complexes containing or comprising one or more neuroactive
   steroids can be formed using any suitable host molecule or molecules. For
   example, the water solubility of neuroactive steroids can be increased by
   inclusion complexation with cyclodextrins. Steroid-cyclodextrin complexes are
   known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 7,569,557 to Backensfeld,
30 et al., and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2006/0058262 to
   Zoppetti, et al.
                                            70

            Dextrans are soluble polysaccharides produced by bacteria and yeasts.
   They are characterized by a predominance (>95%) of a (1-6) backbone linkages
   and varying proportions of a(1-2), a(1- 3) and a(1-4) linkages typically at
   branch points 1, 2. Dextrins are partially hydrolyzed glucose homopolymers
 5 composed exclusively of a(1-4) backbone linkages.
            Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides containing or comprising six
   (a-cyclodextrin), seven (P-cyclodextrin), eight (y-cyclodextrin), or more a-(1,4)
   linked glucose residues. The hydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrins are oriented
   to the outside of the ring while the glucosidic oxygen and two rings of the non
10 exchangeable hydrogen atoms are directed towards the interior of the cavity. As
   a result, cyclodextrins possess a hydrophobic inner cavity combined with a
   hydrophilic exterior which conveys water solubility. Upon combination with a
   hydrophobic drug, such as a neuroactive steroid, the neuroactive steroid (i.e., the
   guest) inserts into the hydrophobic interior of the cyclodextrin (i.e., the host).
15 The host-guest complex retains water solubility as a consequence of the
   hydrophobic exterior of the cyclodextrin ring.
            Neuroactive steroid-cyclodextrin complexes can, as solubility permits,
   be incorporated into any of the parenteral and non-parenteral formulations
   described below. If desired, the aqueous solubility of solid neuoractive steroid
20 cyclodextrin complexes can be further enhanced by isolating the neuoractive
   steroid-cyclodextrin complex as a solid via lyophilization and/or via micronizing
   the solid neuoractive steroid-cyclodextrin complex.

            This cyclic orientation provides a truncated cone structure that is
   hydrophilic on the exterior and lipophilic on the interior. Cyclodextrin
   complexes are formed when a guest molecule is partially or fully contained in
   the interior of the cavity. The parent a-,  P-, and y-cyclodextrins (particularly p)
 5 have limited aqueous solubility and show toxicity when given parenterally.
   Therefore, the parent cyclodextrin structure can be chemically modified to
   generate a parenterally safe CD-derivative. The modifications are typically made
   at one or more of the 2, 3, or 6 position hydroxyls.
            Neuroactive steroid-cyclodextrin complexes are preferably formed from
10 a cyclodextrin selected from the group consisting of a-cyclodextrin,     p
   cyclodextrin, y-cyclodextrin, and derivatives thereof. The cyclodextrin may be
   chemically modified such that some or all of the primary or secondary hydroxyl
   groups of the macrocycle, or both, are functionalized with a pendant group.
   Suitable pendant groups include, but are not limited to, sulfinyl, sulfonyl,
15 phosphate, acyl, and C1-C1 2 alkyl groups optionally substituted with one or more
   (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4) hydroxy, carboxy, carbonyl, acyl, oxy, oxo; or a combination
   thereof. Methods of modifying these alcohol residues are known in the art, and
   many cyclodextrin derivatives are commercially available, including sulfo butyl
   ether  p-cyclodextrins   available under the trade name CAPTISOL® from Ligand
20 Pharmaceuticals (La Jolla, CA).
            Examples of suitable cyclodextrins for use in neuroactive steroid, e.g.,
   allopregnanolone formulations, can include cyclodextrins disclosed in U.S.
   Patent Nos. 5,874,418; 6,046,177; and 7,635,733, which are herein incorporated

   thereof.
           Preferred cyclodextrins include, but are not limited to, alkyl
   cyclodextrins, hydroxy alkyl cyclodextrins, such as hydroxy propyl     p
15 cyclodextrin, carboxy alkyl cyclodextrins and sulfoalkyl ether cyclodextrins,
   such as sulfo butyl ether p-cyclodextrin.
           In particular embodiments, the cyclodextrin is a alpha, beta, or gamma
   cyclodextrin having a plurality of charges (e.g., negative or positive) on the
   surface. In more particular embodiments, the cyclodextrin is a P-cyclodextrin
20 containing or comprising a plurality of functional groups that are negatively
   charged at physiological pH. Examples of such functional groups include, but
   are not limited to, carboxylic acid (carboxylate) groups, sulfonate (RSO3-),
   phosphonate groups, phosphinate groups, and amino acids that are negatively
   charged at physiological pH. The charged functional groups can be bound
25 directly to the cyclodextrins or can be linked by a space, such as an alkylene
   chain. The number of carbon atoms in the alkylene chain can be varied, but is
   generally between about 1 and 10 carbons, preferably 1-6 carbons, more
   preferably 1-4 carbons. Highly sulfated cyclodextrins are described in U.S.
   Patent No. 6,316,613.
                                           73

            In one embodiment, the cyclodextrins is a P-cyclodextrin functionalized
   with a plurality of sulfobutyl ether groups. Such a cyclodextrins is sold under
   the tradename CAPTISOL®.
            CAPTISOL® is a polyanionic beta-cyclodextrin derivative with a
 5 sodium sulfonate salt separated from the lipophilic cavity by a butyl ether spacer
   group, or sulfobutylether (SBE). CAPTISOL® is not a single chemical species,
   but comprised of a multitude of polymeric structures of varying degrees of
   substitution and positional/regional isomers dictated and controlled to a uniform
   pattern by a patented manufacturing process consistently practiced and
10 improved to control impurities.
           CAPTISOL* contains six to seven sulfobutyl ether groups per
   cyclodextrin molecule. Because of the very low pKa of the sulfonic acid groups,
   CAPTISOL* carries multiple negative charges at physiologically compatible pH
   values. The four-carbon butyl chain coupled with repulsion of the end group
15 negative charges allows for an "extension" of the cyclodextrin cavity. This often
   results in stronger binding to drug candidates than can be achieved using other
   modified cyclodextrins. It also provides a potential for ionic charge interactions
   between the cyclodextrin and a positively charged drug molecule. In addition,
   these derivatives impart exceptional solubility and parenteral safety to the
20 molecule. Relative to beta-cyclodextrin, CAPTISOL® provides higher
   interaction characteristics and superior water solubility in excess of 100
   grams/100 ml, a 50-fold improvement.
           In other embodiments, the cyclodextrins has plurality of functional
   groups that are negatively charged at physiological pH. Suitable positively
25 charged groups include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium groups.
   Exemplary cyclodextrins include, but are not limited to, mono-6(A)
   butylammonium-6(A)-deoxy-beta-cyclodextrin tosylate (BuAM-beta-CD) and
   Amine- and guanidine- derivatised     p-cyclodextrin  (pCD).
            Preferably, the cyclodextrin is present in an amount of from about 0.1%
30 to about 40% w/w of the overall formulation, preferably from about 5% to about
   40% w/w, more preferably about 10% to about 40% w/w, most preferably about
                                           74

   10% to about 35% w/w. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the
   cyclodextrins is from about 15% to about 35% w/w, preferably from about 20%
   to about 35% w/w, more preferably about 30% to about 35% w/w. In one
   embodiment, the formulation contains about 1 to about 2, preferably about 1.5
 5 mg neuroactive steroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) per ml of cyclodextin, e.g.,
   CAPTISOL@.
                           b.     Ion Exchange Resins
           Ion exchange resins (IER) are high molecular weight water insoluble
   polymers containing or comprising fixed positively or negatively charged
10 functional groups in their matrix, which have an affinity for oppositely charged
   counter ions. IER are solid insoluble high molecular weight poly electrolytes
   that can exchange with surrounding medium reversibly and stochiometrically.
   IER are Styrene (Di Vinyl Benzene) copolymer containing or comprising
   - Acidic groups: Carboxylic or sulphonic for Cation E.R.
15 - Basic groups: Quaternary Ammonium for Anion E.R
           Based on the nature of the ionic species being interchanged, the IE
   process is known as either cation exchange (CE) or anion exchange (AE).The IE
   process is competitive in nature. In practice, drug in an ionic form (usually
   solution) is mixed with the appropriate IER form a complex, known as
20 'resinate'.
           The performance of resinates are governed by several factors, such as:
   1. The pH and temperature of the drug solution;
   2. The molecular weight and charge intensity of the drug and IER;
   3. Geometry;
25 4. Mixing speed;
   5. Ionic strength of the drug solution;
   6. Degree of cross linking and particle size of the IER;
   7. The nature of solvent; and
   8. Contact time between the drug species and the IER.
30         In general, IER consist of spherical beads of approximately 0.5-1.2 mm
   in diameter. The most common type is an opaque yellow in color, although other
                                           75

   colors are also reported. The constitution of each spherical particle of IER is
   similar to that of a homogeneous gel. The shrinkage or expansion of the
   spherical volume that takes place is based on the ionic environment in which the
   IER is present.
 5         A major drawback of controlled or sustained release systems is dose
   dumping, resulting in increased risk of toxicity. Ion exchange resins offers better
   drug retaining properties and prevention of dose dumping. The polymeric
   (physical) and ionic (chemical) properties of ion exchange resin will release the
   drugs more uniformly than that of simple matrices (because of physical
10 properties only). Drug loaded onto the strong IER resinates provides simplest
   form of controlled or sustained release delivery system. Resinates can be filled
   directly in a capsule, suspended in liquids, suspended in matrices or compressed
   into tablets. Drug will be slowly released by ion exchange phenomenon and
   absorbed.
15         Microencapsulation of resinates provides better control over the drug
   release for oral or depo release. The absorption of the drug from coated
   resinates is a consequence of the entry of the counter ions into the coated
   resinates and release of drug ions from drug resin complex by the ion exchange
   process and diffusion of drug ions through the membrane into the dissolution
20 medium. Designed release rate at the desired level can be obtained by
   optimization of coating thickness. Microencapsulation of resinates can be
   achieved by air suspension coating (Wurster process), interfacial
   polymerization, solvent evaporation or pan coating.
           Modification of the coating of resinates for example, by pretreatment
25 with polyethylene glycol 400, can be used to maintain the geometry and
   improve coating process. The pretreated resinates are then coated with ethyl
   cellulose or any other water insoluble polymer. The polyethylene glycol helps
   in controlling the swelling rate of matrix in water, while an outer ethyl cellulose
   coating modifies the diffusion pattern of ions in and out of system. A major
30 drawback of controlled or sustained release systems is dose dumping, resulting
   in increased risk of toxicity. Ion exchange resins offers better drug retaining
                                           76

   properties and prevention of dose dumping. The polymeric (physical) and ionic
   (chemical) properties of ion exchange resin release the drugs more uniformly
   than that of simple matrices.
            Drug loaded onto the strong IER resinates provides simplest form of
 5 controlled or sustained release delivery system. Resinates can be filled directly
   in a capsule, suspended in liquids, suspended in matrices or compressed into
   tablets. Drug will be slowly released by ion exchange phenomenon and
   absorbed.
            There are a few ion exchange resins suitable for intravenous
10 administration of drug. For example, Shimada, et al., in Jpn J. Antibiot. 1985
   Sep;38(9):2496-502, describes a clinical study on unmodified intravenous dried
   ion-exchange resin treated human normal immunoglobulin, SM-4300 that
   showed efficacy with no obvious antipyretic effect, opsonic effect or healing
   impairment.
15                          c.     Lipid Carriers
            To facilitate the administration of neuroactive steroids possessing poor
   aqueous solubility, a variety of lipid carriers may be used.
                                            Lipid Emulsions
            Neuroactive steroids can be combined suspended or dissolved using a
20 lipid emulsion. Lipid emulsions are known in the art. See, for example, U.S.
   Patent No. 6361792 to Long, et. al.; U.S. Patent No. 7,550,155 to Zhang, et al.,
   and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2006/0067952. Lipid
   emulsions formulations typically include one or more neuroactive steroids, an
   oil component, an emulsifier, and water.
25          The oil component can be a monoglyceride, a diglyceride, a triglyceride,
   or combinations thereof. In some cases, the oil component includes an ester
   formed between one or more fatty acids and an alcohol other than glycerol. The
   oil component can be, for example, a vegetable oil such as almond oil, borage
   oil, black currant seed oil, corn oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, sesame oil,
30 cottonseed oil, peanut oil, olive oil, rapeseed oil, coconut oil, palm oil, canola
   oil, or combinations thereof. Vegetable oils are typically long-chain
                                            77

   triglycerides formed from C 14 -C 22 fatty acids. The oil component can also
   include medium chain triglycerides formed from C8-C12 fatty acids, such as
   Miglyol 812, Crodamol@ GTCC-PN, or Neobees M-5 oil.
            The emulsifier serves to stabilize the lipid emulsion by preventing
 5 separation of the emulsion into individual oil and aqueous phases. Suitable
   emulsifiers include, but are not limited to, propylene glycol mono- and di-fatty
   acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty
   acid esters, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene co-polymers and block co
   polymers, salts of fatty alcohol sulphates, sorbitan fatty acid esters, esters of
10 polyethylene-glycol glycerol ethers, oil and wax based emulsifiers, glycerol
   monostearate, glycerine sorbitan fatty acid esters and phospholipids. In some
   cases the emulsifier is a phospholipid.
            In some cases, the emulsifier is a vitamin E derivative. Suitable vitamin
   E derivatives include, but are not limited to, a-tocopheryl oxalate, a-tocopheryl
15 malonate, a-tocopheryl succinate, a-tocopheryl glutarate, a-tocopheryl adipate,
   a-tocopheryl pimelate, a-tocopheryl suberate, a-tocopheryl azelate, and D-a
   tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (vitamin E TPGS).
            Exemplary phospholipids include , phosphatidyl chlorine, lecithin (a
   mixture of choline ester of phosphorylated diacylglyceride),
20 phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid with about 4
   to about 22 carbon atoms, and more generally from about 10 to about 18 carbon
   atoms and varying degrees of saturation. Preferably, the phospholipid is of
   natural origin. Naturally occurring phospholipids include soy lecithin, egg
   lecithin, hydrogenated soy lecithin, hydrogenated egg lecithin, sphingosine,
25 gangliosides, and phytosphingosine, and combinations thereof.
            Suitable lipid emulsions generally contain between about 1% and 40%
   w/v oil component and between about 0.1% and 7.5% w/v emulsifier. Suitable
   commercially available lipid emulsions include lipid emulsions containing or
   comprising soybean oil, such as Intralipid@ 10%, Intralipid@ 20%, and
30 Intralipid@ 30%, as well as lipid emulsions containing or comprising a mixture
   of soybean and safflower oils, such as Liposyn@ 1110% and Liposyn@ II 20%.
                                            78

           Lipid emulsions can optionally contain one or more additional
   components. For example, lipid formulations can contain one or more non
   aqueous miscible co-solvents, such as an alcohol or glycol. In some preferred
   formulations, glycerol and/or propylene glycol is present as a co-solvent.
 5         Many lipid emulsions are capable of supporting bacterial growth.
   Accordingly, in some cases, one or more components may be added to the lipid
   emulsion formulation to prevent or retard bacterial growth, for example
   disodium edatate, citric acid, metabisulfate, benzyl alcohol, one or more
   parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, or thimerosal.
10         Additionally, lipid emulsions can contain one or more agents used to
   modify or stabilize the pH of the solution, including phosphate buffers, acetate
   buffers, and citrate buffers.
           In one embodiment, the formulation is an oil-in-water emulsion
   containing or comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or more
15 neuroactive steroids dissolved in a solution containing or comprising between
   about 1% w/v and about 25% w/v soybean oil, between about 0.5% and about
   7.5% w/v egg yolk phospholipid, and between about 0.5% w/v and about 5%
   w/v of a miscible co-solvent.
           In another embodiment, the formulation is an oil-in-water emulsion
20 containing or comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or more
   neuroactive steroids dissolved in a solution containing or comprising between
   about 1% w/v and about 15% w/v soybean oil, between about 1% w/v and about
   15% w/v safflower oil, between about 0.5% and about 7.5% w/v egg
   phosphatides, and between 0.5% w/v and about 5% w/v of a miscible co
25 solvent.
           Lipid emulsions can be administered as described above, or incorporated
   into the parenteral formulations described below.
                                         Liposomes
           One or more neuroactive steroids can be incorporated into liposomes. As
30 is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other
   lipid substances. See, for example, "Remington- The science and practice of
                                          79

   pharmacy", 20th Edition, Jennaro et. al., (Phila, Lippencott, Williams, and
   Wilkens, 2000).
            Liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid
   substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid
 5 crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any nontoxic, physiologically
   acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used.
   The disclosed compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to one or
   more neuroactive steroids, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and other
   suitable excipients.
10          Examples of suitable lipids are the phospholipids and the
   phosphatidylcholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods of forming
   liposomes are known in the art. See, e.g., Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell
   Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York p. 33 et seq., 1976. The
   liposomes can be cationic liposomes (e.g., based on DOTMA, DOPE, DC
15 cholesterol) or anionic liposomes. Liposomes can further comprise proteins to
   facilitate targeting a particular cell, if desired. Administration of a composition
   comprising a compound and a cationic liposome can be administered to the
   blood afferent to a target organ or inhaled into the respiratory tract to target cells
   of the respiratory tract.
20          One or more neuroactive steroids can formulated using commercially
   available liposome preparations such as LIPOFECTIN®, LIPOFECTAMIE@
   (GIBCO-BRL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.), SUPERFECT® (Qiagen, Inc. Hilden,
   Germany) and TRANSFECTAM® (Promega Biotec, Inc., Madison, Wis.), as
   well as other liposomes developed according to procedures standard in the art.
25 Liposomes where the diffusion of the compound or delivery of the compound
   from the liposome is designed for a specific rate or dosage can also be used.
            One or more neuroactive steroids can also be formulated using noisomes.
   Noisomes are multilamellar or unilamellar vesicles involving non-ionic
   surfactants. An aqueous solution of solute is enclosed by a bilayer resulting from
30 the organization of surfactant macromolecules. Similar to liposomes, noisomes
   are used in targeted delivery of, for example, anticancer drugs, including
                                              80

   methotrexate, doxorubicin, and immunoadjuvants. They are generally
   understood to be different from transferosomes, vesicles prepared from
   amphiphilic carbohydrate and amino group containing or comprising polymers,
   e.g., chitosan.
 5          One or more neuroactive steroids can also be deliverd using
   nanoerythrosomes. Nanoerythrosomes are nano-vesicles made of red blood cells
   via dialysis through filters of defined pore size. These vesicles can be loaded
   with one or more neuroactive steroids.
                                    Lipid Nanoemulsions
10          Lipid nanoemulsions can also be used. Lipid nanoemulsions are known
   in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US
   2007/0207173 to Chen, et al, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US
   2001/0045050 to Elbayoumi, et al. Lipid nanoemulsions can be prepared by
   microemulsification of any of the lipid emulsions described above using for
15 example, a high pressure homogenizer, or via a phase inversion temperature
   method (PIT).
            In preferred lipid nanoemulsions containing or comprising neuroactive
   steroids, vitamin E succinate and/or Vitamin E TPGS are included as
   emulsifiers.
20          The lipid nanoemulsion can further be lyophilized if desired. See, for
   example, U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2011/0015266.
            Lipid anoemulsions can be administered as described above, or
   incorporated into the parenteral or non-parenteral formulations described below.
            The pre-concentrate includes an oil phase which has at least one fatty
25 acid oil. Fatty acid oils of the present invention include at least one
   polyunsaturated fatty acid. The term "polyunsaturated fatty acid" include those
   fatty acids having at least 50 weight percent or more of polyunsaturated fatty
   acids. Polyunsaturated fat can be found in grain products, fish and sea food
   (herring, salmon, mackerel, halibut), soybeans, and fish oil. Polyunsaturated
30 fatty acids include omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. Polyunsaturated
   fatty acids include linolic acid and linolenic acid.. Preferable polyunsaturated
                                            81

   fatty acids include eicosapentaenoic acid, salts of eicosapentaenoic
   acid,docosahexaenoic acid, salts of docosahexaenoic acid, triglycerides of
   eicosapentaenoic acid, tryglycerides of docosahexaenoic acid, ethyl esters of
   eicosapentaenoic acid, or ethyl esters of docosahexaenoic acid.
 5         Polyunsaturated fatty acids include omega-3 fatty acid oils and medium
   chain triglycerides (MCT). A medium chain triglyceride contains about 6 to 14
   carbon atoms, preferably about 8 to 12 carbon atoms are suitable for use in the
   oil phase. Preferable medium chain glyceride includes, for example,
   caprylic/capric triglyceride such as "Migriol 810", "Migriol 812" (both trade
10 names, manufactured by Huls Co., Ltd., available from Mitsuba Trading Co.,
   Ltd.), a glyceryl tricaprylate (tricaprylin) such as "Panasate 800" (trade name,
   manufactured by NOF Corporation, Japan).
           The pre-concentrate includes an emulsifier component. The emulsifier
   component has one or more surfactants. Surfactants include any molecule
15 having both a polar head group, which energetically prefers solvation by water,
   and a hydrophobic tail that is not well solvated by water. The ratio of the oil
   phase to the emulsifier component is important for the toxicity of the
   nanoemulsion prepared from the pre-concentrate. Surfactants suitable for use
   with the pre-concentrate and emulsion include a variety of anionic and nonionic
20 surfactants, as well as other emulsifying compounds that are capable of
   promoting the formation of oil-in-water emulsions; so long as they are on the
   GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) list and are approved for human
   consumption such as lecithin, solutol HS-15 (polyoxyethylene esters of 12
   hydroxystearic acid), polysorbate 80 or Cremophore EL (polyethoxylated castor
25 oil). See McCutcheon's Volume 1: Emulsifiers and Detergents North American
   Edition, 1996 (incorporated herein by reference).
                    2.     Formulationsfor Parenteral Administration
           The compounds described herein can be formulated for parenteral
   administration. "Parenteral administration", as used herein, refers to intravenous
30 or intraarterial administration.
                           ParticleSize Reduction
                                            82

            The solubility of one or more neuractive steroids can be improved by
   decreasing drug particle size. By decreasing particle size, the surface area to
   volume ratio of the drug particles is increased, resulting in increased solvation of
   the drug particle.
 5          Particle size reduction can be achieved using a variety of micronization
   techniques including, but not limited to, grinding, milling (e.g., air-attrition
   milling (jet milling), ball milling), coacervation, high pressure homogenization,
   spray drying, and/or supercritical fluid crystallization. In some instances,
   particles are sized by mechanical impact (e.g., by hammer mills, ball mill and/or
10 pin mills). In some instances, particles are sized via fluid energy (e.g., by spiral
   jet mills, loop jet mills, and/or fluidized bed jet mills). After micronization, the
   drug particles can be further processed. For example, the micronized drug
   particles may be coated to further influence solubility and/or drug release.
            Depending on the micronization process and active agent involved, the
15 micronized drug particles can be crystalline or amorphous. Using micronization
   techniques, drug particles ranging from 10 nm to 100 microns can be formed.
   The average particle size and distribution of the drug particles can be controlled
   through the selection of micronization technique as well as by variation of
   process conditions. Accordingly, formulations of drug particles can be prepared
20 which contain nanoparticles of drug, microparticles of drug, and combinations
   thereof. Appropriate micronization techniques can be selected to produce
   populations of drug particles with monodisperse or polydisperse particle size
   distributions. Methods of producing monodisperse drug particles are known in
   the art. Alternatively, populations of drug particles can be separated following
25 micronization to obtain drug particle populations with the desired size range and
   distribution.
            In addition to improving solubility, micronization can also be used to
   control drug release profiles. As different sized drug particles will dissolve at
   different rates and over different periods of time, micronization can be used to
30 prepare controlled release, sustained release, pulsatile release, and delayed
   release formulations. For example, populations of micronized drug particles
                                             83

   with different average particle sizes and/or different particle size distributions
   can be mixed. The resulting mixtures will exhibit a drug release profile which is
   the combination of the drug release profile of component populations of drug
   particles. In some embodiments, micronized drug particles containing or
 5 comprising different neuroactive steroids can be mixed to effect combination
   therapy.
            Micronized drug particles can be incorporated into any of the parenteral
   and non-parenteral formulations described below as a suspension or dispersion
   in a solid or fluid carrier. Micronized drug particles can also be used to form
10 solutions for parenteral or non-parenteral administration. Micronized drug
   particles can also be provided, for example, in a kit used to prepare solutions or
   suspensions for injection.
                            Aqueous Compositions
           Parenteral formulations can be prepared as aqueous compositions using
15 techniques is known in the art. Typically, such compositions can be prepared as
   injectable formulations, for example, solutions or suspensions; solid forms
   suitable for using to prepare solutions or suspensions upon the addition of a
   reconstitution medium prior to injection; emulsions, such as water-in-oil (w/o)
   emulsions, oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions, and microemulsions thereof,
20 liposomes, or emulsomes.
           The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing or
   comprising, for example, water, ethanol, one or more polyols (e.g., glycerol,
   propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), oils, such as vegetable oils
   (e.g., peanut oil, corn oil, sesame oil, etc.), and combinations thereof.
25         The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a
   coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the
   case of dispersion and/or by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be
   preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride.
            Solutions and dispersions of the active compounds as the free acid or
30 base or pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof can be prepared in water or
   another solvent or dispersing medium suitably mixed with one or more
                                            84

   pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including, but not limited to, surfactants,
   dispersants, emulsifiers, pH modifying agents, and combination thereof.
           Suitable surfactants may be anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic
   surface active agents. Suitable anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to,
 5 those containing or comprising carboxylate, sulfonate and sulfate ions.
   Examples of anionic surfactants include sodium, potassium, ammonium of long
   chain alkyl sulfonates and alkyl aryl sulfonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene
   sulfonate; dialkyl sodium sulfosuccinates, such as sodium dodecylbenzene
   sulfonate; dialkyl sodium sulfosuccinates, such as sodium bis-(2-ethylthioxyl)
10 sulfosuccinate; and alkyl sulfates such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Cationic
   surfactants include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium compounds
   such as benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, cetrimonium bromide,
   stearyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, polyoxyethylene and coconut
   amine. Examples of nonionic surfactants include ethylene glycol monostearate,
15 propylene glycol myristate, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl stearate,
   polyglyceryl-4-oleate, sorbitan acylate, sucrose acylate, PEG-150 laurate, PEG
   400 monolaurate, polyoxyethylene monolaurate, polysorbates, polyoxyethylene
   octylphenylether, PEG- 1000 cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene tridecyl ether,
   polypropylene glycol butyl ether, Poloxamer® 401, stearoyl
20 monoisopropanolamide, and polyoxyethylene hydrogenated tallow amide.
   Examples of amphoteric surfactants include sodium N-dodecyl- -alanine,
   sodium N-lauryl-     -iminodipropionate, myristoamphoacetate, lauryl betaine and
   lauryl sulfobetaine.
           The formulation can contain a preservative to prevent the growth of
25 microorganisms. Suitable preservatives include, but are not limited to, parabens,
   chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and thimerosal. The formulation may also
   contain an antioxidant to prevent degradation of the active agent(s).
           The formulation is typically buffered to a pH of 3-8 for parenteral
   administration upon reconstitution. Suitable buffers include, but are not limited
30 to, phosphate buffers, acetate buffers, and citrate buffers.
                                           85

           Water soluble polymers are often used in formulations for parenteral
   administration. Suitable water-soluble polymers include, but are not limited to,
   polyvinylpyrrolidone, dextran, carboxymethylcellulose, and polyethylene
   glycol.
 5          Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active
   compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent or dispersion
   medium with one or more of the excipients listed above, as required, followed
   by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the
   various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the
10 basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those listed
   above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable
   solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze
   drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any
   additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
15 The powders can be prepared in such a manner that the particles are porous in
   nature, which can increase dissolution of the particles. Methods for making
   porous particles are well known in the art.
                            a.       Controlled release formulations
            The parenteral formulations described herein can be formulated for
20 controlled release including immediate release, delayed release, extended
   release, pulsatile release, and combinations thereof.
                            Nano- and microparticles
            For parenteral administration, the compounds, and optionally one or
   more additional active agents, can be incorporated into microparticles,
25 nanoparticles, or combinations thereof that provide controlled release. In
   embodiments wherein the formulations contains two or more drugs, the drugs
   can be formulated for the same type of controlled release (e.g., delayed,
   extended, immediate, or pulsatile) or the drugs can be independently formulated
   for different types of release (e.g., immediate and delayed, immediate and
30 extended, delayed and extended, delayed and pulsatile, etc.).
                                            86

           For example, the compounds and/or one or more additional active agents
   can be incorporated into polymeric microparticles which provide controlled
   release of the drug(s). Release of the drug(s) is controlled by diffusion of the
   drug(s) out of the microparticles and/or degradation of the polymeric particles
 5 by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic degradation. Suitable polymers include
   ethylcellulose and other natural or synthetic cellulose derivatives.
           Polymers which are slowly soluble and form a gel in an aqueous
   environment, such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or polyethylene oxide may
   also be suitable as materials for drug containing or comprising microparticles.
10 Other polymers include, but are not limited to, polyanhydrides, poly(ester
   anhydrides), polyhydroxy acids, such as polylactide (PLA), polyglycolide
   (PGA), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and
   copolymers thereof, poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) and copolymers thereof,
   polycaprolactone and copolymers thereof, and combinations thereof.
15         Alternatively, the drug(s) can be incorporated into microparticles
   prepared from materials which are insoluble in aqueous solution or slowly
   soluble in aqueous solution, but are capable of degrading within the GI tract by
   means including enzymatic degradation, surfactant action of bile acids, and/or
   mechanical erosion. As used herein, the term "slowly soluble in water" refers to
20 materials that are not dissolved in water within a period of 30 minutes.
   Preferred examples include fats, fatty substances, waxes, wax-like substances
   and mixtures thereof. Suitable fats and fatty substances include fatty alcohols
   (such as lauryl, myristyl stearyl, cetyl or cetostearyl alcohol), fatty acids and
   derivatives, including, but not limited to, fatty acid esters, fatty acid glycerides
25 (mono-, di- and tri-glycerides), and hydrogenated fats. Specific examples
   include, but are not limited to hydrogenated vegetable oil, hydrogenated
   cottonseed oil, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated oils available under the
   trade name Sterotex@, stearic acid, cocoa butter, and stearyl alcohol. Suitable
   waxes and wax-like materials include natural or synthetic waxes, hydrocarbons,
30 and normal waxes. Specific examples of waxes include beeswax, glycowax,
   castor wax, carnauba wax, paraffins and candelilla wax. As used herein, a wax
                                            87

   like material is defined as any material which is normally solid at room
   temperature and has a melting point of from about 30 to 300'C.
           In some cases, it may be desirable to alter the rate of water penetration
   into the microparticles. To this end, rate-controlling (wicking) agents may be
 5 formulated along with the fats or waxes listed above. Examples of rate
   controlling materials include certain starch derivatives (e.g., waxy maltodextrin
   and drum dried corn starch), cellulose derivatives (e.g., hydroxypropylmethyl
   cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, methylcellulose, and carboxymethyl
   cellulose), alginic acid, lactose and talc. Additionally, a pharmaceutically
10 acceptable surfactant (for example, lecithin) may be added to facilitate the
   degradation of such microparticles.
            Proteins which are water insoluble, such as zein, can also be used as
   materials for the formation of drug containing or comprising microparticles.
   Additionally, proteins, polysaccharides and combinations thereof which are
15 water soluble can be formulated with drug into microparticles and subsequently
   cross-linked to form an insoluble network. For example, cyclodextrins can be
   complexed with individual drug molecules and subsequently cross-linked.
            Encapsulation or incorporation of drug into carrier materials to produce
   drug containing or comprising microparticles can be achieved through known
20 pharmaceutical formulation techniques. In the case of formulation in fats,
   waxes or wax-like materials, the carrier material is typically heated above its
   melting temperature and the drug is added to form a mixture comprising drug
   particles suspended in the carrier material, drug dissolved in the carrier material,
   or a mixture thereof. Microparticles can be subsequently formulated through
25 several methods including, but not limited to, the processes of congealing,
   extrusion, spray chilling or aqueous dispersion. In a preferred process, wax is
   heated above its melting temperature, drug is added, and the molten wax-drug
   mixture is congealed under constant stirring as the mixture cools. Alternatively,
   the molten wax-drug mixture can be extruded and spheronized to form pellets or
30 beads. Detailed descriptions of these processes can be found in "Remington
                                            88

   The science and practice of pharmacy", 20th Edition, Jennaro et. al., (Phila,
   Lippencott, Williams, and Wilkens, 2000).
            For some carrier materials it may be desirable to use a solvent
   evaporation technique to produce drug containing or comprising microparticles.
 5 In this case drug and carrier material are co-dissolved in a mutual solvent and
   microparticles can subsequently be produced by several techniques including,
   but not limited to, forming an emulsion in water or other appropriate media,
   spray drying or by evaporating off the solvent from the bulk solution and milling
   the resulting material.
10         In some embodiments, drug in a particulate form is homogeneously
   dispersed in a water-insoluble or slowly water soluble material. To minimize
   the size of the drug particles within the composition, the drug powder itself may
   be milled to generate fine particles prior to formulation. The process of jet
   milling, known in the pharmaceutical art, can be used for this purpose. In some
15 embodiments drug in a particulate form is homogeneously dispersed in a wax or
   wax like substance by heating the wax or wax like substance above its melting
   point and adding the drug particles while stirring the mixture. In this case a
   pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant may be added to the mixture to facilitate
   the dispersion of the drug particles.
20          The particles can also be coated with one or more modified release
   coatings. Solid esters of fatty acids, which are hydrolyzed by lipases, can be
   spray coated onto microparticles or drug particles. Zein is an example of a
   naturally water-insoluble protein. It can be coated onto drug containing or
   comprising microparticles or drug particles by spray coating or by wet
25 granulation techniques. In addition to naturally water-insoluble materials, some
   substrates of digestive enzymes can be treated with cross-linking procedures,
   resulting in the formation of non-soluble networks. Many methods of cross
   linking proteins, initiated by both chemical and physical means, have been
   reported. One of the most common methods to obtain cross-linking is the use of
30 chemical cross-linking agents. Examples of chemical cross-linking agents
   include aldehydes (gluteraldehyde and formaldehyde), epoxy compounds,
                                           89

   carbodiimides, and genipin. In addition to these cross-linking agents, oxidized
   and native sugars have been used to cross-link gelatin (Cortesi, R., et al.,
   Biomaterials 19 (1998) 1641-1649). Cross-linking can also be accomplished
   using enzymatic means; for example, transglutaminase has been approved as a
 5 GRAS substance for cross-linking seafood products. Finally, cross-linking can
   be initiated by physical means such as thermal treatment, UV irradiation and
   gamma irradiation.
            To produce a coating layer of cross-linked protein surrounding drug
   containing or comprising microparticles or drug particles, a water soluble
10 protein can be spray coated onto the microparticles and subsequently cross
   linked by the one of the methods described above. Alternatively, drug
   containing or comprising microparticles can be microencapsulated within
   protein by coacervation-phase separation (for example, by the addition of salts)
   and subsequently cross-linked. Some suitable proteins for this purpose include
15 gelatin, albumin, casein, and gluten.
   Polysaccharides can also be cross-linked to form a water-insoluble network. For
   many polysaccharides, this can be accomplished by reaction with calcium salts
   or multivalent cations which cross-link the main polymer chains. Pectin,
   alginate, dextran, amylose and guar gum are subject to cross-linking in the
20 presence of multivalent cations. Complexes between oppositely charged
   polysaccharides can also be formed; pectin and chitosan, for example, can be
   complexed via electrostatic interactions.
                   3.     Formulations for Non-Parenteral Administration
25          Neuroactive steroids can be formulated for non-parenteral
   administration. Non-parenteral formulations may be useful for oral,
   subcutaneous, intra-peritoneal, intramuscular, transdermal, nasal, pulmonary, or
   mucosal delivery.
                          a.       Depot Formulations
30          Neuroactive steroids, including progesterone and progesterone analogues
   such as decanoate salts or esters of progesterone, can be formulated for depot
                                          90

   injection. In a depot injection, the active agent is formulated with one or more
   pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that provide for the gradual release of
   active agent over a period of hours or days after injection. The depot formulation
   can be administered by any suitable means; however, the depot formulation is
 5 typically administered via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.
             A variety of carriers may be incorporated into the depot formulation to
   provide for the controlled release of the active agent. In some cases, depot
   formulations contain one or more biodegradable polymeric or oligomeric
   carriers. Suitable polymeric carriers include, but are not limited to poly(lactic
10 acid) (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(lactic acid)
   polyethyleneglycol (PLA-PEG) block copolymers, polyanhydrides, poly(ester
   anhydrides), ppolyglycolide (PGA), poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and
   copolymers thereof, poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB), polycaprolactone,
   cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, as well as blends,
15 derivatives, copolymers, and combinations thereof.
             In depot formulations containing or comprising a polymeric or
   oligomeric carrier, the carrier and active agent can be formulated as a solution,
   an emulsion, or suspension. One or more neuroactive steroids, and optionally
   one or more additional active agents, can also be incorporated into polymeric or
20 oligomeric microparticles, nanoparticles, or combinations thereof.
             In some cases, the formulation is fluid and designed to solidify or gel
   (i.e., forming a hydrogel or organogel) upon injection. This can result from a
   change in solubility of the composition upon injection, or for example, by
   injecting a pre-polymer mixed with an initiator and/or crosslinking agent. The
25 polymer matrix, polymer solution, or polymeric particles entrap the active agent
   at the injection site. As the polymeric carrier is gradually degraded, the active
   agent is released, either by diffusion of the agent out of the matrix and/or
   dissipation of the matrix as it is absorbed. The release rate of the active agent
   from the injection site can be controlled by varying, for example, the chemical
30 composition, molecular weight, crosslink density, and concentration of the
                                            91

   polymeric carrier. Examples of such systems include those described in U.S.
   Pat. Nos. 4,938,763, 5,480,656 and 6,113,943.
            Depot formulations can also be prepared by using other rate-controlling
   excipients, including hydrophobic materials, including acceptable oils (e.g.,
 5 peanut oil, corn oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, etc.) and phospholipids, ion
   exchange resins, and sparingly soluble carriers.
            The depot formulation can further contain a solvent or dispersion
   medium containing or comprising, for example, water, ethanol, one or more
   polyols (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), oils,
10 such as vegetable oils (e.g., peanut oil, corn oil, sesame oil, etc.), and
   combinations thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the
   use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle
   size in the case of dispersion and/or by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it
   will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium
15 chloride.
            Solutions and dispersions of the neuroactive compounds as the free acid
   or base or pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof can be prepared in water or
   another solvent or dispersing medium suitably mixed with one or more
   pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including, but not limited to, surfactants,
20 dispersants, emulsifiers, pH modifying agents, and combination thereof.
            Suitable surfactants may be anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic
   surface active agents. Suitable anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to,
   those containing or comprising carboxylate, sulfonate and sulfate ions.
   Examples of anionic surfactants include sodium, potassium, ammonium of long
25 chain alkyl sulfonates and alkyl aryl sulfonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene
   sulfonate; dialkyl sodium sulfosuccinates, such as sodium dodecylbenzene
   sulfonate; dialkyl sodium sulfosuccinates, such as sodium bis-(2-ethylthioxyl)
   sulfosuccinate; and alkyl sulfates such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Cationic
   surfactants include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium compounds
30 such as benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, cetrimonium bromide,
   stearyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, polyoxyethylene and coconut
                                           92

   amine. Examples of nonionic surfactants include ethylene glycol monostearate,
   propylene glycol myristate, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl stearate,
   polyglyceryl-4-oleate, sorbitan acylate, sucrose acylate, PEG-150 laurate, PEG
   400 monolaurate, polyoxyethylene monolaurate, polysorbates, polyoxyethylene
 5 octylphenylether, PEG- 1000 cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene tridecyl ether,
   polypropylene glycol butyl ether, Poloxamer® 401, stearoyl
   monoisopropanolamide, and polyoxyethylene hydrogenated tallow amide.
   Examples of amphoteric surfactants include sodium N-dodecyl-p-alanine,
   sodium N-lauryl-p-iminodipropionate, myristoamphoacetate, lauryl betaine and
10 lauryl sulfobetaine.
            The formulation can contain a preservative to prevent the growth of
   microorganisms. Suitable preservatives include, but are not limited to, parabens,
   chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and thimerosal. The formulation may also
   contain an antioxidant to prevent degradation of the active agent(s).
15          The formulation is typically buffered to a pH of 3-8 for parenteral
   administration upon reconstitution. Suitable buffers include, but are not limited
   to, phosphate buffers, acetate buffers, and citrate buffers.
           Water soluble polymers are often used in formulations for parenteral
   administration. Suitable water-soluble polymers include, but are not limited to,
20 polyvinylpyrrolidone, dextran, carboxymethylcellulose, and polyethylene
   glycol.
            Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active
   compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent or dispersion
   medium with one or more of the excipients listed above, as required, followed
25 by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the
   various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the
   basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those listed
   above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable
   solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze
30 drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any
   additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
                                            93

   The powders can be prepared in such a manner that the particles are porous in
   nature, which can increase dissolution of the particles. Methods for making
   porous particles are well known in the art.
                           b.      Gels
 5         Formulations may be in the form of an organogel (assuming the
   neuroactive steroid is relatively water insoluble) or a hydrogel. Numerous gel
   formulations are known. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,411,737 by Hsu, et
   al. Hydrogels, especially those further including nanoparticles microparticles
   for sustained, immediate and/or delayed release, can also be used. See, for
10 example, U.S. Patent No. 6,589,549 to Shih, et al.
           U.S. patent application No. 20100295113 by Hoffman, et al., describes a
   composite hydrogel including a blend of an aqueous solution of an anionic
   polysaccharide or a derivative thereof, such as or a derivative thereof and an
   aqueous solution of methylcellulose or another water soluble cellulose
15 derivative thereof, having dispersed polymeric particles, such as polymeric
   micro particles and nanoparticles, and wherein the stability of the hydrogel is
   enhanced relative to the stability of the hydrogel alone. The polymeric particles
   may contain at least one therapeutic agent, in which case each therapeutic agent
   exhibits a linear sustained release rate that can be tuned or altered by selecting
20 the appropriate polymer formulation of the micro particles and/or nanoparticles.
   The composite may be injectable, and in the absence of a therapeutic agent may
   be used as a bulking agent for reconstructive and cosmetic surgery or may act as
   a platform for subsequent delivery of therapeutic agents.
            See also, Salem, Int J Nanomedicine. 2010 Nov 10;5:943-54, describing
25 a sustained release form of natural progesterone to be given as IM injection. A
   progesterone nanosuspension (PNS) was first developed and then dispersed in a
   thermosensitive gel matrix. The selected nanoparticles showed an average
   particle size of 267 nm and a zeta potential approaching-41 mV. The in vitro
   release profile of PNS from Pluronic F127 plus methyl cellulose gel followed
30 zero order kinetics and correlated linearly with the weight percentage of gel
                                           94

   dissolved, demonstrating that the overall rate of release of PNS is controlled by
   dissolution of the pluronic F127/methyl cellulose (MC) gel.
           Gels can also be administered in combination with oral or
   subcutaneously administered drug. See, for example, Tomic, et al., Gynecol
 5 Endocrinol. 2011 Apr 19.
                            c.      Oral Formulations
           Formulations are prepared using a pharmaceutically acceptable "carrier"
   composed of materials that are considered safe and effective and may be
   administered to an individual without causing undesirable biological side effects
10 or unwanted interactions. The "carrier" is all components present in the
   pharmaceutical formulation other than the active ingredient or ingredients. The
   term "carrier" includes but is not limited to diluents, binders, lubricants,
   disintegrators, fillers, matrix-forming compositions and coating compositions.
           "Carrier" also includes all components of the coating composition which
15 may include plasticizers, pigments, colorants, stabilizing agents, and glidants.
   The delayed release dosage formulations may be prepared as described in
   references such as "Pharmaceutical dosage form tablets", eds. Liberman et. al.
   (New York, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1989), "Remington - The science and practice
   of pharmacy", 20th ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, 2000,
20 and "Pharmaceutical dosage forms and drug delivery systems", 6 Edition,
   Ansel et.al., (Media, PA: Williams and Wilkins, 1995) which provides
   information on carriers, materials, equipment and processes for preparing tablets
   and capsules and delayed release dosage forms of tablets, capsules, and
   granules.
25         Examples of suitable coating materials include, but are not limited to,
   cellulose polymers such as cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl cellulose,
   hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate and
   hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate; polyvinyl acetate phthalate,
   acrylic acid polymers and copolymers, and methacrylic resins that are
30 commercially available under the trade name Eudragit® (Roth Pharma,
   Westerstadt, Germany), Zein, shellac, and polysaccharides.
                                           95

           Additionally, the coating material may contain conventional carriers
   such as plasticizers, pigments, colorants, glidants, stabilization agents, pore
   formers and surfactants.
           Optional pharmaceutically acceptable excipients present in the drug
 5 containing or comprising tablets, beads, granules or particles include, but are not
   limited to, diluents, binders, lubricants, disintegrants, colorants, stabilizers, and
   surfactants.     Diluents, also termed "fillers," are typically necessary to increase
   the bulk of a solid dosage form so that a practical size is provided for
   compression of tablets or formation of beads and granules. Suitable diluents
10 include, but are not limited to, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, calcium sulfate,
   lactose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin,
   sodium chloride, dry starch, hydrolyzed starches, pre-gelatinized starch, silicone
   dioxide, titanium oxide, magnesium aluminum silicate and powder sugar.
           Binders are used to impart cohesive qualities to a solid dosage
15 formulation, and thus ensure that a tablet or bead or granule remains intact after
   the formation of the dosage forms. Suitable binder materials include, but are not
   limited to, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, gelatin, sugars (including sucrose,
   glucose, dextrose, lactose and sorbitol), polyethylene glycol, waxes, natural and
   synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, sodium alginate, cellulose, including
20 hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, ethylcellulose, and
   veegum, and synthetic polymers such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid
   copolymers, methacrylic acid copolymers, methyl methacrylate copolymers,
   aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymers, polyacrylic acid/polymethacrylic acid and
   polyvinylpyrrolidone. Some of the materials which are suitable as binders can
25 also be used as matrix-forming materials such as hydroxypropyl methyl
   cellulose, ethyl cellulose, and microcrystalline cellulose.
           Lubricants are used to facilitate tablet manufacture. Examples of
   suitable lubricants include, but are not limited to, magnesium stearate, calcium
   stearate, stearic acid, glycerol behenate, polyethylene glycol, talc, and mineral
30 oil.
                                            96

           Disintegrants are used to facilitate dosage form disintegration or
   "breakup" after administration, and generally include, but are not limited to,
   starch, sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl starch, sodium
   carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, clays,
 5 cellulose, alginine, gums or cross linked polymers, such as cross-linked PVP
   (Polyplasdone@ XL from GAF Chemical Corp).
           Stabilizers are used to inhibit or retard drug decomposition reactions
   which include, by way of example, oxidative reactions.
           Surfactants may be anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic surface
10 active agents. Suitable anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, those
   containing or comprising carboxylate, sulfonate and sulfate ions. Examples of
   anionic surfactants include sodium, potassium, ammonium salts of long chain
   alkyl sulfonates and alkyl aryl sulfonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene
   sulfonate; dialkyl sodium sulfosuccinates, such as sodium dodecylbenzene
15 sulfonate; dialkyl sodium sulfosuccinates, such as sodium bis-(2-ethylthioxyl)
   sulfosuccinate; and alkyl sulfates such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Cationic
   surfactants include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium compounds
   such as benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, cetrimonium bromide,
   stearyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, polyoxyethylene and coconut
20 amine. Examples of nonionic surfactants include ethylene glycol monostearate,
   propylene glycol myristate, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl stearate,
   polyglyceryl-4-oleate, sorbitan acylate, sucrose acylate, PEG-150 laurate, PEG
   400 monolaurate, polyoxyethylene monolaurate, polysorbates, polyoxyethylene
   octylphenylether, PEG- 1000 cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene tridecyl ether,
25 polypropylene glycol butyl ether, Poloxamer* 401, stearoyl
   monoisopropanolamide, and polyoxyethylene hydrogenated tallow amide.
   Examples of amphoteric surfactants include sodium N-dodecyl-.beta.-alanine,
   sodium N-lauryl-.beta.-iminodipropionate, myristoamphoacetate, lauryl betaine
   and lauryl sulfobetaine.
                                           97

            If desired, the tablets, beads, granules or particles may also contain
   minor amount of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying
   agents, dyes, pH buffering agents, and preservatives.
            The delayed-release portion is designed to prevent drug release after a
 5 defined period of time. Although oral is not a preferred route of administration,
   in the case of an orally delivered formulation, this would be in the upper part of
   the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Delayed release in an oral formulation can be
   achieved using enteric coatings. The enteric coated formulation remains intact
   or substantially intact in the stomach but dissolves and releases the contents of
10 the dosage form once it reaches the small intestine. Other types of coatings can
   be used to provide delayed release following injection subcutaneously, intra
   tissue or intramuscularly at a site near or at the area to be treated.
                                     Extended release dosage forms
            The extended release formulations are generally prepared as diffusion or
15 osmotic systems, for example, as described in "Remington - The science and
   practice of pharmacy" (20th ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore,
   MD, 2000). A diffusion system typically consists of two types of devices, a
   reservoir and a matrix, and is well known and described in the art. The matrix
   devices are generally prepared by compressing the drug with a slowly dissolving
20 polymer carrier into a tablet form. The three major types of materials used in
   the preparation of matrix devices are insoluble plastics, hydrophilic polymers,
   and fatty compounds. Plastic matrices include, but are not limited to, methyl
   acrylate-methyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, and polyethylene.
   Hydrophilic polymers include, but are not limited to, cellulosic polymers such as
25 methyl and ethyl cellulose, hydroxyalkylcelluloses such as hydroxypropyl
   cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and
   Carbopol@ 934, polyethylene oxides and mixtures thereof. Fatty compounds
   include, but are not limited to, various waxes such as carnauba wax and glyceryl
   tristearate and wax-type substances including hydrogenated castor oil or
30 hydrogenated vegetable oil, or mixtures thereof.
                                             98

           In certain preferred embodiments, the plastic material is a
   pharmaceutically acceptable acrylic polymer, including but not limited to,
   acrylic acid and methacrylic acid copolymers, methyl methacrylate, methyl
   methacrylate copolymers, ethoxyethyl methacrylates, cyanoethyl methacrylate,
 5 aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid),
   methacrylic acid alkylamine copolymer poly(methyl methacrylate),
   poly(methacrylic acid)(anhydride), polymethacrylate, polyacrylamide,
   poly(methacrylic acid anhydride), and glycidyl methacrylate copolymers.
           In certain preferred embodiments, the acrylic polymer is included of one
10 or more ammonio methacrylate copolymers. Ammonio methacrylate copolymers
   are well known in the art, and are described in NF XVII as fully polymerized
   copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic acid esters with a low content of
   quaternary ammonium groups.
           In one preferred embodiment, the acrylic polymer is an acrylic resin
15 lacquer such as that which is commercially available from Rohm Pharma under
   the tradename Eudragit@. In further preferred embodiments, the acrylic
   polymer includes a mixture of two acrylic resin lacquers commercially available
   from Rohm Pharma under the tradenames Eudragit@ RL30D and Eudragit@
   RS30D, respectively. Eudragit@ RL30D and Eudragit@ RS30D are copolymers
20 of acrylic and methacrylic esters with a low content of quaternary ammonium
   groups, the molar ratio of ammonium groups to the remaining neutral
   (meth)acrylic esters being 1:20 in Eudragit@ RL30D and 1:40 in Eudragit@
   RS30D. The mean molecular weight is about 150,000. Edragit@ S-100 and
   Eudragit@ L-100 are also preferred. The code designations RL (high
25 permeability) and RS (low permeability) refer to the permeability properties of
   these agents. Eudragit@ RL/RS mixtures are insoluble in water and in digestive
   fluids. However, multiparticulate systems formed to include the same are
   swellable and permeable in aqueous solutions and digestive fluids.
           The polymers described above such as Eudragit@ RL/RS may be mixed
30 together in any desired ratio in order to ultimately obtain a sustained-release
   formulation having a desirable dissolution profile. Desirable sustained-release
                                           99

   multiparticulate systems may be obtained, for instance, from 100% Eudragit@
   RL, 50% Eudragit@ RL and 50% Eudragit@ RS, and 10% Eudragit@ RL and
   90% Eudragit@ RS. One skilled in the art will recognize that other acrylic
   polymers may also be used, such as, for example, Eudragit@ L.
 5         Alternatively, extended release formulations can be prepared using
   osmotic systems or by applying a semi-permeable coating to the dosage form.
   In the latter case, the desired drug release profile can be achieved by combining
   low permeable and high permeable coating materials in suitable proportion.
           The devices with different drug release mechanisms described above can
10 be combined in a final dosage form including single or multiple units. Examples
   of multiple units include, but are not limited to, multilayer tablets and capsules
   containing or comprising tablets, beads, or granules.
           An immediate release portion can be added to the extended release
   system by means of either applying an immediate release layer on top of the
15 extended release core using a coating or compression process or in a multiple
   unit system such as a capsule containing or comprising extended and immediate
   release beads.
           Extended release tablets containing or comprising hydrophilic polymers
   are prepared by techniques commonly known in the art such as direct
20 compression, wet granulation, or dry granulation. Their formulations usually
   incorporate polymers, diluents, binders, and lubricants as well as the active
   pharmaceutical ingredient. The usual diluents include inert powdered
   substances such as starches, powdered cellulose, especially crystalline and
   microcrystalline cellulose, sugars such as fructose, mannitol and sucrose, grain
25 flours and similar edible powders. Typical diluents include, for example,
   various types of starch, lactose, mannitol, kaolin, calcium phosphate or sulfate,
   inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and powdered sugar. Powdered cellulose
   derivatives are also useful. Typical tablet binders include substances such as
   starch, gelatin and sugars such as lactose, fructose, and glucose. Natural and
30 synthetic gums, including acacia, alginates, methylcellulose, and
   polyvinylpyrrolidone can also be used. Polyethylene glycol, hydrophilic
                                            100

   polymers, ethylcellulose and waxes can also serve as binders. A lubricant is
   necessary in a tablet formulation to prevent the tablet and punches from sticking
   in the die. The lubricant is chosen from such slippery solids as talc, magnesium
   and calcium stearate, stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable oils.
 5          Extended release tablets containing or comprising wax materials are
   generally prepared using methods known in the art such as a direct blend
   method, a congealing method, and an aqueous dispersion method. In the
   congealing method, the drug is mixed with a wax material and either spray
   congealed or congealed and screened and processed.
10                                 Delayed release dosageforms
            Delayed release formulations are created by coating a solid dosage form
   with a polymer film, which is insoluble in the acidic environment of the
   stomach, and soluble in the neutral environment of the small intestine.
            The delayed release dosage units can be prepared, for example, by
15 coating a drug or a drug-containing or comprising composition with a selected
   coating material. The drug-containing or comprising composition may be, e.g.,
   a tablet for incorporation into a capsule, a tablet for use as an inner core in a
   "coated core" dosage form, or a plurality of drug-containing or comprising
   beads, particles or granules, for incorporation into either a tablet or capsule.
20 Preferred coating materials include bioerodible, gradually hydrolyzable,
   gradually water-soluble, and/or enzymatically degradable polymers, and may be
   conventional "enteric" polymers. Enteric polymers, as will be appreciated by
   those skilled in the art, become soluble in the higher pH environment of the
   lower gastrointestinal tract or slowly erode as the dosage form passes through
25 the gastrointestinal tract, while enzymatically degradable polymers are degraded
   by bacterial enzymes present in the lower gastrointestinal tract, particularly in
   the colon. Suitable coating materials for effecting delayed release include, but
   are not limited to, cellulosic polymers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose,
   hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl
30 cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate,
   hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose,
                                          101

   cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate and
   carboxymethylcellulose sodium; acrylic acid polymers and copolymers,
   preferably formed from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, ethyl
   acrylate, methyl methacrylate and/or ethyl methacrylate, and other methacrylic
 5 resins that are commercially available under the tradename Eudragit® (Rohm
   Pharma; Westerstadt, Germany), including Eudragit® L30D-55 and L100-55
   (soluble at pH 5.5 and above), Eudragit® L-100 (soluble at pH 6.0 and above),
   Eudragit* S (soluble at pH 7.0 and above, as a result of a higher degree of
   esterification), and Eudragits® NE, RL and RS (water-insoluble polymers having
10 different degrees of permeability and expandability); vinyl polymers and
   copolymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl acetate, vinylacetate phthalate,
   vinylacetate crotonic acid copolymer, and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer;
   enzymatically degradable polymers such as azo polymers, pectin, chitosan,
   amylose and guar gum; zein and shellac. Combinations of different coating
15 materials may also be used. Multi-layer coatings using different polymers may
   also be applied.
            The preferred coating weights for particular coating materials may be
   readily determined by those skilled in the art by evaluating individual release
   profiles for tablets, beads and granules prepared with different quantities of
20 various coating materials. It is the combination of materials, method and form
   of application that produce the desired release characteristics, which one can
   determine only from the clinical studies.
            The coating composition may include conventional additives, such as
   plasticizers, pigments, colorants, stabilizing agents, glidants, etc. A plasticizer is
25 normally present to reduce the fragility of the coating, and will generally
   represent about 10 wt. % to 50 wt. % relative to the dry weight of the polymer.
   Examples of typical plasticizers include polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol,
   triacetin, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, dibutyl
   sebacate, triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, triethyl acetyl citrate, castor oil and
30 acetylated monoglycerides. A stabilizing agent is preferably used to stabilize
   particles in the dispersion. Typical stabilizing agents are nonionic emulsifiers
                                             102

   such as sorbitan esters, polysorbates and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Glidants are
   recommended to reduce sticking effects during film formation and drying, and
   will generally represent approximately 25 wt. % to 100 wt. % of the polymer
   weight in the coating solution. One effective glidant is talc. Other glidants such
 5 as magnesium stearate and glycerol monostearates may also be used. Pigments
   such as titanium dioxide may also be used. Small quantities of an anti-foaming
   agent, such as a silicone (e.g., simethicone), may also be added to the coating
   composition.
                                    Methods of manufacturing
10         As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and as described in the
   pertinent texts and literature, a number of methods are available for preparing
   drug-containing or comprising tablets, beads, granules or particles that provide a
   variety of drug release profiles. Such methods include, but are not limited to,
   the following: coating a drug or drug-containing or comprising composition with
15 an appropriate coating material, typically although not necessarily, incorporating
   a polymeric material, increasing drug particle size, placing the drug within a
   matrix, and forming complexes of the drug with a suitable complexing agent.
           The delayed release dosage units may be coated with the delayed release
   polymer coating using conventional techniques, e.g., using a conventional
20 coating pan, an airless spray technique, fluidized bed coating equipment (with or
   without a Wurster insert), or the like. For detailed information concerning
   materials, equipment and processes for preparing tablets and delayed release
   dosage forms, see Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, eds. Lieberman et al.
   (New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1989), and Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical
25 Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 6.sup.th Ed. (Media, PA: Williams
   & Wilkins, 1995).
           Alternatively, a delayed release tablet may be formulated by dispersing
   the drug within a matrix of a suitable material such as a hydrophilic polymer or
   a fatty compound. The hydrophilic polymers may be included of polymers or
30 copolymers of cellulose, cellulose ester, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl
   acrylate, ethyl acrylate, and vinyl or enzymatically degradable polymers or
                                           103

   copolymers as described above. These hydrophilic polymers are particularly
   useful for providing a delayed release matrix. Fatty compounds for use as a
   matrix material include, but are not limited to, waxes (e.g. carnauba wax) and
   glycerol tristearate. Once the active ingredient is mixed with the matrix
 5 material, the mixture can be compressed into tablets.
           A preferred method for preparing extended release tablets is compressing
   a drug-containing or comprising blend, e.g., blend of granules, prepared using a
   direct blend, wet-granulation, or dry-granulation process. Extended release
   tablets may also be molded rather than compressed, starting with a moist
10 material containing or comprising a suitable water-soluble lubricant. However,
   tablets are preferably manufactured using compression rather than molding. A
   preferred method for forming an extended release drug-containing or comprising
   blend is to mix drug particles directly with one or more excipients such as
   diluents (or fillers), binders, disintegrants, lubricants, glidants, and colorants. As
15 an alternative to direct blending, a drug-containing or comprising blend may be
   prepared by using wet-granulation or dry-granulation processes. Beads
   containing or comprising the active agent may also be prepared by any one of a
   number of conventional techniques, typically starting from a fluid dispersion.
   For example, a typical method for preparing drug-containing or comprising
20 beads involves dispersing or dissolving the active agent in a coating suspension
   or solution containing or comprising pharmaceutical excipients such as
   polyvinylpyrrolidone, methylcellulose, talc, metallic stearates, silicone dioxide,
   plasticizers or the like. The admixture is used to coat a bead core such as a
   sugar sphere (or so-called "non-pareil") having a size of approximately 60 to 20
25 mesh.
           An alternative procedure for preparing drug beads is by blending drug
   with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as
   microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, talc,
   magnesium stearate, a disintegrant, etc., extruding the blend, spheronizing the
30 extrudate, drying and optionally coating to form the immediate release beads.
                             d.     Implants
                                            104

            Neuroactive steroid can also be administered by insertion of an implant
   such as the silastic tube used for delivery of contraceptive hormones. See, for
   example, Levonorgestrel and Norplant, both of which delivery long term release
   of hormone for contraception, following subdermal implantation. The effective
 5 dosage is increased by increasing the size of the hole by which drug exits the
   reservoir to the individual to be treated.
                            e.      Transdermal Patches
            Neuroactive steroid can also be administered by a transdermal patch,
   similar to those used for contraception, although in a significantly higher
10 dosage. See, for example, the Transdermal CombiPatch
   (estradiol/norethindrone) and the Testogen TM TDS@ -enhanced testosterone.
   Dosage can be increased by increasing the release mechanisms and/or increasing
   the concentration in the patch.
            D.      Combinations with Other Active Compounds
15          Neuroactive steroid can be administered adjunctively with other active

   III.     Administration of Neuroactive steroid Formulations
            A composition described herein, can be administered to a subject in need
   thereof, to treat a disorder, e.g., a CNS related disorder, e.g., a traumatic brain
25 injury; e.g., convulsive status epilepticus, e.g., early status epilepticus,
   established status epilepticus, refractory status epilepticus, super-refractory
   status epilepticus; non-convulsive status epilepticus, e.g., generalized status
   epilepticus, complex partial status epilepticus; a seizure, e.g., acute repatitve
   seizures, cluster seizures. Although preferred patients are human, typically any
30 mammal including domestic animals such as dogs, cats and horses, may also be
   treated.

                   Traumatic brain injury
           The amount of the active ingredients to be administered is chosen based
   on the amount which provides the desired dose to the patient in need of such
   treatment to alleviate symptoms or treat a condition. Behavioral assays can be
 5 used to determine the rate and extent of behavior recovery in response to the
   treatment. Improved patient motor skills, spatial learning performance, cognitive
   function, sensory perception, speech and/or a decrease in the propensity to
   seizure may also be used to measure the neuroprotective effect. Such
   functional/behavioral tests used to assess sensorimortor and reflex function are
10 described in, for example, Bederson et al. (1986) Stroke 17:472-476, DeRyck et
   al. (1992) Brain Res. 573:44-60, Markgraf et al. (1992) Brain Res. 575:238-246,
   Alexis et al. (1995) Stroke 26:2336-2346. Enhancement of neuronal survival
   may also be measured using the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) or the Barthl
   Index.
15         The treatment of a traumatic brain injury can be monitored by employing
   a variety of neurological measurements. For example, a partial therapeutic
   responses can be monitored by determining if, for example, there is an
   improvement in the subjects a) maximum daily Glasgow Coma Score; b)
   duration of coma; 3) daily intracranial pressure-therapeutic intensity levels; 4)
20 extent of cerebral edema/mass effect measured on serial CT scans; and, 5)
   duration of ventilator support. A brief description of each of these assays is
   provided below.
           The Glasgow Coma Score (index GCS) is a reflection of the depth of
   impaired consciousness and is best obtained following initial resuscitation
25 (oxygenation, rehydration and support of blood pressure) but prior to use of
   sedating drugs, neuromuscular blocking agents, or endotracheal intubation.
           The duration of coma is defined as the number of hours from the time of
   injury that the subject is unable to purposefully respond to commands or
   mechanical stimulation. For non-intubated subjects, this equates to a GCS score
30 of >8. For intubated patients, this correlates with a GCS motor score of
   .gtoreq.5. Duration of coma has been found to be predictive of functional
                                           106

   outcome (Uhler et al. (1994) Neurosurgery 34(1): 122-8; Jiang et al. (1996)
   Brain Res 735(1): 101-7; and Gonzalez-Vidal et al. (1998) Arch Med Res 29(2):
   117-24). Time spent in a coma induced pharmacologically for reasons other than
   brain injury should be subtracted in the final analysis.
 5         The intracranial pressure (ICP) of patients with severe TBI is often
   monitored with an intracranial pressure device. Monitoring ICP can provide a
   measure of cerebral edema. However, inherent variability and analysis
   complexities due to therapeutic interventions intended on lowering the ICP mire
   using ICP measurements. To adjust for these interventions a therapeutic
10 intensity scale was developed. This scale, known as the Therapeutic Intensity
   Level (TIL), measures treatment aggressiveness for elevated ICPs (Allolio et al.
   (1995) European Journal of Endocrinology 133(6): 696-700; Adashi et al.
   (1996) Reproductive endocrinology, surgery, and technology Philadelphia:
   Lippincott-Raven; and, Beers et al. eds. (1999) The Merck manual of diagnosis
15 and therapy. 17th ed., Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories, Rahway,
   N.J.).
           The extent of cerebral edema and mass effect can be determined by CT
   scans. For example, the volume of focal lesions can be measured. Mass lesions,
   either high-density or mixed-density abnormalities, will be evaluated by
20 measuring the area of the abnormality as a region of interest, multiplying the
   area by the slice thickness, and summing these volumes for contiguous slices
   showing the same lesion. Each lesion will be measured three times, and the
   mean volume will be entered. This technique has been shown to be reliable
   (Garcia-Estrada et al. (1993) Brain Res 628(1-2): 271-8).
25         Intracerebral lesions can be further characterized by location (frontal,
   temporal, parietal, occipital, basal ganglia, or any combination). When an
   edematous zone is present, its volume (the hypodense perimeter) can be
   measured and analyzed separately. Midline shift will be measured using the
   septum pellucidum as the midline structure. The ventricle-brain ratio (VBR) will
30 be calculated to quantify the degree of cerebral atrophy. Levin et al. ((1981)
   Archives of Neurology 38(10):623-9) found that the VBR had satisfactory
                                           107

   reliability across different examiners, and was related both to the severity of
   acute injury and neurobehavioral sequelae (Hoffman et al. (1994) J Neurotrauma
   11(4): 417-31).
            The duration of ventilator support will be defined as the number of hours
 5 the patient receives positive pressure mechanical ventilation (Uhler et al. (1994)
   Veurosurgery 34(1): 122-8; Jiang et al. (1996) Brain Res 735(1): 101-7; and
   Gonzalez-Vidal et al. (1998) Arch Med Res 29(2): 117-24). Time spent under
   ventilator support for reasons other than brain injury will be subtracted in the
   final analysis.
10          In addition to the neurological measurements discussed above, a partial
   therapeutic response can also be assayed through various functional and
   neuropsychological outcomes. Several standardized measures of
   neuropsychological and functional performance are known. For instance
   subjects may display an improvement in the Glasgow Outcome Scale
15 (GOS)/Glasgow Outcome Scale Extender (GOSE) and/or in the Disability
   Rating Scale (DRS). The Glasgow Outcome Score is one of the most widely
   used measures of brain injury recovery in the world (Garcia-Estrada et al. (1999)
   Int J Dev Neurosci 17(2): p. 145-51). Patients are classified into one of five
   categories: death, persistent vegetative state, severe disability, moderate
20 disability, and good recovery. It is easy to administer and score, and has a high
   degree of reliability and validity.
            The Disability Rating Scale (DRS) offers more precision than the GOS
   for measuring outcomes of moderate brain injury (Goodman et al. (1996) J
   Neurochem 66(5): 1836-44). The DRS consists of an eight-item rating of arousal
25 and awareness, daily living activities, physical dependence, and employability
   (Vedder et al. (1999) J Neurochem 72(6):2531-8). Inter-rater reliability for the
   entire DRS is high (0.97 to 0.98).
            The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) can be used to assess
   physical and cognitive disability. It contains 18 items in the following domains:
30 self-care, sphincter control, mobility, locomotion, communication, and social
   cognition (Baulieu (1997) Mult Scler 3(2): 105-12). The FIM has demonstrated
                                           108

   reliability and validity as an outcome measure following moderate and severe
   TBI (Jung-Testas et al. (1994) J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol 48(1): 145-54).
            The Sickness Impact Profile is one method for measuring self-perceived
   health status (Schumacher et al. (1995) Ciba Found Symp 191: p. 9 0 - 1 1 2 and
 5 Koenig et al. (1995) Science 268(5216):1500-3). It consists of 136 questions
   divided into 12 categories: sleep and rest, eating, work, home management,
   recreation and pastimes, ambulation, mobility, body care and movement, social
   interaction, alertness, behavior, emotional behavior, and communication. It has
   been widely used across a variety of diseases and injuries, including head injury
10 (Thomas et al. (1999) Spine 24:2134-8). Baseline SIP scores will reflect pre
   injury health status, while follow-up scores will examine post-injury
   functioning.
                    Ischemia
            Global ischemia, as used herein in reference to the CNS, refers to a
15 condition which results from a general diminution of blood flow to the entire
   brain, forebrain, or spinal cord, which causes the delayed death of neurons,
   particularly those in metabolically active loci, throughout these tissues.
            Focal ischemia, as used herein in reference to the CNS, refers to a
   condition that results from the blockage of a single artery that supplies blood to
20 the brain or spinal cord, resulting in the death of all cellular elements (pan
   necrosis) in the territory supplied by that artery.
                    Epilepsy
            Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by repeated seizures overtime.
   Types of epilepsy can include, but are not limited to generalized epilepsy, e.g.,
25 childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile nyoclonic epilepsy, epilepsy with grand
   mal seizures on awakening, West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, partial
   epilepsy, e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy, frontal lobe epilepsy, benign focal
   epilepsy of childhood.
                    Status epilepticus (SE)
30          Status epilepticus (SE) can include, e.g., convulsive status epilepticus,

 5 characterized by the presence of convulsive status epileptic seizures, and can
   include early status epilepticus, established status epilepticus, refractory status
   epilepticus, super-refractory status epilepticus. Early status epilepticus is treated
   with a first line therapy. Established status epilepticus is characterized by status
   epileptic seizures which persist despite treatment with a first line therapy, and a
10 second line therapy is administered. Refractory status epilepticus is
   characterized by status epileptic seizures which persist despite treatment with a
   first line and a second line therapy, and a general anesthetic is generally
   administered. Super refractory status epilepticus is characterized by status
   epileptic seizures which persist despite treatment with a first line therapy, a
15 second line therapy, and a general anesthetic for 24 hours or more.
            Non-convulsive status epilepticus can include, e.g., focal non-convulsive
   status epilepticus, e.g., complex partial non-convulsive status epilepticus, simple
   partial non-convulsive status epilepticus, subtle non-convulsive status
   epilepticus; generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus, e.g., late onset
20 absence non-convulsive status epilepticus, atypical absence non-convulsive
   status epilepticus, or typical absence non-convulsive status epilepticus.
            Compositions described herein can also be administered as a
   prophylactic to a subject having a CNS disorder e.g., a traumatic brain injury,
   status epilepticus, e.g., convulsive status epilepticus, e.g., early status

   Example 1.      Stability studies of formulations comprising allopregnanolone
   and CAPTISOL@
           Materials and Methods
20         Formulations of allopregnanolone (1.5 mg/ml) and CAPTISOL@ (6%)
   were evaluated for stability after storage at different temperatures and relative
   humidities over a 12 week period. The formulations were stored in an IntraVia
   flexible bag [multilayer polyolefin plastic, (PL 2408), non-latex, non-PVC, non
   DEHP] or a vial (Type 1 glass vial with a 20 mm stopper, FluroTec, 4432/50
25 Westar). The samples were prepared from a stock solution of 250 ml of 6
   mg/ml allopreganolone in CAPTISOL@. The formulations were evaluated
   based on clarity/color, assay (potency), impurities (known, unknown, and total),
   osmolality, pH, bacterial endotoxins, and particulate matter.
           Results
30         The studies demonstrated that the formulation was stable under all
   conditions that were tested for twelve weeks: refrigerated 2-5'C; refrigerated
                                           111

   Example 2. Allopregnanolone rescue of AGS SE in Fmr1 Knockout Mice.
 5          Allopregnanolone reversed the sensitization to audiogenic seizure (AGS)
   - a form of status epilepticus (SE) - in Fmr] KO mice at 3, 10, 30 mg/kg dosed
   intraperitoneal (IP) in 30% b-Cyclodextrin, as indicated by the significant
   decrease in Percent Seizure (FIG. 1A), and increase Percent Survival (FIG. IB)
   relative to vehicle treated control. Plasma levels of six animals in each
10 Allopregnanolone treatment group were collected randomly at completion of
   study and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Bioanalytical measures are indicated in
   ng/mL (FIG. 1A). Data are presented as mean +/- SEM. *P<0.05 indicate a
   statistically significant difference relative to vehicle control by Fisher's PLSD.
   MPEP 30mg/kg was used as a positive control in the study.

   Example 3. Allopregnanolone prevention of status epilepticus in PZT-Seizure
   model.
            Allopregnanolone at 3, 10, 30 mg/kg dosed intraperitoneal (IP) in 15%
   p-Cyclodextrin    prevented status epilepticus in PTZ (pentylenetetrazol) (85
20 mg/kg IP)-treated C57BL6/J mice, as indicated by the significant decrease in
   Seizure rank (FIG. 2A), and increase Latency to Death (FIG. 2B) relative to
   vehicle-treated control. Plasma levels of three animals in each Allopregnanolone
   treatment group were collected randomly at completion of study and analyzed
   by LC-MS/MS. Bioanalytical measures are indicated in ng/mL (FIG. 2A). Data
25 are presented as mean +/- SEM. *P<0.05 indicate a statistically significant
   difference relative to vehicle control by Fisher's PLSD. Valproate 400 mg/kg

            The plasma concentration profile over time of allopregnanolone in male
   patient diagnosed with refractory status epilepticus was evaluated as shown in
   FIG. 3. The patient was dosed Allopregnanolone 1.5 mg/ml in
   6%hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin in 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously for 5
 5 days. Infusion rate 86 p g/kg/h. Dosing schedule included 5.6 mg/h of
   Allopregnanolone at 3.8 mL/h. Plasma concentrations was analyzed 2 hours
   prior to start of infusion then 52, 76, 100, 124, and 148 hours.
   Example 5. Allopregnanolone in vivo plasma concentration post intramuscular
10 and intravenous administration.
            The plasma and brain exposure profiles of Allopregnanolone were
   measured by LC/MS-MS after single intramuscular (IM) (10mg/kg) or
   intravenous (IV) (5mg/kg) dose in 30% CAPTISOL® in SD rats. Analysis
   shows that Allopregnanolone dosed IM (10mg/kg) has an unexpectedly
15 substantially greater exposure in plasma (671-916%, 0.5-2 hr) and brain (506%,
   1 hr) relative to IV (5mg/kg) dose as indicated in Table 1 and 2. N=2/ time

   Example 6. Progesterone in 6% CAPTISOL® rescue of injury in TBI rodent
20 model.
            Progesterone in 6% CAPTISOL® rescued motor impairment in a
   penetrating ballistic brain injury rodent model of traumatic brain injury in both
   the low and high dose groups (FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B). Progesterone was
   administered via a bolus loading dose followed by a 5 day continuous infusion
25 where progesterone was tapered over the last 24 hours every 8 hrs by 25%. The
   low dose group received 2.5 mg/kg/hr for a 1 hr bolus infusion followed by a
   maintenance dose of 1.25 mg/kg/hr over 5 days with the last 24 hours being a
   taper. The high dose group received 5.0 mg/kg/hr for a 1 hr bolus infusion
   followed by a maintenance dose of 2.50 mg/kg/hr over 5 days with the last 24
30 hours being a taper.
