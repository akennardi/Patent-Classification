                                         TECHNICAL FIELD
           This invention relates to a silicone composition and a cured product thereof.
10                                       BACKGROUND ART
           A dilatant fluid is a mixture of liquid and particles and behaves as a fluid under
   slow deformation and as a solid in response to rapid deformation.         This nature is utilized
   in a variety of industrial fields (see Patent Documents 1 to 4).
           Recently, the dilatant fluid is used for protecting a fuel cell stack mounted inside
15 fuel cell vehicles (see Patent Document 5).      In the fuel cell stack, the dilatant fluid
   conforms to slow deformation as in the case of cell deflection, to prevent the cells from
   being further deformed or damaged.        On the other hand, when large deformation is
   applied as in the case of a minor collision, the dilatant fluid behaves as a solid to prevent
   misalignment of the cell stack.     However, the fuel cell stack of Patent Document 5 has the
20 problem that since the dilatant fluid is received in a bag, the dilatant fluid leaks out upon
   breakage of the bag.
           If a solid material like rubber exerts dilatant properties, the problem of Patent
   Document 5 would be overcome.          However, the prior art crosslinked rubber does not
   always exhibit a high storage elastic modulus at a high strain rate.       In order to increase the
25 storage elastic modulus at a high strain rate, the amount of a filler added must be increased.
   A heavy loading of the filler, however, causes a viscosity buildup to the composition prior
   to curing, making the composition difficult to handle.

                                    SUMMARY OF INVENTION
            An object of the invention is to provide a silicone composition which has a low
 5 viscosity and good moldability prior to curing and cures into a dilatant product that exhibits
   a low storage elastic modulus at a low strain rate and a high storage elastic modulus at a
   high strain rate; and a cured product of the composition.
            The inventors have found that when an organopolysiloxane component capped at
   one end with an alkoxysilyl group, a linear organohydrogenpolysiloxane component having
10 Si-H groups on side chains, and a linear organohydrogenpolysiloxane component having
   Si-H groups at both ends are used in a filled addition-curable silicone composition, the
   resulting silicone composition has a low viscosity, despite the filler loading, and ease of
   handling prior to curing, and cures into a cured product that exhibits a low storage elastic
   modulus when the strain rate is in a low-frequency range (i.e., 0.1 Hz) and a high storage
15 elastic modulus when the strain rate is in a high-frequency range (i.e., 500 Hz).

                          ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION
           The silicone composition of the invention has a low viscosity and good moldability
   prior to curing, does not leak out after curing, and affords a cured product which exhibits a
   low storage elastic modulus at a low strain rate and a high storage elastic modulus at a high
20 strain rate.

                       DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
           As used herein, the notation (Cn-Cm) means a group containing from n to m carbon
   atoms per group.     The abbreviation ppm stands for parts by weight per million parts by
   weight.
 5         The silicone composition is defined as comprising components (A) to (G), which
   are described below in detail.
   Component (A)
           Component (A) is an organopolysiloxane containing at least one silicon-bonded
10 alkenyl group in the molecule and having a viscosity at 25'C of 1.0 to 100 Pa- s, preferably
   2.0 to 10 Pa- s.
           If the viscosity is less than 1.0 Pa-s, the composition becomes less dilatant.        If the
   viscosity exceeds 100 Pa-s, the composition becomes less flowing.           It is noted that the
   viscosity is measured by a rotational viscometer (the same applies hereinafter).
15         Any well-known organopolysiloxanes may be used as component (A) insofar as
   they have the viscosity and alkenyl content defined above.          The structure of the
   organopolysiloxane is not particularly limited, and it may be linear or branched.
   Component (A) may be a mixture of two or more organopolysiloxanes having different
   viscosities.
20         The silicon-bonded alkenyl group has 2 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 8
   carbon atoms.     Examples include vinyl, allyl, 1-butenyl, and 1-hexenyl.         Of these, vinyl
   is preferred for ease of synthesis and cost.     The alkenyl group may be present at the end of
   the molecular chain and/or at a position midway the molecular chain of the
   organopolysiloxane.      It is preferred for flexibility that the alkenyl groups be attached to
25 only the both ends of the molecular chain.
           Besides the alkenyl group, the organopolysiloxane (A) contains silicon-bonded
   organic groups, which include monovalent hydrocarbon groups of 1 to 20 carbon atoms,
   preferably 1 to 10 carbon atoms.       Examples of the monovalent hydrocarbon group include
   alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-hexyl, and n-dodecyl; aryl groups
30 such as phenyl; aralkyl groups such as 2-phenylethyl and 2-phenylpropyl; and halogenated
   forms of the foregoing groups in which some or all hydrogen atoms are substituted by
   halogen atoms (e.g., chlorine, fluorine and bromine), such as fluoromethyl, bromoethyl,
                                                     -5-

   chloromethyl and 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl.       It is preferred for ease of synthesis and cost that
   at least 90 mol% of the organic groups be methyl.
            Understandably, component (A) is preferably an organopolysiloxane capped at both
   ends with dimethylvinylsilyl, more preferably a dimethylpolysiloxane capped at both ends
 5 with dimethylvinylsilyl.
   Component (B)
            Component (B), which plays the role of decreasing the viscosity of the composition
   to impart fluidity thereto, is an organopolysiloxane having the general formula (1).

10                       R'           R1      n
            In formula (1), R' is each independently a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent
   hydrocarbon group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably I to 6 carbon atoms, and more
   preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms.       Examples include linear, branched and cyclic alkyl, alkenyl,
   aryl, aralkyl, haloalkyl and cyanoalkyl groups.        Suitable linear alkyl groups include
15 methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-hexyl, and n-octyl.        Suitable branched alkyl groups include
   isopropyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, and 2-ethylhexyl.       Suitable cyclic alkyl groups include
   cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.       Suitable alkenyl groups include vinyl and allyl.      Suitable
   aryl groups include phenyl and tolyl.      Suitable aralkyl groups include 2-phenylethyl and
   2-methyl-2-phenylethyl.       Suitable haloalkyl groups include 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl,
20 2-(nonafluorobutyl)ethyl, and 2-(heptadecafluorooctyl)ethyl.           Typical of the cyanoalkyl
   group is cyanoethyl.      Of these, methyl, phenyl and vinyl are preferred as R .
            R2 is each independently an alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkenyl or acyl group.         Although
   the carbon count is not particularly limited, these groups preferably have 1 to 10 carbon
   atoms, more preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and even more preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms.
25 Suitable alkyl groups include linear, branched and cyclic alkyl groups as exemplified above
   for R .    Suitable alkoxyalkyl groups include methoxyethyl and methoxypropyl.             Suitable
   alkenyl groups are as exemplified above for R'.          Suitable acyl groups include acetyl and
   octanoyl.     Of these, alkyl groups are preferred as R2 , with methyl and ethyl being more
   preferred.
                                                     -6-

           The subscript n is an integer of 2 to 100, preferably 5 to 80, and a is an integer of 1
   to 3, preferably equal to 3.
           The viscosity at 25'C of component (B), though not particularly limited, is
   preferably 0.005 to 10 Pa- s, more preferably 0.005 to 1 Pa- s.    If the viscosity is less than
 5 0.005 Pa- s, the composition may be liable to oil bleeding and lead to a reduction of
   adhesion with time.    If the viscosity exceeds 10 Pa-s, the composition may become too
   viscous to flow.
           Preferred examples of component (B) include organopolysiloxanes having the
   following formulae, but are not limited thereto.

           Component (B) may be used alone or in admixture of two or more.            Component
   (B) is blended in an amount of 1 to 100 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 50 parts by weight
   per 100 parts by weight of component (A).       If the amount of component (B) is less than 1
   part by weight, the composition has too high a viscosity.     If the amount of component (B)
15 exceeds 100 parts by weight, the composition is difficult to cure.
   Component (C)
           Component (C), which plays the role of curing the liquid composition, is an
   organohydrogenpolysiloxane having the general formula (2).

            In formula (2), p and q are positive integers, and p+q is an integer of 10 to 100,
   preferably 20 to 60.        If p+q is less than 10, the organohydrogenpolysiloxane may become
   volatile, causing contact and other failures when used with electronic parts. If p+q exceeds
   100, the organohydrogenpolysiloxane may have too high a viscosity and be difficult to handle.
 5         The value of p/(p+q) is in a range of 0.01 to 0.5, preferably in a range of 0.05 to 0.4.
   If the value is less than 0.01, the composition may not form a network structure through
   crosslinking.       If the value exceeds 0.5, many Si-H groups remain unreacted after initial
   cure, allowing excessive crosslinking reaction to take place over time in the presence of
   moisture so that the composition loses flexibility.
10          R3 is each independently a CI-C 6 alkyl group, which may have a linear, branched or
   cyclic structure.      Suitable alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, and
   n-hexyl.     It is preferred for ease of synthesis and cost that at least 90 mol% of R3 be methyl.
            Preferred examples of component (C) include organohydrogenpolysiloxanes having
   the following formulae, but are not limited thereto.

            Component (C) may be used alone or in admixture of two or more.
   Component (D)
            Component (D), which plays the role of maintaining the cured composition at a low
20 hardness and enhancing dilatant properties, is an organohydrogenpolysiloxane having the
   general formula (3).

            In formula (3), R 4 is each independently a C1 -C6 alkyl group.            The alkyl group
   may be as exemplified above for R .            It is also preferred for ease of synthesis and cost that
   at least 90 mol% of R 4 be methyl.         The subscript m is an integer of 5 to 1,000., preferably
   10 to 100.     If m is less than 5, the organohydrogenpolysiloxane may become volatile,
 5 causing contact and other failures when used with electronic parts.              If m exceeds 1,000,
   the organohydrogenpolysiloxane may have too high a viscosity and be difficult to handle.
            Preferred examples of component (D) include organohydrogenpolysiloxanes having
   the following formulae, but are not limited thereto.

10          Component (D) may be used alone or in admixture of two or more.
            Components (C) and (D) are combined in such amounts that a ratio of the total
   number of SiH groups in components (C) and (D) to the total number of alkenyl groups in
   components (A) and (B), that is, {total number of SiH groups in components (C) and
   (D)}/{ total number of alkenyl groups in components (A) and (B)} ranges from 0.6 to 1.5,
15 preferably from 0.7 to 1.4.        If the ratio of the total number of SiH groups to the total
   number of alkenyl groups is less than 0.6, the cured composition forms an insufficient
   network structure, failing to provide the desired hardness after curing.             If the ratio exceeds
   1.5, the cured composition has too high a hardness.
            Moreover, components (C) and (D) are combined in such amounts that a ratio of
20 {number of SiH groups in component (D)}/{ number of SiH groups in component (C) }
   ranges from 1 to 10, preferably from 2 to 9.            If the ratio of the number of SiH groups in
   component (D) to the number of SiH groups in component (C) is less than 1, the composition
   becomes less dilatant.       If the ratio exceeds 10, the composition becomes less curable.
25 Component (E)
            Component (E) is a filler which plays the role of imparting dilatant properties to the
   (cured) composition.
            Any of well-known fillers may be used, for example, aluminum powder, copper
   powder, silver powder, nickel powder, gold powder, alumina powder, zinc oxide powder,
                                                         -9-

   magnesium oxide powder, aluminum nitride powder, boron nitride powder, silicon nitride
   powder, diamond powder, carbon powder, indium, and gallium.            The filler may be used
   alone or in admixture of two or more.
            The filler should have an average particle size of 0.1 to 20 vtm, preferably 0.5 to 15
 5  tm.   Particles with an average particle size of less than 0.1 jtm are likely to agglomerate,
   adversely affecting fluidity.   With an average particle size in excess of 20 jim, the
   composition may lose dilatant properties.      The shape of the filler is preferably spherical,
   though not limited thereto.    Notably, the average particle size is determined as a volume
   average particle size D50 (a particle size at cumulative 50% by volume or median diameter)
10 in particle size distribution measurement by laser light diffractometry.
            Component (E) is blended in an amount of 200 to 1,000 parts by weight, preferably
   300 to 800 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of component (A).          Less than 200
   parts by weight of component (E) fails to impart the desired dilatant properties to the cured
   composition.      With more than 1,000 parts by weight of component (E), the composition
15 does not become liquid and has poor fluidity.
   Component (F)
            Component (F) is a platinum group metal catalyst.       The platinum group metal
   catalyst may be selected from any well-known ones as long as it promotes addition reaction
20 between alkenyl groups in component (A) and SiH groups in components (C) and (D).
            Examples of the catalyst include platinum group metals alone such as platinum
   (including platinum black), rhodium and palladium; platinum chlorides, chloroplatinic
   acids and chloroplatinates such as H 2 PtCI4 -nH 2 0, H 2PtC6-nH20, NaHPtC16-nH 20,
   KHPtCl- nH 20, Na 2 PtC 6 - nH 20, K2 PtCl 4 -nH 2 0, PtC4- nH 20, PtCl 2 and Na2 HPtCl 4 -nH2O,
25 wherein n is an integer of 0 to 6, preferably 0 or 6; alcohol-modified chloroplatinic acids;
   chloroplatinic acid-olefin complexes; supported catalysts comprising platinum group
   metals such as platinum black and palladium on supports of alumina, silica, and carbon;
   rhodium-olefin complexes; chlorotris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium (known as Wilkinson's
   catalyst); and complexes of platinum chlorides, chloroplatinic acids and chloroplatinates
30 with vinyl-containing siloxanes.     The platinum group metal catalyst may be used alone or
   in admixture of two or more.     Of these, platinum or platinum compounds are preferred.
                                                  -10-

            Component (F) may be used in a catalytic amount, that is, an amount sufficient to
   promote reaction of component (A) and the like with components (C) and (D), which may
   be determined as appropriate depending on the desired cure rate.        Specifically, the amount
   of component (F) is 0.1 to 7,000 ppm, preferably I to 6,000 ppm of platinum group metal
 5 based on the weight of component (A).       If the amount of component (F) is less than 0.1
   ppm, the catalytic effect may not be exerted.       If the amount exceeds 7,000 ppm, no further
   improvements in cure rate may be expected.
   Component (G)
10          Component (G) is a reaction inhibitor.      The reaction inhibitor is blended to
   suppress the progress of curing reaction at room temperature for thereby prolonging the
   shelf life and pot life of the composition.   The reaction inhibitor may be selected from
   well-known ones as long as it suppresses the catalytic activity of component (F).
            Examples of the reaction inhibitor include hydroxyl-containing acetylene compounds
15 such as 1-ethynyl-I-cyclohexanol and 3-butyn-1-ol, various nitrogen compounds, organic
   phosphorus compounds, oxime compounds, and organic chlorine compounds.                 Of these,
   hydroxyl-containing acetylene compounds are preferred because they are non-corrosive to
   metals.
            The reaction inhibitor may be diluted with an organic solvent such as toluene, xylene
20 or isopropyl alcohol prior to use, in order to facilitate its dispersion in the silicone resin.
            Component (G) is blended in an amount of 0.01 to 1.0 part by weight, preferably
   0.05 to 0.9 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of component (A).          Less than 0.01 part
   by weight of component (G) may fail to gain a satisfactory shelf life or pot life whereas
   more than 1.0 part by weight may render the composition less curable.
25
   Other components
            Besides components (A) to (G), any well-known additives may be added to the
   composition as long as the objects of the invention are not impaired.        Suitable additives
   include, for example, hindered phenol-based antioxidants, reinforcing or non-reinforcing
30 fillers such as calcium carbonate, thixotropic agents such as polyethers, and colorants such
   as pigments and dyes.
                                                  -11-

           The method of preparing the inventive silicone composition containing the above
   components is not particularly limited and may accord with any well-known techniques.
   The composition may be prepared by mixing the components (A) to (G) and optional other
   components in any desired order.        Specifically, a one-pack type composition may be
 5 prepared by charging a planetary mixer with components (A), (B) and (E), which are
   mixed at a predetermined temperature (e.g., 25C) for a predetermined time (e.g., 1 hour)
   under reduced pressure.      The mixture is cooled.     Then components (G), (F), (C) and (D)
   are added thereto and mixed at a predetermined temperature (e.g., 25C) for a
   predetermined time (e.g., 1 hour).
10         Alternatively, the composition may be formulated as a two-pack type composition
   in any combination of the components as long as all components (A), (C), (D) and (F) do
   not coexist at the same time.      For example, a two-pack type composition consisting of
   agents A and B may be prepared as follows.          A gate mixer is charged with components
   (A), (B) and (E), which are mixed at a predetermined temperature (e.g., 25C) for a
15 predetermined time (e.g., 1 hour) under reduced pressure.         The mixture is cooled.    Then
   component (F) is added thereto and mixed at a predetermined temperature (e.g., 25C) for
   a predetermined time (e.g., 30 minutes), yielding agent A.        Separately, a gate mixer is
   charged with components (A), (B) and (E), which are mixed at a predetermined temperature
   (e.g., 25C) for a predetermined time (e.g., 1 hour) under reduced pressure.        The mixture is
20 cooled.    Then component (G) is added thereto and mixed at a predetermined temperature
   (e.g., 25C) for a predetermined time (e.g., 30 minutes), and components (C) and (D) are
   added thereto and mixed at a predetermined temperature (e.g., 25C) for a predetermined
   time (e.g., 30 minutes), yielding agent B.
           The silicone composition of one-pack type may be stored for a long term by
25 refrigeration or freezing whereas the silicone composition of two-pack type may be stored
   for a long term at room temperature.
           The viscosity at 25'C of the silicone composition is not particularly limited, and
   preferably 1 to 400 Pa- s, more preferably 10 to 300 Pa- s.      If the viscosity at 25'C is less
   than 1 Pa- s, the filler may settle down.    If the viscosity is more than 400 Pa-s, the
30 composition may have too low a fluidity to mold.
           A cured product obtained by curing the silicone composition defined above is also
   contemplated herein.      The curing conditions are not particularly limited and may be
                                                    -12-

   similar to conditions used for well-known silicone gels.     Specifically, the silicone
   composition, after casting to a part, may be allowed to cure naturally with the heat
   generated from the part or be cured by positive heating.    In the latter case, the composition
   is cured by heating at preferably 60 to 180'C, more preferably 80 to 150'C for preferably
 5 0.1 to 3 hours, more preferably 0.5 to 2 hours.
           The cured product of the silicone composition thus obtained preferably has a
   hardness of up to 50 as measured by a type A Durometer according to JIS K6253 because it
   typically shows a flexible behavior under slow deformation and minimizes the stress
   applied to the part in contact therewith.
10         The cured product preferably exhibits a storage elastic modulus of 8.1 to 100 MPa,
   more preferably 8.1 to 80 MPa when the strain rate is a high frequency (500 Hz).         The
   cured product preferably exhibits a storage elastic modulus of 0.5 to 8.0 MPa, more
   preferably 1.0 to 7.0 MPa when the strain rate is a low frequency (0.1 Hz).        A cured
   product having a storage elastic modulus within the above ranges exhibits good dilatant
15 properties.   Additionally, the ratio of (storage elastic modulus at a strain rate equal to a
   high frequency of 500 Hz)/(storage elastic modulus at a strain rate equal to a low frequency
   of 0.1 Hz) is preferably at least 3.0, more preferably at least 3.5.

   Preparation of silicone composition
           A 5-L planetary mixer (Inoue Mfg. K.K.) was charged with components (A), (B)
 5 and (E), which were mixed at 25'C for 2 hours under reduced pressure.     Component (F)
   was added thereto and mixed at 25'C for 30 minutes.       Then component (G) was added
   thereto and mixed at 25'C for 30 minutes until uniform.     Finally components (C) and (D)
   were added thereto and mixed at 25'C for 30 minutes until uniform, yielding a silicone
   composition.     The amounts of components blended are shown in Table 1.
10
           The silicone compositions thus obtained were measured and evaluated for the
   following physical properties.    The results are also shown Table 1.
   Viscosity
15         The absolute viscosity of the composition was measured at 25'C by a rotational
   viscometer PC-IT (Malcom Co., Ltd.).
   Hardness
           The composition was press cured at 120'C for 10 minutes and further heated in an
20 oven at 120'C for 50 minutes, obtaining a silicone sheet of 2.0 mm thick.   Three silicone
   sheets were overlaid into a laminate, which was measured for hardness by type A
   Durometer according to JIS K6253.
   Dilatant properties
25         Analysis was made by using a viscoelasticity system Rheogel-E4000 (UBM Co., Ltd.)
   under conditions including method: dynamic viscoelasticity (sinusoidal) measurement,
   measurement mode: frequency dependency, chuck: tension, waveform: sine wave, and
   strain control: 25 gm.   The sample was dimensioned 5.0 mm wide by 2.2 mm thick by 30
   mm long.     The storage elastic modulus was determined both when the strain rate was a
30 high frequency (500 Hz) and when the strain rate was a low frequency (0.1 Hz), from

            As seen from Table 1, the silicone compositions of Examples 1 to 4 had a low
   viscosity and good moldability.      The cured products exhibited a relatively high storage
   elastic modulus in the range of 8.5 to 19.0 MPa when the strain rate was a high frequency
   (500 Hz) and a low storage elastic modulus in the range of 1.0 to 5.0 MPa when the strain rate
 5 was a low frequency (0.1 Hz), indicating that the cured products had good dilatant properties.
