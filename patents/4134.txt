                                     A SHADOWLINE
The following statement is a full description of this invention including the best method
of performing it known to me:

                                               1
A SHADOWLINE
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present invention relates to a shadowline. The present invention has
particular, although not exclusive application to a shadowline for a building ceiling.
BACKGROUND
[0002]      The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of
the common general knowledge.
[0003]      A shadowline is a type of fixing or bead that assists in hiding imperfections
when finishing adjacent surfaces in a building. In particular, ceiling shadowlines can
minimise the unsightly appearance of misaligned walls and ceilings by providing a
clean, straight shadow edge whilst also often giving the impression of a greater ceiling
height. A ceiling shadowline creates a feel of a floating ceiling, giving straight lines
between the wall and ceiling junction, also creating an impression of a greater ceiling
height.
[0004]      The preferred embodiment provides an improved ceiling shadowline. The
preferred embodiment also provides an improved shadow affect between a ceiling and
wall junction.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005]      According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
shadowline including:
        a pair of legs for extending along respective surfaces; and
        a channel between the legs.
[0006]      One leg may sit on a wall and the other leg on a ceiling, with the ceiling leg
adjacent the channel that produces the shadow affect once a tearaway strip is removed.

                                               2
The shadowline may include a cover for covering the channel. The cover may be
releasably fastened to the channel and may be removed in use to uncover the channel.
The shadowline may define a line of weakness to facilitate tearing away of the cover.
The cover may be pivotally connected.
[0007]     The shadowline may include bonding abutments or walls extending from
each leg and against which bonding can abut.
[0008]     The cover may form an angle. The cover may form a right angle. The legs
may extend at a slightly obtuse angle.
[0009]     The shadowline may be integrally formed. The shadowline may be extruded.
The legs may include apertures formed after extrusion for receiving bonding. The
apertures may be drilled or pressed holes.
[00010]    Each leg may be planar. Each surface may be flat. One surface may include
a wall whereas the other surface may include a ceiling.
[00011]    According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
method for installing a shadowline with a channel between legs, the method involving
bonding the legs along respective surfaces.
[00012]    The method may further involve removing a cover covering the channel to
uncover the channel.
[00013]    Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination
with any one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the
invention.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[00014]    Preferred features, embodiments and variations of the invention may be
discerned from the following Detailed Description which provides sufficient information
for those skilled in the art to perform the invention. The Detailed Description is not to be
regarded as limiting the scope of the preceding Summary of the Invention in any way.
The Detailed Description will make reference to a number of drawings as follows:

[00015]     Figures 1a-1c show sectional views of a ceiling shadowline in accordance
with an embodiment of the present invention that is sequentially having a channel cover
removed; and
[00016]     Figure 2 is a perspective view of the uncovered shadowline of Figure 1c.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[00017]     According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an
extruded ceiling shadowline 100 as shown in Figure 1a. The shadowline 100 includes a
pair of legs 102a, 102b for extending along respective ceiling and wall surfaces. A
square channel 104 is formed between the legs 102a, 102b. The shadowline 100 further
includes a right-angled cover 106 for covering the channel 104.
[00018]     The cover 106 is releasably fastened to the channel 104 and can be removed
in use to uncover the channel 104. The shadowline 100 defines a longitudinal line of
weakness 108, between the cover 106 and channel 104, to facilitate pivoting and then
tearing away of the cover 106 from the channel 104 as shown in Figures 1b and 1c
respectively.
[00019]     Turning to Figure 1c, the shadowline 100 includes small abutments or walls
11 Ca, 101 b extending inwardly from each planar leg 102a, 102b and against which
bonding (e.g. plaster) can abut. The walls 11 Ca, 11 Ob terminate in a flat surface against
which the bonding is feathered flush.
[00020]     The legs 102a, 102b extend at a slightly obtuse angle to facilitate snug fitting
in the right angle formed by the ceiling and the wall defining the flat attachment
surfaces.
[00021]     The shadowline 100 is integrally formed and extruded from polymeric
material. As can best be seen in in Figure 2, the legs 102 include round apertures 200
formed by drilling or pressing after extrusion. The rows of apertures 200 receive
bonding during installation.
[00022]     A method for installing the shadowline 100 is now briefly described.

                                               4
[00023]     The shadowline 100 is placed in a ceiling corner and with the legs 102a,
102b abutting the ceiling and wall respectively.
[00024]     Plaster is feathered over the legs 102a, 102b and received in the holes 200
to bond the legs 102a, 102b to respective surfaces. The plaster abuts and sits flush with
the abutments or walls 11 Ca, 100b. Any excess plaster can be simply troweled onto the
cover 106 which prevents it from entering the clean channel 104.
[00025]     In practice, the plastic shadowline 100 or bead is plastered into place using
base coat, then it is sanded. More plaster is then applied using a top coat plaster with a
wider trowel, and then sanded again to gain a flat surface with the same texture as
paper on the gyprock sheeting forming the wall and ceiling.
[00026]     Once the top coat of plaster sets, and before painting, the cover 106 (and
any excess bonded plaster) is pivoted out of the channel 104 along the line of weakness
108 using a screwdriver (Figure 2).
[00027]     The cover 106 is then torn away along the line of weakness 108 to uncover
the clean channel 104.
[00028]     The wall and ceiling are then painted. In some cases 2 coats of base plaster
could be used then a final top coat to finish it.
[00029]     A person skilled in the art will appreciate that many embodiments and
variations can be made without departing from the ambit of the present invention.
[00030]     In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language
more or less specific to structural or methodical features. It is to be understood that the
invention is not limited to specific features shown or described since the means herein
described comprises preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention
is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the
appended claims appropriately interpreted by those skilled in the art.
[00031]     Reference throughout this specification to 'one embodiment' or 'an
embodiment' means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in
connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present

                                           5
invention. Thus, the appearance of the phrases 'in one embodiment' or 'in an
embodiment' in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all
referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or
characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more combinations.
