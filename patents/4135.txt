           This application     is related    to Australian   Patent Application     No.  2014248553,
   International Patent Application No. PCT/US2014/024825          (Publication No. WO 2014/165217
 5 A2), and United States Patent Application No. 13/796,614, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by way of reference.
   FIELD
           Aspects of embodiments of the present invention relate to a dynamic real time
   transmission line monitor, a dynamic real time transmission line monitoring system, and a
10 method of monitoring a transmission line using the same.
   BACKGROUND
           Transmission lines are used to supply electric power and may span large distances.
   Further, a distance between support points of a transmission line may be great, and an amount
   by which the transmission line may drop down, or sag, between the support points may vary
15 depending on various factors, such as a temperature of the transmission line due to an ambient
   temperature or an amount of current passing through and heating the transmission line, or
   environmental factors such as wind or precipitation. When a transmission line drops down by a
   certain amount, it may contact an object, such as a tree, and result in a disruption in power
   transmission.
20         As such, it is desirable that a location of a transmission line in space be known. Further,
   regulations may require that locations of transmission lines in space be known.              Some
   techniques have been used for predicting or approximating locations of transmission lines in
   space, such as techniques based on laser scanning using helicopters, and day-ahead forecasting
   based on an estimated amount of current to be passed through the transmission line, as well as
25 previously collected data for predicted weather parameters.          However, such techniques are
                                                     -1-

   static, rather than dynamic, and do not yield a real time location of a transmission line in space
   based on real time measurements.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           In the following detailed description, certain exemplary embodiments of the present
   invention are shown and described, by way of illustration. As those skilled in the art would
   recognize, the described exemplary embodiments may be modified in various ways without
 5 departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and
   description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, rather than restrictive.
           With reference to FIGS. 1 to 4, a dynamic real time transmission line monitor 100
   according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a housing 102 having an interior
   cavity 104. The transmission line monitor 100 is installable on a transmission line 10 (see, e.g.,
10 FIG. 5) and further includes one or more sensors 110 configured to sense in real time at least
   one of a temperature, a position., a current, an acceleration/vibration. a tilt, a roll, or a distance
   of the transmission line 10 from an object, and an antenna 112 configured to transmit a signal
   including information sensed by the sensor 110 away from the transmission line monitor 100 in
   real time.
15         The one or more sensors 110 are configured to sense in real time at least one of a
   temperature, a position, a current, an acceleration, a tilt, a roll, or a distance of the transmission
   line 10 from an object 15.     The one or more sensors 110, in one embodiment, include an
   accelerometer 113 for measuring a vibration frequency spectrum or a tilt and roll of the

   embodiments, the transmission line monitor 100 may include any other suitable sensors or
   devices configured to sense, measure, or detect a property of the transmission line 10 or
   environment.
           The antenna 112 is configured to transmit a signal including information sensed by the
10 one or more sensors 110 away from the transmission line monitor 100 in real time. The antenna
   112, in one embodiment, transmits a radio wave signal away from the transmission line monitor
   100 in real time, and may include a board made of FR4 composite or a dipole antenna or

   the cover portion 140. That is, in one embodiment, the upper non-conductive inner portion 152
   has an oblong shape with substantially straight front and rear sides, and rounded first and
   second ends. However, the present invention is not limited to the above-described shape of the
   upper non-conductive inner portion 152, and, in other embodiments, the upper non-conductive
                                                 -13-

   inner portion 152 may have any other suitable shape. The upper channel portion 157 extends
   along a length of the upper non-conductive inner portion 152 and has a substantially semi
   circular shape having a radius corresponding to that of the largest transmission line 10. The
   upper channel portion 157 of the upper non-conductive inner portion 152 and the lower channel
 5 portion 154 of the lower non-conductive inner portion 151 together make up the channel 155 of
   the non-conductive inner portion 150. The second alignment portion 134, in one embodiment,
   is at a lower surface of the front lateral portion 156a and is a recess having a shape substantially
   corresponding to the cone-shaped protrusion of the first alignment portion 132 for receiving the

            The non-conductive inner portion 150, in one embodiment, is made of fiberglass, such
   as by casting. In one embodiment, for example, the non-conductive inner portion 150 is made
   of a vinyl ester resin with 1/32-inch milled fibers. However, the present invention is not limited
                                                     -14-

   thereto, and, in other embodiments, the non-conductive inner portion 150 may be made of a cast
   high-temperature polymer, glass-filled nylon, or any other suitable material.
           With reference to FIGS. 7 and 17, the keeper 106, in one embodiment, includes a keeper
   plate 180 and one or more biasing members 182, such as compression springs. The keeper 106
 5 is engaged with the travel bolt 105 and descends via rotation of the travel bolt 105 to move the
   housing 102 to the closed position and continues to descend upon further rotation of the travel
   bolt 105 to retain the transmission line 10 after the housing 102 is in the closed position. As
   such, the housing 102 may be moved to the closed position and the transmission line monitor
   100 may be efficiently and easily fixed at a location on the transmission line 10 by rotation of
10 only the single travel bolt 105. The keeper plate 180, in one embodiment, includes a body
   portion 183 and a tubular portion 185 protruding downward from the body portion 183. The
   tubular portion 185 has an opening 186 in which the travel bolt 105 is received. The keeper
   plate 180 further includes a cradle portion 187 which retains the transmission line 10 opposite
   the cradle portion 127 of the base portion 120. The keeper plate 180, in one embodiment, is
15 made of aluminum, such as by casting or machining. However, the present invention is not
   limited thereto, and, in other embodiments, the keeper plate 180 may be made of any other
   suitable material.
           The keeper 106 further includes a threaded member 190 threadedly engaged with the
   travel bolt 105 in a threaded opening 105a at an upper end thereof. The keeper 106 further
20 includes a keeper cover 188 that is fixed to an upper side of the upper non-conductive inner
   portion 152, and which provides an upper stop for the keeper plate 180. The one or more
   biasing members 182 bias the keeper plate 180 against the keeper cover 188.                In one
   embodiment, the opening 186 may have a recess (e.g., a bore) at an upper portion of the
   opening 186 receiving a head of the threaded member 190. Similarly, the opening 186 may
25 have a recess (e.g., a bore), at a lower portion of the opening 186 and receiving the upper end of
   the travel bolt 105. When the travel bolt 105 is rotated relative to the threaded member 190, the
   keeper plate 180 is moved downward, and the cover portion 140 is moved downward together
   with the keeper plate 180 due to the one or more biasing members 182 biasing the keeper plate
   180 against the keeper cover 188. In this manner, the travel bolt 105 may be rotated until the
                                                    -15-

   housing 102 is in the closed position. After the housing 102 is in the closed position, the travel
   bolt 105 may be further rotated against a biasing force of the one or more biasing members 182,
   such as compressing the compression springs, to move the keeper plate 180 further downward
   and retain the cradle portion 187 against the transmission line 10. The one or more biasing
 5 members 182 bias the housing 102 toward the open position, and when the travel bolt 105 is
   rotated in an opposite direction, the one or more biasing members 182 force the keeper plate
   180 upward.
           With reference to FIG. 18, the electronics assembly 170, in one embodiment, includes
   an electronics housing 171 and one or more circuit assemblies making up a computer of the
10 transmission line monitor 100 that is configured to receive and manipulate information sensed
   by the one or more sensors 110, and cause the signal containing the information to be
   transmitted from the antenna 112. In one embodiment, the electronics housing 171 houses the
   one or more circuit assemblies and is sealed with a cover 172 and a gasket 173.            In one
   embodiment, the one or more circuit assemblies include a first circuit assembly 174a, a second
15 circuit assembly 174b, a third circuit assembly 174c, and a fourth circuit assembly 174d. In one
   embodiment, the first circuit assembly 174a is a main circuit assembly of the electronics
   assembly 170 and may make up the computer. The second circuit assembly 174b may be a
   daughter board assembly for the antenna 112 and may be mounted in the electronics housing
   171 via a mounting bracket 175. The third and fourth circuit assembly 174c and 174d may be
20 temperature sensor circuit assemblies corresponding to the temperature sensor 114 and the
   ambient temperature sensor 116, respectively.           The electronics housing 171, in one
   embodiment, houses the distance sensor 115 and has an opening 171a formed through a bottom
   side of the electronics housing 171 through which the distance sensor 115 is exposed. The
   electronics assembly 170 may include a distance sensor mounting bracket 178 mounting the
25 distance sensor 115 in the electronics housing 171, and a gasket 176, such as an O-ring,
   weatherproofing the opening 171a. The electronics housing 171 may also house the ambient
   temperature sensor 116 and have an opening 171b (see FIG. 3) formed through the bottom side
   of the electronics housing 171 through which the ambient temperature sensor 116 is exposed.
   Further, the electronics housing 171 may house the temperature sensor 114, and the cover 172
                                                  -16-

   may have an opening 172a through which the temperature sensor 114 is exposed.             In one
   embodiment, the electronics assembly 170 includes a cable 177 passing outside the electronics
   housing 171 to the antenna 112 to communicate therewith. The electronics housing 171 and the
   cover 172, in one embodiment, are made of aluminum, such as by casting or machining.
 5 However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and, in other embodiments, the electronics
   housing 171 and the cover 172 may be made of any other suitable material.
           The transmission line monitor 100, in one embodiment, further includes a current
   transformer 192 for powering the transmission line monitor 100, such as the electronics
   assembly 170, or computer, and the one or more sensors 110 using a current of the transmission
10 line 10. As such, the transmission line monitor 100 may be self-powered via the current of the
   transmission line 10. The current transformer 192 may be housed in a current transformer
   housing 194.     Further, in one embodiment, a current of the transmission line 10 may be
   measured using the current transformer. In one embodiment, the transmission line monitor 100
   includes an electronic switch and a position resistor.
15         The transmission line monitor 100, in one embodiment, includes a temperature sensing
   target 195, a temperature of which is measured by the temperature sensor 114. The temperature
   sensing target 195 is in contact with the transmission line 10 such that a temperature of the
   temperature sensing target 195 is the same or substantially the same as a temperature of the
   transmission line 10. The temperature sensing target 195, in one embodiment, is configured as
20 shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B. That is, in one embodiment, the temperature sensing target 195
   includes a concave contact surface 196 having a radius of curvature corresponding to a radius of
   the transmission line 10, and a target surface 198 opposite the contact surface 196.          For
   example, in one embodiment, where the transmission line monitor 100 is configured to be
   installed on a transmission line conductor having a diameter of two inches, the contact surface
25 has a radius of one inch. In one embodiment, the temperature sensing target 195 is made of
   aluminum and is anodized black on at least the target surface 198 at which the temperature
   sensor 114 measures the temperature.       The target surface 198 has an emissivity of one or
   approximately one due to the black anodizing to facilitate an accurate temperature
                                                  -17-

   measurement, compared to measuring the temperature directly of a surface of the transmission
   line 10.
            With reference to FIG. 20, the dynamic real time transmission line monitor 100 is shown
   installed on the transmission line 10, according to an embodiment of the present invention. In
 5 one embodiment, the transmission line monitor 100 may be installed at a location along the
   transmission line 10 that is supported by a pair of towers 12. For example, the transmission line
   monitor 100 may be installed on the transmission line 10 at a location that is equidistant or
   substantially equidistant from the towers 12, as depicted in FIG. 20. A nearest object 15 (e.g., a
   tree or the ground) below the transmission line 10 is detected, and a distance d1 to the object 15
10 is measured by the transmission line monitor 100. According to an embodiment of the present
   invention, the transmission line monitor 100 is small and lightweight, such as about 16.5 inches
   long and less than 25 pounds, further facilitating easy installation of the transmission line
   monitor 100 on the transmission line 10.
            With reference to FIGS. 21A and 21B, a roll and a tilt of the dynamic real time
15 transmission line monitor 100 installed on the transmission line are illustrated, according to an
   embodiment of the present invention. The transmission line monitor 100, in one embodiment,
   detects and/or measures an amount of the roll (see FIG. 21A) via the accelerometer 113 (e.g., a
   MEMS accelerometer) described above.           Further, the transmission line monitor 100, in one
   embodiment, detects and/or measures an amount of the tilt (see FIG. 21B) via the accelerometer
20 113. Because the transmission line monitor 100 is installed on the transmission line 10 at a
   location thereof, a roll and tilt of the transmission line 10 at the location where the transmission
   line monitor 100 is installed may be derived from the measured roll and tilt of the transmission
   line monitor 100.      Roll and tilt of the transmission line 10 may be caused by wind or
   precipitation, for example.
25          With reference to FIG. 22, a dynamic real time transmission line monitoring system 200
   according to another embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of dynamic real
   time transmission line monitors 210 and a monitoring station 220. Each of the dynamic real
   time transmission line monitors 210 may have a same or similar configuration as the dynamic
   real time the transmission line monitor 100 described above.               In one embodiment, the
                                                     -18-

   transmission line monitors 210 may be installed at different locations along the same
   transmission line 10 that is supported by towers 12, as depicted in FIG. 22. However, the
   present invention is not limited thereto, and, in another embodiment, at least two of the
   transmission line monitors 210 may be installed on separate transmission lines 10. Each of the
 5 dynamic real time transmission line monitors 210 includes one or more sensors 110 configured
   to sense in real time at least one of a temperature, a position, a current, an acceleration, a
   vibration, a tilt, a roll, or a distance of the transmission line 10 from a nearest object 15 (e.g., a
   tree or the ground) below the transmission line 10. In one embodiment, the transmission line
   monitors 210 may be configured to send a signal containing information of a property of the
10 transmission line 10 sensed by one or more sensors of the transmission line monitor 210 to the
   monitoring station 220 and/or to one another. That is, one of the transmission line monitors 210
   may send a signal to another one of the transmission line monitors 210, such as a nearest one of
   the transmission line monitors 210. In this manner, the transmission line monitors 210 may
   relay signals to the monitoring station 220 across a great distance. Also, the transmission line
15 monitors 210 may communicate information to one another. The monitoring station 220 may
   include a computer configured to analyze and store the information received from one or more
   of the transmission line monitors 210, as well as produce screen prints displaying the
   information. In one embodiment, each of the transmission line monitors 210 may be remotely
   programmable, such as via the monitoring station 220. According to another embodiment of
20 the present invention, the dynamic real time transmission line monitoring system 200 may
   include only one dynamic real time transmission line monitor 210 and the monitoring station
   220, and the one transmission line monitor 210 sends a signal containing information of a
   property of the transmission line 10 sensed by one or more sensors of the transmission line
   monitor 210 to the monitoring station 220.
25         With reference to FIG. 23, tasks of a method 300 of dynamic real time transmission line
   monitoring according to an embodiment of the present invention are shown. While the method
   300 is described herein with respect to the dynamic real time transmission line monitor 100
   and/or the dynamic real time transmission line monitoring system 200 described above, the
   method 300, or at least some of the tasks thereof, may be performed using a dynamic real time
                                                      -19-

   transmission line monitor and/or a dynamic real time transmission line monitoring system
   according to other embodiments of the present invention.
            In one embodiment, the method 300 of dynamic real time transmission line monitoring
   includes a task 310 of installing the dynamic real time transmission line monitor 100 on the
 5 transmission line 10.     The transmission line monitor 100 is installed on a length of the
   transmission line 10 conductor, such as an aluminum conductor having a suitable diameter and
   voltage. For example, the transmission line 10 may be a 2-inch diameter conductor and may
   have a voltage of 100 kV.      However, embodiments of the present invention are not limited
   thereto. In the task 310, the transmission line monitor 100 is installed on the transmission line
10 10 while the housing 102 is in the open position such that the length of the transmission line 10
   is received into the cavity 104 and, more specifically, the channel 155 of the transmission line
   monitor 100 through the gap 108 (see FIG. 6). The transmission line monitor 100, as a result of
   its construction according to embodiments of the present invention, may be installed on the
   transmission line 10 while the transmission line 10 is live using either a bare hand or hot stick
15 technique.
            The method 300, in one embodiment, includes a task 320 of moving the housing 102 of
   the transmission line monitor 100 to a closed position to retain the transmission line monitor
   100 on the length of the transmission line 10. In one embodiment, the task 320 includes moving
   at least one of the cover portion 140 or the base portion 120 relative to the other to the closed
20 position of the housing 102 to retain the length of the transmission line 10 in the cavity 104 and,
   more specifically, the channel 155. In the task 320, the travel bolt 105 is turned to move at least
   one of the cover portion 140 or the base portion 120 relative to the other to the closed position
   of the housing 102. In one embodiment, the travel bolt 105 is turned further after the housing
   102 is in the closed position such that the keeper 106 engages the transmission line monitor 100
25 on the transmission line 10. As such, the transmission line monitor 100 may be retained at a
   fixed position on the transmission line 10. As discussed above with respect to the task 310, the
   housing 102 of the transmission line monitor 100 may be moved to the closed position to retain
   the transmission line monitor 100 on the length of the transmission line 10 while the
   transmission line 10 is live using either a bare hand or hot stick technique.

           The method 300, in one embodiment, includes a task 330 of powering the transmission
   line monitor 100 using a current of the transmission line 10. The transmission line monitor 100
   may include a current transformer used to power the computer and sensors of the transmission
   line monitor 100 using current of the transmission line 10. As such, the transmission line
 5 monitor 100 may be self-powered via the current of the transmission line 10.                In one
   embodiment, a current of the transmission line 10 is measured, and the current transformer may
   be used for measuring the current of the transmission line 10.          In one embodiment, the
   transmission line monitor 100 includes an electronic switch which, after the transmission line
   monitor 100 is powered on via the current transformer and the current of the transmission line
10 10, switches such that the current transformer measures the current of the transmission line 10.
           In one embodiment, the method 300 of dynamic real time transmission line monitoring
   further includes a task 340 of sensing a temperature of the transmission line 10 in real time.
   The temperature of the transmission line 10 is measured by the temperature sensor 114 at a
   location of the transmission line 10 that is in the cavity 104 and, more specifically, the channel
15 155 of the housing 102. The temperature sensor 114 may be a thermocouple or an infrared
   temperature measuring device. In one embodiment, the temperature sensor 114 measures the
   temperature of the temperature sensing target 195 that is in contact with the transmission line 10
   such that the temperature of the temperature sensing target 195 is the same or substantially the
   same as a temperature of the transmission line 10. The temperature sensing target 195, in one
20 embodiment, is anodized black and has an emissivity of one or approximately one on at least
   the target surface 198 at which the temperature sensor 114 measures the temperature such that
   an accurate temperature measurement may be obtained.
           The method 300, in one embodiment, includes a task 350 of sensing vibration,
   acceleration, tilt, and/or roll of the transmission line 10 in real time. In one embodiment, a
25 vibration frequency spectrum and/or a tilt and roll of the transmission line 10 is measured using
   the accelerometer 113, which may be a MEMS accelerometer. For example, the accelerometer
   113 may measure a frequency spectrum at which the transmission line 10 is vibrating, which
   may be a galloping vibration or a low-amplitude aeolian vibration caused by wind which may
   cause fatigue in the transmission line 10.
                                                   -21-

            In one embodiment, the method 300 of dynamic real time transmission line monitoring
   further includes a task 360 of sensing a distance of the transmission line 10 from a nearest
   object in real time. The transmission line monitor 100 may be used to detect and measure a
   distance dl to a nearest object 15 (see FIG. 20), such as a tree, the ground, or any other object
 5 below the transmission line monitor 100. The distance dl is measured in real time using the
   distance sensor 115, which may be a LIDAR sensor. For example, the distance dl may vary in
   real time due to wind, precipitation, ambient temperature, or the temperature of the transmission
   line 10, which may cause sagging at elevated temperatures, such as caused by a high current
   passing through the transmission line 10.
10          The method 300, in one embodiment, includes a task 370 of transmitting a signal to the
   monitoring station 220. The signal including information sensed by the one or more sensors
   110 is transmitted from the transmission line monitor 10 by the antenna 112 in real time. In one
   embodiment, the antenna 112 transmits a radio wave signal to the monitoring station 220.
   According to embodiments of the present invention, as a result of the construction of the
15 transmission line monitor 100, the signal is effectively transmitted from the antenna 112 while a
   corona discharge from the antenna 112 is prevented or substantially prevented. The monitoring
   station 220, or control center, may be any suitable station configured to receive the signal from
   the antenna 112 of the transmission line monitor 100. In one embodiment, the transmission line
   monitor 100 may transmit a signal to more than one monitoring station 220.
20          The method 300, in one embodiment., includes a task 380 of transmitting a signal to
   another transmission line monitor. The signal including information sensed by the one or more
   sensors 110 is transmitted from the transmission line monitor 10 by the antenna 112 in real
   time. The signal, in one embodiment, is transmitted from one transmission line monitor 100 to
   one or more other transmission line monitors 100. For example, the signal may be transmitted
25 from a first transmission line monitor 100 to one or more second transmission line monitors 100
   installed on a same transmission line 10 as the first transmission line monitor 100 or on one or
   more other transmission lines 10. Each of the second transmission line monitors 100 may, in
   turn, transmit a signal including information sensed by the first transmission line monitor 100,
   as well as information sensed by the second transmission line monitor 100. In this manner, a
                                                  -22-

   large amount of information sensed at various locations along one or more transmission lines
   may be communicated over a large distance to one or more monitoring stations 220. Further, in
   one embodiment, the signal may be transmitted from one transmission line monitor 100 to one
   or more other transmission line monitors 100 and also directly to the monitoring station 220 as
 5 described above with respect to the task 370.
           The method 300, in one embodiment, includes a task 390 of monitoring information
   transmitted to the monitoring station.     As discussed above, the monitoring station 220, or
   control center, may be any suitable station configured to receive the signal from one or more of
   the transmission line monitors 100. The monitoring station 220 may also include a computer
10 for storing and analyzing information data received from the one or more transmission line
   monitors 100, as well as for producing alarms and/or screen prints displaying the information,
   or for further processing or communicating the information to a user. In one embodiment, the
   real time information is received by the monitoring station 220 and monitored as the real time
   information itself. However, in another embodiment, the real time information received by the
15 monitoring station 220 may be monitored or analyzed together with previously collected data,
   estimated parameters (e.g., estimated weather parameters), and/or day-ahead forecasts, for
   example.
           While in one embodiment, the method 300 of dynamic real time transmission line
   monitoring may include each of the tasks described above and shown in FIG. 23, in other
20 embodiments of the present invention, in a method of dynamic real time transmission line
   monitoring, one or more of the tasks described above and shown in FIG. 23 may be absent
   and/or additional tasks may be performed. Further, in the method 300 of dynamic real time
   transmission line monitoring according to one embodiment, the tasks may be performed in the
   order depicted in FIG. 23. However, the present invention is not limited thereto and, in a
25 method of dynamic real time transmission line monitoring according to other embodiments of
   the present invention, the tasks described above and shown in FIG. 23 may be performed in any
   other suitable sequence.
           According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, the transmission line
   monitor, when attached to the most critical spans of a transmission line (i.e. the spans with the
                                                  -23-

   least amount of clearance to ground) and when coupled with local weather data, can be used to
   calculate real time dynamic transmission line ratings using well established theory, such as
   IEEE 738-2012 "Standard for Calculating the Current-Temperature Relationship of Bare
   Overhead Conductors." By accumulating this data along with the weather predictions for each
 5 day, it is possible to build an intelligent algorithm that will forecast the maximum line rating for
   the next day using the next day's weather forecast. In this way, using the transmission line
   monitor according to embodiments of the present invention, it is possible to increase or
   maximize the capacity of transmission line networks. In addition, if the weather forecast turns
   out to be incorrect, the transmission line monitor is a safety device that may send a signal to
10 warn an operator of the transmission line system that a clearance violation is about to take
   place, or has already taken place. This will allow the operators to take one or more corrective
   actions (e.g., reducing a current through the transmission line and/or moving a load from the
   transmission line to one or more other transmission lines) before a clearance violation occurs.
            With reference to FIG. 24, tasks of a method 400 of dynamic real time transmission line
15 monitoring according to an embodiment of the present invention are shown. The method 400
   may be performed using the dynamic real time transmission line monitor 100 and/or the
   dynamic real time transmission line monitoring system 200 described above, for example, or at
   least some of the tasks thereof, may be performed using a dynamic real time transmission line
   monitor and/or a dynamic real time transmission line monitoring system according to other
20 embodiments of the present invention.          Also, one or more of the tasks of the method 400
   described below may be omitted, and/or one or more additional tasks may be performed.
   Further, one or more of the tasks of the method 300 described above with respect to FIG. 23
   may be performed together with one or more of the tasks of the method 400.
            In one embodiment, the method 400 of dynamic real time transmission line monitoring
25 includes a task 410 of providing a dynamic real time transmission line monitor on a critical span
   of a transmission line. For example, the dynamic real time transmission line monitor may be
   installed on a transmission line in a manner similar to that described above with respect to the
   task 310. Further, each of a plurality of dynamic real time transmission line monitors may be
                                                     -24-

   installed at a respective critical span, as the critical spans may vary due to changing wind or
   weather patterns, for example.
           The method 400 further includes a task 420 of accumulating measurement data from the
   transmission line monitor.       As described above, the transmission line monitor may sense
 5 measurement data in real time of at least one of a temperature, a position, a current, an
   acceleration, a vibration, a tilt, or a roll of the transmission line. That is, the transmission line
   monitor, using one or more sensors, may sense measurement data of ambient temperature, wind
   speed and direction, solar radiation, and/or other weather factors, current and temperature of the
   transmission line, and also a distance of the transmission line from a nearest object, as shown in
10 a task 450. Further, a task 430 of calculating real time dynamic transmission line ratings, as
   described above, is performed. That is, real time dynamic transmission line ratings may be
   calculated using the accumulated measurement data and well established theory, such as IEEE
   738-2012 "Standard for Calculating the Current-Temperature Relationship of Bare Overhead
   Conductors."     Further, in a task 440, by accumulating the data along with the weather
15 predictions for each day, an intelligent algorithm may be used that will forecast the maximum
   line rating for the next day using the next day's weather forecast together with the data of
   conditions accumulated from the past.           The measurement data may be accumulated and
   analyzed by a device such as a remote computer or database server, which may be located at a
   monitoring station, as described above.
20         In the task 450, a distance of the transmission line from a nearest object is measured,
   and, in a task 460, the transmission line monitor may detect an actual clearance violation based
   on the measured distance. Also, a clearance violation may be predicted or forecasted based on
   the accumulated data and the algorithm. A weather forecast may also be used in predicting a
   clearance violation. In a task 470, if such a clearance violation is detected or predicted, a
25 corrective action may be taken. One or more such corrective actions may include reducing a
   current in the transmission line or moving a load to one or more adjacent lines, for example.
           Although the drawings and accompanying description illustrate some exemplary
   embodiments of a transmission line monitor and a method of monitoring a transmission line
   using the same, it will be apparent that the novel aspects of the present invention may also be

   the present invention. Also, in other embodiments, components described above with respect to
   one embodiment may be included together with or interchanged with those of other
   embodiments.

   the invention. Persons skilled in the art and technology to which this invention pertains will
