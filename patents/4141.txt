The wireless repeater system includes transceiver to bridge two or more devices to
one another, using WiFi, RF communications, Bluetooth, etc. It can act as a WiFi
repeater system, connect to existing WiFi systems, repeat the WiFi signal, or create its
own networks. It can be powered by environmental sources such as solar, wind,
liquid turbine, thermal power or so. Backup power can be recharged or included into
the wireless repeater system which remains in operation even when the environmental
source is not producing power. The backup power can be Li-lon/Li-Polymer battery,
Sealed Lead Acid battery, Capacitor storage, external power feed, etc. The wireless
repeater system can include integrated sensors such as wind velocity,
temperature/humidity, pressure, dust and strain sensors, accelerometers, etc. It can be
connected to physical devices using Ethernet and Serial connections. It also includes
external antenna connections or has an internal antenna options and should be
weatherproof.

Description:
The wireless repeater system will include transceiver technology to bridge two
or more devices to one another, using wireless technology, this can include but
is not limited to; WiFi communications, RF communications, Bluetooth
Communications.
The wireless repeater system can act as but not limited to a WiFi repeater
system, connect to existing WiFi systems, repeat the WiFi signal, or create its
own network/s.
The wireless repeater system can be powered by but not restricted to
environmental sources such as solar power, wind power, liquid turbine power,
and thermal power. A form of backup power can also be recharged or included
into the wireless repeater system to allow the repeater system to remain in
operation even when the environmental source is not producing power. This
backup power can be in the form of but not limited to; Li-lon/Li-Polymer
battery, Sealed Lead Acid battery, Capacitor storage, external power feed.
The wireless repeater system can be capable to include sensors that will be
integrated into the wireless repeater system, these sensors can be but not
limited to; wind velocity sensors, temperature/humidity sensors, pressure
sensors, dust sensors, strain sensors, accelerometers.
The wireless repeater system can be capable of providing connections to
physical devices if required, some communication types include but not limited
to; Ethernet connections, Serial connections.
The wireless repeater system will include external antenna connections, but
may also have internal antenna options.
The wireless repeater system should be weatherproof and some possible
designs for the housing are included below, this design may change based on
environmental conditions such as low air velocity, solar power, etc.
