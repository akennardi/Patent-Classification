                             PIVOTABLE USB OUTLET MODULE
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention relates to a USB outlet module with pivotable
   transformer for attachment to a grid plate.
 5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            It is common practice nowadays to charge many electronic devices, such as
   mobile phones, cameras, headphones and portable music players using a USB port
   on a computer or a USB AC (alternating current) adaptor which can be plugged into a
   wall mounted power outlet.
10          However, typically multiple portable electronic devices are used by individuals
   and family groups and accordingly the number of computer USB ports that are
   available may be insufficient. Furthermore, the use of a USB AC adaptor requires an
   available power outlet, as well as a separate adaptor and a cable for each device.
   The requirement for multiple adaptors can be problematic and the adaptors are
15 typically suitable for only a particular country or region which poses problems when
   travelling.
            For this reason, wall mounted grid plates that include an integral USB port or
   ports have been developed to allow the connection of a portable electronic device
   directly to a power source using simply an appropriate USB cable. These systems,
20 while overcoming many of the issues identified above, still suffer a number of
   problems. For instance, if a problem occurs with the transformer or wiring of the
   integral USB port/s the entire grid plate must be replaced.
            There are a number of systems suggested in the published prior art that
   include a USB module that is attachable to a grid plate. These include the USB
25 mechanism disclosed in Australian Patent 2014101063 (LEGRAND) that comprises a
   USB connector electrically connected to a transformer via a cable which allows for
   the transformer to be positioned remote from the grid plate when the USB connector
   is fixed to a grid plate.
            One of the advantages with this system is that the transformer can be
30 positioned in multiple locations behind the grid plate which is helpful for cavity walls
   where space may be limited. However, the system disclosed in LEGRAND requires

                                                  2
   the use of cable ties to hold the transformer in place, which means if they are not
   properly installed there may not be adequately support for the transformer which may
   pull down on the USB connector.
            Another system is illustrated in Australian Design 201615584 (SCHNEIDER),
 5 that discloses a USB power module, wherein the transformer is rigidly connected to
   the USB ports. However, since the transformer disclosed in SCHNEIDER is rigidly
   connected and extends rearwardly of the USB ports it can pose a problem where
   space is limited in the wall cavity or where there is an obstacle such as a stud or
   frame member in the way.
10          It should be appreciated that any discussion of the prior art throughout the
   specification is included solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present
   invention and should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art
   was widely known or formed part of the common general knowledge in the field as it
   existed before the priority date of the application.
15 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            In one aspect of the invention, but not necessarily the broadest or only
   aspect, there is proposed a Universal Serial Bus (USB) module, comprising,
   at least one USB port supported within a USB housing, the USB housing attachable
   to a grid plate, and
20 a transformer electrically connected to said at least one USB port, the transformer
   being held within a transformer housing,
   wherein said USB housing is pivotably connected to said transformer housing to
   thereby permit the transformer housing to be moved relative to the USB housing.
            The transformer housing may be pivotable about a single axis. The single
25 axis may be in the form of a hinge or knuckle about which the transformer housing
   can pivot.
            Preferably, the single axis is positioned generally horizontal when the USB
   module is attached to the grid plate and mounted to a wall. The transformer housing
   may be pivoted about the horizontal axis, which may be generally parallel to a
30 vertical plane of said grid plate.
            In this way, the transformer housing is able to pivot along a vertical arc
   extending rearwardly of the grid plate or USB housing. Accordingly, the transformer

                                                3
   housing can be positioned wherein it extends vertically upward from the USB
   housing, or it extends horizontally rearward of the USB housing, or vertically
   downward from the USB housing.
           This means that the transformer housing can be positioned in different
 5 orientations to avoid obstacles that are located behind the grid plate when installed.
           The single axis may also be positioned generally along the vertical axis
   wherein the transformer housing can pivot along a horizontal arc that extends
   rearwardly of the USB housing to either side thereof, when attached to the grid plate.
           In another form, the pivot between the transformer housing and USB housing
10 comprises a cooperating ball and socket assembly. In this way, the transformer
   housing can be positioned in multiple orientations relative to the USB housing.
           Preferably, the pivot or hinge is biased or otherwise configured to hold the
   transformer housing at a set angle to the USB housing once installed. The
   cooperating members of the hinge or ball/socket assembly may frictionally engage
15 each other or be configured such that the cooperating members are biasedly held in
   two or more orientations.
           The transformer housing may include a slot or slots to permit passage of
   cabling therethrough for connection of the transformer to a power source.
           Preferably, the USB module includes two USB ports that are in a stacked
20 horizontal orientation.
           The transformer includes an input for connection to mains wiring and an
   output for connection to the USB port or ports. The transformer converts the mains
   power to a USB power specification. Preferably, the power output the USB ports is
   5V and 2000mA.
25         A cover may reversibly engage over the grid plate. The cover may be
   configured to extend over a front of the grid plate and includes at least one aperture
   to allow access to the USB port or ports therethrough. Preferably, the cover is
   configured to snap fit in place over the grid plate to provide an aesthetic cover.
           The grid plate may be configured to engage a mounting part for use in
30 attaching the grid plate to a surface, such as a wall or ceiling.

                                                4
            In another aspect of the invention there is proposed a method of attaching a
   grid plate with attachable USB module to a mounting surface, including the steps of:
   providing a Universal Serial Bus (USB) module, comprising at least one USB port
   held by a USB housing and a transformer held within a transformer housing that is
 5 electrically connected to said at least one USB port, wherein said USB housing is
   pivotably connected to said transformer housing;
   attaching said USB module to the grid plate, wherein the USB housing is rigidly
   connected thereto;
   pivoting the transformer housing to adjust the orientation of the transformer housing
10 relative to the USB housing and grid plate; and
   attaching the grid plate to, or through, the mounting surface;
   wherein the transformer housing is positionable to avoid obstacles behind said
   mounting surface.
            The above method further including the step of connecting said transformer to
15 main power or other power source.
            The above method wherein the mounting surface may be a wall panel or
   ceiling panel and in a one form is a wall panel of a cavity wall structure.

20 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED AND EXEMPLIFIED
   EMBODIMENTS
          Similar reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the
   drawings. Dimensions of certain parts shown in the drawings may have been
   modified and/or exaggerated for the purposes of clarity or illustration.
25         Referring to the drawings for a more detailed description, there is illustrated a
   Universal Serial Bus (USB) module 10, demonstrating by way of an examples,
   arrangements in which the principles of the present invention may be employed. The
   USB module 10 is configured for attachment to a grid plate 12.

                                                 6
           As illustrated in Figure 16 the grid plate 12 includes a generally planar body
   14, a plurality of holes 16, 18, 20 for receiving fasteners 22 therethrough. The grid
   plate 12 further includes a mounting aperture 24 for holding the USB module 10.
           A cover 26 clips over the grid plate 12 and includes opening 28 that coaxially
 5 aligns mounting aperture 24 and fits around and allows access to USB ports 30, 32
   of the USB module 10. The cover 26 is provided for aesthetics and may be
   constructed from plastic or metal.
           As illustrated in Figure 2, the USB module 10 comprises, a USB unit 34
   shown in broken lines, which includes the USB ports, 30, 32. The DC output of the
10 USB ports 30, 32 is envisaged to be 5V and 2000mA.
           The USB unit 34 is supported within a USB housing 40. The USB housing 40
   is configured for attachment to the grid plate 12, as illustrated in Figure 1. The
   attachment means may take any form wherein the USB housing 40 can be attached
   to and detached from the grid plate 12.
15         The USB housing 40 includes two rearwardly extending arms 42, 44, that are
   parallel and spaced apart from each other.
           As further illustrated in Figure 2, the USB module 10 further includes a
   transformer 46, showing in broken lines, that is held within a transformer housing 48.
   The transformer 46 is electrically connected to the USB unit 34 by way of a cable 50,
20 as indicated in broken lines.
           The transformer housing 48 includes slots 52, 54 to allow passage of mains
   power cabling (not shown) therethrough for connection of the transformer 46 to a
   power source.
           The transformer housing 48 includes a forwardly projecting arm 56 that is
25 configured to be coupled between the arms 42, 44 of the USB housing 40 to thereby
   form a hinge 57. The arms 42, 44, 56 may include cooperating projections and
   indents (not shown) such that the transformer housing 40 is pivotable relative to the
   USB housing 40. The reader should however appreciate that other hinge or pivot
   configurations could be used, such as a shaft that engages coaxially aligned holes in
30 the arms or a ball and socket assembly.

                                                   7
            The configuration and components of the transformer and USB unit will not be
   described in detail since they would be obvious to the person skilled in the art.
            The transformer 46 converts mains power input alternating current (AC) to
   direct current (DC) at the output for supply to the USB port or ports, as is well known
 5 in the art. The input is envisaged to be mains wiring carrying power at mains power
   specifications, i.e. 240V, although the invention can also be used in off-grid systems.
            As further illustrated in Figure 2, the transformer housing 48 comprises
   cooperating casings 58, 60 that are joined along junction 62. The USB housing 40
   also includes casings 64, 66 that are joined along junction 68.
10          As illustrated in Figures 3a to 3c the transformer housing 48 can be pivoted
   between a first position 70 as shown in Figure 3a, through a second position 72, as
   illustrated in Figure 3b, and into a third position 74, as illustrated in Figure 3c.
             Figures 4 to 7 illustrate the transformer housing 48 in the first position 70,
   wherein the transformer housing 48 extends straight out from the rear of the USB
15 housing 40. This configuration may be used where space behind the grid plate 12 is
   not restricted.
             Figures 8 to 11 illustrate the transformer housing 48 in the second position
   72, wherein the transformer housing 48 extends obliquely rearwardly of the USB
   housing 40. The oblique position may be a transition position or the transformer
20 housing 48 may be able to be held in this position.
             Figures 12 to 15 illustrate the transformer housing 48 in the third position 74,
   wherein the transformer housing 48 depends downwardly of the USB housing 40.
    Preferably the transformer housing 48 is held is this position and is spaced apart
   from the rear of the grid plate 12.
25          The reader will appreciate that although in the present embodiment the
   transformer housing 48 is pivotably coupled to the USB housing 40 and movable
   around a single axis, a ball and socket coupling or any other type of pivot or hinge
   could be used without departing from the scope of the invention. Furthermore,
   although the present embodiments have a single horizontal axis, the axis may be
30 positioned vertical or at an oblique angle.

                                                  8
            Figure 16 illustrates the rear of the grid plate 12 showing one possible
   embodiment of holes 16, 18, 20 and mounting aperture 24.
            Figure 17 illustrates the USB module 10 attached to the grid plate 12, wherein
   the grid plate 12 is attached to a cavity wall 80 by way of fasteners 82, as is known in
 5 the art. The cavity wall 80 comprises spaced wall panels 84, 86 which delineate
   sides of a cavity 88. The wall panel 86 includes an opening 90 through which the
   USB module 10 is able to extend. The fasteners 22 extend through wall panel 86,
   however the reader will appreciate that the grid plate 12 may also be attached to a
   mounting bracket (not shown), as is known in the art.
10          As can be seen in Figure 17, the transformer housing 48 can be folded out of
   the way so that it does not impinge upon the wall panel 84 or other obstruction within
   the wall cavity 88.
            Figures 18 and 19 show an alternate orientation of the transformer housing
   48, such that it extends upwardly from the USB housing 40.
15          Preferably, the pivot or hinge 57 is biased or otherwise configured to hold the
   transformer housing 48 in either orientation as illustrated in Figures 17 and 18/19 or
   the pivot or hinge 57 may include a plurality of teeth (not shown) that allow the
   transformer housing 48 to be positioned in multiple orientations along a vertical or
   horizontal arc.
20          The skilled addressee will now appreciate the advantages of the illustrated
   invention over the prior art. In one form the invention provides a USB module that
   can be used where there is restricted cavity wall space. The invention may allow the
   transformer to be positioned in different orientations to potentially avoid obstructions
   or to allow passage of cabling within a cavity wall. The transformer housing can
25 therefore be moved relative the USB housing, which can be rigidly connected to the
   grid plate, which means that there will be adequate support for the transformer
   housing, without the need for cable ties of other independent fixing means.
            Various features of the invention have been particularly shown and described
   in connection with the exemplified embodiments of the invention, however it must be
30 understood that these particular arrangements merely illustrate the invention and it is
   not limited thereto. Accordingly, the invention can include various modifications,
   which fall within the spirit and scope of the invention.
