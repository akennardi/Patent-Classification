   by reference.
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5            The invention relates generally to cyclic ether pyrazol-4-yl-heterocyclyl-carboxamide
   compounds for treating disorders mediated by Pim kinase (Pim-1, Pim-2, and/or Pim-3)
   inhibitors, thus useful as cancer therapeutics. The invention also relates to compositions, more
   specifically pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of using the
   same, either alone or in combination, to treat various forms of cancer and hyperproliferative
10 disorders, as well as methods of using the compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis
   or treatment of mammalian cells, or associated pathological conditions.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
              Pim kinases are family of three highly-related serine and threonine protein kinases
   encoded by the genes Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3. The gene names are derived from the phrase
15 Proviral Insertion, Moloney, frequent integration sites for murine moloney virus wherein the
   insertions lead to overexpression of Pim kinases and either de novo T-cell lymphomas,
   or dramatic acceleration of tumorigenesis in a transgenic Myc-driven lymphoma model (Cuypers
   et al. (1984) Cell, vol. 37 (1) pp. 141-50; Selten et al. (1985) EMBO J. vol. 4 (7) pp. 1793-8; van
   der Lugt et al. (1995) EMBO J. vol. 14 (11) pp. 2536-44; Mikkers et al. (2002) Nature Genetics,
20 vol. 32 (1) pp. 153-9; van Lohuizen et al. (1991) Cell, vol. 65 (5) pp. 737-52). These
   experiments reveal synergy with the oncogene c-Myc, and suggest that inhibition of the Pim
   kinases may have therapeutic benefit.
              Mouse genetics suggests that antagonizing Pim kinases may have an acceptable safety
   profile; a Pim 1 -/-; Pim-2 -/-, Pim-3 -/- mouse knockout is viable although slightly smaller than
25 wild type littermates (Mikkers et al. (2004) Mol Cell Biol vol. 24 (13) pp. 6104-154). The three
   genes give rise to six protein isoforms including a protein kinase domain, and apparently without
   recognizable regulatory domains. All six isoforms are constitutively active protein kinases that
   do not require post-translational modification for activity, thus Pim kinases are regulated
   primarily at the transcriptional level (Qian et al. (2005) J Biol Chem, vol. 280 (7) pp. 6130-7).
30 Pim kinase expression is highly inducible by cytokines and growth factors receptors and Pims
   are direct transcriptional targets of the Stat proteins, including Stat3 and Stat5. Pim-1, for

            Pim kinases function in cellular proliferation and survival pathways parallel to the
   PI3k/Akt/mTOR signaling axis (Hammerman et al. (2005) Blood vol. 105 (11) pp. 4477-83).
   Indeed, several of the phosphorylation targets of the PI3k axis including Bad and eIF4E-BP1 are
   cell growth and apoptosis regulators and are also phosphorylation targets of the Pim kinases (Fox
 5 et al. (2003) Genes Dev vol. 17 (15) pp. 1841-54; Macdonald et al. (2006) Cell Biol vol. 7 pp. 1;
   Aho et al. (2004) FEBS Letters vol. 571 (1-3) pp. 43-9; Tamburini et al. (2009) Blood vol. 114
   (8) pp. 1618-27). Pim kinase may affect cell survival since phosphorylation of Bad increases
   Bcl-2 activity and therefore promotes cell survival. Likewise, phosphorylation of eIF4E-BP1 by
   mTOR or Pim kinases causes depression of eIF4E, promoting mRNA translation and cellular
10 growth. In addition, Pim-1 has been recognized to promote cell cycle progression through
   phosphorylation of CDC25A, p21, and Cdc25C (Mochizuki et al. (1999) J Biol Chemvol. 274
   (26) pp. 18659-66; Bachmann et al. (2006) Int J Biochem Cell Biol vol. 38 (3) pp. 430-43; Wang
   et al. (2002) Biochim Biophys Acta vol. 1593 (1) pp. 45-55.
            Pim kinases show synergy in transgenic mouse models with c-Myc-driven and Akt
15 driven tumors (Verbeek et al. (1991) Mol Cell Biol vol. 11 (2) pp. 1176-9; Allen et al. Oncogene
   (1997) vol. 15 (10) pp. 1133-41; Hammerman et al. (2005) Blood vol. 105 (11) pp. 4477-83).
   Pim Kinases are involved in transforming activity of oncogenes identified in acute myeloid
   leukemia (AML) including Flt3-ITD, BCR-abl, and Tel-Jak2. Expression of these oncogenes in
   BaF3 cells results in upregulation of Pim-1 and Pim-2 expression, resulting in IL-3 independent
20 growth, and subsequent Pim inhibition results in apoptosis and cell growth arrest (Adam et al.
   (2006) Cancer Research 66 (7):3828-35). Pim overexpression and dysregulation has also been
   noted as a frequent event in many hematopoietic cancers, including leukemias and lymphoma
   (Amson et al. (1989) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86 (22):8857-61); Cohen et al. (2004) Leuk
   Lymphoma 45 (5):951-5; Htttmann et al. (2006) Leukemia 20 (10):1774-82) as well as multiple
25 myeloma (Claudio et al. (2002) Blood 100 (6):2175-86. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal B
   lymphocyte malignancy, which is characterized by the accumulation of terminally differentiated
   antibody-producing cells in the bone marrow.
            Pim 1 has been shown to be overexpressed and correlated to prostate cancer progression
   (Cibull et al. (2006) J Clin Pathol 59 (3):285-8; Dhanasekaran et al. (2001) Nature vol. 412
30 (6849):822-6). Pim 1 expression increases in mouse models with disease progression (Kim et al.
   (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99 (5):2884-9). Pim-1 has been reported to be the most highly
   overexpressed mRNA in the subset of human prostate tumor samples which have a c-Myc-driven
   gene signature (Ellwood-Yen et al. (2003) Cancer Cell 4(3):223-38). Pim-3 has been also been
   shown to be overexpressed and to have a functional role in pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular

   (2):209-18.
            Beyond oncology therapeutic and diagnostic applications, Pim kinases could play an
   important role in normal immune system function and Pim inhibition could be therapeutic for a
 5 number of different immunologic pathologies including tumorigensis (Nawijn et al (2011)
   Nature Rev. 11:23-34), inflammation, autoimmune conditions, allergy, and immune suppression
   for organ transplantation (Aho et al. (2005) Immunology 116 (1):82-8).

   physiological change or disorder, such as the development or spread of cancer. For purposes of
   this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of
   symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease,
   delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and
 5 remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. "Treatment" can also
   mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in
   need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to
   have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.
           The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a compound of the
10 present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition, or disorder, (ii)
   attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition,
   or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular
   disease, condition, or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically
   effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size;
15 inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral
   organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some
   extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with
   the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be
   cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by
20 assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR).
           The terms "cancer" refers to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is
   typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A "tumor" comprises one or more cancerous

10 herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis,
   amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the
   administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of the
   invention, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a Formula I
   compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic
15 product thereof.
           The term "package insert" is used to refer to instructions customarily included in
   commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications,
   usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and/or warnings concerning the use of such
   therapeutic products.
20         The term "chiral" refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability
   of the mirror image partner, while the term "achiral" refers to molecules which are
   superimposable on their mirror image partner.
           The term "stereoisomers" refers to compounds which have identical chemical
   constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.
25         "Diastereomer" refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose
   molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical
   properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of
   diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis
   and chromatography.
30         "Enantiomers" refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable
   mirror images of one another.
           Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed.,
   McGraw-HillDictionaryof Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York;
   and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., "Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds", John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,
35 New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers,

       WO 2014/048939                               - 15 -                     PCT/EP2013/069892
   and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms
   of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and
   atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present
   invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to
 5 rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the
   prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about
   its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of
   rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is
   levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical
10 structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A
   specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is
   often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic
   mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or
   stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms "racemic mixture" and "racemate"
15 refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.
   Enantiomers may be separated from a racemic mixture by a chiral separation method, such as
   supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Assignment of configuration at chiral centers in
   separated enantiomers may be tentative, and depicted in Table 1 structures for illustrative
   purposes, while stereochemical determination awaits, such as x-ray crystallographic data.
20          The term "tautomer" or "tautomeric form" refers to structural isomers of different
   energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers
   (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as
   keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by
   reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.
25          The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" denotes salts which are not biologically or
   otherwise undesirable. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include both acid and base addition
   salts. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" indicates that the substance or composition must
   be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a
   formulation, and/or the mammal being treated therewith.
30          The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt" denotes those
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid,
   hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, and organic acids
   selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic, and
   sulfonic classes of organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid,
35 gluconic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid,

   succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, aspartic acid, ascorbic acid, glutamic acid,
   anthranilic acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, embonic acid, phenylacetic acid,
   methanesulfonic acid "mesylate", ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and salicyclic acid.
           The term "pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt" denotes those
 5 pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed with an organic or inorganic base. Examples of
   acceptable inorganic bases include sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron,
   zinc, copper, manganese, and aluminum salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable
   organic nontoxic bases includes salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted
   amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange
10 resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine,
   ethanolamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, trimethamine, dicyclohexylamine, lysine, arginine,
   histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine,
   methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, and
   polyamine resins
15         A "solvate" refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a
   compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited
   to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethylacetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine.
           The term "EC5 0 " is the half maximal effective concentration" and denotes the plasma
   concentration of a particular compound required for obtaining 50% of the maximum of a
20 particular effect in vivo.
           The term "Ki" is the inhibition constant and denotes the absolute binding affinity of a
   particular inhibitor to a receptor. It is measured using competition binding assays and is equal to
   the concentration where the particular inhibitor would occupy 50% of the receptors if no
   competing ligand (e.g. a radioligand) was present. Ki values can be converted logarithmically to
25 pKi values (-log Ki), in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency.
           The term "IC5 0" is the half maximal inhibitory concentration and denotes the
   concentration of a particular compound required for obtaining 50% inhibition of a biological
   process in vitro. IC50 values can be converted logarithmically to pIC5 o values (-log IC5 0 ), in
   which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency. The IC50 value is not an absolute
30 value but depends on experimental conditions e.g. concentrations employed, and can be
   converted to an absolute inhibition constant (Ki) using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Biochem.
   Pharmacol. (1973) 22:3099).
           The terms "compound of this invention," and "compounds of the present invention" and
   "compounds of Formula I" include compounds of Formulas I and stereoisomers, geometric

   isomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs
   thereof.
            Any formula or structure given herein, including Formula I compounds, is also intended
   to represent hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such compounds, and mixtures thereof.
 5          Any formula or structure given herein, including Formula I compounds, is also intended
   to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically
   labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or
   more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples
   of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of
10 hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as, but not limited
   to 2H (deuterium, D), 3H (tritium), 1IC, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18F, 31P, 32P, 35S, 36Cl, and 1251.
   Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which
   radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 13C, and 14C are incorporated. Such isotopically labelled
   compounds may be useful in metabolic studies, reaction kinetic studies, detection or imaging
15 techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed
   tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive
   treatment of patients. Deuterium labelled or substituted therapeutic compounds of the invention
   may have improved DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) properties, relating to
   distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Substitution with heavier isotopes such as
20 deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability,
   for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. An 18F labeled
   compound may be useful for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this
   invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures
   disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a
25 readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Further,
   substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e., 2H or D) may afford certain
   therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo
   half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood
   that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent in the compound of the formula (I).
30 The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by an
   isotopic enrichment factor. In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically
   designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. Unless
   otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as "H" or "hydrogen", the position is
   understood to have hydrogen at its natural abundance isotopic composition. Accordingly, in the

      WO 2014/048939                                   -  18 -                      PCT/EP2013/069892
   compounds of this invention any atom specifically designated as a deuterium (D) is meant to
   represent deuterium.

   BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION
           Determination of the Pim kinase activity of a Formula I compound is possible by a
   number of direct and indirect detection methods. Certain exemplary compounds described
15 herein were assayed for their Pim kinase binding activity, including isoforms Pim-1, Pim-2, and
   Pim-3, (Example 901) and in vitro activity against tumor cells (Example 902). Certain
   exemplary compounds of the invention had Pim binding activity IC50 values less than about 1
   micromolar (pM). Certain compounds of the invention had tumor cell-based activity EC50
   values less than about 1 micromolar (pM), for example against cell line BaF3, a murine
20 interleukin-3 dependent pro-B cell line, useful as a model system for assessing both the potency
   and downstream signaling of kinase oncogenes ("Ba/F3 cells and their use in kinase drug

   discovery", Warmuth, M, et al, (January 2007) Current Opinion in Oncology, Vol 19(l):55-60),
   and against MM1.S, a multiple myeloma cell line, useful as a model system for assessing the
   efficacy of Pim inhibitors in the treatment of multiple myeloma patients (Greenstein et al (2003)
   Exper. Hematol. 31(4):271-282). Formula I compounds having Ki/IC50 /EC50 of less than 1 pM
 5 in assays described in Examples 901 and 902, may be useful therapeutically as Pim kinase
   inhibitors (Pim- 1, Pim-2 and/or Pim-3).
            hERG (the human Ether-i-go-go-RelatedGene) is a gene (KCNH2) that codes for a
   protein known as Kv11.1, the alpha subunit of a potassium ion channel. This ion channel
   (sometimes simply denoted as 'hERG') is best known for its contribution to the electrical activity
10 of the heart that coordinates the heart's beating (i.e., the hERG channel mediates the repolarizing
   IJ current in the cardiac action potential). When this channel's ability to conduct electrical
   current across the cell membrane is inhibited or compromised, either by application of drugs or
   by rare mutations in some families (Hedley PL et al. (2009) Human Mutation 30 (11): 1486-511),
   it can result in a potentially fatal disorder called long QT syndrome; a number of clinically
15 successful drugs in the market have had the tendency to inhibit hERG, and create a concomitant
   risk of sudden death, as a side-effect, which has made hERG inhibition an important antitarget
   that must be avoided during drug development (Sanguinetti MC, Tristani-Firouzi M (March
   2006) Nature 440(7083): 463-9). hERG has also been associated with modulating the functions
   of some cells of the nervous system (Chiesa N et al (June 1997) J. Physiol. (Lond.). 501 ( Pt 2)
20 (2): 313-8; Overholt JL, et al (2000) Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 475: 241-8) and with establishing and
   maintaining cancer-like features in leukemic cells. hERG assays were conducted according to
   Example 903.
            Exemplary Formula I compounds in Tables la, lb, and Ic were made, characterized, and
   tested for inhibition of Pim kinase according to the methods of this invention, and have the
25 following structures and corresponding names (ChemBioDraw Ultra, Version 11.0,
   CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge MA). Some compounds with chiral atoms in Table 1 have not
   been fully characterized as to stereochemistry. A tentative assignment of stereochemistry or
   stereochemical relationship to other groups may be depicted in the structures. Means of
   separation of stereoisomers and characterization data are given in the Examples.

            Administration of the compounds of the present invention (hereinafter the "active
   compound(s)") can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site
35 of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection

       WO 2014/048939                               - 90 -                       PCT/EP2013/069892
   (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical,
   inhalation and rectal administration.
            The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being
   treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the
 5 compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in
   the range of about 0.00 1 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to
   about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about
   0.05 to 7 g/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below
   the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger
10 doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses
   are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.
            The active compound may be applied as a sole therapy or in combination with one or
   more chemotherapeutic agents, for example those described herein. Such conjoint treatment may
   be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual
15 components of treatment.
            The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral
   administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution,
   suspension for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion for topical
   administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The
20 pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of
   precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical
   carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In
   addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.
            Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of Formula I
25 compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose
   solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.
            Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various
   organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional
   ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration,
30 tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various
   disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents
   such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate,
   sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a
   similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials,
35 therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When

   aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein
   may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if
   desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol,
   propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.
 5          Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of
   active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. For examples, see
   Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Ester, Pa., 15.sup.th Edition
   (1975).
   ADMINISTRATION OF FORMULA I COMPOUNDS
10          The Formula I compounds of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate
   to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous,
   intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal,
   rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary
   and intranasal. For local immunosuppressive treatment, the compounds may be administered by
15 intralesional administration, including perfusing or otherwise contacting the graft with the
   inhibitor before transplantation. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for
   example the condition of the recipient. Where the compound is administered orally, it may be
   formulated as a pill, capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.
   Where the compound is administered parenterally, it may be formulated with a pharmaceutically
20 acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form, as detailed below.
            A dose to treat human patients may range from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of
   Formula I compound. A typical dose may be about 100 mg to about 300 mg of the compound.
   A dose may be administered once a day (QID), twice per day (BID), or more frequently,
   depending on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including absorption,
25 distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the particular compound. In addition, toxicity factors
   may influence the dosage and administration regimen. When administered orally, the pill,
   capsule, or tablet may be ingested daily or less frequently for a specified period of time. The
   regimen may be repeated for a number of cycles of therapy.

            Another aspect of this invention provides a compound of this invention for use in the
   treatment of the diseases or conditions described herein in a mammal, for example, a human,
   suffering from such disease or condition. Also provided is the use of a compound of this
   invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of the diseases and conditions
20 described herein in a warm-blooded animal, such as a mammal, for example a human, suffering
   from such disorder.
   PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS
            In order to use a Formula I compound for the therapeutic treatment (including
   prophylactic treatment) of mammals including humans, it is normally formulated in accordance
25 with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. According to this aspect
   of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of this
   invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.
            A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a Formula I compound and a carrier, diluent
   or excipient. Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art
30 and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and/or swellable polymers,
   hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like. The particular
   carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the
   compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on
   solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal.

       WO 2014/048939                               - 93 -                      PCT/EP2013/069892
   In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic
   solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol,
   propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The
   formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents,
 5 lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents,
   glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other
   known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present
   invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the
   pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).
10          The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures.
   For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form
   of the Formula I compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known
   complexation agent) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the
   excipients described above. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into
15 pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable
   patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.
            The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a
   variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an
   article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical
20 formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well known to those skilled in the art
   and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal
   cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent
   indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon
   a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate
25 warnings.
            Pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared
   for various routes and types of administration. For example, a compound of Formula I having
   the desired degree of purity may optionally be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents,
   carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16 edition, Osol,
30 A. Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, milled powder, or an aqueous solution.
   Formulation may be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at
   the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non
   toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation
   depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but may range from
35 about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at pH 5 is a suitable embodiment.

       WO 2014/048939                               - 94 -                      PCT/EP2013/069892
           The compound of this invention for use herein is preferably sterile. In particular,
   formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. Such sterilization is readily
   accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.
           The compound ordinarily can be stored as a solid composition, a lyophilized formulation
 5 or as an aqueous solution.
           The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising a Formula I compound
   will be formulated, dosed and administered in a fashion, i.e., amounts, concentrations, schedules,
   course, vehicles and route of administration, consistent with good medical practice. Factors for
   consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal
10 being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of
   delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other
   factors known to medical practitioners. The "therapeutically effective amount" of the compound
   to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount
   necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the coagulation factor mediated disorder. Such amount
15 is preferably below the amount that is toxic to the host or renders the host significantly more
   susceptible to bleeding.
           As a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the Formula I
   compound administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.0 1-100 mg/kg,
   namely about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of
20 compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day.
           Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the
   dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other
   organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as
   octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride,
25 benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl
   paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight
   (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or
   immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as
   glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and
30 other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA;
   sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium;
   metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEENTM,
   PLURONICSTM or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also
   be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by
35 interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and

       WO 2014/048939                               - 95 -                      PCT/EP2013/069892
   poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for
   example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules)
   or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences
   16f edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).
 5          Sustained-release preparations of Formula I compounds may be prepared. Suitable
   examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic
   polymers containing a compound of Formula I, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles,
   e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters,
   hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides
10 (US 3773919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable
   ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON
   DEPOTTM (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and
   leuprolide acetate) and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.
            The formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The
15 formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of
   the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are
   found in Remington's PharmaceuticalSciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA). Such
   methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which
   constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by
20 uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or
   finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
            Formulations of a compound of Formula I suitable for oral administration may be
   prepared as discrete units such as pills, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a
   predetermined amount of a compound of Formula I.
25          Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active
   ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder,
   lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be
   made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened
   with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are
30 formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom.
            Tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules,
   emulsions, hard or soft capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared for oral
   use. Formulations of compounds of Formula I intended for oral use may be prepared according
   to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such
35 compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents,

   coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets
   containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable
   excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be,
   for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium
 5 phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding
   agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate,
   stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including
   microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and
   thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such
10 as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.
           For treatment of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations
   are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an
   amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active
   ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base.
15 Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream
   base.
           If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an
   alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol,
   sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The
20 topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or
   penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such
   dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs.
           The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known
   ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it desirably
25 comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or oil, or with both a fat and an oil.
   Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts
   as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s)
   with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with
   the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed
30 phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the
   formulation of the invention include Tween@ 60, Span@ 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol,
   myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.
           Aqueous suspensions of Formula I compounds contain the active materials in admixture
   with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a
35 suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone,

       WO 2014/048939                                - 97 -                      PCT/EP2013/069892
   methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum
   tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring
   phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g.,
   polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic
 5 alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a
   partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan
   monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl
   or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and
   one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.
10          The pharmaceutical compositions of compounds of Formula I may be in the form of a
   sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This
   suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or
   wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable
   preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally
15 acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized
   powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's
   solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally
   be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be
   employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid
20 may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.
            The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to
   produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode
   of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to
   humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an
25 appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about
   95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be
   prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous
   solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500       g of the active
   ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about
30 30 mL/hr can occur.
            Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous
   sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes
   which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and
   non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.

            Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein
   the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent
   for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a
   concentration of about 0.5 to 20% w/w, for example about 0.5 to 10% w/w, for example about
 5 1.5% w/w.
            Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges
   comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth;
   pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose
   and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.
10          Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable
   base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.
            Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for
   example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and
   500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is
15 administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so
   as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the
   active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be
   prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents
   such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis disorders as described below.
20          Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons,
   creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient
   such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.
            The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example
   sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried lyophilizedd) condition requiring
25 only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior
   to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders,
   granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are
   those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate
   fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.
30          The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active
   ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are
   materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or
   gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible
   with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally,
35 orally or by any other desired route.

   COMBINATION THERAPY
            The compounds of Formula I may be employed alone or in combination with other
   therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as a
   hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula I is
 5 combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination
   therapy, with a second compound that has anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for
   treating a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The second compound of the pharmaceutical
   combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the
   compound of Formula I such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are
10 suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one
   embodiment, a composition of this invention comprises a compound of Formula I, in
   combination with a chemotherapeutic agent such as described herein.
            The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen.
   When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more
15 administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate
   formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either
   order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously
   exert their biological activities.
            Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and
20 may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other
   chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.
            The combination therapy may provide "synergy" and prove "synergistic", i.e., the effect
   achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that
   results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the
25 active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a
   combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate
   formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic
   effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by
   different injections in separate syringes, separate pills or capsules, or separate infusions. In
30 general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered
   sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more
   active ingredients are administered together.
            In a particular embodiment of anti-cancer therapy, a compound of Formula I, or a
   stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable
35 salt or prodrug thereof, may be combined with other chemotherapeutic, hormonal or antibody

       WO 2014/048939                               - 100 -                     PCT/EP2013/069892
   agents such as those described herein, as well as combined with surgical therapy and
   radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the
   administration of at least one compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer,
   tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, and the use
 5 of at least one other cancer treatment method. The amounts of the compound(s) of Formula I
   and the other pharmaceutically active chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of
   administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.
   METABOLITES OF FORMULA I COMPOUNDS
            Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of
10 Formula I described herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction,
   hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the
   like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of
   compounds of Formula I, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a
   compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic
15 product thereof.
            Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g., "C or 'H)
   isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g.,
   greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man,
   allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and
20 isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These
   products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies
   capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are
   determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis
   of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to
25 those skilled in the art. The metabolite products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo,
   may be useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.
   ARTICLES OF MANUFACTURE
            In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or "kit", containing
   materials useful for the treatment of the diseases and disorders described above is provided. The
30 kit comprises a container comprising a compound of Formula I. The kit may further comprise a
   label or package insert, on or associated with the container. The term "package insert" is used to
   refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that
   contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications
   and/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. Suitable containers include,

       WO 2014/048939                               - 101 -                     PCT/EP2013/069892
   for example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The container may be formed from a
   variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container may hold a compound of Formula I or
   II or a formulation thereof which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile
   access port (for example, the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a
 5 stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the
   composition is a compound of Formula I. The label or package insert indicates that the
   composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. In addition, the label or
   package insert may indicate that the patient to be treated is one having a disorder such as a
   hyperproliferative disorder, neurodegeneration, cardiac hypertrophy, pain, migraine or a
10 neurotraumatic disease or event. In one embodiment, the label or package inserts indicates that
   the composition comprising a compound of Formula I can be used to treat a disorder resulting
   from abnormal cell growth. The label or package insert may also indicate that the composition
   can be used to treat other disorders. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture
   may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such
15 as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and
   dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user
   standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.
            The kit may further comprise directions for the administration of the compound of
   Formula I and, if present, the second pharmaceutical formulation. For example, if the kit
20 comprises a first composition comprising a compound of Formula I, and a second
   pharmaceutical formulation, the kit may further comprise directions for the simultaneous,
   sequential or separate administration of the first and second pharmaceutical compositions to a
   patient in need thereof.
            In another embodiment, the kits are suitable for the delivery of solid oral forms of a
25 compound of Formula I, such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably includes a number of
   unit dosages. Such kits can include a card having the dosages oriented in the order of their
   intended use. An example of such a kit is a "blister pack". Blister packs are well known in the
   packaging industry and are widely used for packaging pharmaceutical unit dosage forms. If
   desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example in the form of numbers, letters, or other
30 markings or with a calendar insert, designating the days in the treatment schedule in which the
   dosages can be administered.
            According to one embodiment, a kit may comprise (a) a first container with a compound
   of Formula I contained therein; and optionally (b) a second container with a second
   pharmaceutical formulation contained therein, wherein the second pharmaceutical formulation
35 comprises a second compound with anti-hyperproliferative activity. Alternatively, or

       WO 2014/048939                             - 102 -                      PCT/EP2013/069892
   additionally, the kit may further comprise a third container comprising a pharmaceutically
   acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline,
   Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a
   commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.
 5          In certain other embodiments wherein the kit comprises a composition of Formula I and a
   second therapeutic agent, the kit may comprise a container for containing the separate
   compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet, however, the separate
   compositions may also be contained within a single, undivided container. Typically, the kit
   comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is
10 particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different
   dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when
   titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.
   PREPARATION OF FORMULA I COMPOUNDS
            Compounds of Formula I may be synthesized by synthetic routes that include processes
15 analogous to those well-known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description
   contained herein, and those for other heterocycles described in: Comprehensive Heterocyclic
   Chemistry II, Editors Katritzky and Rees, Elsevier, 1997, e.g. Volume 3; Liebigs Annalen der
   Chemie, (9):1910-16, (1985); Helvetica Chimica Acta, 41:1052-60, (1958); Arzneimittel
   Forschung, 40(12):1328-31, (1990), each of which are expressly incorporated by reference.
20 Starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals
   (Milwaukee, WI) or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art
   (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, Reagents for
   OrganicSynthesis, v. 1-23, Wiley, N.Y. (1967-2006 ed.), or Beilsteins Handbuch der
   organischen Chemie, 4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available
25 via the Beilstein online database).
            Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and
   deprotection) useful in synthesizing Formula I compounds and necessary reagents and
   intermediates are known in the art and include, for example, those described in R. Larock,
   Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (1989); T. W. Greene and P. G .M.
30 Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1999); and L.
   Paquette, ed., Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1995) and
   subsequent editions thereof.
            Compounds of Formula I may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at
   least 2, for example 5 to 1,000 compounds, or 10 to 100 compounds. Libraries of compounds of

       WO 2014/048939                              - 103  -                     PCT/EP2013/069892
   Formula I may be prepared by a combinatorial 'split and mix' approach or by multiple parallel
   syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry, by procedures known to those
   skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a
   compound library comprising at least 2 compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
 5         The General Procedures and Examples provide exemplary methods for preparing
   Formula I compounds. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be
   used to synthesize the Formula I compounds. Although specific starting materials and reagents
   are depicted and discussed in the Figures, General Procedures, and Examples, other starting
   materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and/or reaction
10 conditions. In addition, many of the exemplary compounds prepared by the described methods
   can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to
   those skilled in the art.
           In preparing compounds of Formulas I, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary
   or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary
15 depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation
   methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl
   (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). The need for
   such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of
   protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John
20 Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991.
   METHODS OF SEPARATION
           In the methods of preparing Formula I compounds, it may be advantageous to separate
   reaction products from one another and/or from starting materials. The desired products of each
   step or series of steps is separated and/or purified to the desired degree of homogeneity by the
25 techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction,
   crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography.
   Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and
   normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid
   chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB)
30 and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin
   layer and flash chromatography.
           Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent
   selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product, unreacted starting material,
   reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as

       WO 2014/048939                              - 104 -                      PCT/EP2013/069892
   activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents
   can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in the case of an acidic material, binding
   reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers,
   liquid/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the like. Selection of appropriate methods of
 5 separation depends on the nature of the materials involved, such as, boiling point and molecular
   weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in
   chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the
   like.
            Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis
10 of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as
   by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by
   converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an
   appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's
   acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual
15 diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the
   present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of
   this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.
            A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be
   obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers
20 using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. "Stereochemistry of Organic
   Compounds," John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J.
   Chromatogr., 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be
   separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric
   salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2)
25 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the
   diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially
   pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions, such as on a chiral adsorbent by
   HPLC or SFC (Supercritical Fluid Chromatography), see White and Burnett (2005) Jour. of
   Chrom. A1074:175-185; and "Drug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology,"
30 (1993) Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York).
            Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically
   pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, ax-methyl-p-phenylethylamine
   (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as
   carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by
35 fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of

   amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid,
   tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.
            Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer
   of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. and Wilen, S. "Stereochemistry of
 5 Organic Compounds", John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can
   be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing
   reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and
   hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity
   involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (-) menthyl chloroformate in the
10 presence of base, or Mosher ester, a-methoxy-a-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. J.
   Org. Chem. (1982) 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the IH NMR spectrum for
   the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of
   atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase
   chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO
15 96/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by
   chromatography using a chiral stationary phase ("Chiral Liquid Chromatography" (1989) W. J.
   Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, J. Chromatogr., (1990) 513:375-378).
   Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other
   chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.

            Scheme 1 shows an exemplary synthesis of 4-aminopyrazole compounds 5. 4-Nitro-1H
   pyrazole 1 is converted to 1-substituted-4-nitro-1H-pyrazole compounds 2 by treatment with a
   base in a suitable solvent or neat, followed by the addition of an alkylation reagent such as
   dimethyl sulfate. Compound 2 may be converted to 5-chloro-4-nitro-1H-pyrazole 3 by treatment
 5 with a base such as lithium hexamethyldisilazide, or nBuLi in a suitable solvent such as THF
   (tetrahydrofuran) at an appropriate temperature, such as -78 'C. Compound 3 may be converted
   to compound 4 by direct SnAr, or transition metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions, e.g. Suzuki,

   1.5 equivalents of an aryl, heterocyclyl or heteroaryl boronic acid or ester reagent and an excess
   of aqueous sodium carbonate in acetonitrile. A catalytic amount, or more, of a low valent
   palladium reagent, such as bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride, is added. A variety
 5 of boronic acids or boronic esters can be used. Boronic esters include pinacol esters (4,4,5,5
   tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl). Also, a nitrogen atom of a heterocycle or heteroaryl may
   be protected, for example as N-THP. In some cases potassium acetate is used in place of sodium
   carbonate to adjust the pH of the aqueous layer. The reaction may be heated to about 140-150 'C
   under pressure in a microwave reactor such as the Biotage Optimizer (Biotage, Inc.) for 10 to 30
10 minutes. The contents are extracted with ethyl acetate, or another organic solvent. After
   evaporation of the organic layer the Suzuki coupling product may be purified on silica or by
   reverse phase HPLC.

           Example 901 Pim kinase binding activity
           PIM-1, -2, and -3 enzymes were generated as fusion proteins expressed in bacteria and
   purified by IMAC column chromatography (Sun, X., Chiu, J.F., and He, Q.Y. (2005) Expert Rev.
10 Proteomics, 2:649-657). A fluorescent-labeled Pim-specific peptide substrate, was custom
   synthesized by American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA). Reaction Buffer contained 10
   mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.0 1% Tween 20, 2 mM DTT. Termination Buffer
   contained 190 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.015% Brij-35, 0.2% Coating Reagent 3 (Caliper Life
   Sciences, Hopkinton, MA), 20 mM EDTA. Separation Buffer contained 100 mM HEPES, pH
15 7.2, 0.015% Brij-35, 0.1% Coating Reagent 3, 1:200 Coating Reagent 8 (Caliper Life Sciences,
   Hopkinton, MA), 10 mM EDTA and 5% DMSO.
           PIM reactions were carried out in a final volume of 10 pL per well in a 384-well plate. A
   standard enzymatic reaction, initiated by the addition of 5 pL 2X ATP and test compound to 5
   pL of 2X enzyme and FAM-peptide, contained 20 pM PIM1, 50 pM PIM2, or 55 pM PIM3, 1
20 pM FAM-peptide, and 10 pM ATP, in Reaction Buffer. After 90 minutes of incubation at room
   temperature, the phosphorylation reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 P L Termination
   Buffer. The product and substrate in each independent reaction were separated on a 12-sipper
   microfluidic chip (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA) run on a Caliper LC3000* (Caliper
   Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). The separation of product and substrate was optimized by
25 choosing voltages and pressure using Caliper's Optimizer software (Hopkinton, MA). The
   separation conditions used a downstream voltage of -500V, an upstream voltage of -2150V, and
   a screening pressure of -1.2 psi. The product and substrate fluorophore were excited at 488 nm
   and detected at 530 nm. Substrate conversion was calculated from the electropherogram using
   HTS Well Analyzer software (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). Ki values for the test
30 compound were calculated. See Table 1 for representative PIMI LC3K Ki in micromolar values
   of exemplary compounds.

   BaF3 PIM2 cells, and MM1.S (multiple myeloma) cells were seeded at 2k/well, 5k/well, 5k/well,
   and 10k/well respectively, in a 384-well plate, at 45 pL/well. Test compound was added at 5
   pL/well. BaF3 cells (parental and transfected) were incubated overnight, while MM1.S cells
   were incubated for 72 hours at 37 'C, 5% CO 2. CELL TITER GLO@ Reagent (Promega) was

            The in vitro potential for hERG potassium channel current inhibition was assessed
   according to the study site standard procedures (ChanTest, Cleveland, OH). In brief, hERG
   inhibition (% max) was determined in hERG-expressing HEK-293 cells (n=2 /concentration)
   using the automated PatchXpress 7000A system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) for 5
15 minutes after adding the test article. IC5o values were calculated based on hERG inhibition at test
   article concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 30, and 100 tiM.
            hERG IC5o and IC20 values of certain compounds of the invention were measured and
   compared with a compound, 5-amino-N-(5-((4R,5R)-4-amino-5-fluoroazepan-1-yl)-1-methyl
   1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2,6-difluorophenyl)thiazole-4-carboxamide, No. 139, from a series of PIM
20 inhibitors where corresponding R2 is an N-linked heterocyclyl or C-linked carbocyclyl moiety
   (US 2013/0079321). The IC5o/20 values for this compound No. 139 of US 2013/0079321 were
   2.7 and 0.7 micromolar (pM), respectively. In contrast, the IC5o/20 values for compound No. 154,
   5-Amino-N-[5-[(2S,5R,6R)-5-amino-6-methoxy-oxepan-2-yl]-1-methyl-pyrazol-4-yl]-2-(2,6
   difluorophenyl)thiazole-4-carboxamide, from Table lb of the present invention were 9.1 and 1.6
25 micromolar, respectively. The IC5o/20 values for compound No. 177, 5-Amino-N-[5-[(2S,5R,6S)-

                                                       - 291
   5-amino-6-fluoro-oxepan-2-yl] -1 -methyl-pyrazol-4-yl]-2-(2,6-difluorophenyl)thiazole-4
   carboxamide from Table Ib of the present invention were 16 and 3.9 micromolar, respectively.
   This hERG data indicates the compounds of the invention present diminished susceptibility to
   QTc prolongation. An excessively prolonged QTc-interval may lead to serious ventricular
 5 arrhythmia and sudden death (De Bruin, M.L et al (2005) European Heart Journal, 26:590-597;
   Redfern, W.S. et al (2003) Cardiovascular Research, 58:32-45).
