   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming machine
35 having a plurality of mechanical reels, a video display
   and a game controller arranged to control the video
   display to add to the symbols of the mechanical reels
                                             10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                 6
   which are displayed for use in evaluation of the game
   outcome. In an embodiment, the video display extends the
   number of symbols display by each mechanical reel to
   provide an extra row of symbols. In an embodiment the
 5 video display displays additional symbols when a video
   symbol condition is met.
   A stand alone gaming machine 10 is illustrated in Figure
   1.  The gaming machine 10 includes a console 12 having
10 five mechanical reels 30, each carrying a plurality of
   symbols at respective ones of a plurality of symbol
   display positions and a video display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of symbols at video symbol
   display positions.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
15 houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
20 mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.  Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
25 value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
30 other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
35 credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
                                              10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                 7
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
 5 panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
10 display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit.   The top box 26 may also include a display,
   for example a video display unit, which may be of the same
15 type as the display 14, or of a different type.
   Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the gaming machine of
   Figure 1.
20 The gaming machine 10 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.   Processor 102
25 processes game play instructions made by the player in
   accordance with game play rules and outputs game play
   outcomes.   Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 103 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
30 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
35 provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory and generating outputs (for example on
                                              10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                  8
   the display).   Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also known to
   provide a specific purpose processor using an application
 5 specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable
   gate array   (FPGA).
   Typically, the gaming machine 10 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
10 type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
15 player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 10.    The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
20 for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.   A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
25
   In the example shown in Figure 2, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including video display 14, a touch screen
   and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play mechanism),
30 a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer 109, a bill
   acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110, a coin output
   mechanism 111 and mechanical reels 30.    Typically, the
   mechanical reels are driven by stepper motors           (not shown)
   to enable accurate control of the stopping position of
35 each reel.
   Additional hardware may be included as part of the gaming
                                               10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                9
   machine 10, or hardware may be omitted as required for the
   specific implementation.  For example, while buttons or
   touch screens are typically used in gaming machines to
   allow a player to place a wager and initiate a play of a
 5 game, any input device that enables the player to input
   game play instructions may be used.   For example, in some
   gaming machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a
   play of the game.
10 In addition, the gaming machine 10 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
15 database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                   In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
20 communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
25 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.               The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.               The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
30 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
35 It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 10 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 14,107,108,109,110,111 to be provided
                                              10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                10
   remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 4 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
 5 network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 4, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
10 machine 10 shown in Figures 1 to 3 or may have simplified
   functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
15
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
20 associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
25 part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game.  With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller.   A database
30 management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.   Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
35 accounting functions for the Jackpot game.       A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
                                              10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                11
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
 5 the game server 205 provides the game controller.                The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
10 could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
15 and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
20 example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
25
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
30
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
35 may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
                                             10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                 12
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
 5 may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of  the gaming machine
10 As described above, and shown in further detail in Figure
   5, the gaming machine has five mechanical reels 30, and a
   video display 14 disposed adjacent and below the
   mechanical reels 30.   Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that in other embodiments, the video display
15 could be disposed above the reels or video displays could
   be disposed both above and below the reels.         It will be
   appreciated that each of the mechanical reels has a
   plurality of symbol display positions arranged around the
   periphery at which symbols are disposed.     In most
20 implementations, there will be a single symbol at each
   symbol display position but as is known in the art, it is
   possible for there to be more than one symbol at a symbol
   display position depending on the design of the game being
   played on the gaming machine.
25
   As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, due
   to the curvature of the mechanical reels, a limited number
   of symbol display positions, typically three, are viewable
   by a player and in prior art implementations, these
30 symbols are those which are eligible for use in evaluation
   of the outcome of the game   (depending on the player's
   selections as part of the player's wager and/or the rules
   of the game).  In the embodiments, the video display is
   used to add one or more symbols of those found on the
35 mechanical reels to one or more of the reels at video
   symbol display positions.   In some embodiments, the number
   and timing of added video symbols can depend on factors
                                              10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                 13
   such as the player's wager, a trigger occurring in the
   game, the nature of the trigger etc.    Figure 6 shows one
   example, where each of the five mechanical reels has three
   viewable symbol display positions 31,32,33 when stopped
 5 and the video display 14 is used to display a single video
   symbol display position 40 for each of the reels, thereby
   adding one symbol to each reel.
   In one embodiment, of a gaming machine, the player
10 operates the buttons and/or touch screen 107 interface to
   specify a wager and hence the win entitlement which will
   be evaluated for this play of the game and initiates a
   play of the game.   Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that there may be more than one game round in a
15 play of a gaming machine such as is the case when a series
   of free spins is awarded.   The outcome of a game round may
   be no win, a win  (for example from a winning combination
   of symbols), a contribution towards a win accrued over a
   plurality of game rounds, a trigger condition occurring
20 etc.  A game round involves at least one of the reels
   being "spun" - e.g. new symbols of the reels are selected
   for display at the display positions and the reel is
   either spun to a stop.
25 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a player's
   win entitlement will vary from game to game dependent on
   player selections.   In most spinning reel games, it is
   typical for the player's entitlement to be affected by the
   amount they wager and selections they make (i.e. the
30 nature of the wager) .  For example, a player's           win
   entitlement may be based on how many lines they play in
   each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game   (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
35 and how much they wager per line.    In the embodiment, each
   win line selectable by the player is formed by a
   combination of symbol display positions, one from each of
                                                 10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                 14
   the five mechanical reels, the symbol display positions
   being located relative to one another such that they form
   a line and the video display symbol positions are added
   together with one or more additional win lines when an add
 5 video symbol condition is met.   In one example, the add
   video symbol condition is that the player has placed an
   ante bet and the video display symbols are added                for each
   play of the game where the player places the ante bet.                        In
   another example, the symbol display positions are used as
10 part of a feature game such as a free game series, which
   may be triggered from the base game.   In this example,
   symbols of the mechanical reels are used in the base game
   and the video symbols display positions are added during
   the feature game.   In one variant of this example, the
15 player must satisfy an eligibility criterion to be
   eligible for the added video display symbol positions such
   as having wagered the maximum number of lines or placed
   the maximum wager on the base game.   Other eligibility
   criteria may be applied, for example that the player has
20 played sufficient games, or the player is a member of a
   loyalty program.
   In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
25 example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   player's selection of pay lines and are an inherent part
   of the win entitlement.
   Once the player places their wager, the game controller
30 carries out a play of the game.   In Figure 7, the
   processor 102 of game controller 100 is shown implementing
   a number of modules based on program code and data stored
   in memory 103.   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
   that various of the modules could be implemented in some
35 other way, for example by a dedicated circuit.
   These modules include the outcome generator 810 which
                                              10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                 15
   operates in response to the player's placement of a wager
   and initiates a play of the game and generates a game
   outcome which will then be evaluated by award evaluator
   813.  The first part of forming the game outcome is for a
 5 stop determiner 811 to select a subset of symbols of the
   mechanical reels by selecting stopping positions for each
   of the reels  (the stop position being the centre of the
   three rows of symbol display positions).
10 It will be appreciated that the symbols arranged around
   the reel specify a sequence of symbols for each reel such
   that the stop determiner 811 selects a subset of the
   symbols of each reel to be stopped in the viewable symbol
   display positions of each mechanical reel by selecting a
15 stopping position in the sequence for each reel.               In the
   embodiment, the stop positions are determined at random by
   the stop determiner selecting stopping positions for each
   reel using numbers obtained from RNG 113.     In an
   alternative embodiment, a probability table stored in
20 memory 64 is used to vary the odds of a particular stop
   position being selected.
   In the embodiment, the video symbol rule data 803
   specifies that the player must have placed video reel
25 activator determines whether the player's wager includes
   an ante bet.   If there is no ante bet, the above process
   concludes the generation of a game outcome and the
   mechanical reels are controlled by mechanical reel
   controller 816 to stop at the selected stop positions.
30 The mechanical reel evaluator 813A of outcome evaluator
   813 evaluates the generated outcome with reference to the
   win lines specified by the player, the symbols which are
   on those win lines, and the pay table 802 stored in memory
   103.
35
   When there is an ante bet, the video symbol activator 814
   determines that a row of video symbols is to be added and
                                             10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                 16
   activates video symbol adder 813.    In the embodiment, the
   video reel adder 813 determines from the selected stop
   positions of each reel and reel data which specifies the
   symbol sequence of each reel, which symbol of each reel is
 5 next to symbol position 33 in the sequence and causes the
   video display controller 815 to display a video symbol on
   video display 14 at the video symbol display position 40
   below the bottom mechanical reel symbol at position 33.
   For example, if part of the sequence of symbols on one if
10               J,K,Q,10,A,A... and the mechanical reel,
   the reels is ...
   displays Q,10,A, in positions 31,32 and 33 respectively
   the video symbol adder causes the display 14 to display a
   further A symbol at position 40 for the respective reel.
15 The outcome generator 810 passes data to the outcome
   evaluator 813 which specifies the selected symbols
   displayed on the mechanical reels 30 and the video display
   14.  The combined reel evaluator 814A determines whether
   any awards are payable based on the win lines which apply
20 when the video symbols are added, the selected symbols and
   the pay table 802.   Person skilled in the art will
   appreciate that the pay table may be modified or different
   when the video symbol positions are populated.            Any awards
   are displayed to the player and meters 104 are updated.
25 In an advantageous embodiment, at least one added win line
   passes through at least one mechanical reel symbol and at
   least one video symbol.
   In an alternative embodiment, the outcome evaluator 813
30 determines that a trigger condition is met by the symbols
   of the base game and advises the video symbol activator
   814 to cause the video symbol adder 812 to operate.                    In
   one example, if a trigger condition is met, the video
   symbols are added to the current play of the base game and
35 the symbols are re-evaluated.    In another example, the
   trigger condition triggers a feature game having a number
   of free games and video symbols are added for each of the
                                               10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                17
   free games.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that other
   techniques may be used to trigger adding of the video
 5 symbol, for example, the video symbol activator 814 may
   conduct a random determination each time the game is
   played to determine whether to add the video symbols.
   In another embodiment, the player obtains a win
10 entitlement by selecting a number of reels to play and an
   amount to wager per reel in the same manner as in games
   which are marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by
   Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd.   In the embodiment,
   the selection of the reel means that each displayed symbol
15 of the reel can be substituted for a symbol at one or more
   designated display positions.   In other words, all symbols
   displayed at symbol display positions corresponding to a
   selected reel can be used to form symbol combinations with
   symbols displayed at a designated,  symbol display
20 positions of the other reels.   For example, if there are
   five reels and three symbol display positions for each
   reel such that the symbol display positions comprise three
   rows of five symbol display positions, the symbols
   displayed in the centre row are used for non-selected
25 reels.  As a result, the total number of ways to win is
   determined by multiplying the number of active display
   positions of each reel, the active display positions being
   all display positions of each selected reel and the
   designated display position of the non-selected reels.                       As
30 a result, for five reels and fifteen display positions
   there are 243 ways to win.
   Such embodiments are suited to implementations where there
   are a plurality of different video symbol conditions and
35 different numbers of video symbol positions are activated
   depending on which video symbol condition is met.                 For
   example, where there are five mechanical reels, there may
                                              10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                 18
   be five different levels of ante bet and one to five video
   symbol positions 40 are added depending on the level that
   is bet.   A further condition of such an embodiment may be
   that the player is also playing all reels.      In such an
 5 example, if the player places the third level of ante bet,
   symbols are displayed at symbol positions 40A,40B,40C such
   that the player has 4*4*4*3*3 = 576 ways to win.               In
   another example, the player may be entitled to place an
   ant bet irrespective of whether they are playing all
10 reels.  In such an example, the player may play one reel
   and the ante bet for three reels giving 4*2*2*1*1 = 16
   ways to win.
   In an example where the video symbol condition is that a
15 trigger condition has to occur to trigger a feature game
   having a series of free games, there may be different
   triggers which add different numbers of video symbols.
   For example, three scattered symbols may add one video
   symbol in each free game, four scattered symbols may add
20 three video symbols in each free game, and five scattered
   symbols may add five video symbols in each free game.
   The method of the embodiment is summarised in relation to
   Figure 8.   The method 900 involves rotating the mechanical
25 reels 910 and determining 920 whether a video reel
   condition is met.   If a video reel condition is met, the
   method involves displaying 930 a video symbol or symbols
   in addition to the stopped symbols on the mechanical
   reels.  The method concludes by evaluating the displayed
30 symbols 940 irrespective of whether the only symbols are
   on the mechanical reels or also include the symbols on the
   video reels.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
35 above description of the system.   It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   digitally by a processor.   Persons skilled in the art will
                                             10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                 19
   also appreciate that the method could be embodied in
   program code.   The program code could be supplied in a
   number of ways, for example on a tangible computer
   readable storage medium, such as a disc or a memory (for
 5 example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as a
   data signal  (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that
   program code provides a series of instructions executable
   by the processor.
10
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
15 embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.
   For example, persons skilled in the art will appreciate
   that there are a number of further variations may be
20 achieved.   In one such variation the symbols which are
   added as video symbols could be selected at random using a
   random number generated 113 by the video symbol adder 812
   from the symbols 801 of the mechanical reels.
25 Further, rather than examples described above where at
   most a single video symbol is added for each mechanical
   reel, two or more symbols can be added per reel and/or
   different numbers of symbols can be added for each reel.
   An embodiment where two symbols are added for each reel is
30 suited in particular to embodiments where there are
   displays above and below the mechanical reels.
   It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, a first
   number of video symbols could be added in response to a
35 first trigger occurring and the second number could be
   added in response to the second trigger condition being
   met.
                                             10352713_1 (GHMatters) P83365.AU.3 8/06/18

                                20
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the same
   technique can be used with three mechanical reels or other
   numbers of reels.
 5
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that an
   advantage of the invention is that it increases the
   potential for interesting game complexity in mechanical
   reel-based games without drastically altering the
10 appearance of the game and as such the manner in which the
   games behave will be such that players who prefer
   mechanical reel based games will not be put off by the
   video aspects of the game.
15 It is particularly advantageous to, in effect, extend the
   reels as this does not affect the trust that the player
   has for a mechanical machine because they can physically
   see that the correct symbol(s) have been added by the
   video symbols.  For example, as the reel slows, the player
20 will see which symbol passed position 33 immediately
   before stopping and therefore will trust its presence at
   position 40.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred
25 to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission
   that the prior art forms a part of the common general
   knowledge in the art in any country.
   In the claims which follow and in the preceding
30 description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
   "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
   i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but
35 not to preclude the presence or addition of further
   features in various embodiments of the invention.
