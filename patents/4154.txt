ABSTRACT
Patent of Invention: Title "METHOD FOR PACKAGING FUNGAL SPORES IN A
MODIFIED ATMOSPHERE WITH A VIEW TO INCREASING THE SHELF LIFE OF
THE FUNGI".
The present invention relates to a packaging method for increasing the shelf life of
fungal spores and to the packaging that contains such spores. The packaging method
comprises the steps of pre-drying the spores to a water activity range viable for the
fungus of interest, followed by packing of the spores into gas- and water-vapour
impermeable packaging by means of the use of sachets, thereby providing an
atmosphere of low relative humidity and low oxygen content, followed by keeping of
the spores in the packaging for a certain period of time at the temperature suitable for
the spores prior to the exposure thereof to high temperatures.

           Title "METHOD       FOR PACKAGING FUNGAL SPORES IN A MODIFIED
   ATMOSPHERE WITH A VIEW TO INCREASING THE SHELF LIFE OF THE FUNGI".
           The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent
 5 application number <removed-apn>, which in turn is a divisional application from
   Australian patent application number 2011284816, the entire disclosure of which is
   incorporated herein by reference.
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
10         The present invention relates to methods for packaging fungal spores, such as
   entomopathogenic fungi of the genera Beauveria, Isaria, Lecanicillium, Nomuraea,
   Metarhizium and Trichoderma, to increase the shelf-life.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
15         Biological pesticides are an alternative to those obtained synthetically, because
   they    are   not    toxic to  humans.    Among      them   are  those  produced     from
   entomopathogenic fungi, whose spores are dehydrated in order to remain viable for
   extended periods (Moore et al. Effects of moisture content and temperature on
   storage of Metarhizium flavoride conidia. Biocontrol Science and Technology, v.6, p.
20 51-61).    Dehydration also    allows spores to survive in extreme environments
   characterized by dry heat, freezing and thawing, as well as acidic medium.
           For more than a century research has shown the interaction between fungi and
   agricultural pests. Such interaction promotes the development of crop plants through
   the elimination of their pathogens, insect pests and weeds. Such findings have
25 stimulated the use of mycopesticides to control agricultural pests. The production of
   biopesticides has increased and, among the causes of this increase are the demand
   of consumers for healthier foods, foods with less toxic waste, greater awareness of
   industry professionals regarding the use of agricultural pesticides, increasingly
   restrictive legislation on chemical pesticides and the need to use alternative products
30 in programs to manage the resistance to chemical.
           Fungi used in the biological control of pests and are used as pesticides are
   exposed to high temperatures, reaching 500C or more during transport or storage.
                                                 1

  This environmental factor affects the viability of fungal spores sensitive to temperature
  rises, such as Metarhizium, Beauveria, Lecanicillium and Trichoderma. The studies
  carried out to date were directed especially to storage of said fungi under refrigerated
  conditions or ambient temperatures below approximately 300C. Mycopesticides
5 experience rapid decline in viability during storage without
                                              1a

refrigeration and it compromises product acceptance in the market, causing
undesirable results in control of target pests.
       The study by Marques and Alves (Marques, E J., Alves, S.R. "Otimizagao de
formulagdes na preservagao de esporos de Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. e
Metarhizium     anisopliae    (Metschn.)     Sorok    em    diferentes   condigbes     de
armazenamento. [Optimization of formulations in the preservation of spores of
Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. and Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschn.) Sorok at
different storage conditions] Arquivos de Biologia e Tecnologia, v. 39, p. 861- 877,
1996) demonstrated that the viability of spores having moisture content of 15.5%
stored at 30'C can be greatly reduced in less than 30 days.
       The study of Sandhu et al. (Sandhu, S.S., Rajak, R.C., Agarwal, G.P. Studies
on prolonged storage of Beauveria bassiana conidia: effects of temperature and
relative humidity on conidial viability and virulence against chikpea borer. Helicoverpa
armigera. Biocontrol Science and Technology, v. 3, p.47-53, 1993) disclosed that the
lower the relative temperature and humidity of the equilibrium adopted during
storage, the longer the viability of Beauveria bassiaria spores is preserved.
        Great emphasis has been given to the storage of entomopathogenic fungi and
other species in environments with low or moderate temperature or in packages
which allow exchange between the atmospheres inside and outside, which do not
constitute suitable methods for storage at temperatures above 25'C.
        Document US 5,989,898 discloses the use of impermeable packages and
humidity and oxygen absorbers to generate atmosphere with relative humidity of less
than 10% and less than 5% oxygen. The document also proposes the elimination of
oxygen by vacuum packaging, or by applying nitrogen to the package with spores.
       The    microorganisms     used were      Beauveria bassiana and       Metarhizium
anisopliae for storage at 25C and 37C. Document US5989898 us es a surfactant
agent to reactivate the spores, differing from the present invention, which allows
storage at temperatures above 37C, using different nontoxic gases (CO 2 , H2 and
He) in substitution to oxygen, and adopts the observance of a pre-incubation period
of the packaged product. It is important that properly packaged mycopesticides be
exposed to suitable temperature conditions before being exposed to extreme
conditions to allow the levels of oxygen and moisture to reduce to suitable levels. WO
9,718,294 discloses a two- to six-fold extension of the shelf-life of fungal spores or
bacteria by reducing the oxygen content, associated or not with moisture reduction
                                             2

methods. However, the maximum storage temperature evaluated was 30'C, and
after only 70 days of storage the initial viability was reduced by 85% or more in the
treatment employing an 02 absorber sachet or in the treatment employing nitrogen.
The present invention allows for maintenance of viability of fungal spores stored at
higher temperatures, e.g. 40C over a period of three to six months.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
        It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for packing fungal
spores with a view to increasing their shelf life. The method comprises the steps of: i)
reducing the initial humidity content of the spores to a water activity range viable to
the organisms; ii) placing the spores into gas- and water-vapour-impermeable
packaging with at least one moisture and oxygen absorbing agent; iii) keeping of the
spores in the packaging for a minimum of two days at between 15 and 25'C,
preferably at 25C      or other temperature suitable fo r the organisms prior to the
exposure thereof to high temperatures.
        A second embodiment of the invention consists in providing spores of the
genera Beauveria, Isaria, Lecanicillium, Nomuraea, Metarhizium and Trichoderma,
with increased shelf-life.
        In another embodiment a sealed package is obtained comprising in the inside:
(i) viable spores of fungi; and (ii) an environment with reduced moisture content and
oxygen by the use of sachets and with an incubation period at a suitable temperature
in gas- and water-vapour-impermeable packaging.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
        The present invention relates to a storage method for increasing the shelf-life
of fungi under non-refrigerated conditions, particularly temperatures higher than or
                                              3

equal to 37C. By means of this methodology the spo res remain viable even when
subjected to high ambient temperatures.
        In the description that follows, certain terms are extensively used. Then
following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the invention.
        The term "modified atmosphere packaging" is herein defined as the process
where the packaging material inside said package is exposed to gas having a
different composition from atmospheric air, and may include techniques such as
injection of a certain gas or mixture of gases inside the packing or the use of
elements whose components react with components of the packaging. These
elements may be but are not limited to absorbing sachets, gas emitters or water
vapour absorbers.
        The term "viability" refers to the percentage of germination of spores
measured by a procedure which employs rapid rehydration, for being considered a
more suitable protocol for assessment of the conidial quality of mycopesticides.
        It is considered "viable temperature to the organism" one that does not cause
death or debilitation of conidia of certain species. In the present invention the viable
temperature is preferably close to 25'C.
        "Water activity" (a,) is defined as the ratio of the pressure of water vapour of a
material and the pressure of the vapour of pure water at the same temperature. It is a
measurement of the water contained in the material which is available for chemical
and biological reactions and, therefore, it is an important parameter in studies with
microorganisms.
        For the purposes of the present invention, "pre-incubation period" or
"equilibration period" is the time the spores are kept in the impermeable packaging
prior to exposure to high temperatures, this time is needed to reduce water activity to
values lower than 0.1, preferably between 0.02 and 0.03.
        The term "shelf-life" is defined as the time period in which a mycopesticide
may be stored in a specific temperature condition without considerable loss of the
attributes related to its efficacy. For mycopesticides packaged in non-hermetic
packages, storage relative humidity should be also considered. For the purposes of
the present invention, it is considered the period of 2 to 6 months the minimum
desirable shelf life for biological insecticides stored at temperatures close to 40'C.
Viability is the attribute most commonly used by pathologists to refer to the conidial
quality and should preferably be greater than 80%. Therefore, it was established as
                                              4

   shelf-life for mycoinsecticides the time required for the viability to be reduced to 80%
   at a determined temperature.
           The method of extending the shelf-life of spores of entomopathogenic fungi
   consists of the following steps:
 5          i) reducing the initial humidity content of the spores to very low levels of water
   activity viable for the organisms;
            ii) placing the spores into gas- and water-vapour impermeable packaging with
   one oxygen absorber agent and one humidity absorber agent, and these agents are
   preferably in the form of sachets. Optionally, a single sachet capable of absorbing
10 both oxygen and humidity can be used.
            iii) keeping the spores in the packaging for at least 2 days at a mild
   temperature prior to exposure to high temperatures.
            Reduction of the initial humidity content of hydrated spores can be achieved by
   drying during the step of harvesting the spores. The production of fungi normally
15 occurs in solid substrates, such as boiled rice and the like. Immediately after the
   process of producing fungi the colonized substrate can be conditioned in a room with
   low relative humidity, resulting in drying of conidia or using a chamber containing
   desiccant material until reduction of water activity to low values occurs.
           Such low values of water activity prior to filling are preferably lower than 0.1.
20 This material may be selected from the group of, but not being limited to: calcium
   sulfate and silica gel. For the reduction in humidity content in the drying chamber to
   occur it is necessary to wait for a period of two days or longer at lower temperatures,
   preferably between 15 and 250C, more preferably at about 250C or other temperature
   that does not affect spore viability, in which the dehydration of the fungus can occur
25 without weakening the fungal structure.
           The water activity of the organisms is significantly reduced after filling, and thus
   maintained through the use of gas- and water-vapour-impermeable packaging.
            In the packaging process of spores, as a means to provide proper atmosphere
   for the conservation thereof, preferably, sachets containing humidity and oxygen
30 absorber agents are used. These sachets can have only one function, that is, they are
   individually oxygen absorbers or humidity absorbers, or can have dual function when
   a single sachet acts as oxygen and humidity absorber. The sachets should generate
   nontoxic atmosphere to spores. As humidity absorbers, calcium sulfate or silica gel
   can be used. Useful Sachets for the present invention may be selected from
                                                  5

but are not limited to: RP-3A (oxygen and humidity absorber), Ageless@ ZPT 1000
(oxygen absorber), OxyFree TM        504A (oxygen     and carbon dioxide absorber),
OxyFree TM 504E (oxygen absorber and carbon dioxide generator) or anhydrous
calcium sulfate (humidity aborber). The impermeable packages used in the method
of the present invention can be, but are not limited to aluminized packages and glass.
        The result of using sachets for packaging is different, depending on the initial
water activity of the spores. When using only oxygen absorber sachet, the high
humidity of the spores affects the preservation of the same, reducing viability after
exposure to high temperature conditions. Humidity absorbers that do not release
water vapour when exposed to high temperatures should be used, such as DrieriteTM
anhydrous calcium sulfate compound, which only releases water vapour after
exposure to temperatures above 177C.
        The water activity of the final mycopesticide and the atmospheric composition
inside the package are essential factors for maintaining the viability of the spores
until use. The time spores are kept in the impermeable packaging prior to exposure
to high temperatures is referred to as pre-incubation or "equilibration period", this
time is needed to reduce water activity to values lower than 0.1, preferably between
0.02 and 0.03. For the fungus Beauveria bassiana, for example, the equilibration
period is usually two days for small amounts of spores or more, depending on factors
such as the size of the package, type of formulation, the amount of mycopesticide
and the amount and efficiency of the absorber sachets used.
        The fungi that can be packaged and reactivated in accordance with the
present invention include, but are not limited to, those of the genera Beauveria,
Isaria, Lecanicillium, Nomuraea, Metarhizium and Trichoderma.
        The impermeable packaging wherein fungal spores according to the invention
are packaged can be, but are not limited to: glass, laminate materials containing
aluminum or ceramic or other gas- and water-vapour-impermeable materials.
        The following examples have the purpose of illustrating and further elucidating
the invention and shall not be considered as a form of limiting the invention.
EXAMPLES
        Example 1: INJECTION OF DIFFERENT GASES IN GLASS PACKAGING
        Samples of Beauveria bassiana spores (0.6 g) were kept in hermetic glass
vials of 125 mL (Ball @, Jarden Corp., Muncie, IN, USA) sealed with metal caps
                                            6

containing rubber septa. In each glass vial were injected for 40 minutes at a rate of
40 mL.min-1 pure carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium or hydrogen, as well as 100% or
21% oxygen, equilibrated with N2 (Airgas East, Inc., Salem, NH, USA). In the vials
where 02 was not injected, the concentration of this gas was measured following the
injection   to   ensure that  the   environment   did  not   contain   non-detectable
concentrations of 0 2 .Gas samples (500 pL) were collected from each vial with an
hermetic syringe (model 1750, Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA), and injected
into a gas chromatograph (Varian Aerograph, Walnut Creek, CA, USA) equipped with
a thermal conductivity detector. The peak heights were compared to a standard
commercial product containing 6.96% 02 and 4.91% CO 2 equilibrated with N2 .Each
treatment consisting of the gas exposure was repeated three or four times. To
minimize gas exchange (02) during storage, glass vials of 125 mL were kept in larger
Ball@ jar hermetic containers (0.95 L) containing the same gas mixture. Using this
arrangement, the glass bottles were incubated at 50C for 60 days. Temperatures
were monitored continuously with two digital data loggers (Hobo@, Onset Computer
Corp., Bourne, MA, USA) per incubator. After this storage, the 02 concentration in
each vial was again determined as indicative of the system hermeticity. The water
activity of the spores was measured at 25C with a water activity meter (LabMaster
a,, Novasina, Pfaffikon, Switzerland) and determined the germination. The viability
was determined directly by suspending the powder conidia in water-surfactant
solution and disposing this material on yeast extract agar-benomyl medium extract
(yeast extract Agar/benomyl medium - YEA). The solutions (water-surfactant) were
equilibrated with ambient temperature. After running each rehydration protocol, the
inoculated agar block (on glass slides) were incubated in paraffinized Petri dishes at
25C in the dark and germination counts were performed 24 after inoculation (p.i.).
Conidia was considered as germinated when a germ tube of any size was visible at
400X magnification with phase contrast illumination. At least 200 conidia were
examined in several microscopic fields for each suspension replicate of each
experimental treatment.
        The experiment was repeated on a different date without treatment with 21%
02.  The vials injected with gases except 02 in which considerable gas exchange
occurred (final content of 02 f> 3.5%) were discarded. The data were transformed
into square root of the arcsine and analyzed using one-factor analysis of variance.
The mean values were compared by Tukey-Kramer HSD or t-test and considered
                                           7

statistically different at a significance level of 5%. Data were analyzed using the JMP
statistical software package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
         Figure 1 shows that the final water activity for the spores in the first assay did
not change with gas treatment (P= 0,4150, F5 , 1 3 =1,1); the global average water
activity was 0.099±0.0248.Significant differences in germination were observed after
60 days at 50C (P <0.0001, F 5,13       =  122.0) and while exposure to N2 , CO 2 , H2 and He
produced viabilities equivalents in the range of 40-51 % , germination rates were very
low or even the absence of viable spores were recorded at 21% and 100%                      02,
respectively.
         As in the first experiment, the treatments did not produce significant
differences in final water activity of the spores (P = 0.29, F      = 3,11=1,4), average water
activity of 0.119 ± 0.0021 between treatments. Injection of 100%          02  resulted again in
no survivors (21%       02 was not tested). The storage of all other gases resulted in
superior viability to treatment with      02  but low, equivalent (range 10-13%) (Fig. 1B).
These germination rates were markedly lower than the range of 49-51 % observed in
the first test, due to the lower water activity of the spores in the first experiment.
Except for vials injected with      02,   residual  02 concentrations (1.6% -1.9%) did not
differ between the vials injected with gases (P=0.73, F2 ,8 = 0.3).
Example 2: N2 AND CO 2 INJECTION FOR STORAGE OF SPORES AT DIFFERENT
TEMPERATURES
         Using the same arrangement described in the previous item, samples of
spores were injected with 20% CO 2 and 80% N2. Four samples were tested for each
treatment regarding the residual      02    and final water activity after storage for 45, 91,
180 and 240 days at 40'C. The experiment was repeated on a different date.
Additionally, experiments were performed to investigate the effects of storage at
25C     (evaluations after 46, 120, 180, 365 and 400 d ays storage) and 50'C
(evaluations after 15, 30, 47, 75 and 90 days storage). In all cases, viability was also
determined in the "day zero", that is, immediately before storing in incubators at
different temperatures. Different bottles were sampled on a single date of evaluation
and therefore, this study did not use repeated measures design.
         The data were transformed into square root of the arcsine and analyzed using
one-factor analysis of variance. The mean values were compared by Tukey-Kramer
HSD or t-test and considered statistically different at a significance level of 5%. Data
                                                 8

were analyzed using the JMP statistical software package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA).
        In the storage experiment at 25C it was observed a significant decrease in
viability (P=0.0002, F5 ,18 = 8.8) but the decrease was gradual and small, and the
viability was higher than 90% at 365 days and 87% at 480 days post-storage, as
seen in Figure 2. The water activity of the spores increased from 0.104 at 46 days
after storage to 0.204 at the end of the experiment (P <0.0001, F [4,15] = 36.3) and the
mean concentration of residual 02 increased from 0.5 % to 12.4% (P <0.0001, F4        15  =
38.0).
        In the experiment at 40'C, there was a statisticall y significant loss of viability
during the first 3 months of storage, but the decrease was only 6 percentage points
(from 93 to 87%). This was followed by a rapid decline to 4% viability at 240 days
after storage (ANOVA P <0.0001, F 4,34= 361.7). During the interval between 45 and
240 days, the average concentration of residual 02 increased from 1.2% to 6.6% (P =
0.0002, F3 ,28 = 9.4) and water activity increased from 0.104 to 0.145 (P <0.0001, F3 ,2 7
=  35.4).
        At 50C the initial viability decreased rapidly from 96 to 81% in the first 15
days, and approximately 10% at 90 days after storage (P <0.0001, F6 ,2 1 = 129.1).The
residual 02 increased from 0.8% at 15 days to 3.2% at 90 days post-storage (P =
0.0074, F5 ,18 = 4.5), while the water activity of the spores did not change significantly
during this period (from 0.104 at 15 days to 0.098 and 90 days: P = 0.3448, F5 ,18
1.2).
        Example 3: GAS INJECTION AND EMPLOYMENT OF ACTIVE PACKAGING
(AP)
        Beauveria bassiana spores were dehydrated with NaOH in glass vials of 125
mL for 1 day at 25C, resulting in 0.083 ± 0.001 water activity. Several random
samples were transferred to glass vials and injected with N2 . The loss of 02 was
reduced using a dual filling system with glass containers. The remaining samples
(0.6 g) were subjected to one of the three AP treatments comprising: i) aluminum
bags (8 x 8.5 cm) with a 02 and moisture RP-3A absorber sachet; ii) a 02 absorber
film (code M-0034, lot 19208A, 88.9x63.5xO.3 mm CSP Technologies, Auburn, AL,
USA) plus a humidity absorber film (CSP Technologies, code M-0026, lot 02208A ,
63.5x38.lxO.6 mm) or; ii) a film having dual action as 02 and humidity absorber (CSP
Technologies, code M-0033, lot 10808A, 76,2x76.2x0.6 mm). For control, spores
                                              9

were maintained in 30 mm thick polyethylene bags (code P827-2.1.2; Empac
Agroindustrial Ltda Plastics, Brasilia, Brazil) with a RP-3A sachet.
        After preparation, all packages with spores were pre-incubated at 25C for 5
days and then transferred to 50'C. The residual 0       2 of the glass vials injected with N2
was checked immediately before incubation at elevated temperature. For all
treatments, three containers were used for destructive determination of water activity
and viability of the spores immediately prior to transfer to 50'C. Spores were
incubated at 50'C for 56 or 120 days. After storage, water activity was measured and
conidial viability was assessed. For each treatment and date, four packages
independently prepared were destructively evaluated and, therefore, repeated
measures design was not adopted.
        Example 4: SACHETS FOR MODIFIED ATMOSPHERE
        Samples of Beauveria bassiana spores were stored in glass vials of 125 mL
with calcium sulfate desiccant (Drierite TM 8-mesh indicator, W.A. Hammond Drierite
Co., Xenia, OH, USA) for two days at 25C. The wate r activity of the spores before
filling was 0.019±0.0005. In another treatment the spores were maintained on
saturated NaCI solution for 2 days at 25C, which resulted in water activity of
0.738±0.0007 before filling. The samples were then transferred to laminate bags
(10x12 cm) containing one of the following sachets for atmosphere modification: 02
and humidity absorber RP-SA, 02 absorber Ageless @ ZPT 1000 (Mitsubishi Gas
Chemical Co., Japan), 02 and CO 2 absorber OxyFree TM                504A (Tianhua Tech,
China), 02 absorber and CO 2 generator OxyFreeTM generator 504E (Tianhua Tech,
China), or humidity absorber based on DrieriteTM (56.7 g). As control, laminated bags
without sachet were used. The bags were incubated at 50C                   without the pre
incubation period, quantifying the water activity of the spores and the germination

        The use of several modified atmosphere sachets resulted in highly significant
differences in viability of spores for both low (P <0.0001, F   [5.12] = 1631.4) and the
high initial water activity (P <0.0001, F     [5.12] = 522.4) (Table 1). As expected,
considering the absorption capacities of different sachets, final water activity of the
spores in the treatments with low or high initial water activity were also markedly
different. The use of sachets that release humidity during storage (Ageless, 504A
and 504E) or absorb humidity but not 02 (Drierite T M ) resulted in lower viability when
compared with the use of dual action absorber, absorbing 02 and humidity (RP-3A)
        Example 5: COMBINATION OF MODIFIED ATMOSPHERE SACHETS FOR
EXTENSION OF SHELF LIFE
Samples of Beauveria bassiana spores were dried with DrieriteTM for 2 days at 25'C
(resulting in water activity of 0.020 ± 0.0008) and then transferred to 16x20 cm
laminated bags with different sachets: RP-5A to absorb 02 and humidity (same
composition as RP-3A but suitable for larger packages) 504E to absorb 02 and
generate CO 2 or a sachet 504E plus a DrieriteTM sachet (56.7 g). Each treatment was
                                           11

repeated three times and the water activity of the spores was determined, as well as
the germination after 148 and 180 days after storage at 40CC.
The sachet which absorbs 02, but releases humidity (504E) was effective when
tested in conjunction with a desiccant (Drierite T M ), but the isolated use of sachet
504E resulted in complete loss of viability (Table 2). The strategy of combining the
use of sachets was as good as the use of dual action sachet (RP-5A), both after 148
days (P< 0.0001, F2 ,6 = 309,0) and after 178 days after storage at 40C ( P< 0,0001,
F2 ,6 = 2,035).

         Example 6: EFFECT OF EQUILIBRIUM PERIOD ON THE SHELF LIFE
The pure spores of Beauveria bassiana had their water activity equilibrated inside the
package prior to being exposed to high temperature regimens. The samples of
Beauveria bassiana were kept in DrieriteTM or NaCI for 2 days at 25C, resulting in
water activity of 0.020±0.0008 and 0.740±0.0018, respectively. Then, the spores
were transferred to laminated bags each containing a sachet RP-3A (02 and humidity
absorber) and pre-incubated for an additional period of 5 days at 25C before being
stored at target temperatures (25, 40 and 50C). Al ternatively, samples were kept in
DrieriteTM or NaCI for 7 days at 25C, transferred to laminat ed bags containing RP-3A
                                             12

sachets and immediately stored at target temperatures without the equilibration
period of 5 days at 25C.             Each treatment was repeat ed four times and
measurements of the water activity and viability were performed after 60 days at
50C and 180 days at 25 or 40CC.
The final water activity of the spores did not vary between treatments at each storage
temperature (Table 3). Germination percentages after 180 days at 25'C were high
(91-94%) for all treatments, except for treatment with high initial water activity and the
equilibration period, in which the viability was reduced to 68%. After 180 days at
40C, viability was 87-89% for most treatments but was significantly lower (75%) in
the treatment with high initial water activity and without the equilibration period (P
0.0068, F3 .8 = 8.7). Finally, after 60 days at 50C, the same te ndency was observed
with viabilities for almost all treatments in the range of 83-86%, except for the
treatment of high initial water activity and without the equilibrium period, in which the
viability was significantly reduced to 60% (P< 0.0001, F3 ,8 = 37.8).
The shelf-lives observed in this study are considerably higher than those previously
obtained. Atmospheres modified after the injection of gases other than 02 (CO 2 , N2 ,
H2 and He) resulted in comparable viabilities after 2 months of storage at 50CC.
When testing an atmosphere of 20% CO 2 (+ 80% N2 ) in vials, the time for spore
viability dropped to 80% were superior to 91 and 15 days at a temperature of 40 to
50C, respectively. These times are similar for the estimates obtained from the data
published by Hong et al. (2001) (Hong, TD, et al. The effect of storage environment
on the longevity of conidia of Beauveria bassiana. Mycological Research v. 105, p.
597-602, 2001), suggesting that the spores dehydrate at up to 5% humidity and
stored with atmospheric air in hermetically sealed containers retained 80% viability
for 80 and 17 days at 40 to 50'C, respectively. These were, until then, the longest
shelf-lives ever recorded for this species of fungus in high temperatures. However,
when using the active packaging (with sachets which absorb 02 and humidity in
hermetic packages) and an equilibration period was introduced, the viability reached
unprecedented values ranging from 80 to 90% after 6 months at 40C, or 2 months at
50CC.

        Example 7: EFFECT OF THE DEHYDRATION STEP (BEFORE PACKAGING)
ON THE SHELF LIFE
        It can be verified from Table 4 that the equilibration period of 7 days at 25,C
was adopted for all treatments. However, in one experiment, it was found that the
mere use of the sachet RP-3A (which absorbs water vapour and oxygen inside the
package) is not sufficient to ensure high levels of germination. In the treatment
"Hydration + RP-3A" the step of pre-drying the sample before packaging was not
adopted and, even with the reduction of water activity to 0.050 at the end of
equilibration period (and of 0.020 at the end of 16 months of storage), the final result
was lower than in the previous treatment, where the water activity at the end of the
equilibration period and throughout the storage period at 40,C remained below 0.1,
and within the ideal range of 0.02 to 0.03. In experiment 2, the two treatments
followed the recommended steps (pre-drying, adoption of sachet(s) for absorption of
humidity and oxygen, observing the equilibrium period for removal of oxygen and
reduction of water activity to levels close to 0.03 before exposure to high
temperatures) and thus the results were satisfactory. In the first experiment of
treatment 2 a dual function sachet was used (absorbing humidity and oxygen), while
in the second a sachet for each function was adopted. It is important to highlight that
                                              14

the processes and methods known in the art were never able to provide viability

16 months of storage of conidia at 40CC.

"Hydration + RP-3A", the failure to observe the first step (dehydration of the water
activity of the spores before packaging to levels below 0.3) resulted in water activity
at the end of the equilibration period higher than the optimal limit (0.02 to 0.03),
leading to percentages of germination lower than in the previous treatment, where all
steps recommended in the patent were observed.
          b Data collected immediately before storage at high temperature following
initial equilibration period of 7 days at 25 0 C.
          Example 8: EFFECT OF ACTIVE PACKAGING IN THE SHELF LIFE OF
FUNGUS Metarhizium anisopliae AT 40C
In experiments where the equilibration period (8 days at 25,C) was observed for
spores of Metarhizium anisopliae (Table 5), the use of sachet RP-3K (oxygen
absorber but releases water vapour) was not sufficient to provide satisfactory results.
Used alone, the release of water vapour increases the water activity of the spores to
                                              15

very high values and, consequently, the shelf-life is dramatically reduced. On the
other hand, treatment with sachet RP-3A, which in addition to absorbing oxygen also
absorbs water vapour inside the package, maintained the water activity of the spores
within optimal values, thus contributing to elevated percentages of germination after
2 weeks storage at 40CC.
         The data in Table 6 demonstrate that the method of the present invention
allows the achievement of a viability (percentage of germination) in the order of 70%
for the funfus Metarhizium anisopliae after more than 5 months storage at 40CC,
which had never been possible for this species by conventional known methods. In
general, the minimum acceptable viability for commercial products (mycopesticides)
is in the order of 80%. Based on extrapolation of the data obtained above, this
percentage would have been reached through the method of the present invention
after 4 months of storage at 40C. These values are significantly higher than that
reported for example in U.S. patent 5,989,893 by Jin et al. (1999), in which the
viability of approximately 80% was observed after 2 months of storage at 37'C.

         It was observed in studies of the prior art reported herein that atmospheres in
which air was replaced by CO 2 and N2 increased longevity of Beauveria bassiana
spores. Previous attempts to extend the shelf-life of this species were conducted in
the presence of air, although the beneficial effects of removal of 02 (or increasing
CO 2 concentration) during the short term shelf-life of Metarhizium anisopliae have
been demonstrated for decades by Clerk and Madelin (19A5) (Clerk, CG; Madelin,
M.F. The longevity of conidia of three insect-parasitizing hyphomycetes. Transactions
of the British Mycological Society 48, 193-209, 1965). Patent US 5,989,898 discloses
that spores of Metarhizium dehydrated with DrieriteTM and stored at atmospheres
supposedly without 02 obtained with the use of Ageless sachet inserted in bags
impermeable to humidity and gas showed 74% viability after 2 months at 37'C, and
showed no viability if maintained in bags without 02 absorber or with high relative
humidity ranging from 40 to 100%. Leite et al. (2002) (Leite, L.G., et al. Preservagao
de micelio de Batkoa sp. e Furia sp. (Entomophthorales) em combinagao com
dessecantes e redutores de oxigenio [Preservation of mycelium of Batkoa sp. and

Arquivos do Instituto Biol6gico 69, 117-122, 2002) Preserved dry mycelia of Batkoa
sp. and Furia sp. for 3 months at 23C using Ageless and silica gel , but further
studies regarding entomopathogenic fungi packages in modified atmosphere are not
known.
         In non-hermetic packages the availability of air to the spores is significant
(Hong, T.O., et al. Saturated salt solutions for humidity control and the survival of dry
powder formulations and or of Beauveria bassiana conidia. Journal of Invertebrate
Pathology. v.89, p. 136-143, 2005) and therefore the results observed for longevity of
spores are discouraging. The present invention showed that the adoption of plastic
                                              17

polymers with high permeability to 02 and humidity are totally undesirable for
mycopesticides packaging, even if combined with an efficient sachet for active
packaging. Gas injection (for 40 min) in glass containers proved far more efficient
than the use of non-hermetic packaging, but less efficient than the use of laminates
(+ sachets of active packaging) for extending the life-shelf of Beauveria bassiana
spores in the present technology due to the presence of water activity greater than
desired after the injection of gas, air exchanges with the external environment and
due to the inability of the gas injection protocols used to enable greater removal of 02
present in the packaging. The study Teshler et al (2007) (Teshler, M.P. et al.
Increased shelf life of the bioherbicide through combining modified atmosphere
packaging and low temperatures. Biocontrol Science and Technology 17, 387-400,
2007). disclosed that the residual 02 concentration was 0.26% after gas injection in
laminated packaging. Water activity remained at low and constant levels after
hermetically filled with aluminum and the use of an efficient 02 and humidity
absorber. In anhydrobiotic organisms, isolated enzymatic reactions may occur which
lead to the production of free radicals and non-enzymatic reactions mediated by
these free radicals. For example, reactions of degradation of phospholipids may
occur, with accumulation of byproducts (fatty acids) in the membranes (McKersie,
B.D.   et al. Senaratna,      T., Walker, M.A.,      Kendall, E.J.,  Hetherington,   P.R.
Deterioration of membranes during aging in plants: Evidence for free radical
mediation. In: L.D. Nooden, L.D., Leopold, A.C. (Eds.), Senescence and Aging in
Plants. San Diego: Academic Press, p. 442-464, 1088). However, the aging under
atmospheric conditions and free from 02 and extremely dry is considerably slower
than under non-hermetic conditions.
        Most active packaging sachets used in the food industry tested was not
effective to extend the viability of Beauveria bassiana spores, whether because the
water activity levels of spores increased to undesirable levels or because 02 was not
reduced to low levels. A sachet with dual action, able to absorb 02 and humidity, was
more efficient than sachets that have only a single attribute. Although the CO 2 is
known to have fungistatic activity on some fungi in growth (Tabak and Cooke, 1968;
Abellana    et   al.  2000),    no    deleterious   effect was    observed   on    stored
entomopathogenic spores, which suggests the possibility of using active packaging
by using 02 absorber and CO 2 emitter sachets.
                                              18

        The shelf-life of approximately one year was recorded for the relatively
thermotolerant M. acridum with humidity of 6.2% (but the same was not achieved for
spores with 7.0% water content) at 27-32C and stored under vacuum (Hong et al,
1999), as well as oil formulations of Beauveria bassiana at 25C (Wraight et al, 2001)
The present invention achieved shelf-life of 8 months for spores with 2.1 to 2.4%
humidity packaged in active packaging, which is sufficient time for distributions in
regions with average temperatures near 40cC. Experi ments were also conducted at
50'C. Similar or higher temperatures can be achieve d in certain regions (Hong, T.D.,
Ellis, R.H., Moore, D. Development of a model to predict the effect of temperature
and moisture on fungal spore longevity. Annals of Botany, v. 79, p. 121-128, 1997) or
during transportation (Ostrem and Godshall, 1979).
        In addition to factors intrinsically related to storage, pre-storage factors such
as the original quality of fungal propagules, which in turn is influenced by the culture
conditions (Agosin, E. et al .. Effect of culture conditions on spore shelf life of the

profound impact on longevity. This invention shows that it is necessary to dry the
spores packaged and subjected to mild conditions before exposure to high
temperatures so that high initial water activity reaches the desired levels, and thus
avoid premature death or debilitation of the spores. Post-storage factors such as the
germination protocol, although not directly related to shelf life, can result in erroneous
viability if not performed properly. The shelf lives shown in this example were
estimated with an emphasis on a rapid rehydration protocol (without prior exposure of
the spores to a regime of slow rehydration inside a humid chamber for 24 h).
        The water activity of pre-dehydrated spores maintained in hermetic bags with
DrieriteTM  or 02  and humidity absorber were consistently in the range of 0.010 to
0.030 (equilibrium relative humidity of 1.9 - 3.0%). This small variation was observed
between the readings taken in winter (laboratory air cooler and drier) and seasons
with higher temperature and relative humidity. The importance of dehydrating the
airborne fungal spores to extend the shelf-life has been shown previously (Clerk,
C.G.;    Madelin,    M.F.  The    longevity  of conidia     of three    insectparasitizing
hyphomycetes. Transactions of the British Mycological Society 48, 193-209, 1965;

Mitani, T. Effects of temperature on viability of conidia from Beauveria bassiana in oil
formulations. Japanese Journal of Applied Entomology and Zoology v. 44, p.51-53,
2000). In studies with hermetic storage in which air was not removed from the
packages (Hong, T.D., et al Gunn, J The effect of storage environment on the
longevity of conidia of Beauveria bassiana. Mycological Research 105, 597- 602,
2001) reported that the longevity of two isolates of Beauveria bassiana did not
increase significantly when the humidity content in storage decreased to values
below the range of 4.6 to 5.2%, in equilibrium with relative humidities of 11-14% at
20'C. In this study, the best water activity of the spores was consistently associated
with DrioriteTM , which has moisture content considerably lower than 5%. The results
                                            20

obtained in the present invention suggest that under practically anaerobic conditions
(<0.03%   02)  optimal water activities for storage are lower than under aerobic
atmospheres.
