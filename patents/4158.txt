[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/491,146, entitled,
"Compositions Containing, Methods Involving, and Uses of Non-Natural Amino Acid Linked Dolastatin
Derivatives," filed May 27, 2011, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                                  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] The ability to incorporate non-genetically encoded amino acids (i.e., "non-natural amino acids")
into proteins permits the introduction of chemical functional groups that could provide valuable
alternatives to the naturally-occurring functional groups, such as the epsilon -NH 2 of lysine, the
sulfhydryl -SH of cysteine, the imino group of histidine, etc. Certain chemical functional groups are
known to be inert to the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids but
react cleanly and efficiently to form stable linkages with functional groups that can be incorporated onto
non-natural amino acids.
[0003] Methods are now available to selectively introduce chemical functional groups that are not found
in proteins, that are chemically inert to all of the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically
encoded amino acids and that may be used to react efficiently and selectively with reagents comprising
certain functional groups to form stable covalent linkages.
                                    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

     amino acids, and methods for making such non-natural amino acids and polypeptides.

[0024] The terms "aldol-based linkage" or "mixed aldol-based linkage" refers to the acid- or base
catalyzed condensation of one carbonyl compound with the enolate/enol of another carbonyl compound,
which may or may not be the same, to generate a P-hydroxy carbonyl compound-an aldol.
[0025] The term "affinity label," as used herein, refers to a label which reversibly or irreversibly binds
another molecule, either to modify it, destroy it, or form a compound with it. By way of example, affinity
labels include enzymes and their substrates, or antibodies and their antigens.
[0026] The terms "alkoxy," "alkylamino" and "alkylthio" (or thioalkoxy) are used in their conventional
sense, and refer to those alkyl groups linked to molecules via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur
atom, respectively.
[0027] The term "alkyl," by itself or as part of another molecule means, unless otherwise stated, a
straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combination thereof, which may be fully
saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of
carbon atoms designated (i.e. CI-CIO means one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon
radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl,
isobutyl, sec-butyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for
example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one
or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited
to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl,

groups include, but are not limited to, groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms such as the structures
CH 2CH 2- and -CH 2 CH 2CH 2CH 2-. A "lower alkyl" or "lower alkylene" is a shorter chain alkyl or
alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms. The term "alkylene," unless otherwise
noted, is also meant to include those groups described herein as "heteroalkylene."
[0029] The term "amino acid" refers to naturally occurring and non-natural amino acids, as well as amino
acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino
acids. Naturally encoded amino acids are the 20 common amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine,

aspartic  acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine,         lysine,
methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine) and pyrolysine and
selenocysteine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a
naturally occurring amino acid, by way of example only, an a-carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a
carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group. Such analogs may have modified R groups (by way of
example, norleucine) or may have modified peptide backbones while still retaining the same basic
chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Non-limiting examples of amino acid analogs
include homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium.
[0030] Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their name, their commonly known three letter
symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature
Commission. Additionally, nucleotides, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter
codes.
[0031] An "amino terminus modification group" refers to any molecule that can be attached to a terminal
amine group. By way of example, such terminal amine groups may be at the end of polymeric molecules,
wherein such polymeric molecules include, but are not limited to, polypeptides, polynucleotides, and
polysaccharides. Terminus modification groups include but are not limited to, various water soluble
polymers, peptides or proteins. By way of example only, terminus modification groups include
polyethylene glycol or serum albumin. Terminus modification groups may be used to modify therapeutic
characteristics of the polymeric molecule, including but not limited to increasing the serum half-life of
peptides.
[0032] By "antibody fragment" is meant any form of an antibody other than the full-length form.
Antibody fragments herein include antibodies that are smaller components that exist within full-length
antibodies, and antibodies that have been engineered. Antibody fragments include but are not limited to
Fv, Fc, Fab, and (Fab')2, single chain Fv (scFv), diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, bifunctional hybrid
antibodies, CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, combinations of CDR's, variable regions, framework regions, constant
regions, heavy chains, light chains, and variable regions, and alternative scaffold non-antibody molecules,
bispecific antibodies, and the like (Maynard & Georgiou, 2000, Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2:339-76;
Hudson, 1998, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 9:395-402). Another functional substructure is a single chain Fv
(scFv), comprised of the variable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain, covalently
connected by a peptide linker (S-z Hu et al., 1996, Cancer Research, 56, 3055-3061). These small (Mr
25,000) proteins generally retain specificity and affinity for antigen in a single polypeptide and can
provide a convenient building block for larger, antigen-specific molecules. Unless specifically noted
otherwise, statements and claims that use the term "antibody" or "antibodies" specifically includes
"antibody fragment" and "antibody fragments."
[0033] By "antibody-drug conjugate, or "ADC", as used herein, refers to an antibody molecule, or
fragment thereof, that is covalently bonded to one or more biologically active molecule(s).             The
                                                     27

     WO 2012/166560                                                              PCT/US2012/039472
biologically active molecule may be conjugated to the antibody through a linker, polymer, or other
covalent bond.
[0034] The term "aromatic" or "aryl", as used herein, refers to a closed ring structure which has at least
one ring having a conjugated pi electron system and includes both carbocyclic aryl and heterocyclic aryl
(or "heteroaryl" or "heteroaromatic") groups. The carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic group may contain
from 5 to 20 ring atoms. The term includes monocyclic rings linked covalently or fused-ring polycyclic
(i.e., rings which share adjacent pairs of carbon atoms) groups. An aromatic group can be unsubstituted or
substituted. Non-limiting examples of "aromatic" or "aryl", groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2
naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, anthracenyl, and phenanthracenyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and
heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described herein.
[0035] For brevity, the term "aromatic" or "aryl" when used in combination with other terms (including
but not limited to, aryloxy, arylthioxy, aralkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above.
Thus, the term "aralkyl" or "alkaryl" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached
to an alkyl group (including but not limited to, benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including
those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (including but not limited to, a methylene group) has been
replaced by a heteroatom, by way of example only, by an oxygen atom. Examples of such aryl groups
include, but are not limited to, phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the
like.
[0036] The term "arylene", as used herein, refers to a divalent aryl radical. Non-limiting examples of
"arylene" include phenylene, pyridinylene, pyrimidinylene and thiophenylene. Substituents for arylene
groups are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described herein.
[0037] A "bifunctional polymer", also referred to as a "bifunctional linker", refers to a polymer
comprising two functional groups that are capable of reacting specifically with other moieties to form
covalent or non-covalent linkages. Such moieties may include, but are not limited to, the side groups on
natural or non-natural amino acids or peptides which contain such natural or non-natural amino acids. The
other moieties that may be linked to the bifunctional linker or bifunctional polymer may be the same or
different moieties. By way of example only, a bifunctional linker may have a functional group reactive
with a group on a first peptide, and another functional group which is reactive with a group on a second
peptide, whereby forming a conjugate that includes the first peptide, the bifunctional linker and the second
peptide. Many procedures and linker molecules for attachment of various compounds to peptides are
known. See, e.g., European Patent Application No. 188,256; U.S. Patent Nos. 4,671,958, 4,659,839,
4,414,148, 4,699,784; 4,680,338; and 4,569,789 which are incorporated by reference herein in their
entirety. A "multi-functional polymer" also referred to as a "multi-functional linker", refers to a polymer
comprising two or more functional groups that are capable of reacting with other moieties. Such moieties
may include, but are not limited to, the side groups on natural or non-natural amino acids or peptides
which contain such natural or non-natural amino acids. (including but not limited to, amino acid side
groups) to form covalent or non-covalent linkages. A bi-functional polymer or multi-functional polymer

may be any desired length or molecular weight, and may be selected to provide a particular desired
spacing or conformation between one or more molecules linked to a compound and molecules it binds to
or the compound.
[0038] The term "bioavailability," as used herein, refers to the rate and extent to which a substance or its
active moiety is delivered from a pharmaceutical dosage form and becomes available at the site of action
or in the general circulation. Increases in bioavailability refers to increasing the rate and extent a
substance or its active moiety is delivered from a pharmaceutical dosage form and becomes available at
the site of action or in the general circulation. By way of example, an increase in bioavailability may be
indicated as an increase in concentration of the substance or its active moiety in the blood when compared
to other substances or active moieties. A non-limiting example of a method to evaluate increases in
bioavailability is given in examples 21-25. This method may be used for evaluating the bioavailability of
any polypeptide.
[0039] The term "biologically active molecule", "biologically active moiety" or "biologically active
agent" when used herein means any substance which can affect any physical or biochemical properties of
a biological system, pathway, molecule, or interaction relating to an organism, including but not limited
to, viruses, bacteria, bacteriophage, transposon, prion, insects, fungi, plants, animals, and humans. In
particular, as used herein, biologically active molecules include but are not limited to any substance
intended for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or other animals, or
to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being of humans or animals. Examples of biologically
active molecules include, but are not limited to, peptides, proteins, enzymes, small molecule drugs, hard
drugs, soft drugs, prodrugs, carbohydrates, inorganic atoms or molecules, dyes, lipids, nucleosides,
radionuclides, oligonucleotides, toxins, cells, viruses, liposomes, microparticles and micelles. Classes of
biologically active agents that are suitable for use with the methods and compositions described herein
include, but are not limited to, drugs, prodrugs, radionuclides, imaging agents, polymers, antibiotics,
fungicides, anti-viral agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-tumor agents, cardiovascular agents, anti
anxiety agents, hormones, growth factors, steroidal agents, microbially derived toxins, and the like.
[0040] By "modulating biological activity" is meant increasing or decreasing the reactivity of a
polypeptide, altering the selectivity of the polypeptide, enhancing or decreasing the substrate selectivity of
the polypeptide. Analysis of modified biological activity can be performed by comparing the biological
activity of the non-natural polypeptide to that of the natural polypeptide.
[0041] The term "biomaterial," as used herein, refers to a biologically-derived material, including but not
limited to material obtained from bioreactors and/or from recombinant methods and techniques.
[0042] The term "biophysical probe," as used herein, refers to probes which can detect or monitor
structural changes in molecules. Such molecules include, but are not limited to, proteins and the
"biophysical probe" may be used to detect or monitor interaction of proteins with other macromolecules.
Examples of biophysical probes include, but are not limited to, spin-labels, a fluorophores, and
photoactivatible groups.

    WO 2012/166560                                                               PCT/US2012/039472
[0043] The term "biosynthetically," as used herein, refers to any method utilizing a translation system
(cellular or non-cellular), including use of at least one of the following components: a polynucleotide, a
codon, a tRNA, and a ribosome. By way of example, non-natural amino acids may be "biosynthetically
incorporated" into non-natural amino acid polypeptides using the methods and techniques described
herein, "In vivo generation of polypeptides comprising non-natural amino acids", and in the non-limiting
example 20. Additionally, the methods for the selection of useful non-natural amino acids which may be
"biosynthetically incorporated" into non-natural amino acid polypeptides are described in the non-limiting
examples 20.
[0044] The term "biotin analogue," or also referred to as "biotin mimic", as used herein, is any molecule,
other than biotin, which bind with high affinity to avidin and/or streptavidin.
[0045] The term "carbonyl" as used herein refers to a group containing at a moiety selecting from the
group consisting of -C(O)-, -S(O)-, -S(O)2-, and -C(S)-, including, but not limited to, groups containing a
least one ketone group, and/or at least one aldehyde groups, and/or at least one ester group, and/or at least
one carboxylic acid group, and/or at least one thioester group. Such carbonyl groups include ketones,
aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, and thioesters. In addition, such groups may be part of linear,
branched, or cyclic molecules.
[0046] The term "carboxy terminus modification group" refers to any molecule that can be attached to a
terminal carboxy group. By way of example, such terminal carboxy groups may be at the end of
polymeric molecules, wherein such polymeric molecules include, but are not limited to, polypeptides,
polynucleotides, and polysaccharides. Terminus modification groups include but are not limited to,
various water soluble polymers, peptides or proteins. By way of example only, terminus modification
groups include polyethylene glycol or serum albumin. Terminus modification groups may be used to
modify therapeutic characteristics of the polymeric molecule, including but not limited to increasing the
serum half-life of peptides.
[0047] The term "chemically cleavable group," also referred to as "chemically labile", as used herein,
refers to a group which breaks or cleaves upon exposure to acid, base, oxidizing agents, reducing agents,
chemical inititiators, or radical initiators.
[0048] The term "chemiluminescent group," as used herein, refers to a group which emits light as a result
of a chemical reaction without the addition of heat. By way of example only, luminol (5-amino-2,3
dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione) reacts with oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (H 20 2 ) in the presence of a
base and a metal catalyst to produce an excited state product (3-aminophthalate, 3-APA).

    WO 2012/166560                                                              PCT/US2012/039472
[0051] "Cofolding," as used herein, refers to refolding processes, reactions, or methods which employ at
least two molecules which interact with each other and result in the transformation of unfolded or
improperly folded molecules to properly folded molecules. By way of example only, "cofolding," employ
at least two polypeptides which interact with each other and result in the transformation of unfolded or
improperly folded polypeptides to native, properly folded polypeptides. Such polypeptides may contain
natural amino acids and/or at least one non-natural amino acid.
[0052] A "comparison window," as used herein, refers a segment of any one of contiguous positions used
to compare a sequence to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two
sequences are optimally aligned. Such contiguous positions include, but are not limited to a group
consisting of from about 20 to about 600 sequential units, including about 50 to about 200 sequential
units, and about 100 to about 150 sequential units. By way of example only, such sequences include
polypeptides and polypeptides containing non-natural amino acids, with the sequential units include, but
are not limited to natural and non-natural amino acids. In addition, by way of example only, such
sequences include polynucleotides with nucleotides being the corresponding sequential units. Methods of
alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for
comparison can be conducted, including but not limited to, by the local homology algorithm of Smith and
Waterman (1970) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482c, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and
Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988)
Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP,
BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer
Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Ausubel
et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995 supplement)).
[0053] By way of example, an algorithm which may be used to determine percent sequence identity and
sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al.
(1997) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, and Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, respectively.
Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for
Biotechnology Information. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and
speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength
(W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=-4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid
sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the
BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915)
alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=-4, and a comparison of both strands. The BLAST
algorithm is typically performed with the "low complexity" filter turned off.
[0054] The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences
(see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787). One measure of
similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an
indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would
                                                     31

    WO 2012/166560                                                               PCT/US2012/039472
occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest
sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2,
or less than about 0.01, or less than about 0.001.
[0055] The term "conservatively modified variants" applies to both natural and non-natural amino acid
and natural and non-natural nucleic acid sequences, and combinations thereof. With respect to particular
nucleic acid sequences, "conservatively modified variants" refers to those natural and non-natural nucleic
acids which encode identical or essentially identical natural and non-natural amino acid sequences, or
where the natural and non-natural nucleic acid does not encode a natural and non-natural amino acid
sequence, to essentially identical sequences. By way of example, because of the degeneracy of the genetic
code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the
codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an
alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described
without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are "silent variations," which are
one species of conservatively modified variations. Thus by way of example every natural or non-natural
nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a natural or non-natural polypeptide also describes every
possible silent variation of the natural or non-natural nucleic acid. One of ordinary skill in the art will
recognize that each codon in a natural or non-natural nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the
only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified
to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a natural and non-natural
nucleic acid which encodes a natural and non-natural polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.
[0056] As to amino acid sequences, individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid,
peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single natural and non-natural
amino acid or a small percentage of natural and non-natural amino acids in the encoded sequence is a
"conservatively modified variant" where the alteration results in the deletion of an amino acid, addition of
an amino acid, or substitution of a natural and non-natural amino acid with a chemically similar amino
acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar natural amino acids are well known
in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic
variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the methods and compositions described herein.
[0057] Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are known to those of
ordinary skill in the art. The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative
substitutions for one another:
          1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G);
         2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);
         3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);
         4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K);
         5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);
         6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W);

[0058] The terms "cycloalkyl" and "heterocycloalkyl", by themselves or in combination with other
terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of "alkyl" and "heteroalkyl", respectively. Thus,

across the entire sequence of a polynucleotide sequence.
[0085] For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test
sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are
entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm
program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters
can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for
the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.

Radioimmunoassay (RIA), Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA), luminescent immunoassay
(LIA), and fluorescent immunoassay (FIA). Analysis of immunogenicity toward therapeutic non-natural

comprises additional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients. Purity and homogeneity may
be determined using analytical chemistry techniques including, but not limited to, polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. In addition, when a component of interest is

metabolites of natural amino acid polypeptides, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified natural
amino acid polypeptides, or modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides may be identified either by
administration of the natural amino acid polypeptides, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified
natural amino acid polypeptides, or modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides to a host and analysis
of tissue samples from the host, or by incubation of natural amino acid polypeptides, non-natural amino
acid polypeptides, modified natural amino acid polypeptides, or modified non-natural amino acid
polypeptides with hepatic cells in vitro and analysis of the resulting compounds.
[0094] The term "metal chelator," as used herein, refers to a molecule which forms a metal complex with
metal ions. By way of example, such molecules may form two or more coordination bonds with a central
metal ion and may form ring structures.
[0095] The term "metal-containing moiety," as used herein, refers to a group which contains a metal ion,
atom or particle. Such moieties include, but are not limited to, cisplatin, chelated metals ions (such as
nickel, iron, and platinum), and metal nanoparticles (such as nickel, iron, and platinum).
[0096] The term "moiety incorporating a heavy atom," as used herein, refers to a group which
incorporates an ion of atom which is usually heavier than carbon. Such ions or atoms include, but are not
limited to, silicon, tungsten, gold, lead, and uranium.
[0097] The term "modified," as used herein refers to the presence of a change to a natural amino acid, a
non-natural amino acid, a natural amino acid polypeptide or a non-natural amino acid polypeptide. Such
changes, or modifications, may be obtained by post synthesis modifications of natural amino acids, non
natural amino acids, natural amino acid polypeptides or non-natural amino acid polypeptides, or by co

translational, or by post-translational modification of natural amino acids, non-natural amino acids,
natural amino acid polypeptides or non-natural amino acid polypeptides. The form "modified or
unmodified" means that the natural amino acid, non-natural amino acid, natural amino acid polypeptide or
non-natural amino acid polypeptide being discussed are optionally modified, that is, he natural amino
acid, non-natural amino acid, natural amino acid polypeptide or non-natural amino acid polypeptide under
discussion can be modified or unmodified.
[0098] As used herein, the term "modulated serum half-life" refers to positive or negative changes in the
circulating half-life of a modified biologically active molecule relative to its non-modified form. By way
of example, the modified biologically active molecules include, but are not limited to, natural amino acid,
non-natural amino acid, natural amino acid polypeptide or non-natural amino acid polypeptide. By way of
example, serum half-life is measured by taking blood samples at various time points after administration
of the biologically active molecule or modified biologically active molecule, and determining the
concentration of that molecule in each sample. Correlation of the serum concentration with time allows
calculation of the serum half-life. By way of example, modulated serum half-life may be an increased in
serum half-life, which may enable an improved dosing regimens or avoid toxic effects. Such increases in
serum may be at least about two fold, at least about three-fold, at least about five-fold, or at least about
ten-fold. A non-limiting example of a method to evaluate increases in serum half-life is given in example
33. This method may be used for evaluating the serum half-life of any polypeptide.
[0099] The term "modulated therapeutic half-life," as used herein, refers to positive or negative change in
the half-life of the therapeutically effective amount of a modified biologically active molecule, relative to
its non-modified form. By way of example, the modified biologically active molecules include, but are not
limited to, natural amino acid, non-natural amino acid, natural amino acid polypeptide or non-natural
amino acid polypeptide. By way of example, therapeutic half-life is measured by measuring
pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties of the molecule at various time points after
administration. Increased therapeutic half-life may enable a particular beneficial dosing regimen, a
particular beneficial total dose, or avoids an undesired effect. By way of example, the increased
therapeutic half-life may result from increased potency, increased or decreased binding of the modified
molecule to its target, an increase or decrease in another parameter or mechanism of action of the non
modified molecule, or an increased or decreased breakdown of the molecules by enzymes such as, by way
of example only, proteases. A non-limiting example of a method to evaluate increases in therapeutic half
life is given in example 33. This method may be used for evaluating the therapeutic half-life of any
polypeptide.

amino acid" is "non-naturally encoded amino acid," "unnatural amino acid," "non-naturally-occurring
amino acid," and variously hyphenated and non-hyphenated versions thereof. The term "non-natural
amino acid" includes, but is not limited to, amino acids which occur naturally by modification of a
naturally encoded amino acid (including but not limited to, the 20 common amino acids or pyrrolysine
and selenocysteine) but are not themselves incorporated into a growing polypeptide chain by the
translation complex. Examples of naturally-occurring amino acids that are not naturally-encoded include,
but are not limited to, N-acetylglucosaminyl-L-serine,        N-acetylglucosaminyl-L-threonine,    and 0

acids which do not occur naturally and may be obtained synthetically or may be obtained by modification
of non-natural amino acids.
[00104] The term "nucleic acid," as used herein, refers to deoxyribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleosides,
ribonucleosides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. By way
of example only, such nucleic acids and nucleic acid polymers include, but are not limited to, (i)
analogues of natural nucleotides which have similar binding properties as a reference nucleic acid and are
metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides; (ii) oligonucleotide analogs including,
but are not limited to, PNA (peptidonucleic acid), analogs of DNA used in antisense technology
(phosphorothioates, phosphoroamidates, and the like); (iii) conservatively modified variants thereof
(including but not limited to, degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences and sequence
explicitly indicated. By way of example, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating
sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed
base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., J.
Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608 (1985); and Rossolini et al., Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98 (1994)).

[00113] The term "polymer," as used herein, refers to a molecule composed of repeated subunits. Such
molecules include, but are not limited to, polypeptides, polynucleotides, or polysaccharides or
polyalkylene glycols.
[00114] The terms "polypeptide," "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a
polymer of amino acid residues. That is, a description directed to a polypeptide applies equally to a
description of a peptide and a description of a protein, and vice versa. The terms apply to naturally
occurring amino acid polymers as well as amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residues
is a non-natural amino acid. Additionally, such "polypeptides," "peptides" and "proteins" include amino
acid chains of any length, including full length proteins, wherein the amino acid residues are linked by
covalent peptide bonds.
[00115] The term "post-translationally modified" refers to any modification of a natural or non-natural
amino acid which occurs after such an amino acid has been translationally incorporated into a polypeptide
chain. Such modifications include, but are not limited to, co-translational in vivo modifications, co
translational in vitro modifications (such as in a cell-free translation system), post-translational in vivo
modifications, and post-translational in vitro modifications.
[00116] The terms "prodrug" or "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug," as used herein, refers to an agent
that is converted into the parent drug in vivo or in vitro, wherein which does not abrogate the biological
activity or properties of the drug, and is relatively nontoxic, i.e., the material may be administered to an
individual without causing undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any
of the components of the composition in which it is contained. Prodrugs are generally drug precursors
that, following administration to a subject and subsequent absorption, are converted to an active, or a
more active species via some process, such as conversion by a metabolic pathway. Some prodrugs have a
chemical group present on the prodrug that renders it less active and/or confers solubility or some other
                                                      44

    WO 2012/166560                                                                  PCT/US2012/039472
property to the drug. Once the chemical group has been cleaved and/or modified from the prodrug the
active drug is generated. Prodrugs are converted into active drug within the body through enzymatic or
non-enzymatic reactions. Prodrugs may provide improved physiochemical properties such as better
solubility, enhanced delivery characteristics, such as specifically targeting a particular cell, tissue, organ
or ligand, and improved therapeutic value of the drug. The benefits of such prodrugs include, but are not
limited to, (i) ease of administration compared with the parent drug; (ii) the prodrug may be bioavailable
by oral administration whereas the parent is not; and (iii) the prodrug may also have improved solubility
in pharmaceutical compositions compared with the parent drug. A pro-drug includes a pharmacologically
inactive, or reduced-activity, derivative of an active drug. Prodrugs may be designed to modulate the
amount of a drug or biologically active molecule that reaches a desired site of action through the
manipulation of the properties of a drug, such as physiochemical, biopharmaceutical, or pharmacokinetic
properties. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a non-natural amino acid polypeptide
which is administered as an ester (the "prodrug") to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where
water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic
acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial. Prodrugs may be designed
as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues.
[00117] The term "prophylactically effective amount," as used herein, refers that amount of a composition
containing at least one non-natural amino acid polypeptide or at least one modified non-natural amino
acid polypeptide prophylactically applied to a patient which will relieve to some extent one or more of the
symptoms of a disease, condition or disorder being treated. In such prophylactic applications, such
amounts may depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. It is considered well within the
skill of the art for one to determine such prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation,
including, but not limited to, a dose escalation clinical trial.
[00118] The term "protected," as used herein, refers to the presence of a "protecting group" or moiety that
prevents reaction of the chemically reactive functional group under certain reaction conditions. The
protecting group will vary depending on the type of chemically reactive group being protected. By way of
example only, (i) if the chemically reactive group is an amine or a hydrazide, the protecting group may be
selected from tert-butyloxycarbonyl       (t-Boc) and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl         (Fmoc); (ii)    if the
chemically reactive group is a thiol, the protecting group may be orthopyridyldisulfide; and (iii) if the
chemically reactive group is a carboxylic acid, such as butanoic or propionic acid, or a hydroxyl group,
the protecting group may be benzyl or an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, or tert-butyl.
[00119] By way of example only, blocking/protecting groups may be selected from:

[00121] The term "radioactive moiety," as used herein, refers to a group whose nuclei spontaneously give
off nuclear radiation, such as alpha, beta, or gamma particles; wherein, alpha particles are helium nuclei,
beta particles are electrons, and gamma particles are high energy photons.
[00122] The term "reactive compound," as used herein, refers to a compound which under appropriate
conditions is reactive toward another atom, molecule or compound.
[00123] The term "recombinant host cell," also referred to as "host cell," refers to a cell which includes an
exogenous polynucleotide, wherein the methods used to insert the exogenous polynucleotide into a cell
include, but are not limited to, direct uptake, transduction, f-mating, or other methods known in the art to
create recombinant host cells. By way of example only, such exogenous polynucleotide may be a
nonintegrated vector, including but not limited to a plasmid, or may be integrated into the host genome.

to a native or properly folded conformation with respect to disulfide bonds. Such disulfide bond
containing polypeptides may be natural amino acid polypeptides or non-natural amino acid polypeptides.
[00127] The term "resin," as used herein, refers to high molecular weight, insoluble polymer beads. By
way of example only, such beads may be used as supports for solid phase peptide synthesis, or sites for
attachment of molecules prior to purification.
[00128] The term "saccharide," as used herein, refers to a series of carbohydrates including but not limited
to sugars, monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides.
[00129] The term "safety" or "safety profile," as used herein, refers to side effects that might be related to
administration of a drug relative to the number of times the drug has been administered. By way of
example, a drug which has been administered many times and produced only mild or no side effects is
said to have an excellent safety profile. A non-limiting example of a method to evaluate the safety profile
is given in example 26. This method may be used for evaluating the safety profile of any polypeptide.
[00130] The phrase "selectively hybridizes to" or "specifically hybridizes to," as used herein, refers to the
binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent
hybridization conditions when that sequence is present in a complex mixture including but not limited to,
total cellular or library DNA or RNA.
[00131] The term "spin label," as used herein, refers to molecules which contain an atom or a group of
atoms exhibiting an unpaired electron spin (i.e. a stable paramagnetic group) that can be detected by
electron spin resonance spectroscopy and can be attached to another molecule. Such spin-label molecules
include, but are not limited to, nitryl radicals and nitroxides, and may be single spin-labels or double spin
labels.
[00132]The term "stoichiometric," as used herein, refers to the ratio of the moles of compounds
participating in a chemical reaction being about 0.9 to about 1.1.
[00133]The term "stoichiometric-like," as used herein, refers to a chemical reaction which becomes
stoichiometric or near-stoichiometric upon changes in reaction conditions or in the presence of additives.
Such changes in reaction conditions include, but are not limited to, an increase in temperature or change
in pH. Such additives include, but are not limited to, accelerants.
[00134] The phrase "stringent hybridization conditions" refers to hybridization of sequences of DNA,
RNA, PNA or other nucleic acid mimics, or combinations thereof, under conditions of low ionic strength
and high temperature. By way of example, under stringent conditions a probe will hybridize to its target
subsequence in a complex mixture of nucleic acid (including but not limited to, total cellular or library
DNA or RNA) but does not hybridize to other sequences in the complex mixture. Stringent conditions are
sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. By way of example, longer
sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. Stringent hybridization conditions include, but
are not limited to, (i) about 5-10 0C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at
a defined ionic strength and pH; (ii) the salt concentration is about 0.01 M to about 1.0 M at about pH 7.0

about 10 to about 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60 0C for long probes (including but not limited to,
greater than 50 nucleotides); (iii) the addition of destabilizing agents including, but not limited to,
formamide, (iv) 50% formamide, 5X SSC, and 1% SDS, incubating at 42 0C, or 5X SSC, about 1% SDS,
incubating at 65 0C, with wash in 0.2X SSC, and about 0.1% SDS at 65 0C for between about 5 minutes to
about 120 minutes. By way of example only, detection of selective or specific hybridization, includes, but
is not limited to, a positive signal at least two times background. An extensive guide to the hybridization
of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-
Hybridization with Nucleic Probes, "Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic
acid assays" (1993).
[00135]The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal which is the object of treatment,
observation or experiment. By way of example only, a subject may be, but is not limited to, a mammal
including, but not limited to, a human.
[00136] The term "substantially purified," as used herein, refers to a component of interest that may be
substantially or essentially free of other components which normally accompany or interact with the
component of interest prior to purification. By way of example only, a component of interest may be
"substantially purified" when the preparation of the component of interest contains less than about 30%,
                 25                     20
less than about      %, less than about    %, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%,
less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, or less than about 1% (by dry weight) of
contaminating components. Thus, a "substantially purified" component of interest may have a purity level
of about 7 0%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about          96
                                                                                        %, about 97%, about
98%, about 99% or greater. By way of example only, a natural amino acid polypeptide or a non-natural
amino acid polypeptide may be purified from a native cell, or host cell in the case of recombinantly
produced natural amino acid polypeptides or non-natural amino acid polypeptides. By way of example a
preparation of a natural amino acid polypeptide or a non-natural amino acid polypeptide may be
"substantially purified" when the preparation contains less than about 30%, less than about 25%, less than
       2                                                                                       4
about    0%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, less than about       %, less than
about 3%, less than about 2%, or less than about 1%(by dry weight) of contaminating material. By way of
example when a natural amino acid polypeptide or a non-natural amino acid polypeptide is recombinantly
produced by host cells, the natural amino acid polypeptide or non-natural amino acid polypeptide may be
                   3             2            2                                              4

about 2%, or about 1% or less of the dry weight of the cells. By way of example when a natural amino
acid polypeptide or a non-natural amino acid polypeptide is recombinantly produced by host cells, the
natural amino acid polypeptide or non-natural amino acid polypeptide may be present in the culture
medium at about 5g/L, about 4g/L, about 3g/L, about 2g/L, about lg/L, about 750mg/L, about 500mg/L,
about 250mg/L, about 100mg/L, about 50mg/L, about 10mg/L, or about lmg/L or less of the dry weight

unsubstituted aryl, including but not limited to, aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens, substituted or
unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or aralkyl groups. When two R groups are attached to
the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered

polypeptides,       modified    non-natural   amino    acid polypeptides,   and reagents    for producing  the
aforementioned compounds) presented herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical
to those recited in the various formulas and structures presented herein, but for the fact that one or more
atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or
mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the present
compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2 H, 3 H,
        4      5
13c,      c,    N,     170, O, 35S, 1F, 36Cl,  respectively. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds described
herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3 H and "C are incorporated, are useful
in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium,
i.e.,  2H,   can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example
increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements.
[00148] Some of the compounds herein (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, non-natural
amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides, and reagents for producing
the aforementioned compounds) have asymmetric carbon atoms and can therefore exist as enantiomers or
diastereomers. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of
their physical chemical differences by methods known, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional
crystallization.     Enantiomers     can be separated by       converting the enantiomeric mixture into a
diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol),
separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the
corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers, and mixtures
thereof are considered as part of the compositions described herein.
[00149] In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein (including, but not limited
to non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid
polypeptides, and reagents for producing the aforementioned compounds) are used in the form of pro
drugs. In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein ((including, but not limited
to non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid
polypeptides,       and reagents for producing the aforementioned compounds) are metabolized upon
administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect,
including a desired therapeutic effect. In further or additional embodiments are active metabolites of non
natural amino acids and "modified or unmodified" non-natural amino acid polypeptides.
[00150] The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides, crystalline forms
(also known as polymorphs), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of non-natural amino acids, non-natural
amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides. In certain embodiments, non
natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid
polypeptides may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the non-natural amino
acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides presented

[00156] It should be understood that a reference to a salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal
forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non
stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the process of crystallization with
pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the
solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different
crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually
have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape,
optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization
solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.
[00157]The screening and characterization of non-natural amino acid polypeptide pharmaceutical
acceptable salts polymorphs and/or solvates may be accomplished using a variety of techniques including,
but not limited to, thermal analysis, x-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, vapor sorption, and microscopy.
Thermal analysis methods address thermo chemical degradation or thermo physical processes including,
but not limited to, polymorphic transitions, and such methods are used to analyze the relationships
between polymorphic forms, determine weight loss, to find the glass transition temperature, or for
excipient compatibility studies. Such methods include, but are not limited to, Differential scanning

                           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[00177] While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it
will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only.
Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without
departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the
invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended that the following
claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and structures within the scope of these claims
and their equivalents be covered thereby.
      I. Introduction
[00178] Recently, an entirely new technology in the protein sciences has been reported, which promises to
overcome many of the limitations associated with site-specific modifications of proteins. Specifically,
new components have been added to the protein biosynthetic machinery of the prokaryote Escherichia
coli (E. coli) (e.g., L. Wang, et al., (2001), Science 292:498-500) and the eukaryote Sacchromyces
cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) (e.g., J. Chin et al., Science 301:964-7 (2003)), which has enabled the
incorporation of non-natural amino acids to proteins in vivo. A number of new amino acids with novel
chemical, physical or biological properties, including photoaffinity labels and photoisomerizable amino
acids, keto amino acids, and glycosylated amino acids have been incorporated efficiently and with high
fidelity into proteins in E. coli and in yeast in response to the amber codon, TAG, using this methodology.
See, e.g., J. W. Chin et al., (2002), Journal of the American Chemical Society 124:9026-9027
(incorporated by reference in its entirety); J. W. Chin, & P. G. Schultz, (2002), ChemBioChem
                                                        56

    WO 2012/166560                                                                PCT/US2012/039472
3(11):1135-1137 (incorporated by reference in its entirety); J. W. Chin, et al., (2002), PNAS United States
of America 99(17):11020-11024 (incorporated by reference in its entirety); and, L. Wang, & P. G.
Schultz, (2002), Chem. Comm., 1-11 (incorporated by reference in its entirety). These studies have
demonstrated that it is possible to selectively and routinely introduce chemical functional groups that are
not found in proteins, that are chemically inert to all of the functional groups found in the 20 common,
genetically-encoded amino acids and that may be used to react efficiently and selectively to form stable
covalent linkages.
      H. Overview
[00179] At one level, described herein are the tools (methods, compositions, techniques) for creating and
using dolastatin linker derivatives or analogs comprising at least one carbonyl, dicarbonyl, oxime,
hydroxylamine, aldehyde, protected aldehyde, ketone, protected ketone, thioester, ester, dicarbonyl,
hydrazine, azide, amidine, imine, diamine, keto-amine, keto-alkyne, alkyne, cycloalkyne, or ene-dione.
At another level, described herein are the tools (methods, compositions, techniques) for creating and using
dolastatin linker derivatives or analogs comprising at least one non-natural amino acid or modified non
natural amino acid with an oxime, aromatic amine, heterocycle (e.g., indole, quinoxaline, phenazine,
pyrazole, triazole, etc.).
[00180].Such dolastatin linker derivatives comprising non-natural amino acids may contain further
functionality, including but not limited to, a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of
polyethylene glycol; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody
fragment; and any combination thereof. Note that the various aforementioned functionalities are not meant
to imply that the members of one functionality cannot be classified as members of another functionality.
Indeed, there will be overlap depending upon the particular circumstances. By way of example only, a
water-soluble polymer overlaps in scope with a derivative of polyethylene glycol, however the overlap is
not complete and thus both functionalities are cited above.
[00181] Provided herein in some embodiments, is a toxic group linker derivative comprising a carbonyl,
dicarbonyl, oxime, hydroxylamine, aldehyde, protected aldehyde, ketone, protected ketone, thioester,
ester, dicarbonyl, hydrazine, azide, amidine, imine, diamine, keto-amine, keto-alkyne,              alkyne,
cycloalkyne, or ene-dione. In some embodiments, the toxic group derivative comprises any of the linkers
disclosed herein.      In other embodiments, described herein are the tools (methods, compositions,
techniques) for creating and using toxic group derivatives or analogs comprising at least one non-natural
amino acid or modified non-natural amino acid with an oxime, aromatic amine, heterocycle (e.g., indole,
quinoxaline, phenazine, pyrazole, triazole, etc.).
[00182] In some embodiments, such toxic derivatives comprising non-natural amino acids may contain
further functionality, including but not limited to, a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of
polyethylene glycol; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody
fragment; and any combination thereof.         In specific embodiments, the toxic group is dolastatin or
auristatin.  In certain specific embodiments, the toxic group is dolastatin-10.       Note that the various
                                                      57

    WO 2012/166560                                                                PCT/US2012/039472
aforementioned functionalities are not meant to imply that the members of one functionality cannot be
classified as members of another functionality. Indeed, there will be overlap depending upon the particular
circumstances. By way of example only, a water-soluble polymer overlaps in scope with a derivative of
polyethylene glycol, however the overlap is not complete and thus both functionalities are cited above.
[00183] Certain embodiments of the present invention describe preparations of certain toxic moieties with
linkers that reduce the toxicity of the moiety in vivo while the toxic moiety retains pharmacological
activity. In some embodiments, the toxicity of the linked toxic group, when administered to an animal or
human, is reduced or eliminated compared to the free toxic group or toxic group derivatives comprising
labile linkages, while retaining pharmacological activity. In some embodiments, increased doses of the
linked toxic group (e.g., dolastatin linker derivatives, non-natural amino acid linked dolastatin derivatives)
may be administered to animals or humans with greater safety. In certain embodiments, the non-natural
amino acid polypeptides linked to a toxic moiety (e.g., dolastatin derivative) provides in vitro and in vivo
stability. In some embodiments, the non-natural amino acid polypeptides linked to a toxic moiety (e.g.,
dolastatin-10 derivative) are efficacious and less toxic compared to the free toxic moiety (e.g., dolastatin
10).
      II.    Dolastatin Linker Derivatives
[00184] At one level, described herein are the tools (methods, compositions, techniques) for creating and
using a dolastatin linker derivatives or analogs comprising at least one non-natural amino acid or modified
non-natural amino acid with a carbonyl, dicarbonyl, oxime or hydroxylamine group. Such dolastatin
linker derivatives comprising non-natural amino acids may contain further functionality, including but not
limited to, a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a second protein or
polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; and any combination thereof. Note
that the various aforementioned functionalities are not meant to imply that the members of one
functionality cannot be classified as members of another functionality. Indeed, there will be overlap
depending upon the particular circumstances. By way of example only, a water-soluble polymer overlaps
in scope with a derivative of polyethylene glycol, however the overlap is not complete and thus both
functionalities are cited above.
[00185] In one aspect are methods for selecting and designing a dolastatin linker derivative to be modified
using the methods, compositions and techniques described herein. The new dolastatin linker derivative
may be designed de novo, including by way of example only, as part of high-throughput screening process
(in which case numerous polypeptides may be designed, synthesized, characterized and/or tested) or based
on the interests of the researcher. The new dolastatin linker derivative may also be designed based on the
structure of a known or partially characterized polypeptide. By way of example only, dolastatin has been
the subject of intense study by the scientific community; a new compound may be designed based on the
structure of dolastatin. The principles for selecting which amino acid(s) to substitute and/or modify are
described separately herein. The choice of which modification to employ is also described herein, and can
be used to meet the need of the experimenter or end user. Such needs may include, but are not limited to,
                                                       58

    WO 2012/166560                                                                 PCT/US2012/039472
manipulating the therapeutic effectiveness of the polypeptide, improving the safety profile of the
polypeptide,   adjusting    the pharmacokinetics,     pharmacologics     and/or pharmacodynamics          of the
polypeptide, such as, by way of example only, increasing water solubility, bioavailability, increasing
serum half-life, increasing therapeutic half-life, modulating immunogenicity, modulating biological
activity, or extending the circulation time. In addition, such modifications include, by way of example
only, providing additional functionality to the polypeptide, incorporating an antibody, and any
combination of the aforementioned modifications.
[00186] Also described herein are dolastatin linker derivatives that have or can be modified to contain an
oxime, carbonyl, dicarbonyl, or hydroxylamine group. Included with this aspect are methods for
producing, purifying, characterizing and using such dolastatin linker derivatives
[00187] The dolastatin linker derivative may contain at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four,
at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, or ten or more of a carbonyl or
dicarbonyl group, oxime group, hydroxylamine group, or protected forms thereof. The dolastatin linker
derivative can be the same or different, for example, there can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more different sites in the derivative that comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more different reactive groups.
             A. Structure and Synthesis of Dolastatin Linker Derivatives:                   Electrophilic     and
                               Nucleophilic Groups
[00188] Dolastatin derivatives with linkers containing a hydroxylamine (also called an aminooxy) group
allow for reaction with a variety of electrophilic groups to form conjugates (including but not limited to,
with PEG or other water soluble polymers). Like hydrazines, hydrazides and semicarbazides, the
enhanced nucleophilicity of the aminooxy group permits it to react efficiently and selectively with a
variety of molecules that contain carbonyl- or dicarbonyl-groups, including but not limited to, ketones,
aldehydes or other functional groups with similar chemical reactivity. See, e.g., Shao, J. and Tam, J., J.
Am. Chem. Soc. 117:3893-3899 (1995); H. Hang and C. Bertozzi, Acc. Chem. Res. 34(9): 727-736
(2001). Whereas the result of reaction with a hydrazine group is the corresponding hydrazone, however,
an oxime results generally from the reaction of an aminooxy group with a carbonyl- or dicarbonyl
containing group such as, by way of example, a ketones, aldehydes or other functional groups with similar
chemical reactivity. In some embodiments, dolastatin derivatives with linkers comprising an azide, alkyne
or cycloalkyne allow for linking of molecules via cycloaddition reactions (e.g., 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions,
azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition, etc.). (Described in U.S. Patent No. 7,807,619 which is incorporated
by reference herein to the extent relative to the reaction).
[00189] Thus, in certain embodiments described herein are dolastatin derivatives with linkers comprising
a hydroxylamine, aldehyde, protected aldehyde, ketone, protected ketone, thioester, ester, dicarbonyl,
hydrazine, amidine, imine, diamine, keto-amine, keto-alkyne, and ene-dione hydroxylamine group, a
hydroxylamine-like group (which has reactivity similar to a hydroxylamine group and is structurally
similar to a hydroxylamine group), a masked hydroxylamine group (which can be readily converted into a

hydroxylamine     group), or a protected hydroxylamine group (which has reactivity similar to a
hydroxylamine group upon deprotection). In some embodiments, the dolastatin derivatives with linkers
comprise azides, alkynes or cycloalkynes.            Such dolastatin linker derivatives include compounds having
the structure of Formula (I), (III), (IV), (V), and (VI):

      IV      NonNatural Amino Acid Derivatives
[00229] The non-natural amino acids used in the methods and compositions described herein have at
least one of the following four properties: (1) at least one functional group on the sidechain of the non
natural amino acid has at least one characteristics and/or activity and/or reactivity orthogonal to the
chemical reactivity of the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids (i.e., alanine, arginine,
asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine,
lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine), or at least
orthogonal to the chemical reactivity of the naturally occurring amino acids present in the polypeptide
that includes the non-natural amino acid; (2) the introduced non-natural amino acids are substantially
chemically inert toward the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids; (3) the non-natural amino acid
can be stably incorporated into a polypeptide, preferably with the stability commensurate with the
naturally-occurring amino acids or under typical physiological conditions, and further preferably such
incorporation can occur via an in vivo system; and (4) the non-natural amino acid includes an oxime
                                                      78

    WO 2012/166560                                                               PCT/US2012/039472
functional group or a functional group that can be transformed into an oxime group by reacting with a
reagent, preferably under conditions that do not destroy the biological properties of the polypeptide that
includes the non-natural amino acid (unless of course such a destruction of biological properties is the
purpose of the modification/transformation), or where the transformation can occur under aqueous
conditions at a pH between about 4 and about 8, or where the reactive site on the non-natural amino acid
is an electrophilic site. Any number of non-natural amino acids can be introduced into the polypeptide.
Non-natural amino acids may also include protected or masked oximes or protected or masked groups that
can be transformed into an oxime group after deprotection of the protected group or unmasking of the
masked group. Non-natural amino acids may also include protected or masked carbonyl or dicarbonyl
groups, which can be transformed into a carbonyl or dicarbonyl group after deprotection of the protected
group or unmasking of the masked group and thereby are available to react with hydroxylamines or
oximes to form oxime groups.
[00230]      Non-natural amino acids that may be used in the methods and compositions described herein
include, but are not limited to, amino acids comprising a amino acids with novel functional groups, amino
acids that covalently or noncovalently interact with other molecules, glycosylated amino acids such as a
sugar substituted serine, other carbohydrate modified amino acids, keto-containing amino acids, aldehyde
containing amino acids, amino acids comprising polyethylene glycol or other polyethers, heavy atom
substituted amino acids, chemically cleavable and/or photocleavable amino acids, amino acids with an
elongated side chains as compared to natural amino acids, including but not limited to, polyethers or long
chain hydrocarbons, including but not limited to, greater than about 5 or greater than about 10 carbons,
carbon-linked sugar-containing amino acids, redox-active amino acids, amino thioacid containing amino
acids, and amino acids comprising one or more toxic moiety.
[00231]      In some embodiments, non-natural amino acids comprise a saccharide moiety. Examples of
such amino acids include N-acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-serine, N-acetyl-L-galactosaminyl-L-serine,           N
acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-threonine,      N-acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-asparagine     and   O-mannosaminyl-L
serine. Examples of such amino acids also include examples where the naturally-occurring N- or 0
linkage between the amino acid and the saccharide is replaced by a covalent linkage not commonly found
in nature - including but not limited to, an alkene, an oxime, a thioether, an amide and the like. Examples
of such amino acids also include saccharides that are not commonly found in naturally-occurring proteins
such as 2-deoxy-glucose, 2-deoxygalactose and the like.
[00232]      The chemical moieties incorporated into polypeptides via incorporation of non-natural amino
acids into such polypeptides offer a variety of advantages and manipulations of polypeptides. For
example, the unique reactivity of a carbonyl or dicarbonyl functional group (including a keto- or
aldehyde- functional group) allows selective modification of proteins with any of a number of hydrazine
or hydroxylamine-containing reagents in vivo and in vitro. A heavy atom non-natural amino acid, for
example, can be useful for phasing x-ray structure data. The site-specific introduction of heavy atoms
using non-natural amino acids also provides selectivity and flexibility in choosing positions for heavy

atoms. Photoreactive non-natural amino acids (including but not limited to, amino acids with
benzophenone and arylazides (including but not limited to, phenylazide) side chains), for example, allow
for efficient in vivo and in vitro photocrosslinking of polypeptides. Examples of photoreactive non-natural
amino acids include, but are not limited to, p-azido-phenylalanine and p-benzoyl-phenylalanine. The
polypeptide with the photoreactive non-natural amino acids may then be crosslinked at will by excitation
of the photoreactive group-providing temporal control. In a non-limiting example, the methyl group of a
non-natural amino can be substituted with an isotopically labeled, including but not limited to, with a
methyl group, as a probe of local structure and dynamics, including but not limited to, with the use of
nuclear magnetic resonance and vibrational spectroscopy.
              A. Structure and Synthesis of Non-Natural Amino Acid Derivatives: Carbonyl, Carbonyl
                                like, Masked Carbonyl, and Protected Carbonyl Groups
[00233] Amino acids with an electrophilic reactive group allow for a variety of reactions to link molecules
via various chemical reactions, including, but not limited to, nucleophilic addition reactions. Such
electrophilic reactive groups include a carbonyl- or dicarbonyl-group (including a keto- or aldehyde
group), a carbonyl-like- or dicarbonyl-like-group (which has reactivity similar to a carbonyl- or
dicarbonyl-group and is structurally similar to a carbonyl- or dicarbonyl-group), a masked carbonyl- or
masked dicarbonyl-group (which can be readily converted into a carbonyl- or dicarbonyl-group), or a
protected carbonyl- or protected dicarbonyl-group (which has reactivity similar to a carbonyl- or
dicarbonyl-group upon deprotection). Such amino acids include amino acids having the structure of

[00266]       The carbonyl or dicarbonyl functionality can be reacted selectively with a hydroxylamine
containing reagent under mild conditions in aqueous solution to form the corresponding oxime linkage
that is stable under physiological conditions. See, e.g., Jencks, W. P., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 81, 475-481
(1959); Shao, J. and Tam, J. P., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117(14):3893-3899 (1995). Moreover, the unique
reactivity of the carbonyl or dicarbonyl group allows for selective modification in the presence of the
other amino acid side chains. See, e.g., Cornish, V. W., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118:8150-8151 (1996);
Geoghegan, K. F. & Stroh, J. G., Bioconjug. Chem. 3:138-146 (1992); Mahal, L. K., et al., Science
276:1125-1128 (1997).
[00267]       The synthesis of p-acetyl-(+/-)-phenylalanine and m-acetyl-(+/-)-phenylalanine is described in
Zhang, Z., et al., Biochemistry 42: 6735-6746 (2003), incorporated by reference. Other carbonyl- or
dicarbonyl-containing amino acids can be similarly prepared.
[00268]       In some embodiments, a polypeptide comprising a non-natural amino acid is chemically
modified to generate a reactive carbonyl or dicarbonyl functional group. For instance, an aldehyde
                                                       100

functionality useful for conjugation reactions can be generated from a functionality having adjacent amino
and hydroxyl groups. Where the biologically active molecule is a polypeptide, for example, an N-terminal
serine or threonine (which may be normally present or may be exposed via chemical or enzymatic
digestion) can be used to generate an aldehyde functionality under mild oxidative cleavage conditions
using periodate. See, e.g., Gaertner, et. al., Bioconjug. Chem. 3: 262-268 (1992); Geoghegan, K. & Stroh,
J., Bioconjug. Chem. 3:138-146 (1992); Gaertner et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:7224-7230 (1994). However,
methods known in the art are restricted to the amino acid at the N-terminus of the peptide or protein.
[00269]      Additionally, by way of example a non-natural amino acid bearing adjacent hydroxyl and
amino groups can be incorporated into a polypeptide as a "masked" aldehyde functionality. For example,
5-hydroxylysine bears a hydroxyl group adjacent to the epsilon amine. Reaction conditions for generating
the aldehyde typically involve addition of molar excess of sodium metaperiodate under mild conditions to

7.0. A typical reaction involves the addition of about 1.5 molar excess of sodium meta periodate to a
buffered solution of the polypeptide, followed by incubation for about 10 minutes in the dark. See, e.g.

[00270] Amino acids with an electrophilic reactive group allow for a variety of reactions to link molecules
via nucleophilic addition reactions among others. Such electrophilic reactive groups include a dicarbonyl
group (including a diketone group, a ketoaldehyde group, a ketoacid group, a ketoester group, and a
ketothioester group), a dicarbonyl-like group (which has reactivity similar to a dicarbonyl group and is
structurally similar to a dicarbonyl group), a masked dicarbonyl group (which can be readily converted
into a dicarbonyl group), or a protected dicarbonyl group (which has reactivity similar to a dicarbonyl
group upon deprotection). Such amino acids include amino acids having the structure of Formula

[00277]         Amino acids with a nucleophilic reactive group allow for a variety of reactions to link
molecules via electrophilic addition reactions among others. Such nucleophilic reactive groups include a
diamine group (including a hydrazine group, an amidine group, an imine group, a 1,1-diamine group, a
1,2-diamine group, a 1,3-diamine group, and a 1,4-diamine group), a diamine-like group (which has
reactivity similar to a diamine group and is structurally similar to a diamine group), a masked diamine
group (which can be readily converted into a diamine group), or a protected diamine group (which has
reactivity similar to a diamine group upon deprotection). In some embodiments, amino acids containing
reactive groups with azides allow for linking of molecules via cycloaddition reactions (e.g., 1,3-dipolar
cycloadditions, azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition, etc.).
[00278]         In another aspect are methods for the chemical synthesis of hydrazine-substituted molecules
for the derivatization of carbonyl-substituted dolastatin derivatives. In one embodiment, the hydrazine
substituted molecule can dolastatin linked derivatives. In one embodiment are methods for the preparation
of hydrazine-substituted molecules suitable for the derivatization of carbonyl-containing non-natural
amino acid polypeptides, including by way of example only, ketone-, or aldehyde-containing non-natural
amino acid polypeptides. In a further or additional embodiment, the non-natural amino acids are
incorporated site-specifically during the in vivo translation of proteins. In a further or additional
embodiment, the hydrazine-substituted dolastatin derivatives allow for the site-specific derivatization of
carbonyl-containing non-natural amino acids via nucleophilic attack of each carbonyl group to form a
heterocycle-derivatized polypeptide, including a nitrogen-containing heterocycle-derivatized polypeptide
in a site-specific fashion. In a further or additional embodiment, the method for the preparation of
hydrazine-substituted dolastatin derivatives provides access to a wide variety of site-specifically
derivatized polypeptides. In a further or additional embodiment are methods for synthesizing hydrazine
functionalized polyethyleneglycol (PEG) linked dolastatin derivatives.

      V. Non-Natural Amino Acid Linked Dolastatin Derivatives
[00291] In another aspect described herein are methods, strategies and techniques for incorporating at least
one such dolastatin linker derivatives into a non-natural amino acid. Also included with this aspect are
methods for producing, purifying, characterizing and using such dolastatin linker derivatives containing at
least one such non-natural amino acid. Also included with this aspect are compositions of and methods for
producing, purifying, characterizing and using oligonucleotides (including DNA and RNA) that can be
used to produce, at least in part, a dolastatin linker derivative containing at least one non-natural amino
acid. Also included with this aspect are compositions of and methods for producing, purifying,
characterizing and using cells that can express such oligonucleotides that can be used to produce, at least
in part, a dolastatin linker derivative containing at least one non-natural amino acid.
[00292] Thus, dolastatin linker derivatives comprising at least one non-natural amino acid or modified
non-natural amino acid with a carbonyl, dicarbonyl, alkyne, cycloalkyne, azide, oxime or hydroxylamine
group are provided and described herein. In certain embodiments, dolastatin linker derivatives with at
least one non-natural amino acid or modified non-natural amino acid with a carbonyl, dicarbonyl, alkyne,
cycloalkyne, azide, oxime or hydroxylamine group include at least one post-translational modification at
some position on the polypeptide. In some embodiments the co-translational or post-translational
modification occurs via the cellular machinery (e.g.,            glycosylation, acetylation, acylation, lipid
modification, palmitoylation, palmitate addition, phosphorylation, glycolipid-linkage modification, and
the like), in many instances, such cellular-machinery-based co-translational or post-translational
modifications occur at the naturally occurring amino acid sites on the polypeptide, however, in certain
embodiments, the cellular-machinery-based co-translational or post-translational modifications occur on
the non-natural amino acid site(s) on the polypeptide.
[00293] In other embodiments, the post-translational modification does not utilize the cellular machinery,
but the functionality is instead provided by attachment of a molecule (a polymer; a water-soluble polymer;
a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or
antibody fragment; and any combination thereof) comprising a second reactive group to the at least one
non-natural amino acid comprising a first reactive group (including but not limited to, non-natural amino
acid containing a ketone, aldehyde, acetal, hemiacetal, alkyne, cycloalkyne, azide, oxime, or
hydroxylamine functional group) utilizing chemistry methodology described herein, or others suitable for
                                                        117

the particular reactive groups. In certain embodiments, the co-translational or post-translational
modification is made in vivo in a eukaryotic cell or in a non-eukaryotic cell. In certain embodiments, the
post-translational modification is made in vitro not utilizing the cellular machinery. Also included with
this aspect are methods for producing, purifying, characterizing and using such dolastatin linker
derivatives containing at least one such co-translationally or post-translationally modified non-natural
amino acids.
[00294] Also included within the scope of the methods, compositions, strategies and techniques described
herein are reagents capable of reacting with a dolastatin linker derivative (containing a carbonyl or
dicarbonyl group, oxime group, alkyne, cycloalkyne, azide, hydroxylamine group, or masked or protected
forms thereof) that is part of a polypeptide so as to produce any of the aforementioned post-translational
modifications. In certain embodiments, the resulting post-translationally modified dolastatin linker
derivative will contain at least one oxime group; the resulting modified oxime-containing dolastatin linker
derivative may undergo subsequent modification reactions. Also included with this aspect are methods for
producing, purifying, characterizing and using such reagents that are capable of any such post
translational modifications of such dolastatin linker derivative(s).
[00295] In certain embodiments, the polypeptide or non-natural amino acid linked dolastatin derivative
includes at least one co-translational or post-translational modification that is made in vivo by one host
cell, where the post-translational modification is not normally made by another host cell type. In certain
embodiments, the polypeptide includes at least one co-translational or post-translational modification that
is made in vivo by a eukaryotic cell, where the co-translational or post-translational modification is not
normally made by a non-eukaryotic cell. Examples of such co-translational or post-translational
modifications include, but are not limited to, glycosylation, acetylation, acylation, lipid-modification,
palmitoylation, palmitate addition, phosphorylation, glycolipid-linkage modification, and the like. In one
embodiment, the co-translational or post-translational modification comprises attachment of an
oligosaccharide to an asparagine by a GlcNAc-asparagine linkage (including but not limited to, where the
oligosaccharide comprises (GlcNAc-Man) 2-Man-GlcNAc-GlcNAc, and the like). In another embodiment,
the co-translational or post-translational modification comprises attachment of an oligosaccharide
(including but not limited to, Gal-GalNAc, Gal-GlcNAc, etc.) to a shrine or threonine by a GalNAc
serine, a GalNAc-threonine, a GlcNAc-serine, or a GlcNAc-threonine linkage. In certain embodiments, a
protein or polypeptide can comprise a secretion or localization sequence, an epitope tag, a FLAG tag, a
polyhistidine tag, a GST fusion, and/or the like. Also included with this aspect are methods for producing,
purifying, characterizing and using such polypeptides containing at least one such co-translational or post
translational modification. In other embodiments, the glycosylated non-natural amino acid polypeptide is
produced in a non-glycosylated form. Such a non-glycosylated form of a glycosylated non-natural amino
acid may be produced by methods that include chemical or enzymatic removal of oligosaccharide groups
from an isolated or substantially purified or unpurified glycosylated non-natural amino acid polypeptide;
production of the non-natural amino acid in a host that does not glycosylate such a non-natural amino acid

             A.   Chemical Synthesis of Non-Natural Amino Acid Linked Dolastatin Derivatives: Oxime
                             Containing Linked Dolastatin Derivatives
[00297] Non-natural amino acid dolastatin linked derivatives containing an oxime group allow for reaction
with a variety of reagents that contain certain reactive carbonyl- or dicarbonyl- groups (including but not
limited to, ketones, aldehydes, or other groups with similar reactivity) to form new non-natural amino
acids comprising a new oxime group. Such an oxime exchange reaction allows for the further
functionalization of dolastatin linked derivatives. Further, the original dolastatin linked derivative
containing an oxime group may be useful in their own right as long as the oxime linkage is stable under
conditions necessary to incorporate the amino acid into a polypeptide (e.g., the in vivo, in vitro and
chemical synthetic methods described herein).
[00298] Thus, in certain embodiments described herein are non-natural amino acid dolastatin linked
derivatives with sidechains comprising an oxime group, an oxime-like group (which has reactivity similar
to an oxime group and is structurally similar to an oxime group), a masked oxime group (which can be
readily converted into an oxime group), or a protected oxime group (which has reactivity similar to an
oxime group upon deprotection).
[00299] Such non-natural amino acid dolastatin linked derivatives include dolastatin linked derivatives
having the structure of Formula (VIII) or (IX):

In certain embodiments of compounds of Formula (X), (XI), (XII) or (XIII), the antibody is herceptin.
[00321]      In certain embodiments, compounds of Formula (X), (XI), (XII) or (XIII) are stable in
aqueous solution for at least 1 month under mildly acidic conditions. In certain embodiments, compounds
of Formula (X), (XI), (XII) or (XIII) are stable for at least 2 weeks under mildly acidic conditions. In

amino acids may be in the form of a salt, or may be incorporated into a non-natural amino acid
polypeptide, polymer, polysaccharide, or a polynucleotide and optionally post translationally modified.
[00322]      Oxime-based non-natural amino acids may be synthesized by methods already described in
the art, or by methods described herein, including: (a) reaction of a hydroxylamine-containing non-natural
amino acid with a carbonyl- or dicarbonyl-containing reagent; (b) reaction of a carbonyl- or dicarbonyl

             B. Chemical Structure and Synthesis of Non-Natural Amino Acid Linked Dolastatin
                             Derivatives: Alkylated Aromatic Amine Linked Dolastatin Derivatives
[00323]     In one aspect are dolastatin linker derivatives for the chemical derivatization of non-natural
amino acids based upon the reactivity of an aromatic amine group. In further or additional embodiments,
at least one of the aforementioned non-natural amino acids is incorporated into a dolastatin linker
derivative, that is, such embodiments are non-natural amino acid linked dolastatin derivatives. In further
or additional embodiments, the dolastatin linker derivatives are functionalized on their sidechains such
that their reaction with a derivatizing non-natural amino acid generates an amine linkage. In further or
additional embodiments, the dolastatin linker derivatives are selected from dolastatin linker derivatives
having aromatic amine sidechains. In further or additional embodiments, the dolastatin linker derivatives
comprise a masked sidechain, including a masked aromatic amine group. In further or additional
embodiments, the non-natural amino acids are selected from amino acids having aromatic amine
sidechains. In further or additional embodiments, the non-natural amino acids comprise a masked
sidechain, including a masked aromatic amine group.
[00324]     In another aspect are carbonyl-substituted dolastatin linker derivatives such as, by way of
example, aldehydes, and ketones, for the production of derivatized non-natural amino acid polypeptides
based upon an amine linkage. In a further embodiment are aldehyde-substituted dolastatin linker
derivatives used to derivatize aromatic amine-containing non-natural amino acid polypeptides via the
formation of an amine linkage between the derivatizing dolastatin linker and the aromatic amine
containing non-natural amino acid polypeptide.

[00325]     In further or additional embodiments, the non-natural amino acids comprise aromatic amine
sidechains where the aromatic amine is selected from an aryl amine or a heteroaryl amine. In a further or
additional embodiment, the non-natural amino acids resemble a natural amino acid in structure but contain
aromatic amine groups. In another or further embodiment the non-natural amino acids resemble
phenylalanine or tyrosine (aromatic amino acids). In one embodiment, the non-natural amino acids have
properties that are distinct from those of the natural amino acids. In one embodiment, such distinct
properties are the chemical reactivity of the sidechain; in a further embodiment this distinct chemical
reactivity permits the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid to undergo a reaction while being a unit of a
polypeptide even though the sidechains of the naturally-occurring amino acid units in the same
polypeptide do not undergo the aforementioned reaction. In a further embodiment, the sidechain of the
non-natural amino acid has a chemistry orthogonal to those of the naturally-occurring amino acids. In a
further embodiment, the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid comprises a nucleophile-containing
moiety; in a further embodiment, the nucleophile-containing moiety on the sidechain of the non-natural
amino acid can undergo a reaction to generate an amine-linked derivatized dolastatin. In a further
embodiment, the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid comprises an electrophile-containing moiety; in
a further embodiment, the electrophile-containing moiety on the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid
can undergo nucleophilic attack to generate an amine-linked derivatized dolastatin. In any of the
aforementioned embodiments in this paragraph, the non-natural amino acid may exist as a separate
molecule or may be incorporated into a polypeptide of any length; if the latter, then the polypeptide may
further incorporate naturally-occurring or non-natural amino acids.
[00326]     Modification of non-natural amino acids described herein using reductive alkylation or
reductive amination reactions have any or all of the following advantages. First, aromatic amines can be
reductively alkylated with carbonyl-containing compounds, including aldehydes, and ketones, in a pH
range of about 4 to about 10 (and in certain embodiments in a pH range of about 4 to about 7) to generate
substituted amine, including secondary and tertiary amine, linkages. Second, under these reaction
conditions the chemistry is selective for non-natural amino acids as the sidechains of naturally occurring
amino acids are unreactive. This allows for site-specific derivatization of polypeptides which have
incorporated non-natural amino acids containing aromatic amine moieties or protected aldehyde moieties,
including, by way of example, recombinant proteins. Such derivatized polypeptides and proteins can
thereby be prepared as defined homogeneous products. Third, the mild conditions needed to effect the
reaction of an aromatic amine moiety on an amino acid, which has been incorporated into a polypeptide,
with an aldehyde-containing reagent generally do not irreversibly destroy the tertiary structure of the
polypeptide (excepting, of course, where the purpose of the reaction is to destroy such tertiary structure).
Similarly, the mild conditions needed to effect the reaction of an aldehyde moiety on an amino acid,
which has been incorporated into a polypeptide and deprotected, with an aromatic amine-containing
reagent generally do not irreversibly destroy the tertiary structure of the polypeptide (excepting, of course,
where the purpose of the reaction is to destroy such tertiary structure). Fourth, the reaction occurs rapidly
                                                      128

at room temperature, which allows the use of many types of polypeptides or reagents that would otherwise
be unstable at higher temperatures. Fifth, the reaction occurs readily is aqueous conditions, again allowing
use of polypeptides and reagents incompatible (to any extent) with non-aqueous solutions. Six, the
reaction occurs readily even when the ratio of polypeptide or amino acid to reagent is stoichiometric,
stoichiometric-like, or near-stoichiometric, so that it is unnecessary to add excess reagent or polypeptide
to obtain a useful amount of reaction product. Seventh, the resulting amine can be produced
regioselectively and/or regiospecifically, depending upon the design of the amine and carbonyl portions of
the reactants. Finally, the reductive alkylation of aromatic amines with aldehyde-containing reagents, and
the reductive amination of aldehydes with aromatic amine containing reagents, generates amine, including
secondary and tertiary amine, linkages which are stable under biological conditions.
[00327]     Non-natural amino acids with nucleophilic reactive groups, such as, by way of example only,
an aromatic amine group (including secondary and tertiary amine groups), a masked aromatic amine
group (which can be readily converted into a aromatic amine group), or a protected aromatic amine group
(which has reactivity similar to a aromatic amine group upon deprotection) allow for a variety of reactions
to link molecules via various reactions, including but not limited to, reductive alkylation reactions with
aldehyde containing dolastatin linked derivatives. Such alkylated non-natural amino acid linked dolastatin
derivatives include amino acids having the structure of Formula (XXV), (XXVI), (XXVII), (XXVIII),
(XXIX), or (XXX):

amino acids having dicarbonyl and/or diamine sidechains. In further or additional embodiments, the non
natural amino acids comprise a masked sidechain, including a masked diamine group and/or a masked
dicarbonyl group. In further or additional embodiments, the non-natural amino acids comprise a group
selected from: keto-amine (i.e., a group containing both a ketone and an amine); keto-alkyne (i.e., a group
containing both a ketone and an alkyne); and an ene-dione (i.e., a group containing a dicarbonyl group and
an alkene).
[00342]     In further or additional embodiments, the non-natural amino acids comprise dicarbonyl
sidechains where the carbonyl is selected from a ketone, an aldehyde, a carboxylic acid, or an ester,
including a thioester. In another embodiment are non-natural amino acids containing a functional group
that is capable of forming a heterocycle, including a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, upon treatment with
an appropriately functionalized reagent. In a further or additional embodiment, the non-natural amino
acids resemble a natural amino acid in structure but contain one of the aforementioned functional groups.
In another or further embodiment the non-natural amino acids resemble phenylalanine or tyrosine
(aromatic amino acids); while in a separate embodiment, the non-natural amino acids resemble alanine
and leucine (hydrophobic amino acids). In one embodiment, the non-natural amino acids have properties
that are distinct from those of the natural amino acids. In one embodiment, such distinct properties are the

heterocycle-derivatized protein. In any of the aforementioned embodiments in this paragraph, the non
natural amino acid may exist as a separate molecule or may be incorporated into a polypeptide of any
length; if the latter, then the polypeptide may further incorporate naturally-occurring or non-natural amino
acids.

[00349]      Provided herein in certain embodiments are derivatizing molecules for the production of toxic
compounds comprising non-natural amino acid polypeptides based upon triazole linkages.              In some
embodiments, the reaction between the first and second reactive groups can proceed via a dipolarophile
reaction. In certain embodiments, the first reactive group can be an azide and the second reactive group
can be an alkyne. In further or alternative embodiments, the first reactive group can be an alkyne and the
second reactive group can be an azide. In some embodiments, the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction (see,
e.g., Huisgen, in 1,3-DIPOLAR CYCLOADDITION CHEMISTRY, (ed. Padwa, A., 1984), p. 1-176)
provides for the incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acids bearing azide and alkyne-containing
side chains permits the resultant polypeptides to be modified with extremely high selectivity. In certain
embodiments, both the azide and the alkyne functional groups are inert toward the twenty common amino
acids found in naturally-occurring polypeptides.            When brought into close proximity, however, the
"spring-loaded" nature of the azide and alkyne groups is revealed and they react selectively and efficiently
via Huisgen [3 2] cycloaddition reaction to generate the corresponding triazole. See, e.g., Chin et al.,
Science 301:964-7 (2003); Wang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 125, 3192-3193 (2003); Chin et al., J. Am.
Chem. Soc., 124:9026-9027 (2002).             Cycloaddition reaction involving azide or alkyne-containing
polypeptides can be carried out at room temperature under aqueous conditions by the addition of Cu(II)
(e.g., in the form of a catalytic amount of CuSO 4 ) in the presence of a reducing agent for reducing Cu(II)
to Cu(I), in situ, in catalytic amount. See, e.g., Wang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 3192-3193 (2003);

(2002). Preferred reducing agents include ascorbate, metallic copper, quinine, hydroquinone, vitamin K,
glutathione, cysteine, Fe 2 , Co 2, and an applied electric potential.

[00362]     Compounds of Formula (XXXI), (XXXII), (XXXIII), (XXXIV), (XXXV), or (XXXVI) may
be formed by the reductive alkylation of aromatic amine compounds with carbonyl containing reagents
such as, by way of example, ketones, esters, thioesters, and aldehydes.
[00363] The formation of such non-natural amino acid heterocycle-linked dolastatin derivatives having the
structure of Formula (XXXI), (XXXII), (XXXIII), (XXXIV), (XXXV), or (XXXVI) includes, but is not
limited to, (i) reactions of diamine-containing non-natural amino acids with dicarbonyl-containing
dolastatin linked derivatives or reactions of diamine-containing non-natural amino acids with ketoalkyne
containing dolastatin linked derivatives, (ii) reactions of dicarbonyl-containing non-natural amino acids
with either diamine-containing dolastatin linked derivatives or reactions of dicarbonyl-containing non
natural amino acids with ketoamine-containing dolastatin linked derivatives, (iii) reactions of ketoalkyne
containing non-natural amino acids with diamine-containing dolastatin linked derivatives, or (iv) reactions
of ketoamine-containing non-natural amino acids with dicarbonyl-containing v.
[00364] Modification of dolastatin linked derivatives described herein with such reactions have any or all
of the following advantages. First, diamines undergo condensation with dicarbonyl-containing compounds
in a pH range of about 5 to about 8 (and in further embodiments in a pH range of about 4 to about 10, in
other embodiments in a pH range of about 3 to about 8, in other embodiments in a pH range of about 4 to
about 9, and in further embodiments a pH range of about 4 to about 9, in other embodiments a pH of
about 4, and in yet another embodiment a pH of about 8) to generate heterocycle, including a nitrogen
containing heterocycle, linkages. Under these conditions, the sidechains of the naturally occurring amino
acids are unreactive. Second, such selective chemistry makes possible the site-specific derivatization of
recombinant proteins: derivatized proteins can now be prepared as defined homogeneous products. Third,
the mild conditions needed to effect the reaction of the diamines described herein with the dicarbonyl
containing polypeptides described herein generally do not irreversibly destroy the tertiary structure of the
polypeptide (excepting, of course, where the purpose of the reaction is to destroy such tertiary structure).
Fourth, the reaction occurs rapidly at room temperature, which allows the use of many types of
polypeptides or reagents that would be unstable at higher temperatures. Fifth, the reaction occurs readily
is aqueous conditions, again allowing use of polypeptides and reagents incompatible (to any extent) with
non-aqueous solutions. Six, the reaction occurs readily even when the ratio of polypeptide or amino acid
to reagent is stoichiometric, near stoichiometric, or stoichiometric-like, so that it is unnecessary to add
excess reagent or polypeptide to obtain a useful amount of reaction product. Seventh, the resulting
heterocycle can be produced regioselectively and/or regiospecifically, depending upon the design of the
                                                      145

diamine and dicarbonyl portions of the reactants. Finally, the condensation of diamines with dicarbonyl
containing molecules generates heterocycle, including a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, linkages which
are stable under biological conditions.
      VI.    Location of non-natural amino acids in dolastatin linker derivatives
[00365] The methods and compositions described herein include incorporation of one or more non-natural
amino acids into a dolastatin linker derivative. One or more non-natural amino acids may be incorporated
at one or more particular positions which do not disrupt activity of the dolastatin linker derivative. This
can be achieved by making "conservative" substitutions, including but not limited to, substituting
hydrophobic amino acids with non-natural or natural hydrophobic amino acids, bulky amino acids with
non-natural or natural bulky amino acids, hydrophilic amino acids with non-natural or natural hydrophilic
amino acids) and/or inserting the non-natural amino acid in a location that is not required for activity.
[00366] A variety of biochemical and structural approaches can be employed to select the desired sites for
substitution with a non-natural amino acid within the dolastatin linker derivative. In some embodiments,
the non-natural amino acid is linked at the C-terminus of the dolastatin derivative. In other embodiments,
the non-natural amino acid is linked at the N-terminus of the dolastatin derivative. Any position of the
dolastatin linker derivative is suitable for selection to incorporate a non-natural amino acid, and selection
may be based on rational design or by random selection for any or no particular desired purpose. Selection
of desired sites may be based on producing a non-natural amino acid polypeptide (which may be further
modified or remain unmodified) having any desired property or activity, including but not limited to a
receptor binding modulators, receptor activity modulators, modulators of binding to binder partners,
binding partner activity modulators, binding partner conformation modulators, dimer or multimer
formation, no change to activity or property compared to the native molecule, or manipulating any
physical or chemical property of the polypeptide such as solubility, aggregation, or stability.
Alternatively, the sites identified as critical to biological activity may also be good candidates for
substitution with a non-natural amino acid, again depending on the desired activity sought for the
polypeptide. Another alternative would be to simply make serial substitutions in each position on the
polypeptide chain with a non-natural amino acid and observe the effect on the activities of the
polypeptide. Any means, technique, or method for selecting a position for substitution with a non-natural
amino acid into any polypeptide is suitable for use in the methods, techniques and compositions described
herein.
[00367] The structure and activity of naturally-occurring mutants of a polypeptide that contain deletions
can also be examined to determine regions of the protein that are likely to be tolerant of substitution with
a non-natural amino acid. Once residues that are likely to be intolerant to substitution with non-natural
amino acids have been eliminated, the impact of proposed substitutions at each of the remaining positions
can be examined using methods including, but not limited to, the three-dimensional structure of the
relevant polypeptide, and any associated ligands or binding proteins. X-ray crystallographic and NMR
structures of many polypeptides are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, www Vesb)org), a
                                                       146

    WO 2012/166560                                                                  PCT/US2012/039472
centralized database containing three-dimensional structural data of large molecules of proteins and
nucleic acids, one can be used to identify amino acid positions that can be substituted with non-natural
amino acids. . In addition, models may be made investigating the secondary and tertiary structure of
polypeptides, if three-dimensional structural data is not available. Thus, the identity of amino acid
positions that can be substituted with non-natural amino acids can be readily obtained.
[00368] Exemplary sites of incorporation of a non-natural amino acid include, but are not limited to, those
that are excluded from potential receptor binding regions, or regions for binding to binding proteins or
ligands may be fully or partially solvent exposed, have minimal or no hydrogen-bonding interactions with
nearby residues, may be minimally exposed to nearby reactive residues, and/or may be in regions that are
highly flexible as predicted by the three-dimensional crystal structure of a particular polypeptide with its
associated receptor, ligand or binding proteins.
[00369] A wide variety of non-natural amino acids can be substituted for, or incorporated into, a given
position in a polypeptide. By way of example, a particular non-natural amino acid may be selected for
incorporation based on an examination of the three dimensional crystal structure of a polypeptide with its
associated ligand, receptor and/or binding proteins, a preference for conservative substitutions
[00370] In one embodiment, the methods described herein include incorporating into the dolastatin linker
derivative, where the dolastatin linker derivative comprises a first reactive group; and contacting the
dolastatin linker derivative with a molecule (including but not limited to a second protein or polypeptide
or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; and any combination thereof) that comprises a
second reactive group. In certain embodiments, the first reactive group is a hydroxylamine moiety and the
second reactive group is a carbonyl or dicarbonyl moiety, whereby an oxime linkage is formed. In certain
embodiments, the first reactive group is a carbonyl or dicarbonyl moiety and the second reactive group is
a hydroxylamine moiety, whereby an oxime linkage is formed. In certain embodiments, the first reactive
group is a carbonyl or dicarbonyl moiety and the second reactive group is an oxime moiety, whereby an
oxime exchange reaction occurs. In certain embodiments, the first reactive group is an oxime moiety and
the second reactive group is carbonyl or dicarbonyl moiety, whereby an oxime exchange reaction occurs.
[00371]In some cases, the dolastatin linker derivative incorporation(s) will be combined with other
additions, substitutions, or deletions within the polypeptide to affect other chemical, physical,
pharmacologic and/or biological traits. In some cases, the other additions, substitutions or deletions may
increase the stability (including but not limited to, resistance to proteolytic degradation) of the polypeptide
or increase affinity of the polypeptide for its appropriate receptor, ligand and/or binding proteins. In some
cases, the other additions, substitutions or deletions may increase the solubility (including but not limited
to, when expressed in E. coli or other host cells) of the polypeptide. In some embodiments sites are
selected for substitution with a naturally encoded or non-natural amino acid in addition to another site for
incorporation of a non-natural amino acid for the purpose of increasing the polypeptide solubility
following expression in E. coli, or other recombinant host cells. In some embodiments, the polypeptides
comprise another addition, substitution, or deletion that modulates affinity for the associated ligand,

poly-His) or other affinity based sequences (including but not limited to, FLAG, poly-His, GST, etc.) or
linked molecules (including but not limited to, biotin) that improve detection (including but not limited to,

segment of the HER2/neu receptor. The HER2 gene (also known as HER2/neu and ErbB2 gene) is
amplified in 20-30% of early-stage breast cancers, which makes it overexpressed. Also, in cancer, HER2
may send signals without mitogens arriving and binding to any receptor, making it overactive.
[00376] HER2 extends through the cell membrane, and carries signals from outside the cell to the inside.
In healthy people, signaling compounds called mitogens arrive at the cell membrane, and bind to the
outside part of other members of the HER family of receptors. Those bound receptors then link (dimerize)
with HER2, activating it. HER2 then sends a signal to the inside of the cell. The signal passes through
different biochemical pathways. This includes the PI3K/Akt pathway and the MAPK pathway. These
signals promote invasion, survival and growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis) of cells.
[00377] Cells treated with trastuzumab undergo arrest during the Gi phase of the cell cycle so there is
reduced proliferation. It has been suggested that trastuzumab induces some of its effect by downregulation
of HER2/neu leading to disruption of receptor dimerization and signaling through the downstream P13K
cascade. P27Kipl is then not phosphorylated and is able to enter the nucleus and inhibit cdk2 activity,
causing cell cycle arrest. Also, trastuzumab suppresses angiogenesis by both induction of antiangiogenic
factors and repression of proangiogenic factors. It is thought that a contribution to the unregulated growth
observed in cancer could be due to proteolytic cleavage of HER2/neu that results in the release of the
extracellular domain. Trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit HER2/neu ectodomain cleavage in breast
cancer cells.

      VIII. Cellular uptake of non-natural amino acids
[00378]       Non-natural amino acid uptake by a eukaryotic cell is one issue that is typically considered
when designing and selecting non-natural amino acids, including but not limited to, for incorporation into
a protein. For example, the high charge density of a-amino acids suggests that these compounds are
unlikely to be cell permeable. Natural amino acids are taken up into the eukaryotic cell via a collection of
protein-based transport systems. A rapid screen can be done which assesses which non-natural amino
acids, if any, are taken up by cells (examples 15 & 16 herein illustrate non-limiting examples of tests
which can be done on non-natural amino acids). See, e.g., the toxicity assays in, e.g., the U.S. Patent
Publication No. 2004/198637 entitled "Protein Arrays," which is herein incorporated by reference in its
entirety, and Liu, D.R. & Schultz, P.G. (1999) Progress toward the evolution of an organism with an
expanded genetic code. PNAS United States 96:4780-4785. Although uptake is easily analyzed with
various assays, an alternative to designing non-natural amino acids that are amenable to cellular uptake
pathways is to provide biosynthetic pathways to create amino acids in vivo.
[00379]       Typically, the non-natural amino acid produced via cellular uptake as described herein is
produced in a concentration sufficient for efficient protein biosynthesis, including but not limited to, a
natural cellular amount, but not to such a degree as to affect the concentration of the other amino acids or
exhaust cellular resources. Typical concentrations produced in this manner are about 10 mM to about 0.05
mM.
      IX.     Biosynthesis of Non-Natural Amino Acids
[00380]       Many biosynthetic pathways already exist in cells for the production of amino acids and other
compounds. While a biosynthetic method for a particular non-natural amino acid may not exist in nature,
including but not limited to, in a cell, the methods and compositions described herein provide such
methods. For example, biosynthetic pathways for non-natural amino acids can be generated in host cell by
adding new enzymes or modifying existing host cell pathways. Additional new enzymes include naturally
occurring     enzymes    or  artificially evolved  enzymes.     For   example,   the   biosynthesis  of p
aminophenylalanine (as presented in an example in WO 2002/085923 entitled "In vivo incorporation of
unnatural amino acids") relies on the addition of a combination of known enzymes from other organisms.
The genes for these enzymes can be introduced into a eukaryotic cell by transforming the cell with a
plasmid comprising the genes. The genes, when expressed in the cell, provide an enzymatic pathway to
synthesize the desired compound. Examples of the types of enzymes that are optionally added are
provided herein. Additional enzymes sequences are found, for example, in Genbank. Artificially evolved
enzymes can be added into a cell in the same manner. In this manner, the cellular machinery and resources
of a cell are manipulated to produce non-natural amino acids.
[00381]       A variety of methods are available for producing novel enzymes for use in biosynthetic
pathways or for evolution of existing pathways. For example, recursive recombination, including but not
limited to, as developed by Maxygen, Inc. (available on the world wide web at www.maxygen.com), can
be used to develop novel enzymes and pathways. See, e.g., Stemmer (1994), Rapid evolution of a protein

 USA., 91:10747-10751. Similarly DesignPath TM , developed by Genencor (available on the world wide
 web at genencor.com) is optionally used for metabolic pathway engineering, including but not limited to,
 to engineer a pathway to create a non-natural amino acid in a cell. This technology reconstructs existing
 pathways in host organisms using a combination of new genes, including but not limited to those
 identified through functional genomics, molecular evolution and design. Diversa Corporation (available
 on the world wide web at diversa.com) also provides technology for rapidly screening libraries of genes
 and gene pathways, including but not limited to, to create new pathways for biosynthetically producing
 non-natural amino acids.
 [00382]      Typically, the non-natural amino acid produced with an engineered biosynthetic pathway as
 described herein is produced in a concentration sufficient for efficient protein biosynthesis, including but
 not limited to, a natural cellular amount, but not to such a degree as to affect the concentration of the other
 amino acids or exhaust cellular resources. Typical concentrations produced in vivo in this manner are
 about 10 mM to about 0.05 mMA. Once a cell is transformed with a plasmid comprising the genes used to
 produce enzymes desired for a specific pathway and a non-natural amino acid is generated, in vivo
 selections are optionally used to further optimize the production of the non-natural amino acid for both
 ribosomal protein synthesis and cell growth.

minutes, PEI stock (1 mg/mL) is added to DNA solution at a 3:1 ratio (mL PEI/ug DNA), and the mixture
is incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The culture is gently added to the mixture and swirled. The
flasks are transferred to a 32'C incubator. At day 6 post-transfection, a western blot analysis is performed.
At day 7 post-transfection, the supernatant is harvested.
         Example 26: Anti-Her2 variant expression test
[00492]       30 ml shaker cultures, CHO-S in FreeStyle medium; 56 ug DNA in PEI reagent were used.
1.5 mM pAF was also used. At day 6, the supernatant was harvested.             Titer was determined by Fc
ELISA. (Figures 2 and 3)
         Example 27: In vitro Inhibition of Proliferation Assay
[00493]       At day 1, the cells were seeded. The media was aspirated and the T-225 culture flasks of cells
was rinsed with 30mL PBS -/. PBS was aspirated and 6 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA was added to each
flask. The flasks were incubated at 37C, 5%CO2 for 2-5 minutes.           Adherent cells were dislodged by
hitting flask and trypsin was neutralized by adding 14mL culture medium. The cell suspension was mixed
and transered to a 50 mL conical tube. The cells were spun down at 1200 rpm, 5 min, room temperature.
The resultant cell pellet was resuspended in 12 mL of culture medium. The cells were counted in a
hemacytometer. Cells were seeded at appropriate cell densities into 96-well flat-bottom, clear plates and
incubated overnight at 37'C, 5% CO 2 to allow cells to attach. Plating volume was 80uL/well. 80uL/well
of culture medium was utilized as the "no cell" control.

[00495]       At day 2, the test samples were added to the cells. The test samples were diluted in culture
medium to a 9x stock concentration in Column 2 of a round-bottom 96-well plate. 3x serial dilutions
were made from Column 2 to Column 11 with a multi-channel pipettor. 1OuL/well of the above samples
was added in duplicate to the appropriate wells of the seeded plate. The total volume in the wells was
about 90uL/well. 1OuL/well of culture medium was added to avoid edge effects for sample wells. Media
Control wells were included in the inner wells where no sample was added (just lOuL/well of culture
medium) to be used in proliferation calculations. The plates were incubated at 37'C, 5%CO2 for 72 hrs.

[00496]        At day 5, proliferation readout occurred. To detect cell proliferation, lOuL/well of WST-8
reagent was added (Cell Counting Kit-8, cat# CK04-20, Dojindo Labs) to all wells.                The plate was
incubated for 4 hrs at 37 0C,  5%CO    2 . The plates were measured for absorbance at OD 450nm. Calculation
of proliferation inhibition of test samples:       subtract the "no cell control" OD450 value from all wells'
OD450 values; calculate average of the Media Control (untreated) wells; calculate each sample's %
Media Control value using the formula: (OD450 sample/OD450 avg % Media Control) *100; calculate
the average, standard deviation, and %CV of each sample's duplicate % Media Control values; plot each
samples average % Media Control value against sample concentration; calculate IC50 values using 4
parameter logistic fit regression analysis to determine potency of test samples.

[00498]      HCC1954 (human breast carcinoma) cells were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI + 10% FBS, 37'C, 5% Co        2  until 80% confluent. Cells
were harvested by trypsinization and suspended in PBS at 1 x 108 cells/mL.
[00499]      Female, SCID-beige mice, 5-8 weeks old, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories.
  ICC1954 cells (human, breast carcinoma, ATCC, # CRL-2338) were mixed 1:1 with Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Bedford MA) and injected subcutaneously into the mice. When tumors reached an average
size of 100-200 mm3 , mice were sorted into groups of 9-10 mice each. Caliper measurements were taken
twice weekly until the end of the study. To estimate tumor volume, two orthogonal diameters were
measured with calipers and the values entered into the formula, (1 x W x W)/2=V, (where W=the shortest
diameter, L=the longest diameter and V=volume), to obtain an estimated volume. The tumor volume was
                                                                       3
converted to tumor weight in the Excel data file by assuming 1 nun = I mg. Endpoint was based on a
study design of tumor growth inhibition (TGI). When the mean tumor volume of the control group
reached approx. 1,000 mm3 all mice were euthanized or day 28, whichever came first.
[00500]      Mice were given a single IV injection (tail vein) on day 1 of dosing. Test article was
dissolved at 4 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL and 0.66 mg/mL and administered at a dose volume of 5 mL/kg to
deliver 20, 10 and 3.3 mg/kg. Test articles were: Herceptin@ clinical grade (Trastuzumab), Her2-HS122

[00504] Human Clinical Trial of the Safety and/or Efficacy of Trastuzumab-Linked Dolastatin Derivative
for Breast Cancer Therapy
[00505] Objective: To compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of administered composition comprising
trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative.
[00506] Study Design: This study will be a Phase I, single-center, open-label, randomized dose escalation
study followed by a Phase II study in breast cancer patients. Patients should not have had exposure to
trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative prior to the study entry. Patients must not have received
treatment for their cancer within 2 weeks of beginning the trial. Treatments include the use of
chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors, and biologic therapy such as monoclonal antibodies.
Patients must have recovered from all toxicities (to grade 0 or 1) associated with previous treatment. All
subjects are evaluated for safety and all blood collections for pharmacokinetic analysis are collected as
scheduled. All studies are performed with institutional ethics committee approval and patient consent.

[00507] Phase I: Patients receive i.v. trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative on days 1, 8, and 15 of each
28-day cycle.     Doses of trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative may be held or modified for toxicity
based on assessments as outlined below. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable
toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative until
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative is determined. The MTD
is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
Dose limiting toxicities are determined according to the definitions and standards set by the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 (August 9,
2006).
[00508] Phase II: Patients receive trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative as in phase I at the MTD
determined in phase I. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2-6 courses in the absence of disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 2 courses of study therapy, patients who achieve
a complete or partial response may receive an additional 4 courses. Patients who maintain stable disease
for more than 2 months after completion of 6 courses of study therapy may receive an additional 6 courses
at the time of disease progression, provided they meet original eligibility criteria.
[00509]      Blood Sampling Serial blood is drawn by direct vein puncture before and after administration
of trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative. Venous blood samples (5 mL) for determination of serum
concentrations are obtained at about 10 minutes prior to dosing and at approximately the following times
after dosing: days 1, 8, and 15. Each serum sample is divided into two aliquots. All serum samples are
stored at -20 0C. Serum samples are shipped on dry ice.
[00510]      Pharmacokinetics:     Patients undergo plasma/serum sample collection for pharmacokinetic
evaluation before beginning treatment and at days 1, 8, and 15.             Pharmacokinetic parameters are
calculated by model independent methods on a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX 8600 computer
system using the latest version of the BIOAVL software. The following pharmacokinetics parameters are
determined: peak serum concentration (Cmax); time to peak serum concentration (tmax); area under the
concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last blood sampling time (AUCo 72 ) calculated with
the use of the linear trapezoidal rule; and terminal elimination half-life          (t1/2), computed from the
elimination rate constant. The elimination rate constant is estimated by linear regression of consecutive
data points in the terminal linear region of the log-linear concentration-time plot. The mean, standard
deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of the pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated for
each treatment. The ratio of the parameter means (preserved formulation/non-preserved formulation) is
calculated.
[00511]      Patient Response to combination therapy: Patient response is assessed via imaging with X
ray, CT scans, and MRI, and imaging is performed prior to beginning the study and at the end of the first
cycle, with additional imaging performed every four weeks or at the end of subsequent cycles. Imaging
modalities are chosen based upon the cancer type and feasibility/availability, and the same imaging
modality is utilized for similar cancer types as well as throughout each patient's study course. Response

cancer/tumor biopsy to assess changes in progenitor cancer cell phenotype and clonogenic growth by flow
cytometry, Western blotting, and IHC, and for changes in cytogenetics by FISH. After completion of
study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 4 weeks.
