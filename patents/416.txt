   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 5
   1. Field of the Invention
              The present invention relates to negative pressure storage container
   technology and more particularly, to a container cover that enables a pumping
   piston to pump air out of a container on which the container cover is covered
10 after the user rotates a rotary device.
   2. Description of the Related Art
              US Patent Number 9,296,542, issued to the present inventor, discloses
   a vacuum storage container, which includes a container housing, a drawer
15 mounted in the container housing and movable between a closed position and an
   open position, a rotary knob pivotally mounted in a door cover of the drawer,
   clockwork coupled to the rotary knob, a drive gear affixed to the rotary knob, a
   transmission gear set rotatable by the drive gear, an eccentric wheel rotatable by
   the transmission gear set, a pumping pump mounted in the drawer and coupled
20 to the eccentric wheel for creating a vacuum in the container housing, an
   ejection mechanism adapted for ejecting the drawer out of the container housing,
   and an operating member control mechanism adapted for locking the drawer to
   the container housing and operable to unlock the drawer for enabling the drawer
   to be ejected out of the container housing by the ejection mechanism. Since the
25 transmission gear set is arranged in a transverse direction, if you want to use the
                                             1

   container cover in a cylindrical can, a barrel or a bottle-like container, the
   container cover will occupy a large transverse space of the container.
              Further, in the use of a conventional mechanical type vacuum storage
 5 container, when the internal air of the storage container leaks out, the storage
   container cannot be automatically inflated. There are electronic type negative
   pressure storage containers commercially available. However, if the internal air
   of an electronic type negative pressure storage container leaks out, a vacuum
   pumping operation must be performed again, bringing inconvenience.
10
             In addition, if the wine in a decanter is not finished soon, it is easy to
   oxidize and to mature quickly and clumsily, soon deteriorating into a worse state.
   Further, if a drink in a vessel is not finished, it is pity to discard the drink.
   Further, people may use a sealing container to store food ingredients. However,
15 because the internal storage chamber of the sealing container is not maintained
   in a negative pressure status, the sealing container cannot keep the storage food
   ingredients fresh for long.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
20            The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances
   in view. It is therefore the main object of the present invention to provide a
   container cover consisting of a rotary device, an outer cover member, an inner
   cover member, a first guide block, second guide block, a pumping piston and a
   piston seat, and adapted for covering a storage container. The component parts
25 are so arranged that when the rotary device is driven by a user to rotate the first
                                             2

   guide block, guide rods of the first guide block are moved along a first
   continuous wave-shaped track of the second guide block, causing the second
   guide block and the pumping piston to move alternatively up and to further
   pump air out of the storage container through an air-pimping hole of the piston
 5 seat to create a negative pressure. Thus, the container cover of the invention has
   the characteristics of simple structure, space saving a wide application range.
              Further, the container cover can be configured for covering a vacuum
   storage can, vacuum storage box, vacuum storage bottle, decanter, or any of a
10 variety of storage containers of different shapes and sizes, facilitating creation of
   a negative pressure in the storage container. When a certain level of negative
   pressure is created in the storage container, the storage food ingredients and
   eatable items in the storage container can be maintained fresh, avoiding ruptured
   storage items due to moisture or oxidation.
15
              Preferably, the container cover further comprises a relief valve rod.
   The relief valve rod has the top end thereof capped with a flexible end cap.
   When a negative pressure is created in the storage container, the flexible end cap
   will curve down, giving a visual indication of the presence of the negative
20 pressure in the storage container.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
              Referring to Figs. 1-11, a container cover that facilitates creating
   negative pressure and long time sealing in accordance with a first embodiment
 5 of the present invention is shown. The container cover of this first embodiment
   comprises a rotary device 1, an outer cover member 2, an inner cover member 3,
   a first guide block 4, a second guide block 5, a pumping piston 61, and a piston
   seat 62, and a check valve 64.
10            The rotary device 1 in this embodiment is a rotary knob rotatably
   coupled to the outer cover member 2 and fastened to the first guide block 4 with
   a plurality of first fasteners 11 or other fastening means.
              The outer cover member 2 is fixedly connected to the inner cover
15 member 3 by means of latches (not shown) and mating latch holes 33 or other
   fastening means. Further, the outer cover member 2 has a plurality of axially
   extending guide grooves 22 (see Fig. 8).
              The inner cover member 3 is connected to the outer cover member 2
20 with a packing gasket 30 sealed therebetween so that when the inner cover
   member 3 is covered with the outer cover member 2 onto an opening 101 of a
   storage container 10 (see Figs. 5-8). The storage container 10 can be kept in an
   airtight condition.
25            The first guide block 4 has a plurality of guide rods 41. The second
                                               6

   guide block 5 has a first continuous wave-shaped track 51 disposed in contact
   with the guide rods 41. Thus, when the first guide block 4 is being rotated with
   the rotary device (rotary knob ) 1, the guide rods 41 are moved along the first
   continuous wave-shaped track 51 of the second guide block 5, causing the
 5 second guide block 5 to be moved up and down. Further, the second guide block
   5 fastened to the pumping piston 61 with third fasteners 53 or other fastening
   means.
              The pumping piston 61 comprises a plurality of constraint blocks 613
10 (see Fig. 2) respectively coupled to the axially extending guide grooves 22 of
   the outer cover member 2 (see Fig. 8) for vertical movement. The pumping
   piston 61 is adapted for reciprocation in a piston groove 621 of the piston seat
   62 axially. The pumping piston 61 further comprises an external mounting
   groove 5 extended around the periphery thereof for the mounting of a first
15 gasket ring 612.
              The piston seat 62 is fastened to the cover member 2 with a plurality
   of second fasteners 31 or other fastening means, comprising a piston groove 621
   that accommodates the pumping piston 61 and allows the pumping piston 61 to
20 reciprocate therein, a second gasket ring 65 mounted around the periphery
   thereof, and an air-pumping hole 622 cut through a bottom wall thereof (see Fig.
   4 and Figs. 7 and 8). The check valve 64 is mounted in the air-pimping hole
   622.
25            Thus, when the user operates the rotary device (rotary knob) 1 to
                                            7

   rotate the first guide block 4, the guide rods 41 of the first guide block 4 are
   moved along the first continuous wave-shaped track 51 of the second guide
   block 5, causing the second guide block 5 and the connected pumping piston 61
   to move alternatively up and down along the piston groove 621 of the piston
 5 seat 62 (see Figs. 7 and 8). During the reciprocating movement of the pumping
   piston 61, air is drawn out of the storage container 10 through the air-pimping
   hole 622 of the piston seat 62, causing reaction of a negative pressure in the
   storage container 10, and thus, the foods stored in the storage container 10 such
   as red wine, beverages, fruits, biscuits and other ingredients can be maintained
10 fresh and well protected against oxidation.
              The container cover further comprises a first spring member 63
   supported between the pumping piston 61 and the piston groove 621 of the
   piston seat 62 (see Figs. 7 and 8) to balance the axial movement of the pumping
15 piston 61.
              In the air-drawing stroke during the reciprocating motion of the piston
   61, the load is heavy. On the contrary, in the return action during the
   reciprocating motion of the piston 61, the load is light. Subject to the
20 arrangement of the first spring member 63, the user's hand can feel smooth
   when rotating the rotary device (rotary knob) 1.
              Further, an upper rail seat 50 is fastened to the second guide block 5
   and the pumping piston 61 by the aforesaid third fasteners 53. The upper rail
25 seat 50 defines a second continuous wave-shaped track 501. The guide rods 41
                                             8

   of the first guide block 4        are supported between the second continuous
   wave-shaped track 501 of the upper rail seat 50 and the first continuous
   wave-shaped track 51 of the second guide block 5 for smooth movement.
 5            As illustrated in Fig. 2, the first continuous wave-shaped track 51 of
   the second guide block 5 comprises a plurality of low-elevation points 511 and a
   plurality of high-elevation points 512, wherein each low-elevation point 511
   rises gradually to one respective high-elevation point 512; each high-elevation
   points 512 descends gradually to one respective low-elevation point 511.
10
              Further, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the second continuous wave-shaped
   track 501 of the upper rail seat 50 comprises a plurality of low-elevation points
   5011 and a plurality of high-elevation points 5012, wherein each low-elevation
   point 5011 rises gradually to one respective high-elevation point 5012; each
15 high-elevation point 5012 descends gradually to one respective low-elevation
   point 5011.
              Further, as illustrated in Figs. 9-11, the outer cover member 2 further
   comprises a relief hole 21 (see Fig. 9); the inner cover member 3 further
20 comprises a through hole 32 (see Fig. 9) corresponding to the relief hole 21.
   Further, a relief valve rod 7 is mounted with a gasket ring 71, and movable to
   close the relief hole 21 of the outer cover member 2 (see Figs. 9 and1O) or open
   relief hole 21 of the outer cover member 2 (see Fig. 11). Further, a second spring
   member 70 is mounted between the relief valve rod 7 and the relief hole 21 of
25 the outer cover member 2, and adapted for imparting an elastic restoring energy
                                               9

   to the relief valve rod 7 (see Fig. 10) to force the gasket ring 71 against the relief
   hole 21 of the outer cover member 2 when the container cover is capped on the
   storage container 10 and a negative pressure is created in the storage container
   10. Further, when the relief valve rod 7 is pressed down by an external force
 5 (see Fig. 11), a gap is created between the gasket ring 71 and the relief hole 21
   of the outer cover member 2 for discharge of the negative pressure. When the
   applied force is released from the relief valve rod 7, the elastic restoring energy
   of the second spring member 70 immediately pushes the relief valve rod 7
   upward (see Fig. 9), forcing the gasket ring 71 to stop the relief hole 21. Further,
10 the relief valve rod 7 has an internal channel 73 (see Fig. 9) extending through
   opposing top and bottom ends thereof. The internal channel 73 has the bottom
   end thereof disposed in communication with the relief hole 21 of the outer cover
   member 2, and the opposing top end thereof mounted with a flexible end cap 74
   (see Fig. 9). Thus, when a negative pressure is created in the storage container
15 10 after the container cover covered the storage container 10, the flexible end
   cap 74 will curve down due to the presence of a suction force in the internal
   channel 73 (see Fig. 10). The downwardly curving condition of the flexible end
   cap 74 can be seen, giving a visual negative pressure indication for reference.
   The flexible end cap 74 has a top protrusion 741 made of a different material or
20 in a different color relative to the body of the flexible end cap 74 for easy visual
   identification of the presence of a negative pressure in the storage container 10.
              Further, as illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 9, dust ring caps 81,82 with
   respective anti-dust filter meshes 83,84 are respectively mounted in the relief
25 hole 21 of the outer cover member 2 and the air-pimping hole 622 of the piston
                                              10

   seat 62, avoiding powder content in the storage container 10 from affecting air
   tightness or product service life. Further, the dust ring caps 81,82 and the
   anti-dust filter meshes 83,84 are detachable for easy cleaning or replacement
 5            Referring to Fig. 13, in a modification of the first embodiment of the
   present invention, the aforesaid upper rail seat 50 is eliminated, achieving the
   same expected effects.
              Referring to Fig. 14, in another modification of the first embodiment
10 of the present invention, the first spring member 63 is eliminated, achieving the
   same expected effects.
              Referring to Fig. 15, in still another modification of the first
   embodiment of the present invention, the relief valve rod 7 is disposed at a
15 different location with the top end thereof facing toward a through hole 12 in the
   rotary device (rotary knob ) 1. In this embodiment, the piston seat 6 further
   comprises a relief hole 620; the relief hole 620 of the piston seat 6 can be
   blocked or opened by the gasket ring 71 of the relief valve rod 7; a second
   spring member 70 is supported between the relief valve rod 7 and the relief hole
20 620 of the piston seat 6 to impart an elastic restoring energy to the piston seat 6,
   forcing the gasket ring 71 of the relief valve rod 7 into abutment against the
   relief hole 620 of the piston seat 6 after creation of a negative pressure in the
   storage container 10. Further, when the relief valve rod 7 is being held down by
   an external pressure, a gap is created between the gasket ring 71 and the relief
25 hole 620 of the piston seat 6 for discharging air pressure. When released the
                                             11

   downward pressure from the relief valve rod 7, the elastic restoring energy of
   the second spring member 70 immediately pushes the relief valve rod 7 upward,
   forcing the gasket ring 71 into abutment against the relief hole 620 again. The
   relief valve rod 7 has an internal channel 73 extending through opposing top and
 5 bottom ends thereof. The bottom end of the internal channel 73 is disposed in
   communication with the relief hole 620 of the piston seat 62. The opposing top
   end of the relief valve rod 7 is mounted with a flexible end cap 74. Thus, when a
   negative pressure is created in the storage container 10 after the container cover
   covered the storage container 10, the flexible end cap 74 will curve down due to
10 a suction force in the internal channel 73 (see Fig. 10). The downwardly curving
   condition of the flexible end cap 74 can be seen, giving a visual negative
   pressure indication for reference. The flexible end cap 74 has a top protrusion
   741 made of a different material or in a different color relative to the body of the
   flexible end cap 74 for easy identification of the presence of a negative pressure
15 in the storage container 10.
              Referring to Figs. 16 and 17, a container cover that facilitates creating
   negative pressure and long time          sealing in accordance      with a second
   embodiment of the present invention is shown. The container cover of this
20 second embodiment is substantially similar to the aforesaid first embodiment
   with the exception that the rotary device 1 in this second embodiment is a motor
   module. The rotary device (motor module) 1 is affixed to the first guide block 4
   with fasteners (not shown). When the rotary device (motor module) 1 is driven
   to rotate the first guide block 4, the mating arrangement between the guide rods
25 41 of the first guide block 4 and the first continuous wave-shaped track 51 of the
                                              12

   second guide block 5 causes the second guide block 5 and the pumping piston
   61 to move alternatively up and down in the piston groove 621 of the piston seat
   62, thereby drawing air out of the storage container 10 through the air-pimping
   hole 622 of the piston seat 62, and a negative pressure is thus created in the
 5 storage container 10.
              Further, as illustrated in Fig. 17, the rotary device (motor module) 1 is
   electrically connected to a power supply module 12 (for example, battery set).
   The power supply module 12 is electrically coupled to a switch control module
10 13 that controls on/off of the rotary device (motor module) 1.
              The other structural details and technical features are same as the
   aforesaid first embodiment. The only difference between the aforesaid first
   embodiment and this second embodiment is the use of a motor module for the
15 rotary device 1. Since the contents of the second embodiment are the same as
   those of the first embodiment, we do not repeat them.
              In conclusion, the invention has the features and effects as follows:
20             1. When rotating the rotary device 1, the mating arrangement between
   the guide rods 41 of the first guide block 4 and the first continuous wave-shaped
   track 51 of the second guide block 5 causes the second guide block 5 and the
   pumping piston 61 to move alternatively up and down in the piston groove 621
   of the piston seat 62, thereby drawing air out of the storage container 10 to
25 create a negative pressure is thus created in the storage container 10. Thus, the
                                               13

   container cover of the invention has the characteristics of simple structure, space
   saving a wide application range.
              2. The container cover can be configured for covering a vacuum
 5 storage can, vacuum storage box, vacuum storage bottle, decanter, or any of a
   variety of storage containers of different shapes and sizes. Fig. 12 illustrates the
   container cover of the present invention capped on a decanter 10'.
              3. When a certain level of negative pressure is created in the storage
10 container 10, the storage food ingredients and eatable items in the storage
