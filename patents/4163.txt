        FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to dipperidine drug intermediates diphenylketone synthesis method.
        GENERAL BACKGROUND
        Diphenylketone is the ultraviolet absorption, and the intermediate of organic
   pigments, medicine, spices and pesticides. In the pharmaceutical industry, it is used to
10 produce dicyclohexidine, benzoyl hydro-bromide, diphenhydramine hydrochloride etc.
   The product itself is also a styrene polymerization inhibitor and flavoring agent. It can
   give fragrance with sweet breath, which is used in a lot of perfume and soap. Most of
   the existing synthetic methods are made by condensation of benzyl chloride and
   benzene, and then oxidized by nitric acid. However, this method has high toxicity and
15 high toxicity to the operators' human safety. And nitric acid is used as reactant, the
   demand of the reaction equipment corrosion resistance requires higher, equipment
   manufacturer and maintenance costs increased, these factors will lead to increasing the
   cost of production, the synthetic process and the method is more complex, so it is
   necessary to put forward a new synthetic method.
