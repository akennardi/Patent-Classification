                            CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]        This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. § l19(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent
Application Serial No. 61/321,263 filed on 6 April 2010, the contents of which are incorporated

                                      FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]        The invention relates to the specific inhibition of the expression of the CD274/PD-LI
gene.
                                 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]        CD274 or PD-LI is a 290 amino acid type I transmembrane protein encoded by the
CD274 gene on mouse chromosome 19 and human chromosome 9. CD274/PD-L1 expression is
implicated in evasion of immune responses involved in chronic infection, e.g., by viruses (including,
for example, HIV, HBV, HCV and HTLV, among others), by bacteria (including, for example,
Helicobacterpylori, among others) and by parasites (including, for example, Schistosoma mansoni).
[0004]        CD274/PD-LI expression is also implicated in suppression of anti-tumor immune
activity. Tumors express antigens that can be recognized by host T cells, but immunologic clearance
of tumors is rare. Part of this failure is due to immune suppression by the tumor microenvironment.
PD-Li expression on many tumors is a component of this suppressive milieu and may act in concert
with other immunosuppressive signals. PD-Li expression has been shown in situ on a wide variety of
solid tumors including breast, lung, colon, ovarian, melanoma, bladder, liver, salivary, stomach,
gliomas, thyroid, thymic epithelial, head, and neck (Brown JA et al., 2003. J. Immunol. 170:1257-66;
Dong H et al. 2002. Nat. Med. 8:793-800; Hamanishi J, et al. 2007. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
104:3360-65; Strome SE et al. 2003. Cancer Res. 63:6501-5; Inman BA et al. 2007. Cancer
109:1499-505; Konishi J et al. 2004. Clin. Cancer Res. 10:5094-100; Nakanishi J et al. 2007. Cancer
Immunol. Immunother. 56:1173-82; Nomi T et al. 2007. Clin. Cancer Res. 13:2151-57; Thompson
RH et al. 2004. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101:17174-79; Wu C, Zhu Y, Jiang J, Zhao J, Zhang XG,
Xu N. 2006. Acta Histochem. 108:19-24). In addition, PD-i expression is upregulated on tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes, and this may also contribute to tumor immunosuppression (Blank C et al.
2003. J. Immunol. 171:4574-81). In ovarian cancer, PD-LI expression is inversely correlated with
intraepithelial, but not stromal, infiltrating CD8 T cells, suggesting that PD-Li inhibits the intratumor
migration of CD8 T cells (Hamanishi J et al. 2007. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104:3360-65).

Translation of PD-LI mRNA is enhanced by loss of PTEN and the ensuing activation of Akt, a
common event in tumorigenesis (Parsa AT et al. 2007. Nat. Med. 13:84-88). Most importantly,
studies relating PD-Li expression on tumors to disease outcome show that PD-Li expression strongly
correlates with unfavorable prognosis in kidney, ovarian, bladder, breast, gastric, and pancreatic
cancer (Hamanishi J et al. 2007. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104:3360-65; Inman BA et al. 2007.

Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 56:1173-82; Nomi T et al. 2007. Clin. Cancer Res. 13:2151-57;
Thompson RH et al. 2004. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101:17174-79; Wu C, Zhu Y, Jiang J, Zhao J,
Zhang XG, Xu N. 2006. Acta Histochem. 108:19-24). In addition, these studies suggest that higher
levels of PD-Li expression on tumors may facilitate advancement of tumor stage and invasion into
deeper tissue structures.
[0005]        The PD-i pathway can also play a role in hematologic malignancies. PD-Li is expressed
on multiple myeloma cells but not on normal plasma cells (Liu J et al. 2007.Blood 110:296-304). PD
LI is expressed on some primary T cell lymphomas, particularly anaplastic large cell T lymphomas
(Brown JA et al., 2003. J. Immunol. 170:1257-66). PD-i is highly expressed on the T cells of
angioimmunoblastic lymphomas, and PD-LI is expressed on the associated follicular dendritic cell
network (Dorfman DM et al. 2006. Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 30:802-10). In nodular lymphocyte
predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, the T cells associated with lymphocytic and/or histiocytic (L&H)
cells express PD-1. Microarray analysis using a readout of genes induced by PD-I ligation suggests
that tumor-associated T cells are responding to PD-i signals in situ in Hodgkin lymphoma (Chemnitz
JM et al. 2007. Blood 110:3226-33). PD-i and PD-Li are expressed on CD4 T cells in HTLV-1
mediated adult T cell leukemia and lymphoma (Shimauchi T et al. 2007. Int. J. Cancer 121: 2585
90). These tumor cells are hyporesponsive to TCR signals.
[0006]        Studies in animal models demonstrate that PD-Li on tumors inhibits T cell activation and
lysis of tumor cells and in some cases leads to increased tumor-specific T cell death (Dong H et al.
2002. Nat. Med.8:793-800; Hirano F et al. 2005. CancerRes.65:1089-96). Tumor-associated APCs
can also utilize the PD-i:PD-L pathway to control antitumor T cell responses. PD-Li expression on a
population of tumor-associated myeloid DCs is upregulated by tumor environmental factors (Curiel
TJ et al. 2003. Nat. Med. 9:562-67). Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) in the tumor-draining lymph
node of B 16 melanoma express IDO, which strongly activates the suppressive activity of regulatory T
cells. The suppressive activity of IDO-treated regulatory T cells required cell contact with IDO
expressing DCs (Sharma MD et al. 2007. J. Clin. Invest. 117:2570-82).
                                  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0007]        Described herein are compositions and methods that effect the RNA-induced silencing
complex (RISC)-mediated cleavage of RNA transcripts of the CD274/PD-LI gene, such as in a cell or
                                                    2

    WO 2011/127180                                                                PCT/US2011/031429
mammal. Also described are compositions and methods for treating pathological conditions and
diseases caused by the expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene, such as a tumor or hematological
malignancy (e.g., ovarian cancer or melanoma), or an infectious disease (e.g., viral hepatitis).
[0008]       As used herein, the term "iRNA" refers to an agent that contains RNA as that term is
defined herein, and which mediates the targeted cleavage of an RNA transcript via an RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC) pathway. In one embodiment, an iRNA as described herein effects
inhibition of CD274/PD-L1 expression in a cell or mammal. Alternatively, in another embodiment, an
iRNA as described herein activates CD274/PD-L1 expression in a cell or mammal.
[0009]       The iRNAs included in the compositions featured herein encompass a dsRNA having an
RNA strand (the antisense strand) having a region that is 30 nucleotides or less, generally 19-24
nucleotides in length, that is substantially complementary to at least part of an mRNA transcript of a
CD274/PD-L1 gene. In one embodiment, the dsRNA comprises a region of at least 15 contiguous
nucleotides.
[0010]       In one embodiment, an iRNA for inhibiting expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene includes
at least two sequences that are complementary to each other. The iRNA includes a sense strand
having a first sequence and an antisense strand having a second sequence. The antisense strand
includes a nucleotide sequence that is substantially complementary to at least part of an mRNA
encoding CD274/PD-L1, and the region of complementarity is 30 nucleotides or less, and at least 15
nucleotides in length. Generally, the iRNA is 19 to 24, e.g., 19 to 21 nucleotides in length. In some
embodiments the iRNA is from about 15 to about 25 nucleotides in length, and in other embodiments
the iRNA is from about 25 to about 30 nucleotides in length. The iRNA, upon contacting with a cell
expressing CD274/PD-L1, inhibits the expression of a CD274/PD-Llgene by at least 10%, at least
20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35% or at least 40% or more, such as when assayed by a
method as described herein. In one embodiment, the CD274/PD-LliRNA is formulated in a stable
nucleic acid lipid particle (SNALP).
[0011]       In one embodiment, an iRNA featured herein includes a first sequence of a dsRNA that is
selected from the group consisting of the sense sequences of Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5, and a
second sequence that is selected from the group consisting of the corresponding antisense sequences
of Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5. The iRNA molecules featured herein can include naturally occurring
nucleotides or can include at least one modified nucleotide, including, but not limited to a 2'-O-methyl
modified nucleotide, a nucleotide having a 5'-phosphorothioate group, and a terminal nucleotide
linked to a cholesteryl derivative. Alternatively, the modified nucleotide may be chosen from the
group of: a 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro modified nucleotide, a 2'-deoxy-modified nucleotide, a locked
nucleotide, an abasic nucleotide, 2'-amino-modified nucleotide, 2'-alkyl-modified nucleotide,
morpholino nucleotide, a phosphoramidate, and a non-natural base comprising nucleotide. Generally,
such a modified sequence will be based on a first sequence of said iRNA selected from the group
                                                     3

    WO 2011/127180                                                                 PCT/US2011/031429
consisting of the sense sequences of Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5, and a second sequence selected
from the group consisting of the corresponding antisense sequences of Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5.
[0012]       In one embodiment, an iRNA as described herein targets a wildtype CD274/PD-L1 RNA
transcript, and in another embodiment, the iRNA targets a mutant transcript (e.g., a CD274/PD-L1
RNA carrying an allelic variant). For example, an iRNA of the invention can target a polymorphic
variant, such as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), of CD274/PD-L1. In another embodiment,
the iRNA targets both a wildtype and a mutant CD274/PD-L1 transcript. In yet another embodiment,
the iRNA targets a transcript variant of CD274/PD-L 1.
[0013]       In one embodiment, an iRNA featured in the invention targets a non-coding region of a
CD274/PD-L1 RNA transcript, such as the 5' or 3' untranslated region.
[0014]       In one aspect, embodiments of the invention provide a cell containing at least one of the
iRNAs featured in the invention. The cell is generally a mammalian cell, such as a human cell. In
some embodiments, the cell is a cancer or tumor cell. In some embodiments, the cell is an immune
cell.
[0015]       In another aspect, embodiments of the invention provide a pharmaceutical composition
for inhibiting the expression of CD274/PD-L1 gene in an organism, generally a human subject. The
composition typically includes one or more of the iRNAs described herein and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier or delivery vehicle. In one embodiment, the composition is used for treating a
cancer or malignancy, such as a myeloma. In one embodiment, the composition is used for treating
an infectious disease, such as a viral hepatitis infection.
[0016]       In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated for administration
of a dosage regimen described herein, e.g., not more than once every four weeks, not more than once
every three weeks, not more than once every two weeks, or not more than once every week. In
another embodiment, the administration of the pharmaceutical composition can be maintained for a
month or longer, e.g., one, two, three, or six months, one year, or five years, or ten years, or longer,
including the remaining lifetime of a subject.
[0017]       In another embodiment, a composition containing an iRNA described herein, e.g., a
dsRNA targeting CD274/PD-L1, is administered with a non-iRNA therapeutic agent, such as an agent
known to treat a cancer, or a symptom of a cancer. In another embodiment, a composition containing
an iRNA featured in the invention, e.g., a dsRNA targeting CD274/PD-L1, is administered along with
a non-iRNA therapeutic regimen, such as immunotherapy. For example, an iRNA featured in the
invention can be administered along with vaccination against a tumor peptide antigen agent for
treatment of tumor or other malignancy. In another example, an iRNA featured in the invention can be
administered along with depletion of a cell population, such as CD4 cells.
[0018]       In another embodiment, a CD274/PD-LliRNA is administered to a patient, and then the
non-iRNA agent or therapeutic regimen is administered to the patient (or vice versa). In another
                                                      4

    WO 2011/127180                                                                PCT/US2011/031429
embodiment, a CD274/PD-L1 iRNA and the non-iRNA therapeutic agent or therapeutic regimen are
administered at the same time. In one embodiment, the therapeutic agent is, for example, a tumor
peptide antigen agent, such as a myeloma peptide that increases melanoma-specific T cell responses.
In another embodiment, the therapeutic regimen includes the depletion of CD4 cells from the patient.
[0019]      In another aspect, provided herein is a method for inhibiting the expression of a
CD274/PD-L 1 gene in a cell by performing the following steps:
        (a)     introducing into the cell a double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), wherein the
                dsRNA includes at least two sequences that are complementary to each other. The
                dsRNA has a sense strand having a first sequence and an antisense strand having a
                second sequence; the antisense strand has a region of complementarity that is
                substantially complementary to at least a part of an mRNA encoding CD274/PD-L1,
                and where the region of complementarity is 30 nucleotides or less, i.e., 15-30
                nucleotides in length, and generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and where the
                dsRNA, upon contact with a cell expressing CD274/PD-L1, inhibits expression of a
                CD274/PD-L1 gene by at least 10%, preferably at least 20%, at least 30%, at least
                40% or more; and
        (b)     maintaining the cell produced in step (a) for a time sufficient to obtain degradation of
                the mRNA transcript of the CD274/PD-L1 gene, thereby inhibiting expression of a
                CD274/PD-L1 gene in the cell.
[0021]      In another aspect, the invention provides methods and compositions useful for activating
expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene in a cell or mammal.
[0022]      In another aspect, the invention provides a method for modulating the expression of a
CD274/PD-L 1 gene in a cell by performing the following steps:
        (a)     introducing into the cell a double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), wherein the
                dsRNA includes at least two sequences that are complementary to each other. The
                dsRNA has a sense strand having a first sequence and an antisense strand having a
                second sequence; the antisense strand has a region of complementarity that is
                substantially complementary to at least a part of an mRNA encoding CD274/PD-L1,
                and where the region of complementarity is 30 nucleotides or less, i.e., 15-30
                nucleotides in length, and generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and where the
                dsRNA, upon contact with a cell expressing CD274/PD-L1, modulates expression of
                a CD274/PD-L1 gene by at least 10%, preferably at least 20%, at least 30%, at least
                40% or more; and
                                                   5

    WO 2011/127180                                                                  PCT/US2011/031429
         (b)      maintaining the cell produced in step (a) for a time sufficient to obtain degradation or
                  increased expression of the mRNA transcript of the CD274/PD-L1 gene, thereby
                  modulating expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene in the cell.
[0023]        In one embodiment, the method is for inhibiting gene expression in an antigen-presenting
cell, a macrophage, a T cell, an NK cell, an NKT cell, a myeloid dendritic cell, a B cell, an epithelial
cell, a vascular endothelial cell, or any combination thereof.

lymphoma cell.
[0025]        In other aspects, the invention provides methods for treating, preventing, reversing, or
managing pathological processes mediated by CD274/PD-L1 expression, such as a tumor or other
malignancy. In one embodiment, the method includes administering to a patient in need of such
treatment, prevention, reversal, or management a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount
of one or more of the iRNAs featured in the invention. In one embodiment, the patient has a tumor or
a hematological malignancy. In another embodiment, administration of the iRNA targeting
CD274/PD-L1 alleviates or relieves the severity of at least one symptom of a CD274/PD-L1-mediated
disorder in the patient, such as high tumor burden, development of metastasis, or tumor or lymphoma
cell proliferation.
[0026]        In one aspect, the invention provides a vector for inhibiting the expression of a
CD274/PD-L1 gene in a cell. In one embodiment, the vector includes at least one regulatory
sequence operably linked to a nucleotide sequence that encodes at least one strand of an iRNA as
described herein. In another such aspect, the invention provides a vector encoding a dsRNA that
targets a CD274/PD-L1 mRNA for cleavage, the dsRNA comprising on one strand a region of
complementarity to said CD274/PD-L1 mRNA, the region of complementarity providing a double
stranded region of said dsRNA of 30 base pairs or less in length.
[0027]        In another aspect, the invention provides a cell containing a vector for inhibiting the
expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene in a cell. The vector includes a regulatory sequence operably
linked to a nucleotide sequence that encodes at least one strand of one of the iRNAs as described
herein.
[0028]        In yet another aspect, the invention provides a composition containing a CD274/PD
LliRNA, in combination with a second iRNA targeting a second gene involved in a pathological
disease, and useful for treating the disease, e.g., a tumor or a hematological malignancy. For example,
the second gene can be the gene encoding PD-1, i.e., PDCD1.

                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0035]        Described herein are iRNAs and methods of using them for inhibiting the expression of a
CD274/PD-L1 gene in a cell or a mammal where the iRNA targets a CD274/PD-L1 gene. Also
provided are compositions and methods for treating pathological conditions and diseases, such as a
cancer or infectious disease, in a mammal caused by or modulated by the expression of a CD274/PD
LI gene. iRNA directs the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA through a process known as
RNA interference (RNAi). In one embodiment, the iRNA activates the expression of a CD274/PD-L1
gene in a cell or mammal, where the iRNA targets a CD274/PD-L1 gene.
CD274/PD-Li
[0036]        CD274/PD-L1 comprises seven exons, the first of which is noncoding and contains the
5'UTR. The next three exons contain the signal sequence, IgV-like domain, and IgC-like domains,
respectively. The transmembrane domain and the intracellular domains are contained in the next two
exons (exons 5 and 6). The last exon contains intracellular domain residues plus the 3'UTR. The
intracellular domain of CD274/PD-L1 is short, only about 30 aa, and highly conserved in all reported
species. There is no known function for the intracellular tail of CD274/PD-L1. There is one reported
splice variant of CD274/PD-L1 in humans consisting of a sequence lacking the IgV-like domain
encoded in exon 2. This mutant should not be able to bind PD-1, although the function of this splice
variant has not yet been reported. No splice variants have been identified for mouse CD274/PD-LI.
The binding interface of CD274/PD-Li to one of its known ligands, PD-1, is via its IgV-like domain
(Keir ME et al., 2008. Annu Rev Immunol. 26:677-704).
[0037]        CD274/PD-Li has been shown to be constitutively expressed on mouse T and B cells,
DCs, macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells, and bone marrow-derived mast cells. CD274/PD-Li
expression is also found on a wide range of nonhematopoietic cells and is upregulated on a number of
cell types after activation. Upon IFN-7 stimulation, PD-Li is expressed on T cells, NK cells,

macrophages, myeloid DCs, B cells, epithelial cells, and vascular endothelial cells ( Flies DB and
Chen L 2007: J Immunother. 30 (3): 251-60). PD-Li is notably expressed on macrophages. In the
mouse, it has been shown that classically activated macrophages (induced by type I helper T cells or a
combination of LPS and interferon-gamma) greatly upregulate PD-LI (Loke P and Allison JP, 2003:
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100 (9): 5336-41). Alternatively, macrophages activated by IL-4
(alternative macrophages), slightly upregulate PD-Li, while greatly upregulating PD-L2. It has been
shown by STAT I-deficient knock-out mice that STAT I is mostly responsible for upregulation of PD
LI on macrophages by LPS or interferon-gamma, but is not at all responsible for its constitutive
expression before activation in these mice. Both type I and type II interferons (IFNs) upregulate PD
Li. Analyses of the human CD274/PD-Li promoter demonstrate that both constitutive and inducible
CD274/PD-L I expression are dependent on two IFN regulatory factor-I (IRF-1) binding sites that are
between 200 and 320 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site, and these IRF-i binding sites are
also found in mouse. Several studies have examined which signaling pathways are required for PD-LI
expression by using pharmacological inhibitors. PD-Li expression in cell lines is decreased when
MyD88, TRAF6, and MEK are inhibited. JAK2 has also been implicated in PD-Li induction. Loss or
inhibition of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a cellular phosphatase that modifies
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13K) and Akt signaling, increases post-transcriptional PD-Li
expression in cancers (Keir ME et al., 2008. Annu Rev Immunol. 26:677-704).
[0038]        PD-Li can influence immune responses by engaging PD-i or B7-1 (CD80) and
modifying TCR or BCR signaling, but can also deliver signals into PD-Li expressing cells, i.e.,
reverse signaling through PD-Li. Surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrate specific and unique
interaction between both PD-Li and B7-1, with an affinity of 1.7 gM, and an affinity of 0.5 gM for
the interaction between PD-Li and PD-i. Chemical cross-linking studies indicate that PD-Li and B7
1, like PD-Li and PD-1, can also interact through their IgV-like domains. The PD-Li:B7-1 interface
overlaps at least partially with the putative PD-Li:PD-1 interface. B7-1:PD-Li interactions can
induce an inhibitory signal into T cells. Ligation of PD-Li on CD4 T cells by B7-1, or ligation of B7
I on CD4 T cells by PD-Li, delivers a functionally significant, inhibitory signal. Because both PD-Li
and B7-1 are expressed on T cells, B cells, DCs, and macrophages, there is the potential for
bidirectional interactions between B7-1 and PD-Li on these cell types. In addition, PD-Li on
nonhematopoietic cells may interact with B7-1 as well as PD-i on T cells to regulate cells (Keir ME
et al., 2008. Annu Rev Immunol. 26:677-704).
[0039]        PD-i and its ligands have important roles in regulating immune defenses against
microbes that cause acute and chronic infections. The PD-i:PD-L pathway appears to be a key
determinant of the outcome of infection, regulating the delicate balance between effective
antimicrobial immune defenses and immune-mediated tissue damage.

    WO 2011/127180                                                                PCT/US2011/031429
[0040]       A number of microorganisms that cause chronic infection appear to have exploited the
PD-i:PD-L pathway to evade the immune responses and establish persistent infection. Studies in the
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model of chronic viral infection were the first to show a
role for the PD-i:PD-L pathway during chronic infection (Barber DL et al. 2006. Nature 439:682
87). Viruses that cause chronic infections can render virus-specific T cells nonfunctional and thereby
silence the antiviral T cell response (Wherry EJ and Ahmed R. 2004. J. Virol. 78:5535-45).
Functional dysregulation, or exhaustion, of CD8 T cells is an important reason for ineffective viral
control during chronic infections and is characteristic of chronic LCMV infection in mice, as well as
of HIV, HBV, HCV, and HTLV infection in humans and SIV infection in primates.
[0041]       In chronic viral infections in humans, several groups have shown that PD-I expression is
high on HIV-specific (Petrovas C et al. 2006. J. Exp. Med. 203:2281-92; Day CL et al. 2006. Nature
443:350-54; Trautmann L et al. 2006. Nat. Med. 12:1198-202), HBV-specific (Boettler T et al. 2006.
J. Virol. 80:3532-40; Boni C et al. 2007. J. Virol. 81:4215-25), and HCV-specific T cells (Urbani S
et al. 2006. J. Virol. 80:11398-403). PD-Li is also upregulated on peripheral blood CD14+
monocytes and myeloid DCs in patients with chronic HBV infection (Chen L et al. 2007. J. Immunol.
178:6634-41; Geng L et al. 2006. J. Viral Hepat. 13:725-33), and on CD14+ cells and T cells in HIV
patients (Trabattoni D et al. 2003. Blood101:2514-20). Blocking PD-i:PD-L interactions in vitro
reverses the exhaustion of HIV-specific, HBV-specific (Boni C et al. 2007. J. Virol. 81:4215-25),
HCV-specific, and SIV-specific (Velu V et al. 2007. J. Virol.81:5819-28) CD8 and CD4 T cells and
restores proliferation and cytokine production (Petrovas C et al. 2006. J. Exp. Med. 203:2281-92; Day
CL et al. 2006. Nature 443:350-54; Trautmann L et al. 2006. Nat. Med. 12:1198-202; Urbani S et al.
2006. J. Virol. 80:11398-403). Recent work shows that the HCV core, a nucleocapsid protein, can
upregulate PD-I and PD-LI expression on healthy donor T cells and that upregulation of PD-I is
mediated by interaction of the HCV core with the complement receptor C1 QBP (Yao ZQ et al. 2007.
Viral Immunol. 20:276-87).
[0042]       The PD-i:PD-L pathway also may play a key role in the chronicity of bacterial infections.
Helicobacterpylori causes chronic gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcers and is a risk factor for
development of gastric cancer. During H. pylori infection, T cell responses are insufficient to clear
infection, leading to persistent infection. Gastric epithelial cells express MHC class II molecules and
are thought to have important APC (antigen-presenting cell) function during H. pylori infection.
Following exposure to H. pylori in vitro or in vivo, PD-LI also is upregulated on human gastric
epithelial cells. Anti-PD-LI blocking antibodies enhance T cell proliferation and IL-2 production in
cultures of gastric epithelial cells exposed to H. pylori and CD4 T cells, suggesting that PD-LI may
play an important role in inhibiting T cell responses during H. pylori infection (Das S et al. 2006. J.
Immunol. 176:3000-9). PD-Li is upregulated in gastric mucosal biopsies from H. pylori-infected
individuals, who show a marked increase in the CD4*CD25"FoxP3* cell population. Naive T cells

    WO 2011/127180                                                                 PCT/US2011/031429
cultured with H. pylori-exposed gastric epithelial cells can develop into functional
CD4*CD25"FoxP3* regulatory T cells (Beswick EJ, et al. 2007. Infect. Immun. 75:4334-41).
[0043]        Parasitic worms also have exploited the PD-i:PD-L pathway to induce macrophages with
strong suppressive function. During Taenia crassiceps infection in mice, PD-Li and PD-L2 are
upregulated on activated macrophages, and a high percentage of CD4 T cells express PD-1. Blockade
of PD-Li, PD-L2, or PD-i significantly decreased suppression of in vitro T cell proliferation by
macrophages from Taenia-infected mice (Terrazas LI et al. 2005. Int. J. Parasitol.35:1349-58).
Similarly, during Schistosoma mansoni infection in mice, macrophages express high levels of PD-Li
and more modest levels of PD-L2. Anti-PD-Li completely abrogated the ability of these macrophages
to suppress T cell proliferation in vitro, whereas anti-PD-L2 had no effect. PD-Li expression on
macrophages from infected mice declines after 12 weeks of infection, correlating with a break in T
cell anergy (Smith P et al. 2004. J. Immunol. 173:1240-48). Thus, an emerging theme is that PD-Li
and PD-L2 can mediate the suppressive functions of macrophages during parasite infections.
[0044]        PD-Li and PD-L2 have distinct roles in the immune response to the protozoan parasite
Leishmania mexicana. Cd274-/- 129Sv mice showed resistance to L. mexicana, whereas
Pdcd1lg2-/- mice developed exacerbated disease with increased parasite burdens. Cd274-/- mice
exhibited a diminished Th2 response, which may explain the increased resistance of Cd274-/- mice.
Pdcd1lg2-/- mice exhibited a marked increase in L. mexicana-specificIgM and IgG2a, which may
contribute to the exacerbated disease observed in Pdcd1lg2-/- mice. Increased parasite-specific IgG
production may suppress the healing response through Fc7R ligation on macrophages.
[0045]        Studies point to a role for PD-Li in limiting immunopathology. Following infection with
LCMV clone 13, WT mice develop a chronic infection, whereas Cd274-/- mice die (Barber DL et al.
2006. Nature 439:682-87). Bone marrow chimera studies point to an important role for PD-Li on
non-bone marrow-derived cells in limiting effector T cell responses and immunopathology.
[0046]        The expression of PD-Li on vascular endothelial cells has led to the hypothesis that PD
LI on endothelial cells may regulate the activation of T cells that contact the vessel wall, the
extravasation of T cells into tissue, and/or limit detrimental consequences of immunopathology.
Cd274-/-Pdcd1lg2-/-mice developed severely increased atherosclerotic lesion burden, suggesting
that PD-Li also may play a significant role in inflammatory diseases in which vascular endothelium
and T cells are important for pathogenesis (Gotsman I et al. 2007. J. Clin. Invest. 117:2974-82).
[0047]        Double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNA) have been shown to block gene expression in
a highly conserved regulatory mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). WO 99/32619 (Fire
et al.) disclosed the use of a dsRNA of at least 25 nucleotides in length to inhibit the expression of
genes in C. elegans. dsRNA has also been shown to degrade target RNA in other organisms,
including plants (see, e.g., WO 99/53050, Waterhouse et al.; and WO 99/61631, Heifetz et al.),
Drosophila(see, e.g., Yang, D., et al., Curr. Biol. (2000) 10:1191-1200), and mammals (see WO
                                                     10

    WO 2011/127180                                                                  PCT/US2011/031429
00/44895, Limmer; and DE 101 00 586.5, Kreutzer et al.). This natural mechanism has now become
the focus for the development of a new class of pharmaceutical agents for treating disorders that are
caused by the aberrant or unwanted regulation of a gene.
[0048]        The iRNAs of the compositions described herein include an RNA strand (the antisense
strand) having a region which is 30 nucleotides or less in length, i.e., 15-30 nucleotides in length,
generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, which region is substantially complementary to at least part of
an mRNA transcript of a CD274/PD-L1 gene. The use of these iRNAs enables the targeted
degradation of mRNAs of genes that are implicated in pathologies associated with CD274/PD-L1
expression in mammals. Very low dosages of CD274/PD-L1 iRNAs in particular can specifically and
efficiently mediate RNAi, resulting in significant inhibition of expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene.
Using cell-based assays, the present inventors have demonstrated that iRNAs targeting CD274/PD-L1
can specifically and efficiently mediate RNAi, resulting in significant inhibition of expression of a
CD274/PD-L1 gene. Thus, methods and compositions including these iRNAs are useful for treating
pathological processes that can be mediated by down regulating CD274/PD-L1, such as in the
treatment of a cancer, hematological malignancy, or infectious disease, e.g., breast cancer or hepatitis
B. The following detailed description discloses how to make and use compositions containing iRNAs
to inhibit the expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene, as well as compositions and methods for treating
diseases and disorders caused by or modulated by the expression of this gene.
[0049]        Embodiments of the pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention include an
iRNA having an antisense strand comprising a region which is 30 nucleotides or less in length,
generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, which region is substantially complementary to at least part of
an RNA transcript of a CD274/PD-L1 gene, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
Embodiments of compositions featured in the invention also include an iRNA having an antisense
strand having a region of complementarity which is 30 nucleotides or less in length, generally 19-24
nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an RNA transcript of a
CD274/PD-L1 gene.
[0050]        Accordingly, in some aspects, pharmaceutical compositions containing a CD274/PD-L1
iRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, methods of using the compositions to inhibit
expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene, and methods of using the pharmaceutical compositions to treat
diseases caused by expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene are featured in the invention.
I.       Definitions
[0051]        For convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the specification,
examples, and appended claims, are provided below. If there is an apparent discrepancy between the
usage of a term in other parts of this specification and its definition provided in this section, the
definition in this section shall prevail.

[0052]       "G," "C," "A," "T" and "U" each generally stand for a nucleotide that contains guanine,
cytosine, adenine, thymidine and uracil as a base, respectively. However, it will be understood that
the term "ribonucleotide" or "nucleotide" can also refer to a modified nucleotide, as further detailed
below, or a surrogate replacement moiety. The skilled person is well aware that guanine, cytosine,
adenine, and uracil can be replaced by other moieties without substantially altering the base pairing
properties of an oligonucleotide comprising a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. For
example, without limitation, a nucleotide comprising inosine as its base can base pair with nucleotides
containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil. Hence, nucleotides containing uracil, guanine, or adenine can
be replaced in the nucleotide sequences of dsRNA featured in the invention by a nucleotide
containing, for example, inosine. In another example, adenine and cytosine anywhere in the
oligonucleotide can be replaced with guanine and uracil, respectively to form G-U Wobble base
pairing with the target mRNA. Sequences containing such replacement moieties are suitable for the
compositions and methods featured in the invention.
[0053]       As used herein, "Programmed Death Ligand-1" ("PD-Li") or "cluster of differentiation
274" ("CD274") refers to a particular polypeptide expressed in a cell. PD-Li is also known as
CD274, B7-H1, PDCD1L1, PDCD1LG1, and PDL1. The sequence of a human CD274/PD-L1
mRNA transcript can be found at NM_014143.2 (SEQ ID NO: 869). The sequence of mouse
CD274/PD-L1 mRNA can be found at NM_021893 (SEQ ID NO: 870), and the sequence of rat
CD274/PD-L1 mRNA can be found at XM_001079572.1 (SEQ ID NO: 871) or XM_574652.2; (SEQ
ID NO: 872).
[0054]       As used herein, the term "iRNA" refers to an agent that contains RNA as that term is
defined herein, and which mediates the targeted cleavage of an RNA transcript via an RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC) pathway. In one embodiment, an iRNA as described herein effects
inhibition of CD274/PD-L1 expression. Alternatively, in another embodiment, an iRNA as described
herein activates CD274/PD-L1 expression.
[0055]       As used herein, "target sequence" refers to a contiguous portion of the nucleotide
sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of a CD274/PD-L1 gene, including
messenger RNA (mRNA) that is a product of RNA processing of a primary transcription product.
The target portion of the sequence will be at least long enough to serve as a substrate for iRNA
directed cleavage at or near that portion. For example, the target sequence will generally be from 9
36 nucleotides in length, e.g., 15-30 nucleotides in length, including all sub-ranges therebetween. As
non-limiting examples, the target sequence can be from 15-30 nucleotides, 15-26 nucleotides, 15-23
nucleotides, 15-22 nucleotides, 15-21 nucleotides, 15-20 nucleotides, 15-19 nucleotides,     15-18
nucleotides, 15-17 nucleotides, 18-30 nucleotides, 18-26 nucleotides, 18-23 nucleotides, 18-22

nucleotides, or 21-22 nucleotides.
[0056]       As used herein, the term "strand comprising a sequence" refers to an oligonucleotide
comprising a chain of nucleotides that is described by the sequence referred to using the standard
nucleotide nomenclature.
[0057]       As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term "complementary," when used to
describe a first nucleotide sequence in relation to a second nucleotide sequence, refers to the ability of
an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the first nucleotide sequence to hybridize and form a
duplex structure under certain conditions with an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the
second nucleotide sequence, as will be understood by the skilled person. Such conditions can, for
example, be stringent conditions, where stringent conditions may include: 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM
PIPES pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50'C or 70'C for 12-16 hours followed by washing. Other conditions,
such as physiologically relevant conditions as can be encountered inside an organism, can apply. The
skilled person will be able to determine the set of conditions most appropriate for a test of
complementarity of two sequences in accordance with the ultimate application of the hybridized
nucleotides.
[0058]       Complementary sequences within an iRNA, e.g., within a dsRNA as described herein,
include base-pairing of the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a first nucleotide sequence
to an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a second nucleotide sequence over the entire
length of one or both nucleotide sequences. Such sequences can be referred to as "fully
complementary" with respect to each other herein. However, where a first sequence is referred to as
"substantially complementary" with respect to a second sequence herein, the two sequences can be
fully complementary, or they can form one or more, but generally not more than 5, 4, 3 or 2
mismatched base pairs upon hybridization for a duplex up to 30 base pairs (bp), while retaining the
ability to hybridize under the conditions most relevant to their ultimate application, e.g., inhibition of
gene expression via a RISC pathway. However, where two oligonucleotides are designed to form,
upon hybridization, one or more single stranded overhangs, such overhangs shall not be regarded as
mismatches with regard to the determination of complementarity. For example, a dsRNA comprising
one oligonucleotide 21 nucleotides in length and another oligonucleotide 23 nucleotides in length,
wherein the longer oligonucleotide comprises a sequence of 21 nucleotides that is fully
complementary to the shorter oligonucleotide, can yet be referred to as "fully complementary" for the
purposes described herein.
[0059]       "Complementary" sequences, as used herein, can also include, or be formed entirely
from, non-Watson-Crick base pairs and/or base pairs formed from non-natural and modified
nucleotides, in as far as the above requirements with respect to their ability to hybridize are fulfilled.

    WO 2011/127180                                                                          PCT/US2011/031429
Such non-Watson-Crick base pairs includes, but are not limited to, G:U Wobble or Hoogstein base
pairing.
[0060]        The terms "complementary," "fully complementary" and "substantially complementary"
herein can be used with respect to the base matching between the sense strand and the antisense strand
of a dsRNA, or between the antisense strand of an iRNA agent and a target sequence, as will be
understood from the context of their use.
[0061]        As used herein, a polynucleotide that is "substantially complementary to at least part of' a
messenger RNA (an mRNA) refers to a polynucleotide that is substantially complementary to a
contiguous portion of the mRNA of interest (e.g., an mRNA encoding CD274/PD-L1). For example,
a polynucleotide is complementary to at least a part of a CD274/PD-L 1 mRNA if the sequence is
substantially complementary to a non-interrupted portion of an mRNA encoding CD274/PD-L 1.
[0062]        The term "double-stranded RNA" or "dsRNA," as used herein, refers to an iRNA that
includes an RNA molecule or complex of molecules having a hybridized duplex region that comprises
two anti-parallel and substantially complementary nucleic acid strands, which will be referred to as
having "sense" and "antisense" orientations with respect to a target RNA. The duplex region can be
of any length that permits specific degradation of a desired target RNA through a RISC pathway, but
will typically range from 9 to 36 base pairs in length, e.g., 15-30 base pairs in length. Considering a
duplex between 9 and 36 base pairs, the duplex can be any length in this range, for example, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, or 36 and
any sub-range therein between, including, but not limited to 15-30 base pairs, 15-26 base pairs, 15-23
base pairs, 15-22 base pairs, 15-21 base pairs, 15-20 base pairs, 15-19 base pairs, 15-18 base pairs,
15-17 base pairs, 18-30 base pairs, 18-26 base pairs, 18-23 base pairs, 18-22 base pairs, 18-21 base
pairs, 18-20 base pairs, 19-30 base pairs, 19-26 base pairs, 19-23 base pairs, 19-22 base pairs, 19-21
base pairs, 19-20 base pairs, 20-30 base pairs, 20-26 base pairs, 20-25 base pairs, 20-24 base pairs,
20-23 base pairs, 20-22 base pairs, 20-21 base pairs, 21-30 base pairs, 21-26 base pairs, 21-25 base
pairs, 21-24 base pairs, 21-23 base pairs, or 21-22 base pairs. dsRNAs generated in the cell by
processing with Dicer and similar enzymes are generally in the range of 19-22 base pairs in length.
One strand of the duplex region of a dsDNA comprises a sequence that is substantially
complementary to a region of a target RNA. The two strands forming the duplex structure can be
from a single RNA molecule having at least one self-complementary region, or can be formed from
two or more separate RNA molecules. Where the duplex region is formed from two strands of a
single molecule, the molecule can have a duplex region separated by a single stranded chain of
nucleotides (herein referred to as a "hairpin loop") between the 3'-end of one strand and the 5'-end of
the respective other strand forming the duplex structure. The hairpin loop can comprise at least one
unpaired nucleotide; in some embodiments the hairpin loop can comprise at least 3, at least 4, at least
5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 20, at least 23 or more unpaired
                                                            14

    WO 2011/127180                                                                       PCT/US2011/031429
nucleotides. Where the two substantially complementary strands of a dsRNA are comprised by
separate RNA molecules, those molecules need not, but can be covalently connected. Where the two
strands are connected covalently by means other than a hairpin loop, the connecting structure is
referred to as a "linker." The term "siRNA" is also used herein to refer to a dsRNA as described
above.
[0063]        The skilled artisan will recognize that the term "RNA molecule" or "ribonucleic acid
molecule" encompasses not only RNA molecules as expressed or found in nature, but also analogs
and derivatives of RNA comprising one or more ribonucleotide/ribonucleoside analogs or derivatives
as described herein or as known in the art. Strictly speaking, a "ribonucleoside" includes a nucleoside
base and a ribose sugar, and a "ribonucleotide" is a ribonucleoside with one, two or three phosphate
moieties. However, the terms "ribonucleoside" and "ribonucleotide" can be considered to be
equivalent as used herein. The RNA can be modified in the nucleobase structure or in the ribose
phosphate backbone structure, e.g., as described herein below. However, the molecules comprising
ribonucleoside analogs or derivatives must retain the ability to form a duplex. As non-limiting
examples, an RNA molecule can also include at least one modified ribonucleoside including but not
limited to a 2'-O-methyl modified nucleoside, a nucleoside comprising a 5' phosphorothioate group, a
terminal nucleoside linked to a cholesteryl derivative or dodecanoic acid bisdecylamide group, a
locked nucleoside, an abasic nucleoside, a 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro modified nucleoside, a 2-amino
modified nucleoside, 2'-alkyl-modified nucleoside, morpholino nucleoside, a phosphoramidate or a
non-natural base comprising nucleoside, or any combination thereof. Alternatively, an RNA molecule
can comprise at least two modified ribonucleosides, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7,
at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20 or more, up to the entire length of the dsRNA
molecule. The modifications need not be the same for each of such a plurality of modified
ribonucleosides in an RNA molecule. In one embodiment, modified RNAs contemplated for use in
methods and compositions described herein are peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) that have the ability to
form the required duplex structure and that permit or mediate the specific degradation of a target RNA
via a RISC pathway.
[0064]        In one aspect, a modified ribonucleoside includes a deoxyribonucleoside.          In such an
instance, an iRNA agent can comprise one or more deoxynucleosides, including, for example, a
deoxynucleoside overhang(s), or one or more deoxynucleosides within the double stranded portion of
a dsRNA. However, it is self evident that under no circumstances is a double stranded DNA molecule
encompassed by the term "iRNA."
[0065]        In one aspect, an RNA interference agent includes a single stranded RNA that interacts
with a target RNA sequence to direct the cleavage of the target RNA. Without wishing to be bound by
theory, long double stranded RNA introduced into plants and invertebrate cells is broken down into
siRNA by a Type III endonuclease known as Dicer (Sharp et al., Genes Dev. 2001, 15:485). Dicer, a
                                                           15

    WO 2011/127180                                                                  PCT/US2011/031429
ribonuclease-III-like enzyme, processes the dsRNA into 19-23 base pair short interfering RNAs with
characteristic two base 3' overhangs (Bernstein, et al., (2001) Nature 409:363). The siRNAs are then
incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where one or more helicases unwind the
siRNA duplex, enabling the complementary antisense strand to guide target recognition (Nykanen, et
al., (2001) Cell 107:309). Upon binding to the appropriate target mRNA, one or more endonucleases
within the RISC cleaves the target to induce silencing (Elbashir, et al., (2001) Genes Dev. 15:188).
Thus, in one aspect the invention relates to a single stranded RNA that promotes the formation of a
RISC complex to effect silencing of the target gene.
[0066]       As used herein, the term "nucleotide overhang" refers to at least one unpaired nucleotide
that protrudes from the duplex structure of an iRNA, e.g., a dsRNA. For example, when a 3-end of
one strand of a dsRNA extends beyond the 5'-end of the other strand, or vice versa, there is a
nucleotide overhang. A dsRNA can comprise an overhang of at least one nucleotide; alternatively the
overhang can comprise at least two nucleotides, at least three nucleotides, at least four nucleotides, at
least five nucleotides or more. A nucleotide overhang can comprise or consist of a
nucleotide/nucleoside analog, including a deoxynucleotide/nucleoside. The overhang(s) may be on
the sense strand, the antisense strand or any combination thereof. Furthermore, the nucleotide(s) of an
overhang can be present on the 5' end, 3' end or both ends of either an antisense or sense strand of a
dsRNA.
[0067]       In one embodiment, the antisense strand of a dsRNA has a 1-10 nucleotide overhang at
the 3' end and/or the 5' end. In one embodiment, the sense strand of a dsRNA has a 1-10 nucleotide
overhang at the 3' end and/or the 5' end. In another embodiment, one or more of the nucleotides in
the overhang is replaced with a nucleoside thiophosphate.
[0068]       The terms "blunt" or "blunt ended" as used herein in reference to a dsRNA mean that
there are no unpaired nucleotides or nucleotide analogs at a given terminal end of a dsRNA, i.e., no
nucleotide overhang. One or both ends of a dsRNA can be blunt. Where both ends of a dsRNA are
blunt, the dsRNA is said to be blunt ended. To be clear, a "blunt ended" dsRNA is a dsRNA that is
blunt at both ends, i.e., no nucleotide overhang at either end of the molecule. Most often such a
molecule will be double-stranded over its entire length.
[0069]       The term "antisense strand" or "guide strand" refers to the strand of an iRNA, e.g., a
dsRNA, which includes a region that is substantially complementary to a target sequence. As used
herein, the term "region of complementarity" refers to the region on the antisense strand that is
substantially complementary to a sequence, for example a target sequence, as defined herein. Where
the region of complementarity is not fully complementary to the target sequence, the mismatches may
be in the internal or terminal regions of the molecule. Generally, the most tolerated mismatches are in
the terminal regions, e.g., within 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5' and/or 3' terminus.

[0070]        The term "sense strand," or "passenger strand" as used herein, refers to the strand of an
iRNA that includes a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense strand as
that term is defined herein.
[0071]        As used herein, in one embodiment, the term "SNALP" refers to a stable nucleic acid
lipid particle. A SNALP represents a vesicle of lipids coating a reduced aqueous interior comprising a
nucleic acid such as an iRNA or a plasmid from which an iRNA is transcribed. SNALPs are
described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20060240093, 20070135372, and in
International Application No. WO 2009082817. These applications are incorporated herein by
reference in their entirety. Examples of "SNALP" formulations are described elsewhere herein.
[0072]        "Introducing into a cell," when referring to an iRNA, means facilitating or effecting
uptake or absorption into the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art. Absorption or uptake of
an iRNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or
devices. The meaning of this term is not limited to cells in vitro; an iRNA can also be "introduced
into a cell," wherein the cell is part of a living organism. In such an instance, introduction into the
cell will include the delivery to the organism. For example, for in vivo delivery, iRNA can be injected
into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vivo delivery can also be by a beta-glucan delivery
system, such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,032,401 and 5,607,677, and U.S. Publication
No. 2005/0281781, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In vitro introduction
into a cell includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and lipofection. Further
approaches are described herein below or are known in the art.
[0073]        As used herein, the term "modulate the expression of," refers to at an least partial
"inhibition" or partial "activation" of CD274/PD-L1 gene expression in a cell treated with an iRNA
composition as described herein compared to the expression of CD274/PD-L1 in an untreated cell.
[0074]        The terms "activate," "enhance," "up-regulate the expression of," "increase the
expression of," and the like, in so far as they refer to a CD274/PD-L1 gene, herein refer to the at least
partial activation of the expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene, as manifested by an increase in the
amount of CD274/PD-L1 mRNA, which may be isolated from or detected in a first cell or group of
cells in which a CD274/PD-L1 gene is transcribed and which has or have been treated such that the
expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene is increased, as compared to a second cell or group of cells
substantially identical to the first cell or group of cells but which has or have not been so treated
(control cells).
[0075]        In one embodiment, expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene is activated by at least about
10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% by administration of an iRNA as described
herein. In some embodiments, a CD274/PD-L1 gene is activated by at least about 60%, 70%, or 80%
by administration of an iRNA featured in the invention. In some embodiments, expression of a
CD274/PD-L1 gene is activated by at least about 85%, 90%, or 95% or more by administration of an
                                                       17

iRNA as described herein. In some embodiments, the CD274/PD-L1 gene expression is increased by
at least 1-fold, at least 2-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 50-fold, at least 100-fold, at least
500-fold, at least 1000 fold or more in cells treated with an iRNA as described herein compared to the
expression in an untreated cell. Activation of expression by small dsRNAs is described, for example,
in Li et al., 2006 Proc. Nal.Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103:17337-42, and in US20070111963 and
US2005226848, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
[0076]        The terms "silence," "inhibit the expression of," "down-regulate the expression of,"
"suppress the expression of," and the like, in so far as they refer to a CD274/PD-L1 gene, herein refer
to the at least partial suppression of the expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene, as manifested by a
reduction of the amount of CD274/PD-L1 mRNA which may be isolated from or detected in a first
cell or group of cells in which a CD274/PD-L1 gene is transcribed and which has or have been treated
such that the expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene is inhibited, as compared to a second cell or group
of cells substantially identical to the first cell or group of cells but which has or have not been so
treated (control cells). The degree of inhibition is usually expressed in terms of
 (mRNA in control cells) - (mRNA in treated cells)            *100%
                 (mRNA in control cells)
[0077]        Alternatively, the degree of inhibition may be given in terms of a reduction of a parameter
that is functionally linked to CD274/PD-L1 gene expression, e.g., the amount of protein encoded by a
CD274/PD-L1 gene, or the number of cells displaying a certain phenotype, e.g., lack of or decreased
cytokine production. In principle, CD274/PD-L1 gene silencing may be determined in any cell
expressing CD274/PD-L1, either constitutively or by genomic engineering, and by any appropriate
assay. However, when a reference is needed in order to determine whether a given iRNA inhibits the
expression of the CD274/PD-L1 gene by a certain degree and therefore is encompassed by the instant
invention, the assays provided in the Examples below shall serve as such reference.
[0078]        For example, in certain instances, expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene is suppressed by at
least about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% by administration of an iRNA
featured in the invention. In some embodiments, a CD274/PD-L1 gene is suppressed by at least about
60%, 70%, or 80% by administration of an iRNA described herein. In some embodiments, a
CD274/PD-L1 gene is suppressed by at least about 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, or more by
administration of an iRNA as described herein.
[0079]        As used herein in the context of CD274/PD-L1 expression, the terms "treat," "treatment,"
and the like, refer to relief from or alleviation of pathological processes mediated by CD274/PD-L1
expression. In the context of the present invention insofar as it relates to any of the other conditions
recited herein below (other than pathological processes mediated by CD274/PD-L1 expression), the
terms "treat," "treatment," and the like mean to relieve or alleviate at least one symptom associated
                                                         18

    WO 2011/127180                                                                  PCT/US2011/031429
with such condition, or to slow or reverse the progression or anticipated progression of such
condition, such as slowing the progression of a malignancy or cancer, or increasing the clearance of
an infectious organism to alleviate/reduce the symptoms caused by the infection, e.g., hepatitis caused
by infection with a hepatitis virus.
[0080]        By "lower" in the context of a disease marker or symptom is meant a statistically
significant decrease in such level. The decrease can be, for example, at least 10%, at least 20%, at
least 30%, at least 40% or more, and is preferably down to a level accepted as within the range of
normal for an individual without such disorder.
[0081]        As used herein, the phrases "therapeutically effective amount" and "prophylactically
effective amount" refer to an amount that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment, prevention,
or management of pathological processes mediated by CD274/PD-L1 expression or an overt symptom
of pathological processes mediated by CD274/PD-L1 expression. The specific amount that is
therapeutically effective can be readily determined by an ordinary medical practitioner, and can vary
depending on factors known in the art, such as, for example, the type of pathological processes
mediated by CD274/PD-L1 expression, the patient's history and age, the stage of pathological
processes mediated by CD274/PD-L1 expression, and the administration of other agents that inhibit
pathological processes mediated by CD274/PD-L1 expression.
[0082]        As used herein, a "pharmaceutical composition" comprises a pharmacologically effective
amount of an iRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, "pharmacologically
effective amount," "therapeutically effective amount" or simply "effective amount" refers to that
amount of an iRNA effective to produce the intended pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive
result. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 10%
reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective
amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to effect at least
a 10% reduction in that parameter. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of an iRNA
targeting CD274/PD-L1 can reduce CD274/PD-L1 protein levels by at least 10%.
[0083]        The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to a carrier for administration of a
therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose,
water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term specifically excludes cell culture
medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not
limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding
agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives.
Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and
lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may
include starch and gelatin, while the lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium
stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl
                                                        19

monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Agents included
in drug formulations are described further herein below.
[0084]       As used herein, a "subject" is a mammal, e. g. a dog, horse, cat, and other non-human
primates. In a preferred embodiment, a subject is a human.
[0085]       As used herein, the term "LNPXX", wherein the "XX" are numerals, is also referred to as
"AFXX" herein. For example, LNPO9 is also referred to AF09 and LNP12 is also known as or
referred to as AF12.
[0086]       As used herein, the term "comprising" or "comprises" is used in reference to
compositions, methods, and respective component(s) thereof, that are essential to the invention, yet
open to the inclusion of unspecified elements, whether essential or not.
[0087]       As used herein, the term "consisting essentially of" refers to those elements required for a
given embodiment. The term permits the presence of elements that do not materially affect the basic
and novel or functional characteristic(s) of that embodiment of the invention.
[0088]       The term "consisting of" refers to compositions, methods, and respective components
thereof as described herein, which are exclusive of any element not recited in that description of the
embodiment.
II.      Double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA)
[0089]       Described herein are iRNA agents that inhibit the expression of the CD274/PD-L1 gene.
In one embodiment, the iRNA agent includes double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) molecules
for inhibiting the expression of a CD274/PD-Llgene in a cell or mammal, e.g., in a human having a
cancer or infectious disease, where the dsRNA includes an antisense strand having a region of
complementarity which is complementary to at least a part of an mRNA formed in the expression of a
CD274/PD-L1 gene, and where the region of complementarity is 30 nucleotides or less in length,
generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and where the dsRNA, upon contact with a cell expressing the
CD274/PD-L1 gene, inhibits the expression of the CD274/PD-L1 gene by at least 10% as assayed by,
for example, a PCR or branched DNA (bDNA)-based method, or by a protein-based method, such as
by Western blot. In one embodiment, the iRNA agent activates the expression of a CD274/PD-L1
gene in a cell or mammal. Expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene in cell culture, such as in COS cells,
HeLa cells, primary hepatocytes, HepG2 cells, primary cultured cells or in a biological sample from a
subject can be assayed by measuring CD274/PD-L1 mRNA levels, such as by bDNA or TaqMan
assay, or by measuring protein levels, such as by immunofluorescence analysis, using, for example,
Western blotting or flow cytometric techniques.
[0090]       A dsRNA includes two RNA strands that are sufficiently complementary to hybridize to
form a duplex structure under conditions in which the dsRNA will be used. One strand of a dsRNA
(the antisense strand) includes a region of complementarity that is substantially complementary, and
                                                    20

    WO 2011/127180                                                                   PCT/US2011/031429
generally fully complementary, to a target sequence. The target sequence can be derived from the
sequence of an mRNA formed during the expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene. The other strand (the
sense strand) includes a region that is complementary to the antisense strand, such that the two strands
hybridize and form a duplex structure when combined under suitable conditions. Generally, the
duplex structure is between 15 and 30 inclusive, more generally between 18 and 25 inclusive, yet
more generally between 19 and 24 inclusive, and most generally between 19 and 21 base pairs in
length, inclusive. Similarly, the region of complementarity to the target sequence is between 15 and
30 inclusive, more generally between 18 and 25 inclusive, yet more generally between 19 and 24
inclusive, and most generally between 19 and 21 nucleotides in length, inclusive. In some
embodiments, the dsRNA is between 15 and 20 nucleotides in length, inclusive, and in other
embodiments, the dsRNA is between 25 and 30 nucleotides in length, inclusive. As the ordinarily
skilled person will recognize, the targeted region of an RNA targeted for cleavage will most often be
part of a larger RNA molecule, often an mRNA molecule. Where relevant, a "part" of an mRNA
target is a contiguous sequence of an mRNA target of sufficient length to be a substrate for RNAi
directed cleavage (i.e., cleavage through a RISC pathway). dsRNAs having duplexes as short as 9
base pairs can, under some circumstances, mediate RNAi-directed RNA cleavage. Most often a target
will be at least 15 nucleotides in length, preferably 15-30 nucleotides in length.
[0091]        One of skill in the art will also recognize that the duplex region is a primary functional
portion of a dsRNA, e.g., a duplex region of 9 to 36, e.g., 15-30 base pairs. Thus, in one embodiment,
to the extent that it becomes processed to a functional duplex of e.g., 15-30 base pairs that targets a
desired RNA for cleavage, an RNA molecule or complex of RNA molecules having a duplex region
greater than 30 base pairs is a dsRNA. Thus, an ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize that in one
embodiment, then, an miRNA is a dsRNA. In another embodiment, a dsRNA is not a naturally
occurring miRNA. In another embodiment, an iRNA agent useful to target CD274/PD-L1 expression
is not generated in the target cell by cleavage of a larger dsRNA.
[0092]        A dsRNA as described herein can further include one or more single-stranded nucleotide
overhangs. The dsRNA can be synthesized by standard methods known in the art as further discussed
below, e.g., by use of an automated DNA synthesizer, such as are commercially available from, for
example, Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, Inc. In one embodiment, a CD274/PD-L1 gene is a human
CD274/PD-L1 gene. In another embodiment the CD274/PD-L1 gene is a mouse or a rat CD274/PD
LI gene. In specific embodiments, the first sequence is a sense strand of a dsRNA that includes a
sense sequence from Table 2 (SEQ ID NO: 5- SEQ ID NO: 436), Table 3 (SEQ ID NO: 437- SEQ ID
NO: 868), and Table 5 (SEQ ID NO: 877- SEQ ID NO: 924), and the second sequence is selected
from the group consisting of the corresponding antisense sequences of Table 2 (SEQ ID NO: 5- SEQ
ID NO: 436), Table 3 (SEQ ID NO: 437- SEQ ID NO: 868), and Table 5 (SEQ ID NO: 877- SEQ ID
NO: 924). Alternative dsRNA agents that target elsewhere in the target sequence provided in Table 2,

Table 3, and Table 5 can readily be determined using the target sequence and the flanking CD274/PD
LI sequence.
[0093]        In one aspect, a dsRNA will include at least nucleotide sequences, whereby the sense
strand is selected from the groups of sense sequences provided in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5, and
the corresponding antisense strand of the sense strand selected from Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5. In
this aspect, one of the two sequences is complementary to the other of the two sequences, with one of
the sequences being substantially complementary to a sequence of an mRNA generated in the
expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene. As such, in this aspect, a dsRNA will include two
oligonucleotides, where one oligonucleotide is described as the sense strand in Table 2, Table 3, and
Table 5,, and the second oligonucleotide is described as the corresponding antisense strand of the
sense strand from Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5. As described elsewhere herein and as known in the
art, the complementary sequences of a dsRNA can also be contained as self-complementary regions of
a single nucleic acid molecule, as opposed to being on separate oligonucleotides.
[0094]        The skilled person is well aware that dsRNAs having a duplex structure of between 20
and 23, but specifically 21, base pairs have been hailed as particularly effective in inducing RNA
interference (Elbashir et al., EMBO 2001, 20:6877-6888). However, others have found that shorter or
longer RNA duplex structures can be effective as well. In the embodiments described above, by
virtue of the nature of the oligonucleotide sequences provided in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5,
dsRNAs described herein can include at least one strand of a length of minimally 21 nt. It can be
reasonably expected that shorter duplexes having one of the sequences of Table 2, Table 3, and Table
5, minus only a few nucleotides on one or both ends may be similarly effective as compared to the
dsRNAs described above. Hence, dsRNAs having a partial sequence of at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
or more contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences of Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5, and
differing in their ability to inhibit the expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene by not more than 5, 10, 15,
20, 25, or 30 % inhibition from a dsRNA comprising the full sequence, are contemplated according to
the invention.
[0095]        In addition, the RNAs provided in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5 identify a site in a
CD274/PD-L1 transcript that is susceptible to RISC-mediated cleavage. As such, the present
invention further features iRNAs that target within one of such sequences. As used herein, an iRNA
is said to target within a particular site of an RNA transcript if the iRNA promotes cleavage of the
transcript anywhere within that particular site. Such an iRNA will generally include at least 15
contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences provided in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5, coupled
to additional nucleotide sequences taken from the region contiguous to the selected sequence in a
CD274/PD-L1 gene.
[0096]        While a target sequence is generally 15-30 nucleotides in length, there is wide variation in
the suitability of particular sequences in this range for directing cleavage of any given target RNA.

    WO 2011/127180                                                                   PCT/US2011/031429
Various software packages and the guidelines set out herein provide guidance for the identification of
optimal target sequences for any given gene target, but an empirical approach can also be taken in
which a "window" or "mask" of a given size (as a non-limiting example, 21 nucleotides) is literally or
figuratively (including, e.g., in silico) placed on the target RNA sequence to identify sequences in the
size range that may serve as target sequences. By moving the sequence "window" progressively one
nucleotide upstream or downstream of an initial target sequence location, the next potential target
sequence can be identified, until the complete set of possible sequences is identified for any given
target size selected. This process, coupled with systematic synthesis and testing of the identified
sequences (using assays as described herein or as known in the art) to identify those sequences that
perform optimally can identify those RNA sequences that, when targeted with an iRNA agent,
mediate the best inhibition of target gene expression. Thus, while the sequences identified, for
example, in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 5 represent effective target sequences, it is contemplated that
further optimization of inhibition efficiency can be achieved by progressively "walking the window"
one nucleotide upstream or downstream of the given sequences to identify sequences with equal or
better inhibition characteristics.
[0097]        Further, it is contemplated that for any sequence identified, e.g., i Table 2, Table 3, and
Table 5, further optimization could be achieved by systematically either adding or removing
nucleotides to generate longer or shorter sequences and testing those and sequences generated by
walking a window of the longer or shorter size up or down the target RNA from that point. Again,
coupling this approach to generating new candidate targets with testing for effectiveness of iRNAs
based on those target sequences in an inhibition assay as known in the art or as described herein can
lead to further improvements in the efficiency of inhibition. Further still, such optimized sequences
can be adjusted by, e.g., the introduction of modified nucleotides as described herein or as known in
the art, addition or changes in overhang, or other modifications as known in the art and/or discussed
herein to further optimize the molecule (e.g., increasing serum stability or circulating half-life,
increasing thermal stability, enhancing transmembrane delivery, targeting to a particular location or
cell type, increasing interaction with silencing pathway enzymes, increasing release from endosomes,
etc.) as an expression inhibitor.
[0098]        An iRNA as described herein can contain one or more mismatches to the target sequence.
In one embodiment, an iRNA as described herein contains no more than 3 mismatches. If the
antisense strand of the iRNA contains mismatches to a target sequence, it is preferable that the area of
mismatch not be located in the center of the region of complementarity. If the antisense strand of the
iRNA contains mismatches to the target sequence, it is preferable that the mismatch be restricted to be
within the last 5 nucleotides from either the 5' or 3' end of the region of complementarity. For
example, for a 23 nucleotide iRNA agent RNA strand which is complementary to a region of a
CD274/PD-L1 gene, the RNA strand generally does not contain any mismatch within the central
                                                      23

     WO 2011/127180                                                                 PCT/US2011/031429
13 nucleotides. The methods described herein or methods known in the art can be used to determine
whether an iRNA containing a mismatch to a target sequence is effective in inhibiting the expression
of a CD274/PD-L1 gene. Consideration of the efficacy of iRNAs with mismatches in inhibiting
expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene is important, especially if the particular region of
complementarity in a CD274/PD-L1 gene is known to have polymorphic sequence variation within
the population.
[0099]        In one embodiment, at least one end of a dsRNA has a single-stranded nucleotide
overhang of 1 to 4, generally 1 or 2 nucleotides. dsRNAs having at least one nucleotide overhang
have unexpectedly superior inhibitory properties relative to their blunt-ended counterparts. In yet
another embodiment, the RNA of an iRNA, e.g., a dsRNA, is chemically modified to enhance
stability or other beneficial characteristics. The nucleic acids featured in the invention may be
synthesized and/or modified by methods well established in the art, such as those described in
"Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry," Beaucage, S.L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,
New York, NY, USA, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Modifications include, for
example, (a) end modifications, e.g., 5' end modifications (phosphorylation, conjugation, inverted
linkages, etc.) 3' end modifications (conjugation, DNA nucleotides, inverted linkages, etc.), (b) base
modifications, e.g., replacement with stabilizing bases, destabilizing bases, or bases that base pair
with an expanded repertoire of partners, removal of bases (abasic nucleotides), or conjugated bases,
(c) sugar modifications (e.g., at the 2' position or 4' position) or replacement of the sugar, as well as
(d) backbone modifications, including modification or replacement of the phosphodiester linkages.
Specific examples of RNA compounds useful in the embodiments described herein include, but are
not limited to RNAs containing modified backbones or no natural internucleoside linkages. RNAs
having modified backbones include, among others, those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the
backbone. For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in the art, modified
RNAs that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to
be oligonucleosides. In particular embodiments, the modified RNA will have a phosphorus atom in
its internucleoside backbone.
[00100]       Modified RNA backbones can include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral
phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and
other alkyl phosphonates including 3'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates,
phosphoramidates including 3-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates,
thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, and
boranophosphates having normal 3'-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and those) having
inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are linked 3'-5' to 5'-3' or 2'-5' to 5'-2'.
Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.

[00104]      In other RNA mimetics suitable or contemplated for use in iRNAs, both the sugar and the
internucleoside linkage, i.e., the backbone, of the nucleotide units are replaced with novel groups. The
base units are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target compound. One
such oligomeric compound, an RNA mimetic that has been shown to have excellent hybridization
properties, is referred to as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In PNA compounds, the sugar backbone of
an RNA is replaced with an aide       containing backbone, in particular an aminoethylglycine backbone.
The nucleobases are retained and are bound directly or indirectly to aza nitrogen atoms of the aide

chemically linking to the RNA one or more ligands, moieties or conjugates that enhance the activity,
cellular distribution, pharmacokinetic properties, or cellular uptake of the iRNA. Such moieties
include but are not limited to lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl.

18:3777-3783), a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain (Manoharan et al., Nucleosides &
Nucleotides, 1995, 14:969-973), or adamantane acetic acid (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett.,
1995, 36:3651-3654), a palmityl moiety (Mishra et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1995, 1264:229-237),
or an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyloxycholesterol moiety (Crooke et al., J. Pharmacol.
Exp. Ther., 1996, 277:923-937).
[00113]       In one embodiment, a ligand alters the distribution, targeting or lifetime of an iRNA agent
into which it is incorporated. In preferred embodiments a ligand provides an enhanced affinity for a
selected target, e.g., molecule, cell or cell type, compartment, e.g., a cellular or organ compartment,
tissue, organ or region of the body, as, e.g., compared to a species absent such a ligand. Preferred
ligands will not take part in duplex pairing in a duplexed nucleic acid.
[00114]       Ligands can include a naturally occurring substance, such as a protein (e.g., human serum
albumin (HSA), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or globulin); carbohydrate (e.g., a dextran, pullulan,
chitin, chitosan, inulin, cyclodextrin or hyaluronic acid); or a lipid. The ligand may also be a
recombinant or synthetic molecule, such as a synthetic polymer, e.g., a synthetic polyamino acid.

peptidomimetic polyamine, dendrimer polyamine, arginine, amidine, protamine, cationic lipid,
cationic porphyrin, quaternary salt of a polyamine, or an alpha helical peptide.
[00115]       Ligands can also include targeting groups, e.g., a cell or tissue targeting agent, e.g., a
lectin, glycoprotein, lipid or protein, e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type such as a
kidney cell. A targeting group can be a thyrotropin, melanotropin, lectin, glycoprotein, surfactant
protein A, Mucin carbohydrate, multivalent lactose, multivalent galactose, N-acetyl-galactosamine,
N-acetyl-gulucosamine multivalent mannose, multivalent fucose, glycosylated polyaminoacids,
multivalent galactose, transferrin, bisphosphonate, polyglutamate, polyaspartate, a lipid, cholesterol, a
steroid, bile acid, folate, vitamin B 12, vitamin A, biotin, or an RGD peptide or RGD peptide mimetic.
[00116]       Other examples of ligands include dyes, intercalating agents (e.g. acridines), cross-linkers
(e.g. psoralene, mitomycin C), porphyrins (TPPC4, texaphyrin, Sapphyrin), polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (e.g., phenazine, dihydrophenazine), artificial endonucleases (e.g. EDTA), lipophilic
molecules, e.g., cholesterol, cholic acid, adamantane acetic acid, 1-pyrene butyric acid,
dihydrotestosterone, 1,3-Bis-O(hexadecyl)glycerol, geranyloxyhexyl group, hexadecylglycerol,
borneol, menthol, 1,3-propanediol, heptadecyl group, palmitic acid, myristic acid,03
(oleoyl)lithocholic acid, 03-(oleoyl)cholenic acid, dimethoxytrityl, or phenoxazine)and peptide
conjugates (e.g., antennapedia peptide, Tat peptide), alkylating agents, phosphate, amino, mercapto,

imidazole conjugates, Eu3+ complexes of tetraazamacrocycles), dinitrophenyl, HRP, or AP.
[00117]       Ligands can be proteins, e.g., glycoproteins, or peptides, e.g., molecules having a specific
affinity for a co-ligand, or antibodies e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type such as a
cancer cell, endothelial cell, or bone cell. Ligands may also include hormones and hormone receptors.
They can also include non-peptidic species, such as lipids, lectins, carbohydrates, vitamins, cofactors,
multivalent lactose, multivalent galactose, N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-gulucosamine
multivalent mannose, or multivalent fucose. The ligand can be, for example, a lipopolysaccharide, an
activator of p38 MAP kinase, or an activator of NF-KB.
[00118]       The ligand can be a substance, e.g, a drug, which can increase the uptake of the iRNA
agent into the cell, for example, by disrupting the cell's cytoskeleton, e.g., by disrupting the cell's
microtubules, microfilaments, and/or intermediate filaments. The drug can be, for example, taxon,
vincristine, vinblastine, cytochalasin, nocodazole, japlakinolide, latrunculin A, phalloidin, swinholide
A, indanocine, or myoservin.

[00119]       In some embodiments, a ligand attached to an iRNA as described herein acts as a
pharmacokinetic (PK) modulator. As used herein, a "PK modulator" refers to a pharmacokinetic
modulator. PK modulators include lipophiles, bile acids, steroids, phospholipid analogues, peptides,
protein binding agents, PEG, vitamins etc. Examplary PK modulators include, but are not limited to,
cholesterol, fatty acids, cholic acid, lithocholic acid, dialkylglycerides, diacylglyceride, phospholipids,
sphingolipids, naproxen, ibuprofen, vitamin E, biotin etc. Oligonucleotides that comprise a number of
phosphorothioate linkages are also known to bind to serum protein, thus short oligonucleotides, e.g.,
oligonucleotides of about 5 bases, 10 bases, 15 bases or 20 bases, comprising multiple of
phosphorothioate linkages in the backbone are also amenable to the present invention as ligands (e.g.
as PK modulating ligands). In addition, aptamers that bind serum components (e.g. serum proteins)
are also suitable for use as PK modulating ligands in the embodiments described herein.
[00120]       For macromolecular drugs and hydrophilic drug molecules, which cannot easily cross
bilayer membranes, entrapment in endosomal/lysosomal compartments of the cell is thought to be the
biggest hurdle for effective delivery to their site of action. In recent years, a number of approaches
and strategies have been devised to address this problem. For liposomal formulations, the use of
fusogenic lipids in the formulation have been the most common approach (Singh, R. S., Goncalves, C.
et al. (2004). On the Gene Delivery Efficacies of pH-Sensitive Cationic Lipids via Endosomal
Protonation. A Chemical Biology Investigation. Chem. Biol. 11, 713-723.). Other components, which
exhibit pH-sensitive endosomolytic activity through protonation and/or pH-induced conformational
changes, include charged polymers and peptides. Examples may be found in Hoffman, A. S., Stayton,
P. S. et al. (2002). Design of "smart" polymers that can direct intracellular drug delivery. Polymers
Adv. Technol. 13, 992-999; Kakudo, Chaki, T., S. et al. (2004). Transferrin-Modified Liposomes
Equipped with a pH-Sensitive Fusogenic Peptide: An Artificial Viral-like Delivery System.
Biochemistry 436, 5618-5628; Yessine, M. A. and Leroux, J. C. (2004). Membrane-destabilizing
polyanions: interaction with lipid bilayers and endosomal escape of biomacromolecules. Adv. Drug
Deliv. Rev. 56, 999-1021; Oliveira, S., van Rooy, I. et al. (2007). Fusogenic peptides enhance
endosomal escape improving iRNA-induced silencing of oncogenes. Int. J. Pharm. 331, 211-4. They
have generally been used in the context of drug delivery systems, such as liposomes or lipoplexes.
For folate receptor-mediated delivery using liposomal formulations, for instance, a pH-sensitive
fusogenic peptide has been incorporated into the liposomes and shown to enhance the activity through
improving the unloading of drug during the uptake process (Turk, M. J., Reddy, J. A. et al. (2002).
Characterization of a novel pH-sensitive peptide that enhances drug release from folate-targeted
liposomes at endosomal pHs is described in Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1559, 56-68).
[00121]       In certain embodiments, the endosomolytic components of the present invention can be
polyanionic peptides or peptidomimetics which show pH-dependent membrane activity and/or
fusogenicity. A peptidomimetic can be a small protein-like chain designed to mimic a peptide. A

peptidomimetic can arise from modification of an existing peptide in order to alter the molecule's
properties, or the synthesis of a peptide-like molecule using unnatural amino acids or their analogs. In
certain embodiments, they have improved stability and/or biological activity when compared to a
peptide. In certain embodiments, the endosomolytic component assumes its active conformation at
endosomal pH (e.g., pH 5-6). The "active" conformation is that conformation in which the
endosomolytic component promotes lysis of the endosome and/or transport of the modular
composition of the invention, or its any of its components (e.g., a nucleic acid), from the endosome to
the cytoplasm of the cell.
[00122]       Libraries of compounds can be screened for their differential membrane activity at
endosomal pH versus neutral pH using a hemolysis assay. Promising candidates isolated by this
method may be used as components of the modular compositions of the invention. A method for
identifying an endosomolytic component for use in the compositions and methods of the present
invention may comprise: providing a library of compounds; contacting blood cells with the members
of the library, wherein the pH of the medium in which the contact occurs is controlled; determining
whether the compounds induce differential lysis of blood cells at a low pH (e.g., about pH 5-6) versus
neutral pH (e.g., about pH 7-8).
[00123]       Exemplary endosomolytic components include the GALA peptide (Subbarao et al.,
Biochemistry, 1987, 26: 2964-2972), the EALA peptide (Vogel et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118:
1581-1586), and their derivatives (Turk et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 2002, 1559: 56-68). In
certain embodiments, the endosomolytic component can contain a chemical group (e.g., an amino
acid) which will undergo a change in charge or protonation in response to a change in pH. The
endosomolytic component may be linear or branched. Exemplary primary sequences of
endosomolytic components include ***H2N-(AALEALAEALEALAEALEALAEAAAAGGC)
CO2H (SEQ ID NO: 873); H2N-(AALAEALAEALAEALAEALAEALAAAAGGC)-CO2H                                 (SEQ ID
NO: 874); and H2N-(ALEALAEALEALAEA)-CONH2                    (SEQ ID NO: 875).
[00124]       In certain embodiments, more than one endosomolytic component can be incorporated
into the iRNA agent of the invention. In some embodiments, this will entail incorporating more than
one of the same endosomolytic component into the iRNA agent. In other embodiments, this will entail
incorporating two or more different endosomolytic components into iRNA agent.
[00125]       These endosomolytic components can mediate endosomal escape by, for example,
changing conformation at endosomal pH. In certain embodiments, the endosomolytic components
can exist in a random coil conformation at neutral pH and rearrange to an amphipathic helix at
endosomal pH. As a consequence of this conformational transition, these peptides may insert into the
lipid membrane of the endosome, causing leakage of the endosomal contents into the cytoplasm.
Because the conformational transition is pH-dependent, the endosomolytic components can display
little or no fusogenic activity while circulating in the blood (pH -7.4). "Fusogenic activity," as used
                                                      31

    WO 2011/127180                                                                 PCT/US2011/031429
herein, is defined as that activity which results in disruption of a lipid membrane by the
endosomolytic component. One example of fusogenic activity is the disruption of the endosomal
membrane by the endosomolytic component, leading to endosomal lysis or leakage and transport of
one or more components of the modular composition of the invention (e.g., the nucleic acid) from the
endosome into the cytoplasm.
[00126]       In addition to hemolysis assays, as described herein, suitable endosomolytic components
can be tested and identified by a skilled artisan using other methods. For example, the ability of a
compound to respond to, e.g., change charge depending on, the pH environment can be tested by
routine methods, e.g., in a cellular assay. In certain embodiments, a test compound is combined with
or contacted with a cell, and the cell is allowed to internalize the test compound, e.g., by endocytosis.
An endosome preparation can then be made from the contacted cells and the endosome preparation
compared to an endosome preparation from control cells. A change, e.g., a decrease, in the endosome
fraction from the contacted cell vs. the control cell indicates that the test compound can function as a
fusogenic agent. Alternatively, the contacted cell and control cell can be evaluated, e.g., by
microscopy, e.g., by light or electron microscopy, to determine a difference in the endosome
population in the cells.   The test compound and/or the endosomes can labeled, e.g., to quantify
endosomal leakage.
[00127]       In another type of assay, an iRNA agent described herein is constructed using one or
more test or putative fusogenic agents. The iRNA agent can be labeled for easy visualization. The
ability of the endosomolytic component to promote endosomal escape, once the iRNA agent is taken
up by the cell, can be evaluated, e.g., by preparation of an endosome preparation, or by microscopy
techniques, which enable visualization of the labeled iRNA agent in the cytoplasm of the cell. In
certain other embodiments, the inhibition of gene expression, or any other physiological parameter,
may be used as a surrogate marker for endosomal escape.
[00128]       In other embodiments, circular dichroism spectroscopy can be used to identify
compounds that exhibit a pH-dependent structural transition.
[00129]       A two-step assay can also be performed, wherein a first assay evaluates the ability of a
test compound alone to respond to changes in pH, and a second assay evaluates the ability of a
modular composition that includes the test compound to respond to changes in pH.
Lipid Conjugates
[00130]       In one embodiment of the aspects described herein, a ligand or conjugate is a lipid or
lipid-based molecule.     Such a lipid or lipid-based molecule preferably binds a serum protein, e.g.,
human serum albumin (HSA). An HSA binding ligand allows for distribution of the conjugate to a
target tissue, e.g., a non-kidney target tissue of the body. For example, the target tissue can be the
liver, including parenchymal cells of the liver. Other molecules that can bind HSA can also be used
as ligands. For example, neproxin or aspirin can be used. A lipid or lipid-based ligand can (a)
                                                      32

     WO 2011/127180                                                                   PCT/US2011/031429
increase resistance to degradation of the conjugate, (b) increase targeting or transport into a target cell
or cell membrane, and/or (c) can be used to adjust binding to a serum protein, e.g., HSA.
[00131]       A lipid based ligand can be used to modulate, e.g., control the binding of the conjugate to
a target tissue. For example, a lipid or lipid-based ligand that binds to HSA more strongly will be less
likely to be targeted to the kidney and therefore less likely to be cleared from the body. A lipid or
lipid-based ligand that binds to HSA less strongly can be used to target the conjugate to the kidney.
[00132]       In a preferred embodiment, the lipid based ligand binds HSA. Preferably, it binds HSA
with a sufficient affinity such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to a non-kidney tissue.
However, it is preferred that the affinity not be so strong that the HSA-ligand binding cannot be
reversed.
[00133]       In another preferred embodiment, the lipid based ligand binds HSA weakly or not at all,
such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to the kidney. Other moieties that target to
kidney cells can also be used in place of or in addition to the lipid based ligand.
[00134]       In another aspect, the ligand is a moiety, e.g., a vitamin, which is taken up by a target cell,
e.g., a proliferating cell. These are particularly useful for treating disorders characterized by
unwanted cell proliferation, e.g., of the malignant or non-malignant type, e.g., cancer cells.
Exemplary vitamins include vitamin A, E, and K. Other exemplary vitamins include are B vitamin,
e.g., folic acid, B 12, riboflavin, biotin, pyridoxal or other vitamins or nutrients taken up by cancer
cells. Also included are HSA and low density lipoprotein (LDL).
[00135]       In another aspect, the ligand is a cell-permeation agent, preferably a helical cell
permeation agent. Preferably, the agent is amphipathic. An exemplary agent is a peptide such as tat
or antennopedia. If the agent is a peptide, it can be modified, including a peptidylmimetic,
invertomers, non-peptide or pseudo-peptide linkages, and use of D-amino acids. The helical agent is
preferably an alpha-helical agent, which preferably has a lipophilic and a lipophobic phase.
Cell PermeationPeptides
[00136]       Peptides suitable for use with the present invention can be a natural peptide, e.g., tat or
antennopedia peptide, a synthetic peptide, or a peptidomimetic. Furthermore, the peptide can be a
modified peptide, for example peptide can comprise non-peptide or pseudo-peptide linkages, and D
amino acids. A peptidomimetic (also referred to herein as an oligopeptidomimetic) is a molecule
capable of folding into a defined three-dimensional structure similar to a natural peptide. The
attachment of peptide and peptidomimetics to iRNA agents can affect pharmacokinetic distribution of
the iRNA, such as by enhancing cellular recognition and absorption. The peptide or peptidomimetic
moiety can be about 5-50 amino acids long, e.g., about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino
acids long.
[00137]       A peptide or peptidomimetic can be, for example, a cell permeation peptide, cationic
peptide, amphipathic peptide, or hydrophobic peptide (e.g., consisting primarily of Tyr, Trp or Phe).
                                                       33

    WO 2011/127180                                                                 PCT/US2011/031429
The peptide moiety can be a dendrimer peptide, constrained peptide or crosslinked peptide. In
another alternative, the peptide moiety can include a hydrophobic membrane translocation sequence
(MTS). An exemplary hydrophobic MTS-containing peptide is RFGF having the amino acid
sequence AAVALLPAVLLALLAP (SEQ ID NO:1). An RFGF analogue (e.g., amino acid sequence
AALLPVLLAAP (SEQ ID NO:2)) containing a hydrophobic MTS can also be a targeting moiety.
The peptide moiety can be a "delivery" peptide, which can carry large polar molecules including
peptides, oligonucleotides, and protein across cell membranes. For example, sequences from the HIV
Tat protein (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ (SEQ ID NO:3)) and the DrosophilaAntennapedia protein
(RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK (SEQ ID NO: 4)) have been found to be capable of functioning as
delivery peptides. A peptide or peptidomimetic can be encoded by a random sequence of DNA, such
as a peptide identified from a phage-display library, or one-bead-one-compound (OBOC)
combinatorial library (Lam et al., Nature, 354:82-84, 1991). Preferably the peptide or peptidomimetic
tethered to a dsRNA agent via an incorporated monomer unit is a cell targeting peptide such as an
arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-peptide, or RGD mimic. A peptide moiety can range in length
from about 5 amino acids to about 40 amino acids. The peptide moieties can have a structural
modification, such as to increase stability or direct conformational properties. Any of the structural
modifications described below can be utilized.
[00138]       An RGD peptide moiety can be used to target a tumor cell, such as an endothelial tumor
cell or a breast cancer tumor cell (Zitzmann et al., Cancer Res., 62:5139-43, 2002). An RGD peptide
can facilitate targeting of an dsRNA agent to tumors of a variety of other tissues, including the lung,
kidney, spleen, or liver (Aoki et al., Cancer Gene Therapy 8:783-787, 2001). Preferably, the RGD
peptide will facilitate targeting of an iRNA agent to the kidney. The RGD peptide can be linear or
cyclic, and can be modified, e.g., glycosylated or methylated to facilitate targeting to specific tissues.
For example, a glycosylated RGD peptide can deliver a iRNA agent to a tumor cell expressing avB3
(Haubner et al., Jour. Nucl. Med., 42:326-336, 2001).
[00139]       Peptides that target markers enriched in proliferating cells can be used, e.g., RGD
containing peptides and peptidomimetics can target cancer cells, in particular cells that exhibit an
avP3 integrin. Thus, one could use RGD peptides, cyclic peptides containing RGD, RGD peptides
that include D-amino acids, as well as synthetic RGD mimics. In addition to RGD, one can use other
moieties that target the avP3 integrin ligand. Generally, such ligands can be used to control
proliferating cells and angiogenesis.
[00140]       A "cell permeation peptide" is capable of permeating a cell, e.g., a microbial cell, such as
a bacterial or fungal cell, or a mammalian cell, such as a human cell. A microbial cell-permeating
peptide can be, for example, an a-helical linear peptide (e.g., LL-37 or Ceropin P1), a disulfide bond
containing peptide (e.g., a -defensin, P-defensin or bactenecin), or a peptide containing only one or
two dominating amino acids (e.g., PR-39 or indolicidin). A cell permeation peptide can also include a
                                                     34

    WO 2011/127180                                                                PCT/US2011/031429
nuclear localization signal (NLS). For example, a cell permeation peptide can be a bipartite
amphipathic peptide, such as MPG, which is derived from the fusion peptide domain of HIV- 1 gp41
and the NLS of SV40 large T antigen (Simeoni et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 31:2717-2724, 2003).
CarbohydrateConjugates
[00141]       In some embodiments, the iRNA oligonucleotides described herein further comprise
carbohydrate conjugates. The carbohydrate conjugates are advantageous for the in vivo delivery of
nucleic acids, as well as compositions suitable for in vivo therapeutic use, as described herein. As used
herein, "carbohydrate" refers to a compound which is either a carbohydrate per se made up of one or
more monosaccharide units having at least 6 carbon atoms (which may be linear, branched or cyclic)
with an oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom bonded to each carbon atom; or a compound having as a part
thereof a carbohydrate moiety made up of one or more monosaccharide units each having at least six
carbon atoms (which may be linear, branched or cyclic), with an oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom
bonded to each carbon atom. Representative carbohydrates include the sugars (mono-, di-, tri- and
oligosaccharides containing from about 4-9 monosaccharide units), and polysaccharides such as
starches, glycogen, cellulose and polysaccharide gums. Specific monosaccharides include C5 and
above (preferably C5 -CS) sugars; di- and trisaccharides include sugars having two or three
monosaccharide units (preferably C 5 -CS).

[00147]       A cleavable linking group is one which is sufficiently stable outside the cell, but which
upon entry into a target cell is cleaved to release the two parts the linker is holding together. In a
preferred embodiment, the cleavable linking group is cleaved at least 10 times or more, preferably at
least 100 times faster in the target cell or under a first reference condition (which can, e.g., be selected
to mimic or represent intracellular conditions) than in the blood of a subject, or under a second
reference condition (which can, e.g., be selected to mimic or represent conditions found in the blood
or serum).
[00148]       Cleavable linking groups are susceptible to cleavage agents, e.g., pH, redox potential or
the presence of degradative molecules. Generally, cleavage agents are more prevalent or found at
higher levels or activities inside cells than in serum or blood. Examples of such degradative agents
include: redox agents which are selected for particular substrates or which have no substrate
specificity, including, e.g., oxidative or reductive enzymes or reductive agents such as mercaptans,
present in cells, that can degrade a redox cleavable linking group by reduction; esterases; endosomes
or agents that can create an acidic environment, e.g., those that result in a pH of five or lower;
enzymes that can hydrolyze or degrade an acid cleavable linking group by acting as a general acid,
peptidases (which can be substrate specific), and phosphatases.
[00149]       A cleavable linkage group, such as a disulfide bond can be susceptible to pH. The pH of
human serum is 7.4, while the average intracellular pH is slightly lower, ranging from about 7.1-7.3.
Endosomes have a more acidic pH, in the range of 5.5-6.0, and lysosomes have an even more acidic
pH at around 5.0. Some linkers will have a cleavable linking group that is cleaved at a preferred pH,
thereby releasing the cationic lipid from the ligand inside the cell, or into the desired compartment of
the cell.
[00150]       A linker can include a cleavable linking group that is cleavable by a particular enzyme.
The type of cleavable linking group incorporated into a linker can depend on the cell to be targeted.
For example, liver targeting ligands can be linked to the cationic lipids through a linker that includes
an ester group. Liver cells are rich in esterases, and therefore the linker will be cleaved more
efficiently in liver cells than in cell types that are not esterase-rich. Other cell-types rich in esterases
include cells of the lung, renal cortex, and testis.
[00151]       Linkers that contain peptide bonds can be used when targeting cell types rich in
peptidases, such as liver cells and synoviocytes.
[00152]       In general, the suitability of a candidate cleavable linking group can be evaluated by
testing the ability of a degradative agent (or condition) to cleave the candidate linking group. It will
also be desirable to also test the candidate cleavable linking group for the ability to resist cleavage in
the blood or when in contact with other non-target tissue. Thus one can determine the relative
susceptibility to cleavage between a first and a second condition, where the first is selected to be
indicative of cleavage in a target cell and the second is selected to be indicative of cleavage in other

tissues or biological fluids, e.g., blood or serum. The evaluations can be carried out in cell free
systems, in cells, in cell culture, in organ or tissue culture, or in whole animals. It may be useful to
make initial evaluations in cell-free or culture conditions and to confirm by further evaluations in
whole animals. In preferred embodiments, useful candidate compounds are cleaved at least 2, 4, 10 or
100 times faster in the cell (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic intracellular conditions) as
compared to blood or serum (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic extracellular conditions).
Redox cleavable linking groups
[00153]      One class of cleavable linking groups are redox cleavable linking groups that are cleaved
upon reduction or oxidation. An example of reductively cleavable linking group is a disulphide
linking group (-S-S-).   To determine if a candidate cleavable linking group is a suitable "reductively
cleavable linking group," or for example is suitable for use with a particular iRNA moiety and
particular targeting agent one can look to methods described herein. For example, a candidate can be
evaluated by incubation with dithiothreitol (DTT), or other reducing agent using reagents know in the
art, which mimic the rate of cleavage which would be observed in a cell, e.g., a target cell. The
candidates can also be evaluated under conditions which are selected to mimic blood or serum
conditions. In a preferred embodiment, candidate compounds are cleaved by at most 10% in the
blood. In preferred embodiments, useful candidate compounds are degraded at least 2, 4, 10 or 100
times faster in the cell (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic intracellular conditions) as
compared to blood (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic extracellular conditions). The rate
of cleavage of candidate compounds can be determined using standard enzyme kinetics assays under
conditions chosen to mimic intracellular media and compared to conditions chosen to mimic
extracellular media.
Phosphate-basedcleavable linking groups
[00154]      Phosphate-based cleavable linking groups are cleaved by agents that degrade or hydrolyze
the phosphate group. An example of an agent that cleaves phosphate groups in cells are enzymes
such as phosphatases in cells. Examples of phosphate-based linking groups are -O-P(O)(ORk)-O-,
O-P(S)(ORk)-O-, -O-P(S)(SRk)-O-, -S-P(O)(ORk)-O-, -O-P(O)(ORk)-S-, -S-P(O)(ORk)-S-, -0

-O-P(O)(H)-O-, -O-P(S)(H)-O-, -S-P(O)(H)-O-, -S-P(S)(H)-O-, -S-P(O)(H)-S-, -O-P(S)(H)-S-.            A
preferred embodiment is -O-P(O)(OH)-O-. These candidates can be evaluated using methods
analogous to those described above.
Acid cleavable linking groups
[00155]      Acid cleavable linking groups are linking groups that are cleaved under acidic conditions.
In preferred embodiments acid cleavable linking groups are cleaved in an acidic environment with a

pH of about 6.5 or lower (e.g., about 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, or lower), or by agents such as enzymes that can act
as a general acid. In a cell, specific low pH organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes can provide
a cleaving environment for acid cleavable linking groups. Examples of acid cleavable linking groups
include but are not limited to hydrazones, esters, and esters of amino acids. Acid cleavable groups
can have the general formula -C=NN-, C(O)O, or -OC(O). A preferred embodiment is when the
carbon attached to the oxygen of the ester (the alkoxy group) is an aryl group, substituted alkyl group,
or tertiary alkyl group such as dimethyl pentyl or t-butyl. These candidates can be evaluated using
methods analogous to those described above.
Ester-basedlinking groups
[00156]        Ester-based cleavable linking groups are cleaved by enzymes such as esterases and
amidases in cells. Examples of ester-based cleavable linking groups include but are not limited to
esters of alkylene, alkenylene and alkynylene groups. Ester cleavable linking groups have the general
formula -C(O)O-, or -OC(O)-. These candidates can be evaluated using methods analogous to those
described above.
Peptide-basedcleaving groups
[00157]        Peptide-based cleavable linking groups are cleaved by enzymes such as peptidases and
proteases in cells. Peptide-based cleavable linking groups are peptide bonds formed between amino
acids to yield oligopeptides (e.g., dipeptides, tripeptides etc.) and polypeptides. Peptide-based
cleavable groups do not include the aide      group (-C(O)NH-).    The aide group can be formed
between any alkylene, alkenylene or alkynelene. A peptide bond is a special type of aide bond
formed between amino acids to yield peptides and proteins. The peptide based cleavage group is
generally limited to the peptide bond (i.e., the aide bond) formed between amino acids yielding
peptides and proteins and does not include the entire aide functional group. Peptide-based cleavable
linking groups have the general formula - NHCHRAC(O)NHCHRBC(O)- (SEQ ID NO: 876), where
RA and RB are the R groups of the two adjacent amino acids. These candidates can be evaluated using
methods analogous to those described above.

[00160]       It is not necessary for all positions in a given compound to be uniformly modified, and in
fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications can be incorporated in a single compound or
even at a single nucleoside within an iRNA. The present invention also includes iRNA compounds
that are chimeric compounds. "Chimeric" iRNA compounds or "chimeras," in the context of this
invention, are iRNA compounds, preferably dsRNAs, which contain two or more chemically distinct
regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide in the case of a dsRNA
compound. These iRNAs typically contain at least one region wherein the RNA is modified so as to
confer upon the iRNA increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, and/or
                                                        45

     WO 2011/127180                                                               PCT/US2011/031429
increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional region of the iRNA may serve as a
substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids. By way of example,
RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex.
Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the
efficiency of iRNA inhibition of gene expression. Consequently, comparable results can often be
obtained with shorter iRNAs when chimeric dsRNAs are used, compared to phosphorothioate deoxy
dsRNAs hybridizing to the same target region. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected
by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in the
art.
[00161]       In certain instances, the RNA of an iRNA can be modified by a non-ligand group. A
number of non-ligand molecules have been conjugated to iRNAs in order to enhance the activity,
cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the iRNA, and procedures for performing such conjugations
are available in the scientific literature. Such non-ligand moieties have included lipid moieties, such
as cholesterol (Kubo, T. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 2007, 365(1):54-61; Letsinger et al.,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1989, 86:6553), cholic acid (Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.,
1994, 4:1053), a thioether, e.g., hexyl-S-tritylthiol (Manoharan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1992,
660:306; Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3:2765), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et
al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1992, 20:533), an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues (Saison
Behmoaras et al., EMBO J., 1991, 10:111; Kabanov et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259:327; Svinarchuk et
al., Biochimie, 1993, 75:49), a phospholipid, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethylammonium
1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995,
36:3651; Shea et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1990, 18:3777), a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain
(Manoharan et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1995, 14:969), or adamantane acetic acid (Manoharan
et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36:365 1), a palmityl moiety (Mishra et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta,
1995, 1264:229), or an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety (Crooke et al.,
J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 277:923). Representative United States patents that teach the
preparation of such RNA conjugates have been listed above. Typical conjugation protocols involve
the synthesis of an RNAs bearing an aminolinker at one or more positions of the sequence. The amino
group is then reacted with the molecule being conjugated using appropriate coupling or activating
reagents. The conjugation reaction may be performed either with the RNA still bound to the solid
support or following cleavage of the RNA, in solution phase. Purification of the RNA conjugate by
HPLC typically affords the pure conjugate.
Delivery of iRNA
[00162]       The delivery of an iRNA to a subject in need thereof can be achieved in a number of
different ways. In vivo delivery can be performed directly by administering a composition comprising
                                                      46

    WO 2011/127180                                                                PCT/US2011/031429
an iRNA, e.g. a dsRNA, to a subject. Alternatively, delivery can be performed indirectly by
administering one or more vectors that encode and direct the expression of the iRNA.
Delivery of an iRNA composition
[00163]        In general, any method of delivering a nucleic acid molecule can be adapted for use with
an iRNA (see e.g., Akhtar S. and Julian RL. (1992) Trends Cell. Biol. 2(5):139-144 and
W094/02595, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). However, there are three
factors that are important to consider in order to successfully deliver an iRNA molecule in vivo: (a)
biological stability of the delivered molecule, (2) preventing non-specific effects, and (3)
accumulation of the delivered molecule in the target tissue. The non-specific effects of an iRNA can
be minimized by local administration, for example by direct injection or implantation into a tissue (as
a non-limiting example, a tumor) or topically administering the preparation. Local administration to a
treatment site maximizes local concentration of the agent, limits the exposure of the agent to systemic
tissues that may otherwise be harmed by the agent or that may degrade the agent, and permits a lower
total dose of the iRNA molecule to be administered. Several studies have shown successful
knockdown of gene products when an iRNA is administered locally. For example, intraocular delivery
of a VEGF dsRNA by intravitreal injection in cynomolgus monkeys (Tolentino, MJ., et al (2004)
Retina 24:132-138) and subretinal injections in mice (Reich, SJ., et al (2003) Mol. Vis. 9:210-216)
were both shown to prevent neovascularization in an experimental model of age-related macular
degeneration. In addition, direct intratumoral injection of a dsRNA in mice reduces tumor volume
(Pille, J., et al (2005) Mol. Ther. 11:267-274) and can prolong survival of tumor-bearing mice (Kim,
WJ., et al (2006) Mol. Ther. 14:343-350; Li, S., et al (2007) Mol. Ther. 15:515-523). RNA
interference has also shown success with local delivery to the CNS by direct injection (Dorn, G., et al.
(2004) Nucleic Acids 32:e49; Tan, PH., et al (2005) Gene Ther. 12:59-66; Makimura, H., et al (2002)
BMC Neurosci. 3:18; Shishkina, GT., et al (2004) Neuroscience 129:521-528; Thakker, ER., et al
(2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101:17270-17275; Akaneya,Y., et al (2005) J. Neurophysiol.
93:594-602) and to the lungs by intranasal administration (Howard, KA., et al (2006) Mol. Ther.
14:476-484; Zhang, X., et al (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279:10677-10684; Bitko, V., et al (2005) Nat.
Med. 11:50-55). For administering an iRNA systemically for the treatment of a disease, the RNA can
be modified or alternatively delivered using a drug delivery system; both methods act to prevent the
rapid degradation of the dsRNA by endo- and exo-nucleases in vivo. Modification of the RNA or the
pharmaceutical carrier can also permit targeting of the iRNA composition to the target tissue and
avoid undesirable off-target effects. iRNA molecules can be modified by chemical conjugation to
lipophilic groups such as cholesterol to enhance cellular uptake and prevent degradation. For example,
an iRNA directed against ApoB conjugated to a lipophilic cholesterol moiety was injected
systemically into mice and resulted in knockdown of apoB mRNA in both the liver and jejunum
(Soutschek, J., et al (2004) Nature 432:173-178). Conjugation of an iRNA to an aptamer has been
                                                     47

    WO 2011/127180                                                                 PCT/US2011/031429
shown to inhibit tumor growth and mediate tumor regression in a mouse model of prostate cancer
(McNamara, JO., et al (2006) Nat. Biotechnol. 24:1005-1015). In an alternative embodiment, the
iRNA can be delivered using drug delivery systems such as a nanoparticle, a dendrimer, a polymer,
liposomes, or a cationic delivery system. Positively charged cationic delivery systems facilitate
binding of an iRNA molecule (negatively charged) and also enhance interactions at the negatively
charged cell membrane to permit efficient uptake of an iRNA by the cell. Cationic lipids, dendrimers,
or polymers can either be bound to an iRNA, or induced to form a vesicle or micelle (see e.g., Kim
SH., et al (2008) Journal of Controlled Release 129(2):107-116) that encases an iRNA. The formation
of vesicles or micelles further prevents degradation of the iRNA when administered systemically.
Methods for making and administering cationic- iRNA complexes are well within the abilities of one
skilled in the art (see e.g., Sorensen, DR., et al (2003) J. Mol. Biol 327:761-766; Verma, UN., et al
(2003) Clin. Cancer Res. 9:1291-1300; Arnold, AS et al (2007) J. Hypertens. 25:197-205, which are
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Some non-limiting examples of drug delivery
systems useful for systemic delivery of iRNAs include DOTAP (Sorensen, DR., et al (2003), supra;
Verma, UN., et al (2003), supra), Oligofectamine, "solid nucleic acid lipid particles" (Zimmermann,
TS., et al (2006) Nature 441:111-114), cardiolipin (Chien, PY., et al (2005) Cancer Gene Ther.
12:321-328; Pal, A., et al (2005) Int J. Oncol. 26:1087-1091), polyethyleneimine (Bonnet ME., et al
(2008) Pharm. Res. Aug 16 Epub ahead of print; Aigner, A. (2006) J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 71659),
Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides (Liu, S. (2006) Mol. Pharm. 3:472-487), and polyamidoamines
(Tomalia, DA., et al (2007) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 35:61-67; Yoo, H., et al (1999) Pharm. Res.
16:1799-1804). In some embodiments, an iRNA forms a complex with cyclodextrin for systemic
administration. Methods for administration and pharmaceutical compositions of iRNAs and
cyclodextrins can be found in U.S. Patent No. 7, 427, 605, which is herein incorporated by reference
in its entirety.
          Vector encoded dsRNAs
[00164]       In another aspect, iRNA targeting the CD274/PD-L1 gene can be expressed from
transcription units inserted into DNA or RNA vectors (see, e.g., Couture, A, et al., TIG. (1996), 12:5
10; Skillern, A., et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/22113, Conrad, International PCT
Publication No. WO 00/22114, and Conrad, U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,299). Expression can be transient (on
the order of hours to weeks) or sustained (weeks to months or longer), depending upon the specific
construct used and the target tissue or cell type. These transgenes can be introduced as a linear
construct, a circular plasmid, or a viral vector, which can be an integrating or non-integrating vector.
The transgene can also be constructed to permit it to be inherited as an extrachromosomal plasmid
(Gassmann, et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1995) 92:1292).
[00165]       The individual strand or strands of an iRNA can be transcribed from a promoter on an
expression vector. Where two separate strands are to be expressed to generate, for example, a
                                                      48

    WO 2011/127180                                                                  PCT/US2011/031429
dsRNA, two separate expression vectors can be co-introduced (e.g., by transfection or infection) into
a target cell. Alternatively each individual strand of a dsRNA can be transcribed by promoters both of
which are located on the same expression plasmid. In one embodiment, a dsRNA is expressed as
inverted repeat polynucleotides joined by a linker polynucleotide sequence such that the dsRNA has a
stem and loop structure.
[00166]       iRNA expression vectors are generally DNA plasmids or viral vectors. Expression vectors
compatible with eukaryotic cells, preferably those compatible with vertebrate cells, can be used to
produce recombinant constructs for the expression of an iRNA as described herein. Eukaryotic cell
expression vectors are well known in the art and are available from a number of commercial sources.
Typically, such vectors are provided containing convenient restriction sites for insertion of the desired
nucleic acid segment. Delivery of iRNA expressing vectors can be systemic, such as by intravenous
or intramuscular administration, by administration to target cells ex-planted from the patient followed
by reintroduction into the patient, or by any other means that allows for introduction into a desired
target cell.
[00167]       iRNA expression plasmids can be transfected into target cells as a complex with cationic
lipid carriers (e.g., Oligofectamine) or non-cationic lipid-based carriers (e.g., Transit-TKO TM).
Multiple lipid transfections for iRNA-mediated knockdowns targeting different regions of a target
RNA over a period of a week or more are also contemplated by the invention. Successful introduction
of vectors into host cells can be monitored using various known methods. For example, transient
transfection can be signaled with a reporter, such as a fluorescent marker, such as Green Fluorescent
Protein (GFP). Stable transfection of cells ex vivo can be ensured using markers that provide the
transfected cell with resistance to specific environmental factors (e.g., antibiotics and drugs), such as
hygromycin B resistance.
[00168]       Viral vector systems which can be utilized with the methods and compositions described
herein include, but are not limited to, (a) adenovirus vectors; (b) retrovirus vectors, including but not
limited to lentiviral vectors, moloney murine leukemia virus, etc.; (c) adeno- associated virus vectors;
(d) herpes simplex virus vectors; (e) SV 40 vectors; (f) polyoma virus vectors; (g) papilloma virus
vectors; (h) picornavirus vectors; (i) pox virus vectors such as an orthopox, e.g., vaccinia virus vectors
or avipox, e.g. canary pox or fowl pox; and (j) a helper-dependent or gutless adenovirus. Replication
defective viruses can also be advantageous. Different vectors will or will not become incorporated
into the cells' genome. The constructs can include viral sequences for transfection, if desired.
Alternatively, the construct may be incorporated into vectors capable of episomal replication, e.g EPV
and EBV vectors. Constructs for the recombinant expression of an iRNA will generally require
regulatory elements, e.g., promoters, enhancers, etc., to ensure the expression of the iRNA in target
cells. Other aspects to consider for vectors and constructs are further described below.
                                                     49

    WO 2011/127180                                                                   PCT/US2011/031429
[00169]      Vectors useful for the delivery of an iRNA will include regulatory elements (promoter,
enhancer, etc.) sufficient for expression of the iRNA in the desired target cell or tissue. The
regulatory elements can be chosen to provide either constitutive or regulated/inducible expression.
[00170]      Expression of the iRNA can be precisely regulated, for example, by using an inducible
regulatory sequence that is sensitive to certain physiological regulators, e.g., circulating glucose
levels, or hormones (Docherty et al., 1994, FASEB J. 8:20-24). Such inducible expression systems,
suitable for the control of dsRNA expression in cells or in mammals include, for example, regulation
by ecdysone, by estrogen, progesterone, tetracycline, chemical inducers of dimerization, and
isopropyl-beta-DI -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). A person skilled in the art would be able to choose
the appropriate regulatory/promoter sequence based on the intended use of the iRNA transgene.
[00171]      In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences encoding an
iRNA can be used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (see Miller et al., Meth. Enzymol.
217:581-599 (1993)). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct
packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences
encoding an iRNA are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the nucleic acid
into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found, for example, in Boesen et al.,
Biotherapy 6:291-302 (1994), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdrl gene
to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other
references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., J. Clin. Invest.
93:644-651 (1994); Kiem et al., Blood 83:1467-1473 (1994); Salmons and Gunzberg, Human Gene
Therapy 4:129-141 (1993); and Grossman and Wilson, Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3:110-114
(1993). Lentiviral vectors contemplated for use include, for example, the HIV based vectors
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,143,520; 5,665,557; and 5,981,276, which are herein incorporated by
reference.
[00172]      Adenoviruses are also contemplated for use in delivery of iRNAs. Adenoviruses are
especially attractive vehicles, e.g., for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally
infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based
delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses
have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson, Current
Opinion in Genetics and Development 3:499-503 (1993) present a review of adenovirus-based gene
therapy. Bout et al., Human Gene Therapy 5:3-10 (1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors
to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of
adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., Science 252:431-434 (1991);

[00173]        Use of Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors is also contemplated (Walsh et al., Proc.
Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204:289-300 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146). In one embodiment, the iRNA
can be expressed as two separate, complementary single-stranded RNA molecules from a recombinant
AAV vector having, for example, either the U6 or HI RNA promoters, or the cytomegalovirus
(CMV) promoter. Suitable AAV vectors for expressing the dsRNA featured in the invention,

[00174]        Another preferred viral vector is a pox virus such as a vaccinia virus, for example an
attenuated vaccinia such as Modified Virus Ankara (MVA) or NYVAC, an avipox such as fowl pox
or canary pox.
[00175]        The tropism of viral vectors can be modified by pseudotyping the vectors with envelope
proteins or other surface antigens from other viruses, or by substituting different viral capsid proteins,
as appropriate. For example, lentiviral vectors can be pseudotyped with surface proteins from
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rabies, Ebola, Mokola, and the like. AAV vectors can be made to
target different cells by engineering the vectors to express different capsid protein serotypes; see, e.g.,

by reference.
[00176]        The pharmaceutical preparation of a vector can include the vector in an acceptable
diluent, or can include a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded.
Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant
cells, e.g., retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more cells which
produce the gene delivery system.

Pharmaceuticalcompositions containing iRNA
[00177]      In one embodiment, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions containing an
iRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition containing the
iRNA is useful for treating a disease or disorder associated with the expression or activity of a
CD274/PD-L1 gene, such as pathological processes mediated by CD274/PD-L1 expression. Such
pharmaceutical compositions are formulated based on the mode of delivery. One example is
compositions that are formulated for systemic administration via parenteral delivery, e.g., by
intravenous (IV) delivery. Another example is compositions that are formulated for direct delivery
into the brain parenchyma, e.g., by infusion into the brain, such as by continuous pump infusion.
[00178]      The pharmaceutical compositions featured herein are administered in dosages sufficient
to inhibit expression of CD274/PD-L1 genes. In general, a suitable dose of iRNA will be in the range
of 0.01 to 200.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, generally in the range
of 1 to 50 mg per kilogram body weight per day. For example, the dsRNA can be administered at
0.05 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 40
mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg per single dose. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered once
daily, or the iRNA may be administered as two, three, or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals
throughout the day or even using continuous infusion or delivery through a controlled release
formulation. In that case, the iRNA contained in each sub-dose must be correspondingly smaller in
order to achieve the total daily dosage. The dosage unit can also be compounded for delivery over
several days, e.g., using a conventional sustained release formulation which provides sustained release
of the iRNA over a several day period. Sustained release formulations are well known in the art and
are particularly useful for delivery of agents at a particular site, such as could be used with the agents
of the present invention. In this embodiment, the dosage unit contains a corresponding multiple of the
daily dose.
[00179]      The effect of a single dose on CD274/PD-L1 levels can be long lasting, such that
subsequent doses are administered at not more than 3, 4, or 5 day intervals, or at not more than 1, 2, 3,
or 4 week intervals.
[00180]      The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and
timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or
disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present.
Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a composition can include
a single treatment or a series of treatments. Estimates of effective dosages and in vivo half-lives for
the individual iRNAs encompassed by the invention can be made using conventional methodologies
or on the basis of in vivo testing using an appropriate animal model, as described elsewhere herein.
[00181]      Advances in mouse genetics have generated a number of mouse models for the study of
various human diseases, such as pathological processes mediated by CD274/PD-L1 expression. Such
                                                     52

models can be used for in vivo testing of iRNA, as well as for determining a therapeutically effective
dose. A suitable mouse model is, for example, a mouse containing a transgene expressing human
CD274/PD-L1.
[00182]      The present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions and formulations that
include the iRNA compounds featured in the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions of the
present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or
systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (e.g., by a
transdermal patch), pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by
nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal, oral or parenteral. Parenteral
administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular
injection or infusion; subdermal, e.g., via an implanted device; or intracranial, e.g., by
intraparenchymal, intrathecal or intraventricular, administration.
[00183]      The iRNA can be delivered in a manner to target a particular tissue, such as the liver (e.g.,
the hepatocytes of the liver).
[00184]      Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include
transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and
powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like
may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful. Suitable
topical formulations include those in which the iRNAs featured in the invention are in admixture with
a topical delivery agent such as lipids, liposomes, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, steroids, chelating
agents and surfactants. Suitable lipids and liposomes include neutral (e.g., dioleoylphosphatidyl
DOPE ethanolamine, dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline DMPC, distearolyphosphatidyl choline)
negative (e.g., dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol DMPG) and cationic (e.g.,
dioleoyltetramethylaminopropyl DOTAP and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine DOTMA). iRNAs
featured in the invention may be encapsulated within liposomes or may form complexes thereto, in
particular to cationic liposomes. Alternatively, iRNAs may be complexed to lipids, in particular to
cationic lipids. Suitable fatty acids and esters include but are not limited to arachidonic acid, oleic
acid, eicosanoic acid, lauric acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid,
linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein, dilaurin, glyceryl 1-monocaprate, 1
dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, an acylcarnitine, an acylcholine, or a Co2 0 alkyl ester (e.g.,
isopropylmyristate IPM), monoglyceride, diglyceride or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
Topical formulations are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,747,014, which is incorporated
herein by reference.
         Liposomal formulations
[00185]      There are many organized surfactant structures besides microemulsions that have been
studied and used for the formulation of drugs. These include monolayers, micelles, bilayers and
                                                      53

    WO 2011/127180                                                                 PCT/US2011/031429
vesicles. Vesicles, such as liposomes, have attracted great interest because of their specificity and the
duration of action they offer from the standpoint of drug delivery. As used in the present invention,
the term "liposome" means a vesicle composed of amphiphilic lipids arranged in a spherical bilayer or
bilayers.
[00186]      Liposomes are unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles which have a membrane formed from
a lipophilic material and an aqueous interior. The aqueous portion contains the composition to be
delivered. Cationic liposomes possess the advantage of being able to fuse to the cell wall. Non
cationic liposomes, although not able to fuse as efficiently with the cell wall, are taken up by
macrophages in vivo.
[00187]      In order to traverse intact mammalian skin, lipid vesicles must pass through a series of
fine pores, each with a diameter less than 50 nm, under the influence of a suitable transdermal
gradient. Therefore, it is desirable to use a liposome which is highly deformable and able to pass
through such fine pores.
[00188]      Further advantages of liposomes include; liposomes obtained from natural phospholipids
are biocompatible and biodegradable; liposomes can incorporate a wide range of water and lipid
soluble drugs; liposomes can protect encapsulated drugs in their internal compartments from
metabolism and degradation (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and
Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245). Important
considerations in the preparation of liposome formulations are the lipid surface charge, vesicle size
and the aqueous volume of the liposomes.
[00189]      Liposomes are useful for the transfer and delivery of active ingredients to the site of
action. Because the liposomal membrane is structurally similar to biological membranes, when
liposomes are applied to a tissue, the liposomes start to merge with the cellular membranes and as the
merging of the liposome and cell progresses, the liposomal contents are emptied into the cell where
the active agent may act.
[00190]      Liposomal formulations have been the focus of extensive investigation as the mode of
delivery for many drugs. There is growing evidence that for topical administration, liposomes present
several advantages over other formulations. Such advantages include reduced side-effects related to
high systemic absorption of the administered drug, increased accumulation of the administered drug at
the desired target, and the ability to administer a wide variety of drugs, both hydrophilic and
hydrophobic, into the skin.
[00191]      Several reports have detailed the ability of liposomes to deliver agents including high
molecular weight DNA into the skin. Compounds including analgesics, antibodies, hormones and
high-molecular weight DNAs have been administered to the skin. The majority of applications
resulted in the targeting of the upper epidermis
                                                     54

    WO 2011/127180                                                                 PCT/US2011/031429
[00192]       Liposomes fall into two broad classes. Cationic liposomes are positively charged
liposomes which interact with the negatively charged DNA molecules to form a stable complex. The
positively charged DNA/liposome complex binds to the negatively charged cell surface and is
internalized in an endosome. Due to the acidic pH within the endosome, the liposomes are ruptured,
releasing their contents into the cell cytoplasm (Wang et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1987,
147, 980-985).
[00193]       Liposomes which are pH-sensitive or negatively-charged, entrap nucleic acids rather than
complex with it. Since both the nucleic acid and the lipid are similarly charged, repulsion rather than
complex formation occurs. Nevertheless, some nucleic acid is entrapped within the aqueous interior of
these liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomes have been used to deliver nucleic acids encoding the
thymidine kinase gene to cell monolayers in culture. Expression of the exogenous gene was detected
in the target cells (Zhou et al., Journal of Controlled Release, 1992, 19, 269-274).
[00194]       One major type of liposomal composition includes phospholipids other than naturally
derived phosphatidylcholine. Neutral liposome compositions, for example, can be formed from
dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Anionic
liposome compositions generally are formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, while anionic
fusogenic liposomes are formed primarily from dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). Another
type of liposomal composition is formed from phosphatidylcholine (PC) such as, for example,
soybean PC, and egg PC. Another type is formed from mixtures of phospholipid and/or
phosphatidylcholine and/or cholesterol.
[00195]       Several studies have assessed the topical delivery of liposomal drug formulations to the
skin. Application of liposomes containing interferon to guinea pig skin resulted in a reduction of skin
herpes sores while delivery of interferon via other means (e.g., as a solution or as an emulsion) were
ineffective (Weiner et al., Journal of Drug Targeting, 1992, 2, 405-410). Further, an additional study
tested the efficacy of interferon administered as part of a liposomal formulation to the administration
of interferon using an aqueous system, and concluded that the liposomal formulation was superior to
aqueous administration (du Plessis et al., Antiviral Research, 1992, 18, 259-265).
[00196]       Non-ionic liposomal systems have also been examined to determine their utility in the
delivery of drugs to the skin, in particular systems comprising non-ionic surfactant and cholesterol.
Non-ionic liposomal formulations comprising NovasomeTm I (glyceryl
dilaurate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) and Novasome TM II (glyceryl
distearate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl    ether) were used to deliver cyclosporin-A into the
dermis of mouse skin. Results indicated that such non-ionic liposomal systems were effective in
facilitating the deposition of cyclosporine-A into different layers of the skin (Hu et al. S.T.P.Pharma.
Sci., 1994, 4, 6, 466).
                                                     55

    WO 2011/127180                                                                  PCT/US2011/031429
[00197]       Liposomes also include "sterically stabilized" liposomes, a term which, as used herein,
refers to liposomes comprising one or more specialized lipids that, when incorporated into liposomes,
result in enhanced circulation lifetimes relative to liposomes lacking such specialized lipids. Examples
of sterically stabilized liposomes are those in which part of the vesicle-forming lipid portion of the
liposome (A) comprises one or more glycolipids, such as monosialoganglioside GMi, or (B) is
derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety.
While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought in the art that, at least for
sterically stabilized liposomes containing gangliosides, sphingomyelin, or PEG-derivatized lipids, the
enhanced circulation half-life of these sterically stabilized liposomes derives from a reduced uptake
into cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (Allen et al., FEBS Letters, 1987, 223, 42; Wu et
al., Cancer Research, 1993, 53, 3765).
[00198]       Various liposomes comprising one or more glycolipids are known in the art.
Papahadjopoulos et al. (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1987, 507, 64) reported the ability of
monosialoganglioside GMI, galactocerebroside sulfate and phosphatidylinositol to improve blood half
lives of liposomes. These findings were expounded upon by Gabizon et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
U.S.A., 1988, 85, 6949). U.S. Pat. No. 4,837,028 and WO 88/04924, both to Allen et al., disclose
liposomes comprising (1) sphingomyelin and (2) the ganglioside Gm, or a galactocerebroside sulfate
ester. U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,152 (Webb et al.) discloses liposomes comprising sphingomyelin.
Liposomes comprising 1,2-sn-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine are disclosed in WO 97/13499 (Lim et
al).
[00199]       Many liposomes comprising lipids derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers,
and methods of preparation thereof, are known in the art. Sunamoto et al. (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn.,
                                                                          2
1980, 53, 2778) described liposomes comprising a nonionic detergent,        C1215G, that contains a PEG
moiety. Illum et al. (FEBS Lett., 1984, 167, 79) noted that hydrophilic coating of polystyrene particles
with polymeric glycols results in significantly enhanced blood half-lives. Synthetic phospholipids
modified by the attachment of carboxylic groups of polyalkylene glycols (e.g., PEG) are described by
Sears (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,426,330 and 4,534,899). Klibanov et al. (FEBS Lett., 1990, 268, 235)
described experiments demonstrating that liposomes comprising phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)
derivatized with PEG or PEG stearate have significant increases in blood circulation half-lives. Blume
et al. (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1990, 1029, 91) extended such observations to other PEG
derivatized phospholipids, e.g., DSPE-PEG, formed from the combination of
distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) and PEG. Liposomes having covalently bound PEG
moieties on their external surface are described in European Patent No. EP 0 445 131 B 1 and WO
90/04384 to Fisher. Liposome compositions containing 1-20 mole percent of PE derivatized with
PEG, and methods of use thereof, are described by Woodle et al. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,013,556 and
5,356,633) and Martin et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,213,804 and European Patent No. EP 0 496 813 B1).

Liposomes comprising a number of other lipid-polymer conjugates are disclosed in WO 91/05545 and
U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,212 (both to Martin et al.) and in WO 94/20073 (Zalipsky et al.) Liposomes
comprising PEG-modified ceramide lipids are described in WO 96/10391 (Choi et al). U.S. Pat. No.
5,540,935 (Miyazaki et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,556,948 (Tagawa et al.) describe PEG-containing
liposomes that can be further derivatized with functional moieties on their surfaces.
[00200]      A number of liposomes comprising nucleic acids are known in the art. WO 96/40062 to
Thierry et al. discloses methods for encapsulating high molecular weight nucleic acids in liposomes.
U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,221 to Tagawa et al. discloses protein-bonded liposomes and asserts that the
contents of such liposomes may include a dsRNA. U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,710 to Rahman et al. describes
certain methods of encapsulating oligodeoxynucleotides in liposomes. WO 97/04787 to Love et al.
discloses liposomes comprising dsRNAs targeted to the raf gene.
[00201]      Transfersomes are yet another type of liposomes, and are highly deformable lipid
aggregates which are attractive candidates for drug delivery vehicles. Transfersomes may be
described as lipid droplets which are so highly deformable that they are easily able to penetrate
through pores which are smaller than the droplet. Transfersomes are adaptable to the environment in
which they are used, e.g., they are self-optimizing (adaptive to the shape of pores in the skin), self
repairing, frequently reach their targets without fragmenting, and often self-loading. To make
transfersomes it is possible to add surface edge-activators, usually surfactants, to a standard liposomal
composition. Transfersomes have been used to deliver serum albumin to the skin. The transfersome
mediated delivery of serum albumin has been shown to be as effective as subcutaneous injection of a
solution containing serum albumin.
[00202]      Surfactants find wide application in formulations such as emulsions (including
microemulsions) and liposomes. The most common way of classifying and ranking the properties of
the many different types of surfactants, both natural and synthetic, is by the use of the
hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB). The nature of the hydrophilic group (also known as the "head")
provides the most useful means for categorizing the different surfactants used in formulations (Rieger,
in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, p. 285).
[00203]      If the surfactant molecule is not ionized, it is classified as a nonionic surfactant. Nonionic
surfactants find wide application in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products and are usable over a wide
range of pH values. In general their HLB values range from 2 to about 18 depending on their
structure. Nonionic surfactants include nonionic esters such as ethylene glycol esters, propylene
glycol esters, glyceryl esters, polyglyceryl esters, sorbitan esters, sucrose esters, and ethoxylated
esters. Nonionic alkanolamides and ethers such as fatty alcohol ethoxylates, propoxylated alcohols,
and ethoxylated/propoxylated block polymers are also included in this class. The polyoxyethylene
surfactants are the most popular members of the nonionic surfactant class.

[00204]       If the surfactant molecule carries a negative charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in
water, the surfactant is classified as anionic. Anionic surfactants include carboxylates such as soaps,
acyl lactylates, acyl aides of amino acids, esters of sulfuric acid such as alkyl sulfates and
ethoxylated alkyl sulfates, sulfonates such as alkyl benzene sulfonates, acyl isethionates, acyl taurates
and sulfosuccinates, and phosphates. The most important members of the anionic surfactant class are
the alkyl sulfates and the soaps.
[00205]       If the surfactant molecule carries a positive charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in
water, the surfactant is classified as cationic. Cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts
and ethoxylated amines. The quaternary ammonium salts are the most used members of this class.
[00206]       If the surfactant molecule has the ability to carry either a positive or negative charge, the
surfactant is classified as amphoteric. Amphoteric surfactants include acrylic acid derivatives,
substituted alkylamides, N-alkylbetaines and phosphatides.
[00207]       The use of surfactants in drug products, formulations and in emulsions has been reviewed
(Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, p. 285).
          Nucleic acid lipidparticles
[00208]       In one embodiment, a CD274/PD-L1 dsRNA featured in the invention is fully
encapsulated in the lipid formulation, e.g., to form a SPLP, pSPLP, SNALP, or other nucleic acid
lipid particle. As used herein, the term "SNALP" refers to a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle,
including SPLP. As used herein, the term "SPLP" refers to a nucleic acid-lipid particle comprising
plasmid DNA encapsulated within a lipid vesicle. SNALPs and SPLPs typically contain a cationic
lipid, a non-cationic lipid, and a lipid that prevents aggregation of the particle (e.g., a PEG-lipid
conjugate). SNALPs and SPLPs are extremely useful for systemic applications, as they exhibit
extended circulation lifetimes following intravenous (i.v.) injection and accumulate at distal sites
(e.g., sites physically separated from the administration site). SPLPs include "pSPLP," which include
an encapsulated condensing agent-nucleic acid complex as set forth in PCT Publication No.
WO 00/03683. The particles of the present invention typically have a mean diameter of about 50 nm
to about 150 nm, more typically about 60 nm to about 130 nm, more typically about 70 nm to about
110 nm, most typically about 70 nm to about 90 nm, and are substantially nontoxic. In addition, the
nucleic acids when present in the nucleic acid- lipid particles of the present invention are resistant in
aqueous solution to degradation with a nuclease. Nucleic acid-lipid particles and their method of
preparation are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,976,567; 5,981,501; 6,534,484; 6,586,410;
6,815,432; and PCT Publication No. WO 96/40964.
[00209]       In one embodiment, the lipid to drug ratio (mass/mass ratio) (e.g., lipid to dsRNA ratio)
will be in the range of from about 1:1 to about 50:1, from about 1:1 to about 25:1, from about 3:1 to

non-cationic lipid may be from about 5 mol % to about 90 mol %, about 10 mol %, or about 58 mol %
if cholesterol is included, of the total lipid present in the particle.
[00214]      The conjugated lipid that inhibits aggregation of particles may be, for example, a
polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-lipid including, without limitation, a PEG-diacylglycerol (DAG), a PEG
dialkyloxypropyl (DAA), a PEG-phospholipid, a PEG-ceramide (Cer), or a mixture thereof. The
PEG-DAA conjugate may be, for example, a PEG-dilauryloxypropyl (Ci2), a PEG

[00216]      In one embodiment, the lipidoid ND98-4HCl (MW 1487) (see U.S. Patent Application
No. 12/056,230, filed 3/26/2008, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), Cholesterol
(Sigma-Aldrich), and PEG-Ceramide C16 (Avanti Polar Lipids) can be used to prepare lipid-dsRNA
nanoparticles (i.e., LNP01 particles). Stock solutions of each in ethanol can be prepared as follows:
ND98, 133 mg/nl; Cholesterol, 25 mg/nl, PEG-Ceramide C16, 100 mg/nl. The ND98, Cholesterol,
and PEG-Ceramide C16 stock solutions can then be combined in a, e.g., 42:48:10 molar ratio. The
combined lipid solution can be mixed with aqueous dsRNA (e.g., in sodium acetate pH 5) such that
the final ethanol concentration is about 35-45% and the final sodium acetate concentration is about
100-300 mM. Lipid-dsRNA nanoparticles typically form spontaneously upon mixing. Depending on
the desired particle size distribution, the resultant nanoparticle mixture can be extruded through a
polycarbonate membrane (e.g., 100 nm cut-off) using, for example, a thermobarrel extruder, such as
Lipex Extruder (Northern Lipids, Inc). In some cases, the extrusion step can be omitted. Ethanol
removal and simultaneous buffer exchange can be accomplished by, for example, dialysis or
tangential flow filtration. Buffer can be exchanged with, for example, phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) at about pH 7, e.g., about pH 6.9, about pH 7.0, about pH 7.1, about pH 7.2, about pH 7.3, or
about pH 7.4.

PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, Green, T.W. et al., Wiley-Interscience, New York
City, 1999). Briefly, protecting groups within the context of this invention are any group that reduces
or eliminates unwanted reactivity of a functional group. A protecting group can be added to a
functional group to mask its reactivity during certain reactions and then removed to reveal the original
functional group. In some embodiments an "alcohol protecting group" is used. An "alcohol
protecting group" is any group which decreases or eliminates unwanted reactivity of an alcohol
functional group. Protecting groups can be added and removed using techniques well known in the
art.

[00243]      Formulations prepared by either the standard or extrusion-free method can be
characterized in similar manners. For example, formulations are typically characterized by visual
inspection. They should be whitish translucent solutions free from aggregates or sediment. Particle
size and particle size distribution of lipid-nanoparticles can be measured by light scattering using, for
example, a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, USA). Particles should be about 20-300 nm, such
as 40-100 nm in size. The particle size distribution should be unimodal. The total dsRNA
concentration in the formulation, as well as the entrapped fraction, is estimated using a dye exclusion
assay. A sample of the formulated dsRNA can be incubated with an RNA-binding dye, such as

0.5% Triton-XIOO. The total dsRNA in the formulation can be determined by the signal from the
sample containing the surfactant, relative to a standard curve. The entrapped fraction is determined
by subtracting the "free" dsRNA content (as measured by the signal in the absence of surfactant) from

[00245]       Compositions and formulations for parenteral, intraparenchymal (into the brain),
intrathecal, intraventricular or intrahepatic administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which
may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives such as, but not limited to, penetration
enhancers, carrier compounds and other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.
[00246]       Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to,
solutions, emulsions, and liposome-containing formulations. These compositions may be generated
from a variety of components that include, but are not limited to, preformed liquids, self-emulsifying
solids and self-emulsifying semisolids. Particularly preferred are formulations that target the liver
when treating hepatic disorders such as hepatic carcinoma.
[00247]       The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention, which may conveniently be
presented in unit dosage form, may be prepared according to conventional techniques well known in
the pharmaceutical industry. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active
ingredients with the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are
prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid
carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
[00248]       The compositions of the present invention may be formulated into any of many possible
dosage forms such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gel capsules, liquid syrups, soft gels,
suppositories, and enemas. The compositions of the present invention may also be formulated as
suspensions in aqueous, non-aqueous or mixed media. Aqueous suspensions may further contain
substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium
carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may also contain stabilizers.
Additional Formulations
Emulsions
[00249]       The compositions of the present invention can be prepared and formulated as emulsions.
Emulsions are typically heterogeneous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of
droplets usually exceeding 0.1 m in diameter (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and
Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, LV., Popovich NG., and Ansel HC., 2004, Lippincott Williams &
Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, NY; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and
Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199; Rosoff, in
Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc.,
New York, N.Y., Volume 1, p. 245; Block in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and
Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 2, p. 335; Higuchi et al., in
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 301). Emulsions
are often biphasic systems comprising two immiscible liquid phases intimately mixed and dispersed
                                                      70

    WO 2011/127180                                                                 PCT/US2011/031429
with each other. In general, emulsions may be of either the water-in-oil (w/o) or the oil-in-water (o/w)
variety. When an aqueous phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk
oily phase, the resulting composition is called a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. Alternatively, when an
oily phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk aqueous phase, the
resulting composition is called an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion. Emulsions may contain additional
components in addition to the dispersed phases, and the active drug which may be present as a
solution in either the aqueous phase, oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Pharmaceutical excipients
such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, dyes, and anti-oxidants may also be present in emulsions as needed.
Pharmaceutical emulsions may also be multiple emulsions that are comprised of more than two
phases such as, for example, in the case of oil-in-water-in-oil (o/w/o) and water-in-oil-in-water
(w/o/w) emulsions. Such complex formulations often provide certain advantages that simple binary
emulsions do not. Multiple emulsions in which individual oil droplets of an o/w emulsion enclose
small water droplets constitute a w/o/w emulsion. Likewise a system of oil droplets enclosed in
globules of water stabilized in an oily continuous phase provides an o/w/o emulsion.
[00250]      Emulsions are characterized by little or no thermodynamic stability. Often, the dispersed
or discontinuous phase of the emulsion is well dispersed into the external or continuous phase and
maintained in this form through the means of emulsifiers or the viscosity of the formulation. Either of
the phases of the emulsion may be a semisolid or a solid, as is the case of emulsion-style ointment
bases and creams. Other means of stabilizing emulsions entail the use of emulsifiers that may be
incorporated into either phase of the emulsion. Emulsifiers may broadly be classified into four
categories: synthetic surfactants, naturally occurring emulsifiers, absorption bases, and finely
dispersed solids (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen,
LV., Popovich NG., and Ansel HC., 2004, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, NY;
Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker,
Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199).
[00251]      Synthetic surfactants, also known as surface active agents, have found wide applicability
in the formulation of emulsions and have been reviewed in the literature (see e.g., Ansel's
Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, LV., Popovich NG., and Ansel
HC., 2004, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, NY; Rieger, in Pharmaceutical
Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.,
volume 1, p. 285; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.),
Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, volume 1, p. 199). Surfactants are typically amphiphilic
and comprise a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic portion. The ratio of the hydrophilic to the
hydrophobic nature of the surfactant has been termed the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) and is a
valuable tool in categorizing and selecting surfactants in the preparation of formulations. Surfactants
may be classified into different classes based on the nature of the hydrophilic group: nonionic,
                                                     71

    WO 2011/127180                                                                PCT/US2011/031429
anionic, cationic and amphoteric (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery
Systems, Allen, LV., Popovich NG., and Ansel HC., 2004, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (8th ed.),
New York, NY Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.),
1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 285).
[00252]      Naturally occurring emulsifiers used in emulsion formulations include lanolin, beeswax,
phosphatides, lecithin and acacia. Absorption bases possess hydrophilic properties such that they can
soak up water to form w/o emulsions yet retain their semisolid consistencies, such as anhydrous
lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Finely divided solids have also been used as good emulsifiers
especially in combination with surfactants and in viscous preparations. These include polar inorganic
solids, such as heavy metal hydroxides, nonswelling clays such as bentonite, attapulgite, hectorite,
kaolin, montmorillonite, colloidal aluminum silicate and colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate,
pigments and nonpolar solids such as carbon or glyceryl tristearate.
[00253]      A large variety of non-emulsifying materials are also included in emulsion formulations
and contribute to the properties of emulsions. These include fats, oils, waxes, fatty acids, fatty
alcohols, fatty esters, humectants, hydrophilic colloids, preservatives and antioxidants (Block, in
Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc.,
New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 335; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and
Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199).
[00254]      Hydrophilic colloids or hydrocolloids include naturally occurring gums and synthetic
polymers such as polysaccharides (for example, acacia, agar, alginic acid, carrageenan, guar gum,
karaya gum, and tragacanth), cellulose derivatives (for example, carboxymethylcellulose and
carboxypropylcellulose), and synthetic polymers (for example, carbomers, cellulose ethers, and
carboxyvinyl polymers). These disperse or swell in water to form colloidal solutions that stabilize
emulsions by forming strong interfacial films around the dispersed-phase droplets and by increasing
the viscosity of the external phase.
[00255]      Since emulsions often contain a number of ingredients such as carbohydrates, proteins,
sterols and phosphatides that may readily support the growth of microbes, these formulations often
incorporate preservatives. Commonly used preservatives included in emulsion formulations include
methyl paraben, propyl paraben, quaternary ammonium salts, benzalkonium chloride, esters of p
hydroxybenzoic acid, and boric acid. Antioxidants are also commonly added to emulsion formulations
to prevent deterioration of the formulation. Antioxidants used may be free radical scavengers such as
tocopherols, alkyl gallates, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, or reducing agents
such as ascorbic acid and sodium metabisulfite, and antioxidant synergists such as citric acid, tartaric
acid, and lecithin.
[00256]      The application of emulsion formulations via dermatological, oral and parenteral routes
and methods for their manufacture have been reviewed in the literature (see e.g., Ansel's
                                                    72

Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, LV., Popovich NG., and Ansel
HC., 2004, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, NY; Idson, in Pharmaceutical
Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.,
volume 1, p. 199). Emulsion formulations for oral delivery have been very widely used because of
ease of formulation, as well as efficacy from an absorption and bioavailability standpoint (see e.g.,
Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, LV., Popovich NG., and
Ansel HC., 2004, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, NY; Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical
Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.,
volume 1, p. 245; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.),
1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199). Mineral-oil base laxatives, oil-soluble
vitamins and high fat nutritive preparations are among the materials that have commonly been
administered orally as o/w emulsions.
[00257]      In one embodiment of the present invention, the compositions of iRNAs and nucleic acids
are formulated as microemulsions. A microemulsion may be defined as a system of water, oil and
amphiphile which is a single optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable liquid solution (see
e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, LV., Popovich NG.,
and Ansel HC., 2004, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, NY; Rosoff, in
Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc.,
New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245). Typically microemulsions are systems that are prepared by first
dispersing an oil in an aqueous surfactant solution and then adding a sufficient amount of a fourth
component, generally an intermediate chain-length alcohol to form a transparent system. Therefore,
microemulsions have also been described as thermodynamically stable, isotropically clear dispersions
of two immiscible liquids that are stabilized by interfacial films of surface-active molecules (Leung
and Shah, in: Controlled Release of Drugs: Polymers and Aggregate Systems, Rosoff, M., Ed., 1989,
VCH Publishers, New York, pages 185-215). Microemulsions commonly are prepared via a
combination of three to five components that include oil, water, surfactant, cosurfactant and
electrolyte. Whether the microemulsion is of the water-in-oil (w/o) or an oil-in-water (o/w) type is
dependent on the properties of the oil and surfactant used and on the structure and geometric packing
of the polar heads and hydrocarbon tails of the surfactant molecules (Schott, in Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 271).
[00258]      The phenomenological approach utilizing phase diagrams has been extensively studied
and has yielded a comprehensive knowledge, to one skilled in the art, of how to formulate
microemulsions (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen,
LV., Popovich NG., and Ansel HC., 2004, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, NY;

    WO 2011/127180                                                                PCT/US2011/031429
Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 335).
Compared to conventional emulsions, microemulsions offer the advantage of solubilizing water
insoluble drugs in a formulation of thermodynamically stable droplets that are formed spontaneously.
[00259]       Surfactants used in the preparation of microemulsions include, but are not limited to,
ionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, Brij 96, polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers, polyglycerol fatty acid
esters, tetraglycerol monolaurate (ML3 10), tetraglycerol monooleate (M03 10), hexaglycerol
monooleate (P0310), hexaglycerol pentaoleate (P0500), decaglycerol monocaprate (MCA750),
decaglycerol monooleate (M0750), decaglycerol sequioleate (S0750), decaglycerol decaoleate
(DA0750), alone or in combination with cosurfactants. The cosurfactant, usually a short-chain
alcohol such as ethanol, 1 -propanol, and 1-butanol, serves to increase the interfacial fluidity by
penetrating into the surfactant film and consequently creating a disordered film because of the void
space generated among surfactant molecules. Microemulsions may, however, be prepared without the
use of cosurfactants and alcohol-free self-emulsifying microemulsion systems are known in the art.
The aqueous phase may typically be, but is not limited to, water, an aqueous solution of the drug,
glycerol, PEG300, PEG400, polyglycerols, propylene glycols, and derivatives of ethylene glycol. The
oil phase may include, but is not limited to, materials such as Captex 300, Captex 355, Capmul MCM,
fatty acid esters, medium chain (C8-C12) mono, di, and tri-glycerides, polyoxyethylated glyceryl fatty
acid esters, fatty alcohols, polyglycolized glycerides, saturated polyglycolized C8-C1O glycerides,
vegetable oils and silicone oil.
[00260]       Microemulsions are particularly of interest from the standpoint of drug solubilization and
the enhanced absorption of drugs. Lipid based microemulsions (both o/w and w/o) have been
proposed to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs, including peptides (see e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.
6,191,105; 7,063,860; 7,070,802; 7,157,099; Constantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994,
11, 1385-1390; Ritschel, Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol., 1993, 13, 205). Microemulsions afford
advantages of improved drug solubilization, protection of drug from enzymatic hydrolysis, possible
enhancement of drug absorption due to surfactant-induced alterations in membrane fluidity and
permeability, ease of preparation, ease of oral administration over solid dosage forms, improved
clinical potency, and decreased toxicity (see e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,191,105; 7,063,860; 7,070,802;
7,157,099; Constantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 1385; Ho et al., J. Pharm. Sci.,
1996, 85, 138-143). Often microemulsions may form spontaneously when their components are
brought together at ambient temperature. This may be particularly advantageous when formulating
thermolabile drugs, peptides or iRNAs. Microemulsions have also been effective in the transdermal
delivery of active components in both cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. It is expected that
the microemulsion compositions and formulations of the present invention will facilitate the increased
systemic absorption of iRNAs and nucleic acids from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as improve the
local cellular uptake of iRNAs and nucleic acids.

[00261]       Microemulsions of the present invention may also contain additional components and
additives such as sorbitan monostearate (Grill 3), Labrasol, and penetration enhancers to improve the
properties of the formulation and to enhance the absorption of the iRNAs and nucleic acids of the
present invention. Penetration enhancers used in the microemulsions of the present invention may be
classified as belonging to one of five broad categories--surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating
agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier
Systems, 1991, p. 92). Each of these classes has been discussed above.
         PenetrationEnhancers
[00262]       In one embodiment, the present invention employs various penetration enhancers to effect
the efficient delivery of nucleic acids, particularly iRNAs, to the skin of animals. Most drugs are
present in solution in both ionized and nonionized forms. However, usually only lipid soluble or
lipophilic drugs readily cross cell membranes. It has been discovered that even non-lipophilic drugs
may cross cell membranes if the membrane to be crossed is treated with a penetration enhancer. In
addition to aiding the diffusion of non-lipophilic drugs across cell membranes, penetration enhancers
also enhance the permeability of lipophilic drugs.
[00263]       Penetration enhancers may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories, i.e.,
surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (see e.g.,
Malmsten, M. Surfactants and polymers in drug delivery, Informa Health Care, New York, NY, 2002;
Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p.92). Each of the above
mentioned classes of penetration enhancers are described below in greater detail.
[00264]       Surfactants: In connection with the present invention, surfactants (or "surface-active
agents") are chemical entities which, when dissolved in an aqueous solution, reduce the surface
tension of the solution or the interfacial tension between the aqueous solution and another liquid, with
the result that absorption of iRNAs through the mucosa is enhanced. In addition to bile salts and fatty
acids, these penetration enhancers include, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyoxyethylene-9
lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether) (see e.g., Malmsten, M. Surfactants and polymers in
drug delivery, Informa Health Care, New York, NY, 2002; Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic
Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p.92); and perfluorochemical emulsions, such as FC-43. Takahashi et al.,
J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1988, 40, 252).
[00265]       Fatty acids: Various fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers
include, for example, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid (n-decanoic acid), myristic acid, palmitic acid,
stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein (1-monooleoyl-rac-glycerol),
dilaurin, caprylic acid, arachidonic acid, glycerol 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one,
acylcarnitines, acylcholines, Co 20 alkyl esters thereof (e.g., methyl, isopropyl and t-butyl), and mono
and di-glycerides thereof (i.e., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, linoleate, etc.)

absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins (see e.g., Malmsten, M. Surfactants and polymers in drug

enhancers. Thus the term "bile salts" includes any of the naturally occurring components of bile as
well as any of their synthetic derivatives. Suitable bile salts include, for example, cholic acid (or its
pharmaceutically acceptable sodium salt, sodium cholate), dehydrocholic acid (sodium
dehydrocholate), deoxycholic acid (sodium deoxycholate), glucholic acid (sodium glucholate),
glycholic acid (sodium glycocholate), glycodeoxycholic acid (sodium glycodeoxycholate),

[00267]       ChelatingAgents: Chelating agents, as used in connection with the present invention, can
be defined as compounds that remove metallic ions from solution by forming complexes therewith,
with the result that absorption of iRNAs through the mucosa is enhanced. With regards to their use as
penetration enhancers in the present invention, chelating agents have the added advantage of also
serving as DNase inhibitors, as most characterized DNA nucleases require a divalent metal ion for
catalysis and are thus inhibited by chelating agents (Jarrett, J. Chromatogr., 1993, 618, 315-339).
Suitable chelating agents include but are not limited to disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate
(EDTA), citric acid, salicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and homovanilate), N
acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amino acyl derivatives of beta-diketones (enamines)(see

[00268]      Non-chelating non-surfactants: As used herein, non-chelating non-surfactant penetration
enhancing compounds can be defined as compounds that demonstrate insignificant activity as
chelating agents or as surfactants but that nonetheless enhance absorption of iRNAs through the
alimentary mucosa (see e.g., Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990,
7, 1-33). This class of penetration enhancers includes, for example, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl
and 1-alkenylazacyclo-alkanone derivatives (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier
Systems, 1991, page 92); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as diclofenac sodium,
indomethacin and phenylbutazone (Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1987, 39, 621-626).
[00269]      Agents that enhance uptake of iRNAs at the cellular level may also be added to the
pharmaceutical and other compositions of the present invention. For example, cationic lipids, such as
lipofectin (Junichi et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,188), cationic glycerol derivatives, and polycationic
molecules, such as polylysine (Lollo et al., PCT Application WO 97/30731), are also known to
enhance the cellular uptake of dsRNAs. Examples of commercially available transfection reagents
include, for example LipofectamineTM (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA), Lipofectamine 2000TM (Invitrogen;
Carlsbad, CA), 293fectinTM (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA), CellfectinTM (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA),

[00270]        Other agents may be utilized to enhance the penetration of the administered nucleic acids,
including glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, pyrrols such as 2-pyrrol, azones, and
terpenes such as limonene and menthone.
Carriers
[00271]        Certain compositions of the present invention also incorporate carrier compounds in the
formulation. As used herein, "carrier compound" or "carrier" can refer to a nucleic acid, or analog
thereof, which is inert (i.e., does not possess biological activity per se) but is recognized as a nucleic
acid by in vivo processes that reduce the bioavailability of a nucleic acid having biological activity by,
for example, degrading the biologically active nucleic acid or promoting its removal from circulation.
The coadministration of a nucleic acid and a carrier compound, typically with an excess of the latter
substance, can result in a substantial reduction of the amount of nucleic acid recovered in the liver,
kidney or other extracirculatory reservoirs, presumably due to competition between the carrier
compound and the nucleic acid for a common receptor. For example, the recovery of a partially
phosphorothioate dsRNA in hepatic tissue can be reduced when it is coadministered with polyinosinic
acid, dextran sulfate, polycytidic acid or 4-acetamido-4'isothiocyano-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid
(Miyao et al., DsRNA Res. Dev., 1995, 5, 115-121; Takakura et al., DsRNA & Nucl. Acid Drug
Dev., 1996, 6, 177-183.
Excipients
[00272]        In contrast to a carrier compound, a "pharmaceutical carrier" or "excipient" is a
pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, suspending agent or any other pharmacologically inert vehicle
for delivering one or more nucleic acids to an animal. The excipient may be liquid or solid and is
selected, with the planned manner of administration in mind, so as to provide for the desired bulk,
consistency, etc., when combined with a nucleic acid and the other components of a given
pharmaceutical composition. Typical pharmaceutical carriers include, but are not limited to, binding
agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,
etc.); fillers (e.g., lactose and other sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, pectin, gelatin, calcium sulfate,
ethyl cellulose, polyacrylates or calcium hydrogen phosphate, etc.); lubricants (e.g., magnesium
stearate, talc, silica, colloidal silicon dioxide, stearic acid, metallic stearates, hydrogenated vegetable
oils, corn starch, polyethylene glycols, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, etc.); disintegrants (e.g.,
starch, sodium starch glycolate, etc.); and wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, etc).
[00273]        Pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic excipients suitable for non-parenteral
administration which do not deleteriously react with nucleic acids can also be used to formulate the
compositions of the present invention. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are
not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohols, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose,
magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone
and the like.

[00274]      Formulations for topical administration of nucleic acids may include sterile and non
sterile aqueous solutions, non-aqueous solutions in common solvents such as alcohols, or solutions of
the nucleic acids in liquid or solid oil bases. The solutions may also contain buffers, diluents and other
suitable additives. Pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic excipients suitable for non
parenteral administration which do not deleteriously react with nucleic acids can be used.
[00275]      Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, water, salt
solutions, alcohol, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic
acid, viscous paraffin, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like.
Other Components
[00276]      The compositions of the present invention can additionally contain other adjunct
components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage
levels. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically
active materials such as, for example, antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory
agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of
the compositions of the present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants,
opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, should not unduly
interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions of the present invention.
The formulations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants,
preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers,
colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously interact with
the nucleic acid(s) of the formulation.
[00277]      Aqueous suspensions can contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension
including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may
also contain stabilizers.
[00278]      In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention include
(a) one or more iRNA compounds and (b) one or more biologic agents which function by a non-RNAi
mechanism. Examples of such biologics include, biologics that target one or more of PD-1, PD-Li,
or B7-Hi (CD80) (e.g., monoclonal antibodies against PD-1, PD-Li, or B7-Hi), or one or more
recombinant cytokines (e.g., IL6, IFN-7, and TNF).
[00279]      Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard
pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50
(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of
the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it
can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are
preferred.

    WO 2011/127180                                                                 PCT/US2011/031429
[00280]       The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating
a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of compositions featured herein lies generally
within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The
dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of
administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods featured in the invention, the
therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be
formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range of the compound or,
when appropriate, of the polypeptide product of a target sequence (e.g., achieving a decreased
concentration of the polypeptide) that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound
which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such
information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may
be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.
[00281]       In addition to their administration, as discussed above, the iRNAs described herein can be
administered in combination with other known agents effective in treatment of pathological processes
mediated by CD274/PD-L1 expression. In any event, the administering physician can adjust the
amount and timing of iRNA administration on the basis of results observed using standard measures
of efficacy known in the art or described herein.
Methods for treating diseases caused by expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene
[00282]       The invention relates in particular to the use of an iRNA targeting CD274/PD-L1 and
compositions containing at least one such iRNA for the treatment of a CD274/PD-L1 -mediated
disorder or disease. For example, a composition containing an iRNA targeting a CD274/PD-L1 gene
is used for treatment of a cancer. As used herein, cancer refers to any of various malignant neoplasms
characterized by the proliferation of anaplastic cells that tend to invade surrounding tissue and
metastasize to new body sites and also refers to the pathological condition characterized by such
malignant neoplastic growths. A cancer can be a tumor or hematological malignancy, and includes but
is not limited to, all types of lymphomas/leukemias, carcinomas and sarcomas, such as those cancers
or tumors found in the anus, bladder, bile duct, bone, brain, breast, cervix, colon/rectum,
endometrium, esophagus, eye, gallbladder, head and neck, liver, kidney, larynx, lung, mediastinum
(chest), mouth, ovaries, pancreas, penis, prostate, skin, small intestine, stomach, spinal marrow,
tailbone, testicles, thyroid and uterus.
[00283]       Leukemias, or cancers of the blood or bone marrow that are characterized by an abnormal
proliferation of white blood cells i.e., leukocytes, can be divided into four major classifications
including Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Acute
myelogenous leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (AML with translocations between
chromosome 10 and 11 [t(10, 11)], chromosome 8 and 21 [t(8;21)], chromosome 15 and 17

[t(15;17)], and inversions in chromosome 16 [inv(16)]; AML with multilineage dysplasia, which
includes patients who have had a prior myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative
disease that transforms into AML; AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), therapy-related,
which category includes patients who have had prior chemotherapy and/or radiation and subsequently
develop AML or MDS; d) AML not otherwise categorized, which includes subtypes of AML that do
not fall into the above categories; and e) Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage, which occur when
the leukemic cells can not be classified as either myeloid or lymphoid cells, or where both types of
cells are present); and Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
[00284]       The types of carcinomas include, but are not limited to, papilloma/carcinoma,
choriocarcinoma, endodermal sinus tumor, teratoma, adenoma/adenocarcinoma, melanoma, fibroma,
lipoma, leiomyoma, rhabdomyoma, mesothelioma, angioma, osteoma, chondroma, glioma,
lymphoma/leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, large cell undifferentiated
carcinomas, basal cell carcinoma and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma.
[00285]       The types of sarcomas include, but are not limited to, soft tissue sarcoma such as alveolar
soft part sarcoma, angiosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma, desmoid tumor, desmoplastic small round cell
tumor, extraskeletal chondrosarcoma, extraskeletal osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, hemangiopericytoma,
hemangiosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma,
lymphosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, neurofibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial
sarcoma, and Askin's tumor, Ewing's sarcoma (primitive neuroectodermal tumor), malignant
hemangioendothelioma, malignant schwannoma, osteosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma.
[00286]       The invention further relates to the use of an iRNA or a pharmaceutical composition
thereof, e.g., for treating a cancer, in combination with other pharmaceuticals and/or other therapeutic
methods, e.g., with known pharmaceuticals and/or known therapeutic methods, such as, for example,
those which are currently employed for treating these disorders. For example, the iRNA or
pharmaceutical composition thereof can also be administered in conjunction with one or more
additional anti-cancer treatments, such as biological, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Accordingly, a
treatment can include, for example, imatinib (Gleevac), all-trans-retinoic acid, a monoclonal antibody
treatment (gemtuzumab, ozogamicin), chemotherapy (for example, chlorambucil, prednisone,
prednisolone, vincristine, cytarabine, clofarabine, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, decitabine, inhibitors
of MDR1), rituximab, interferon-a, anthracycline drugs (such as daunorubicin or idarubicin), L
asparaginase, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, fludarabine, etoposide,
pentostatin, or cladribine), bone marrow transplant, stem cell transplant, radiation thereapy, anti
metabolite drugs (methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine), or any combination thereof.
[00287]       Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy, X-ray therapy, or irradiation) is the use of
ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy can be administered
externally via external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or internally via brachytherapy. The effects of

radiation therapy are localised and confined to the region being treated. Radiation therapy may be
used to treat almost every type of solid tumor, including cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx,
lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, uterus, or soft tissue sarcomas. Radiation is also used to treat
leukemia and lymphoma.
[00288]      Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with drugs that can destroy cancer cells. In
current usage, the term "chemotherapy" usually refers to cytotoxic drugs which affect rapidly dividing
cells in general, in contrast with targeted therapy. Chemotherapy drugs interfere with cell division in
various possible ways, e.g. with the duplication of DNA or the separation of newly formed
chromosomes. Most forms of chemotherapy target all rapidly dividing cells and are not specific to
cancer cells, although some degree of specificity may come from the inability of many cancer cells to
repair DNA damage, while normal cells generally can. Most chemotherapy regimens are given in
combination. Exemplary chemotherapeutic agents include , but are not limited to, 5-FU Enhancer, 9

[00289]      Biological therapies use the body's immune system, either directly or indirectly, to fight
cancer or to lessen the side effects that may be caused by some cancer treatments. In one sense,
targeting CD274/PD-L1 can be considered in this group of therapies in that it can stimulate immune
                                                     82

system action against a tumor, for example. However, this approach can also be considered with other
such biological approaches, e.g., immune response modifying therapies such as the administration of
interferons, interleukins, colony-stimulating factors, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, gene therapy,
and nonspecific immunomodulating agents are also envisioned as anti-cancer therapies to be
combined with the inhibition of CD274/PD-L1. Small molecule targeted therapy drugs are generally
inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated, overexpressed, or otherwise critical proteins within the
cancer cell, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib (Gleevec/Glivec) and gefitinib (Iressa).
Examples of monoclonal antibody therapies that can be used with an iRNA or pharmaceutical
composition thereof include, but are not limited to, the anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab
(Herceptin) used in breast cancer, and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, used in a variety of B-cell
malignancies. The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or blocking certain
hormones. Common examples of hormone-sensitive tumors include certain types of breast and
prostate cancers. Removing or blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional
treatment. In certain cancers, administration of hormone agonists, such as progestogens may be
therapeutically beneficial.
[00290]       Cancer immunotherapy refers to a diverse set of therapeutic strategies designed to induce
the patient's own immune system to fight the tumor, and include, but are not limited to, intravesical
BCG immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer, vaccines to generate specific immune responses,
such as for malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, and the use of Sipuleucel-T for prostate
cancer, in which dendritic cells from the patient are loaded with prostatic acid phosphatase peptides to
induce a specific immune response against prostate-derived cells.
[00291]       In some embodiments, an iRNA targeting CD274/PD-L1 is administered in combination
with an angiogenesis inhibitor. In some embodiments, the angiogenesis inhibitors for use in the
methods described herein include, but are not limited to, monoclonal antibody therapies directed
against specific pro-angiogenic growth factors and/or their receptors. Examples of these are:
bevacizumab (Avastin®), cetuximab (Erbitux®), panitumumab (VectibixTM), and trastuzumab
(Herceptin@).    In some embodiments, the angiogenesis inhibitors for use in the methods described
herein include but are not limited to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of multiple pro
angiogenic growth factor receptors. The three TKIs that are currently approved as anti-cancer
therapies are erlotinib (Tarceva®), sorafenib (Nexavar®), and sunitinib (Sutent@). In some
embodiments, the angiogenesis inhibitors for use in the methods described herein include but are not

[00294]       Efficacy of treatment, prevention, or amelioration of disease can be assessed, for example
by measuring disease progression, disease remission, symptom severity, reduction in pain, quality of
life, dose of a medication required to sustain a treatment effect, level of a disease marker or any other
measurable parameter appropriate for a given disease being treated or targeted for prevention. It is
well within the ability of one skilled in the art to monitor efficacy of treatment or prevention by
measuring any one of such parameters, or any combination of parameters. In connection with the
                                                      84

    WO 2011/127180                                                                    PCT/US2011/031429
administration of an iRNA targeting CD274/PD-L1 or pharmaceutical composition thereof, "effective
against" a cancer indicates that administration in a clinically appropriate manner results in a beneficial
effect for at least a statistically significant fraction of patients, such as a improvement of symptoms, a
cure, a reduction in disease load, reduction in tumor mass or cell numbers, extension of life,
improvement in quality of life, or other effect generally recognized as positive by medical doctors
familiar with treating the particular type of cancer.
[00295]       A treatment or preventive effect is evident when there is a statistically significant
improvement in one or more parameters of disease status, or by a failure to worsen or to develop
symptoms where they would otherwise be anticipated. As an example, a favorable change of at least
10% in a measurable parameter of disease, and preferably at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or more can
be indicative of effective treatment. Efficacy for a given iRNA drug or formulation of that drug can
also be judged using an experimental animal model for the given disease as known in the art. When
using an experimental animal model, efficacy of treatment is evidenced when a statistically significant
reduction in a marker or symptom is observed.
[00296]       The invention relates in particular to the use of an iRNA targeting CD274/PD-L1 and
compositions containing at least one such iRNA for the treatment of a CD274/PD-L1 -mediated
disorder or disease. For example, a composition containing an iRNA targeting a CD274/PD-L1 gene
is used for treatment of an infectious disease or disorder, for example, in a subject having an infection.
In some preferred embodiments the subject has an infection or is at risk of having an infection. An
"infection" as used herein refers to a disease or condition attributable to the presence in a host of a
foreign organism or agent that reproduces within the host. Infections typically involve breach of a
normal mucosal or other tissue barrier by an infectious organism or agent. A subject that has an
infection is a subject having objectively measurable infectious organisms or agents present in the
subject's body. A subject at risk of having an infection is a subject that is predisposed to develop an
infection. Such a subject can include, for example, a subject with a known or suspected exposure to an
infectious organism or agent. A subject at risk of having an infection also can include a subject with a
condition associated with impaired ability to mount an immune response to an infectious organism or
agent, e.g., a subject with a congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, a subject undergoing radiation
therapy or chemotherapy, a subject with a burn injury, a subject with a traumatic injury, a subject
undergoing surgery or other invasive medical or dental procedure.
[00297]       Infections are broadly classified as bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic based on the
category of infectious organism or agent involved. Other less common types of infection are also
known in the art, including, e.g., infections involving rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, and agents causing
scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopthy (BSE), and prion diseases (e.g., kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jacob
disease). Examples of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites which cause infection are well known in
the art. An infection can be acute, subacute, chronic, or latent, and it can be localized or systemic. As
                                                        85

defined herein, a "chronic infection" refers to those infections that are not cleared by the normal
actions of the innate or adaptive immune responses and persist in the subject for a long duration of
time, on the order of weeks, months, and years. A chronic infection may reflect latency of the
infectious agent, and may be include periods in which no infectious symptoms are present, i.e.,
asymptomatic periods. Examples of chronic infections include, but are not limited to, HIV infection
and herpesvirus infections. Furthermore, an infection can be predominantly intracellular or
extracellular during at least one phase of the infectious organism's or agent's life cycle in the host.
[00298]       Exemplary viruses include, but are not limited to: Retroviridae (e.g., human
immunodeficiency viruses, such as HIV-1 (also referred to as HTLV-III), HIV-2, LAV or HTLV
III/LAV, or HIV-III, and other isolates, such as HIV-LP; Picornaviridae(e.g., polio viruses, hepatitis

kills or inhibits the growth or function of infective fungi. Anti-fungal medicaments are sometimes
classified by their mechanism of action. Some anti-fungal agents function as cell wall inhibitors by
inhibiting glucose synthase, other antifungal agents function by destabilizing membrane integrity, and
other antifungal agents function by breaking down chitin (e.g., chitinase) or immunosuppression (501
cream). Thus, exemplary antifungal medicaments useful for the methods described herein include, but

[00305]      In further embodiments, administration of a dsRNA targeting CD274/PD-L1 is
administered in combination with an anti-parasitic medicament or agent. An "antiparasitic
medicament" refers to an agent that kills or inhibits the growth or function of infective parasites.
Examples of antiparasitic medicaments, also referred to as parasiticides, useful for the methods
described herein include, but are not limited to, albendazole, amphotericin B, benznidazole, bithionol,

[00306]      The iRNA and an additional therapeutic agent can be administered in combination in the
same composition, e.g., parenterally, or the additional therapeutic agent can be administered as part of
a separate composition or by another method described herein.
[00307]      Patients can be administered a therapeutic amount of iRNA, such as 0.01 mg/kg, 0.05
mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, or 2.5 mg/kg dsRNA. The iRNA can
be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of time, such as over a 5 minute, 10 minute, 15
minute, 20 minute, or 25 minute period. The administration is repeated, for example, on a regular
basis, such as biweekly (i.e., every two weeks) for one month, two months, three months, four months
or longer. After an initial treatment regimen, the treatments can be administered on a less frequent
basis. For example, after administration biweekly for three months, administration can be repeated
once per month, for six months or a year or longer. Administration of the iRNA can reduce
                                                    91

CD274/PD-L1 levels, e.g., in a cell, tissue, blood, urine or other compartment of the patient by at least
10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at
least 70%, at least 80 % or at least 90% or more.
[00308]        Before administration of a full dose of the iRNA, patients can be administered a smaller
dose, such as a 5% infusion reaction, and monitored for adverse effects, such as an allergic reaction,
or for elevated lipid levels or blood pressure. In another example, the patient can be monitored for
unwanted immunostimulatory effects, such as increased cytokine (e.g., TNF-alpha or INF-alpha)
levels.
[00309]        Genetic predisposition plays a role in the development of some cancers and hematological
malignancies. Therefore, a patient in need of a CD274/PD-L1 iRNA may be identified by taking a
family history, or, for example, screening for one or more genetic markers or variants. A healthcare
provider, such as a doctor, nurse, or family member, can take a family history before prescribing or
administering a CD274/PD-L1 dsRNA. For example, certain variants in the BRCA] and BRCA2 genes
are known to cause an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers. A DNA test may also be
performed on the patient to identify a mutation in the CD274/PD-L1 gene, before a CD274/PD-L1
dsRNA is administered to the patient.
[00310]        Owing to the inhibitory effects on CD274/PD-L1 expression, a composition according to
the invention or a pharmaceutical composition prepared therefrom can enhance the quality of life.
Methods for modulatin2 expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene
[00311]        In yet another aspect, the invention provides a method for modulating (e.g., inhibiting or
activating) the expression of a CD274/PD-L1 gene in a mammal.
[00312]        In one embodiment, the method includes administering a composition featured in the
invention to the mammal such that expression or activity of the target CD274/PD-L1 gene is
decreased, such as for an extended duration, e.g., at least two, three, four days or more, e.g., one week,
two weeks, three weeks, or four weeks or longer. In some embodiments, CD274/PD-L1 expression or
activity is decreased by at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least
40%, at least 50%, or at least 60%, or more, as compared to pretreatment levels.
[00313]        In another embodiment, the method includes administering a composition as described
herein to a mammal such that expression or activity of the target CD274/PD-L1 gene is increased by
e.g., at least 10% compared to an untreated animal. In some embodiments, the activation of
CD274/PD-L1 occurs over an extended duration, e.g., at least two, three, four days or more, e.g., one
week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, or more. Without wishing to be bound by theory, an iRNA
can activate CD274/PD-L1 expression by stabilizing the CD274/PD-L1 mRNA transcript, interacting
with a promoter in the genome, and/or inhibiting an inhibitor of CD274/PD-L1 expression.

[00314]       Preferably, the iRNAs useful for the methods and compositions featured in the invention
specifically target RNAs (primary or processed) of the target CD274/PD-L1 gene. Compositions and
methods for inhibiting the expression of these CD274/PD-L1 genes using iRNAs can be prepared and
performed as described elsewhere herein.
[00315]       In one embodiment, the method includes administering a composition containing an
iRNA, where the iRNA includes a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to at least a part of an
RNA transcript of the CD274/PD-L 1 gene of the mammal to be treated. When the organism to be
treated is a mammal such as a human, the composition may be administered by any means known in
the art including, but not limited to oral, intraperitoneal, or parenteral routes, including intracranial
(e.g., intraventricular, intraparenchymal and intrathecal), intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous,
transdermal, airway (aerosol), nasal, rectal, and topical (including buccal and sublingual)
administration. In certain embodiments, the compositions are administered by intravenous infusion or
injection.

butyldimethylsilyl-uridine-3'-O-N,N'-diisopropyl-2-cyanoethylphosphoramidite (Pierce Nucleic
Acids Technologies) were used for the oligonucleotide synthesis. The 2'-F phosphoramidites, 5'-0
dimethoxytrityl-N4-acetyl-2'-fluro-cytidine-3'-0-N,N'-diisopropyl-2-cyanoethyl-phosphoramidite
and 5'-0-dimethoxytrityl-2'-fluro-uridine-3'-O-N,N'-diisopropyl-2-cyanoethyl-phosphoramidite        are
purchased from (Promega). All phosphoramidites are used at a concentration of 0.2M in acetonitrile
(CH 3 CN) except for guanosine which is used at 0.2M concentration in 10% THF/ANC (v/v).
Coupling/recycling time of 16 minutes is used. The activator is 5-ethyl thiotetrazole (0.75M,
American International Chemicals); for the PO-oxidation iodine/water/pyridine is used and for the
PS-oxidation PADS (2%) in 2,6-lutidine/ACN (1:1 v/v) is used.
[00320]      3'-ligand conjugated strands are synthesized using solid support containing the
corresponding ligand. For example, the introduction of cholesterol unit in the sequence is performed
from a hydroxyprolinol-cholesterol phosphoramidite. Cholesterol is tethered to trans-4
hydroxyprolinol via a 6-aminohexanoate linkage to obtain a hydroxyprolinol-cholesterol moiety. 5'
end Cy-3 and Cy-5.5 (fluorophore) labeled iRNAs are synthesized from the corresponding Quasar
570 (Cy-3) phosphoramidite are purchased from Biosearch Technologies. Conjugation of ligands to
5'-end and or internal position is achieved by using appropriately protected ligand-phosphoramidite
building block. An extended 15 min coupling of 0.1 M solution of phosphoramidite in anhydrous
CH 3 CN in the presence of 5-(ethylthio)-1H-tetrazole activator to a solid-support-bound
oligonucleotide. Oxidation of the internucleotide phosphite to the phosphate is carried out using
standard iodine-water as reported (1) or by treatment with tert-butyl hydroperoxide/acetonitrile/water
(10: 87: 3) with 10 min oxidation wait time conjugated oligonucleotide. Phosphorothioate is
introduced by the oxidation of phosphite to phosphorothioate by using a sulfur transfer reagent such
as DDTT (purchased from AM Chemicals), PADS and or Beaucage reagent. The cholesterol
phosphoramidite is synthesized in house and used at a concentration of 0.1 M in dichloromethane.
Coupling time for the cholesterol phosphoramidite is 16 minutes.
Deprotection I (Nucleobase Deprotection)
[00321]      After completion of synthesis, the support is transferred to a 100 mL glass bottle (VWR).
The oligonucleotide is cleaved from the support with simultaneous deprotection of base and
phosphate groups with 80 mL of a mixture of ethanolic ammonia [ammonia: ethanol (3:1)] for 6.5 h at
55'C. The bottle is cooled briefly on ice and then the ethanolic ammonia mixture is filtered into a new
250-mL bottle. The CPG is washed with 2 x 40 mL portions of ethanol/water (1:1 v/v). The volume

of the mixture is then reduced to  -  30 mL by roto-vap. The mixture is then frozen on dry ice and
dried under vacuum on a speed vac.
Deprotection II (Removal of 2'-TBDMS group)
[00322]      The dried residue is resuspended in 26 mL of triethylamine, triethylamine
trihydrofluoride (TEA-3HF) or pyridine-HF and DMSO (3:4:6) and heated at 60'C for 90 minutes to
remove the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) groups at the 2' position. The reaction is then quenched
with 50 mL of 20 mM sodium acetate and the pH is adjusted to 6.5. Oligonucleotide is stored in a
freezer until purification.
Analysis
[00323]      The oligonucleotides are analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
prior to purification and selection of buffer and column depends on nature of the sequence and or
conjugated ligand.
HPLC Purification
[00324]      The ligand-conjugated oligonucleotides are purified by reverse-phase preparative HPLC.
The unconjugated oligonucleotides are purified by anion-exchange HPLC on a TSK gel column
packed in house. The buffers are 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.5) in 10% CH 3CN (buffer A) and
20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.5) in 10% CH 3CN, IM NaBr (buffer B). Fractions containing full
length oligonucleotides are pooled, desalted, and lyophilized. Approximately 0.15 OD of desalted
oligonucleotides are diluted in water to 150 pL and then pipetted into special vials for CGE and
LC/MS analysis. Compounds are then analyzed by LC-ESMS and CGE.
iRNA preparation
[00325]      For the general preparation of iRNA, equimolar amounts of sense and antisense strand are
heated in 1xPBS at 95'C for 5 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. Integrity of the duplex is
confirmed by HPLC analysis.

Example 2. CD274/PD-L1 siRNA Desi2n and Synthesis
Transcripts
[00327]       Oligonucleotide design was carried out to identify siRNAs targeting the gene encoding
the human "CD274 molecule" (NCBI human symbol CD274) and the orthologous sequences from
mice (Mus musculus) and rat (Rattus norvegicus). The design process used the CD274 transcripts
NM_014143.2 from human (NCBI Geneld 29126; SEQ ID NO: 869, FIG.1), NM_021893.2 from
mouse (NCBI Geneld 60533; SEQ ID NO: 870, FIG.2), and both XM_001079572.1 and
XM_574652.2 from rat (NCBI Geneld 499342; SEQ ID NO: 871, FIG.3 and SEQ ID NO: 872, FIG.4
respectively). All sequences were obtained from the NCBI Refseq collection.
[00328]       Two sets of oligos were designed: a human-specific set of oligos with 100% identity to
human CD274, but less than 100% identity in mouse or rat, and a second set of siRNAs with 100%
identity to the single mouse and both rat CD274 transcripts. All siRNA duplexes were designed with
100% identity to their respective CD274 transcripts.
[00329]       A total of 456 sense human CD274/PD-L1 derived siRNA oligos were synthesized and
formed into duplexes. The sense and corresponding antisense oligos are presented in Table 2 (SEQ ID
NO: 5- SEQ ID NO: 436), Table 3 (SEQ ID NO: 437- SEQ ID NO: 868), and Table 5 (SEQ ID NO:
877- SEQ ID NO: 924) (human CD274/PD-L1, SEQ ID NO: 869) for use in the various aspects and
embodiments described herein. In Tables 2 and 3, corresponding sense and antisense sequences have
been designated or assigned adjacent sequence identifiers, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 5 (sense) and SEQ ID
NO: 6 (antisense). In Table 5, corresponding sense and antisense sequences have not been designated
adjacent sequence identifiers, but are found at the same row. In Table 5, sense oligonucleotide
sequence identifiers are found at column 3 and the sense oligonucleotide sequences at column 5, and
the antisense oligonucleotide sequence identifiers are found at at column 6 and the antisense
oligonucleotide sequences at column 8. For example, the corresponding antisense sequence for sense
sequence SEQ ID NO.: 878 is SEQ ID NO: 902 found at the same row.
siRNA Design and Specificity Prediction
[00330]       The specificity of the 19mer oligo sets was predicted from each sequence. The CD274
siRNAs were used in a comprehensive search against their respective human, or mouse and rat
transcriptomes (defined as the set of NM_ and XM_ records within the NCBI Refseq set) using the
                                                    96

    WO 2011/127180                                                                PCT/US2011/031429
FASTA algorithm. The Python script 'offtargetFasta.py' was then used to parse the alignments and
generate a score based on the position and number of mismatches between the siRNA and any
potential 'off-target' transcript. The off-target score is weighted to emphasize differences in the 'seed'
region of siRNAs, in positions 2-9 from the 5' end of the molecule. The off-target score is calculated
as follows: mismatches between the oligo and the transcript are given penalties. A mismatch in the
seed region in positions 2-9 of the oligo is given a penalty of 2.8; mismatches in the putative cleavage
sites 10 and 11 are given a penalty of 1.2, and all other mismatches a penalty of 1. The off-target
score for each oligo-transcript pair is then calculated by summing the mismatch penalties. The lowest
off-target score from all the oligo-transcript pairs is then determined and used in subsequent sorting of
oligos. Both siRNAs strands were assigned to a category of specificity according to the calculated
scores: a score above 3 qualifies as highly specific, equal to 3 as specific and between 2.2 and 2.8 as
moderate specific. In picking which oligos to synthesize, we sorted from high to low by the off-target
score of the antisense strand and took the best (lowest off-target score) oligo pairs.
Synthesis of CD274 Sequences
[00331]      CD274 sequences were synthesized on a MerMade 192 synthesizer at 1pmol scale.
[00332]      For all the sequences in the list, 'endolight' chemistry was applied as detailed below.
             "    All pyrimidines (cytosine and uridine) in the sense strand contained 2'-O-Methyl
                  bases (2' O-Methyl C and 2'-O-Methyl U)
             "    In the antisense strand, pyrimidines adjacent to(towards 5' position) ribo A
                  nucleoside were replaced with their corresponding 2-0-Methyl nucleosides
             "    A two base dTsdT extension at 3' end of both sense and anti sense sequences was
                  introduced
             "    The sequence file was converted to a text file to make it compatible for loading in the
                  MerMade 192 synthesis software
Synthesis, Cleavage and deprotection:
[00332]      The synthesis of CD274 sequences used solid supported oligonucleotide synthesis using
phosphoramidite chemistry.
[00333]      The synthesis of the above sequences was performed at lum scale in 96 well plates. The
amidite solutions were prepared at 0. 1M concentration and ethyl thio tetrazole (0.6M in Acetonitrile)
was used as activator.
[00334]      The synthesized sequences were cleaved and deprotected in 96 well plates, using
methylamine in the first step and fluoride reagent in the second step. The crude sequences were
precipitated using acetone: ethanol (80:20) mix and the pellet were re-suspended in 0.02M sodium
acetate buffer. Samples from each sequence were analyzed by LC-MS to confirm the identity, UV for
quantification and a selected set of samples by IEX chromatography to determine purity.
Purification and desalting:

[00335]       CD274 sequences were purified on AKTA explorer purification system using Source 15Q
column. A column temperature of 65C was maintained during purification. Sample injection and
collection was performed in 96 well (1.8mL -deep well) plates. A single peak corresponding to the
full length sequence was collected in the eluent. The purified sequences were desalted on a Sephadex
G25 column using AKTA purifier. The desalted CD274 sequences were analyzed for concentration
(by UV measurement at A260) and purity (by ion exchange HPLC). The single strands were then
submitted for annealing.

[00336]       RKO or Hep3B (ATCC, Manassas, VA) cells were grown to near confluence at 37'C in
an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in McCoy's or EMEM (respectively) (ATCC) supplemented with 10%
FBS, streptomycin, and glutamine (ATCC) before being released from the plate by trypsinization.
Reverse transfection was carried out by adding 5pl of Opti-MEM to 5pIl of siRNA duplexes per well
into a 96-well plate along with 10pl of Opti-MEM plus 0.2pl of Lipofectamine RNAiMax per well
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA. cat # 13778-150) and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. 80pl
of complete growth media without antibiotic containing 2.0 x10 4 Hela cells were then added. Cells
were incubated for 24 hours prior to RNA purification. Experiments were performed at 0.1 or 10nM
final duplex concentration for single dose screens with each of the CD274 duplexes. A subset of 16
duplexes that showed robust silencing in the 10nM and 0.1nM screens were assayed over a range of
concentrations from 10nM to 10fM using serial dilutions to determine their IC50.
Total RNA isolation using MagMAX-96 Total RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystem, Forer City
CA, part #: AM1830):
[00337]       Cells were harvested and lysed in 140pl of Lysis/Binding Solution then mixed for 1
minute at 850rpm using and Eppendorf Thermomixer (the mixing speed was the same throughout the
process). Twenty micro liters of magnetic beads and Lysis/Binding Enhancer mixture were added
into cell-lysate and mixed for 5 minutes. Magnetic beads were captured using magnetic stand and the
supernatant was removed without disturbing the beads. After removing supernatant, magnetic beads
were washed with Wash Solution 1 (isopropanol added) and mixed for 1 minute. Beads were capture
again and supernatant removed. Beads were then washed with 150pl Wash Solution 2 (Ethanol
added), captured and supernatant was removed. 50ul of DNase mixture (MagMax turbo DNase
Buffer and Turbo DNase) was then added to the beads and they were mixed for 10 to 15 minutes.
After mixing, 100p l of RNA Rebinding Solution was added and mixed for 3 minutes. Supernatant
was removed and magnetic beads were washed again with 150pl Wash Solution 2 and mixed for 1
minute and supernatant was removed completely. The magnetic beads were mixed for 2 minutes to
dry before RNA was eluted with 50pl of water.

cDNA synthesis using ABI High capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, Cat #4368813):
[00338]      A master mix of 2pl 1OX Buffer, 0.8 pl 25X dNTPs, 2p l Random primers, 1Pl Reverse
Transcriptase, 1pl RNase inhibitor and 3.2plI of H20 per reaction were added into 10Ipl total RNA.
cDNA was generated using a Bio-Rad C-1000 or S-1000 thermal cycler (Hercules, CA) through the
following steps: 25'C 10 min, 37'C 120 min, 85'C 5 sec, 4'C hold.
Real time PCR:
[00339]      2p l of cDNA were added to a master mix containing 0.5 Pl GAPDH TaqMan Probe
(Applied Biosystems Cat # 4326317E), 0.5pl CD274 (PD-Li) TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems
cat # HsO1 125301_ml) and 5pl Roche Probes Master Mix (Roche Cat # 04887301001) in a total of
10pl per well in a LightCycler 480 384 well plate (Roche cat # 0472974001). Real time PCR was
done in a LightCycler 480 Real Time PCR machine (Roche). Each duplex was tested in at least two
independent transfections. For those siRNAs that were tested in RKO and Hep3B cells, at least three
transfections were performed. Each transfection was assayed by qPCR in duplicate.
[00340]      Real time data were analyzed using the AACt method. Each sample was normalized to
GAPDH expression and knockdown was assessed relative to cells transfected with the non-targeting
duplex AD-1955. IC50s were defined using a 4 parameter fit model in XLfit.
[00341]      In the experiments described herein, IC50 values were determined for a set of exemplary
inhibitory duplex sequences in duplicate experiments. For example, IC50 values for inhibitory duplex
AD-31066-bl (SEQ ID NO: 890 and SEQ ID NO: 914), were 0.456978463 nM and 0.817398666 nM; for
inhibitory duplex AD-31067-b1 (SEQ ID NO: 891 and SEQ ID NO: 915), 0.612976729 nM and
2.901972117 nM; for inhibitory duplex AD-31068-bl (SEQ ID NO: 892 and SEQ ID NO: 915),
0.762691728 nM and 0.46079339 nM; and for inhibitory duplex AD-31069-bl (SEQ ID NO: 893 and
SEQ ID NO: 915), 0.30630503 nM and 0.261020215 nM.
