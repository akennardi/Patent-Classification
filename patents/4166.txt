             SICKLE CUTTER FOR A HEADER OF A PLANT CUTTING MACHINE
                                     FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   [0001]      The present invention relates generally to a sickle cutter of a header for use
   with an agricultural machine. In particular, the present invention relates to a stationary
 5 knife assembly for overlapping a gap between a pair of moveable knife assemblies.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0002]      An agricultural machine such as a combine, windrower, cutting machine,
   mower, or the like is used to harvest a variety of crops from a field. During a harvesting
   operation, a header at the front of the machine cuts ripened crop from the field. If the
 0 header has multiple oscillating cutters, the areas between cutters may be cut too much
   (if strokes of the cutters overlap) or may be cut too little (if a gap exists between strokes
   of the cutters). Attempts to mitigate these issues include staggered cutter heights or
   staggered oscillating motions, both of which result in mechanical imbalances within the
   header and inconsistencies in crop cutting.
 5 [0003]      As such, there is still a need for a sickle cutter that has sufficient consistency
   and efficiency during harvesting operations. The present invention addresses the
   foregoing issues of conventional sickle cutters.
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   [0004]      In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
20 sickle cutter of a header for a plant cutting machine having a moveable first sickle knife
   assembly, a moveable second sickle knife assembly and a stationary knife assembly.
   The moveable first sickle knife assembly includes a first moveable ledger. The
   moveable second sickle knife assembly includes a second moveable ledger. The
   stationary knife assembly is located between and overlaps the moveable first and
25 second sickle knife assemblies. The first and second sickle knife assemblies are
   reciprocatingly driven at an offset phase of about 1800.
                                                1

   [0005]      In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided
   a header for a plant cutting machine including a sickle drive, a moveable first sickle
   knife assembly, a moveable second sickle knife assembly and a stationary knife
   assembly. The sickle drive has a drive mechanism, first and second knife arms
 5 operatively connected to the drive mechanism, and first and second knife heads
   respectively mounted to the first and second knife arms. The sickle drive is configured
   to reciprocate the first and second knife arms in opposite directions. The moveable first
   sickle knife assembly is mounted to the first knife head. The moveable second sickle
   knife assembly is mounted to the second knife head. The first and second moveable
 0 sickle knife assemblies define a minimum gap therebetween when reciprocated to an
   innermost stroke position. The first and second moveable sickle knife assemblies define
   a maximum gap therebetween when reciprocated to an outermost stroke position. The
   stationary knife assembly is mounted between the moveable first and second sickle
   knife assemblies and includes a center guard and a stationary knife having a width
 5 greater than the maximum gap.
   [0006]      The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of the
   exemplary embodiments of the invention, will be better understood when read in
   conjunction with the appended drawings. For the purpose of illustrating the invention,
   there are shown in the drawings exemplary embodiments. It should be understood,
 O however, that the invention is not limited to the precise arrangements and
   instrumentalities shown.

    [0022]       Furthermore, the described features, advantages and characteristics of the
    exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be combined in any suitable
    manner in one or more embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, in
    light of the description herein, that the present invention can be practiced without one or
25  more of the specific features or advantages of a particular exemplary embodiment. In
    other instances, additional features and advantages may be recognized in certain
    embodiments that may not be present in all exemplary embodiments of the present
    invention.
    [0023]       Referring now to the drawings wherein an exemplary embodiment of the
30  present invention is shown, FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a plant cutting machine 100 such as
    an agricultural combine. Plant cutting machine 100 includes a header 102 having a
                                                4

   chassis or frame 104 which is attached to a forward end 106 of the harvester, more
   specifically to a feeder house 108. The header 102 is configured to cut crops as the
   plant cutting machine 100 moves forward over a crop field, and may include a reel 110
   (Fig. 1), a draper belt 112 (FIG. 1) and/or an auger 113 (FIG. 2) for moving crop
 5 material sidewardly to the center along the header width and subsequently rearwardly,
   feeding the crop material to the plant cutting machine 100 through the feeder house
   108.
   [0024]      Structurally, the header 102 includes a pan or floor 114 that is supported in a
   desired proximity to the surface of the field during the harvesting operation as shown in
 0 FIG. 2, and an elongate, sidewardly extending sickle cutter 300 along a forward edge
   portion 116 of the floor. The sickle cutter or cutterbar 300 is operable for severing the
   plants or crop for induction into the header 102.
   [0025]      Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3A, the sickle cutter 300 extends in a sideward
   direction along the width of the floor 114, between a first side edge portion 118 of the
 5 floor and an opposite second side edge portion 120. As shown in the exemplary
   embodiment of FIG. 3B, the sickle cutter 300 is powered by a sickle drive 122 that
   includes a first drive mechanism 124A, a second drive mechanism 124B, a pair of
   output shafts 126, a pair of knife arms 128 and a pair of knife heads 130. In an
   exemplary embodiment, the sickle drive 122 is incorporated into or below the floor 114
 O at a central location of the header 102 between the first and second side edge portions
   118, 120.
   [0026]      The output shafts 126 are driven reciprocatingly by the first and second drive
   mechanisms 124A, 124B. The first and second drive mechanisms 124A, 124B
   reciprocate by being jointly driven in opposite rotational directions and in timed relation.
25 In this manner, the output shafts 126 are reciprocatingly driven at an offset phase of
   about 1800.
   [0027]      The first and second drive mechanisms of the exemplary embodiment are
   connected to a power source via enmeshed gears, a cogged belt, a timing shaft or the
   like. The power source can be e.g., a motor, rotating shaft, belt drive, and the like.
30 Additional details regarding sickle drives applicable to the present invention are
                                              5

    disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2014/0345239 and U.S. Patent
    Application Publication No. 2014/0318094, the entire disclosures of which are hereby
    incorporated by reference herein in their entirety for all purposes. The power source can
    alternatively be two separate sickle drives that are timed or untimed. Moreover, in
 5  alternative embodiments, the two sickle drives may each be located on a lateral side of
    the header, centrally on the header, or slightly offset from a center of the header.
    [0028]     The knife arms 128 each attach proximally to the output shaft 126 and distally
    to the knife head 130. Distal ends of the knife arms 128 are indirectly connected to the
    sickle cutter 300. Due to the reciprocating rotation of the output shafts 126, the knife
 0  arms 128 are driven in opposite directions, that is, they reciprocate at an offset phase of
    about 1800. In other words, the knife arms 128 each move generally simultaneously
    outwardly toward the first and second side edge portions 118, 120 and inwardly toward
    each other. In an exemplary embodiment, the inward movement is toward a centerline
    132 of the header 102.
 5  [0029]      Referring now to FIGS. 3A, 3B and 4, the sickle cutter 300 includes an
    elongate, sidewardly extending moveable first sickle knife assembly 302A and an
    elongate, sidewardly extending moveable second sickle knife assembly 302B extending
    in end to end relation to the moveable first sickle knife assembly. The moveable first
    and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B are supported in substantially
 '0 longitudinally aligned relation adjacent to the forward edge portion 116 of the floor 114.
    The moveable second sickle knife assembly 302B is structurally arranged substantially
    as a mirror image of the moveable first sickle knife assembly 302A, and as such is
    structurally configured and operates similar to the moveable first sickle knife assembly
    302A.
25  [0030]     The moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B are each
    mounted to a respective knife head 130 at a distal end of a knife arm 128, such that the
    moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies reciprocate at an offset phase of
    about 1800. As shown in FIG. 3B, the moveable first sickle knife assembly 302A
    reciprocates in lateral directions of the header 102 as indicated at A and the moveable
30  second sickle knife assembly 302B reciprocates in lateral directions as indicated at B.
                                               6

   [0031]      Referring to FIG. 3A, the moveable first sickle knife assembly 302A includes a
   first moveable ledger 304 at an inboard end, that is, nearest the centerline 132 of the
   header 102 in the exemplary embodiment. The first moveable ledger 304 has a lateral
   planar face 306 facing inward toward the centerline 132 and facing the moveable
 5 second sickle knife assembly 302B. The first moveable ledger 304 further has an inner
   planar face 307 facing generally away from the centerline 132 and generally facing
   away from the moveable second sickle knife assembly 302B. Along an outward
   direction of the moveable first sickle knife assembly 302A is a series of knives 308A,
   308B, 308C, 308D However, more or fewer knives may be provided. Pairs of knives
 0 such as 308A-B and 308C-D each constitute a knife section 309A and 309B,
   respectively.
   [0032]      In the exemplary embodiment, the first moveable ledger 304 is a generally
   triangular section of the moveable first sickle knife assembly 302A with the inner planar
   face 307 forming the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The first moveable ledger 304
 5 includes a major plane having a surface area about half of a surface area of a major
   plane of the knife section 309A, 309B. The first moveable ledger 304 may have a
   greater height or vertical thickness than the knife sections 309A, 309B. Other shapes
   are contemplated for the first moveable ledger 304, the lateral planar face 306, and the
   inner planar face 307. For example, the first moveable ledger 304 may be square or
 O rectangular. The lateral planar face 306 and inner planar face 307 may be curved
   concavely or convexly and may be disposed at any angle relative to a longitudinal axis
   of the plant cutting machine 100 and header 102.
   [0033]      As best shown in FIG. 4, the moveable first sickle knife assembly 302A has a
   substantially flat bottom side or underside 316 with the knives 308A-D being angled
25 relative to the bottom side so as to taper downwardly and distally toward the bottom
   side, such that cutting edges are formed at the flat bottom side. The bottom side 316
   also has a countersink for receiving a fastener for securing the respective moveable
   sickle knife assembly to a knife head 130.
   [0034]      The lateral planar faces 306 of each of the moveable first and second sickle
30 knife assemblies 302A, 302B are generally or substantially parallel to each other and to
                                              7

   the centerline 132, in other words, the lateral planar faces 306 each extend generally or
   substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis defined by the plant cutting machine 100.
   [0035]     Both the lateral planar face 306 and the inner planar face 307 of each of the
   moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B are arranged
 5 substantially vertically. As such, in the exemplary embodiment, the lateral planar face
   306 and the inner planar face 307 form square edges relative to the bottom side 316.
   [0036]     The moveable ledgers 304 of the moveable first and second sickle knife
   assemblies 302A, 302B define a variable gap 310 therebetween. During reciprocating
   motion of the moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B, the width
 0 of the variable gap 310 oscillates between a minimum gap 312 (FIG. 6A) and a
   maximum gap 314 (FIG. 6C) as will be discussed further below.
   [0037]     The first moveable ledger 304 and the knife sections 309A, 309B are shown
   in FIG. 3A as being integrally formed. However, they may be constructed as separate
   components that are fastened together, or the first moveable ledger 304 may be a
 5 separate component that is fastened to integrally formed knife sections 309A, 309B.
   Regardless of construction, in the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 4 the first
   moveable ledger 304 and the knife sections 309A, 309B form the substantially flat,
   planar bottom surface 316.
   [0038]     Referring to FIG. 5, the sickle cutter 300 includes a stationary knife assembly
 O 500 having first and second lateral ledgers 502A, 502B.
   [0039]     The first and second lateral ledgers 502A, 502B each have a lateral planar
   face 503A, 503B respectively. The lateral planar faces 503A, 503B face outwardly
   toward the first and second side edge portions 118, 120 of the header 102. In other
   words, the lateral planar faces 503A, 503B face away from the centerline 132 in the
25 exemplary embodiment. The lateral planar faces 503A, 503B of the stationary knife
   assembly 500 are generally or substantially parallel to each other, and likewise are
   generally or substantially parallel to the centerline 132 of the header 102 and the lateral
   planar faces 306 of each of the moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies
   302A, 302B.
                                               8

   [0040]      As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the stationary knife assembly 500 includes a
   stationary knife 501 having a substantially flat top side 504 with the stationary knives
   506A-D being angled relative to the top side so as to taper upwardly and distally toward
   the top side, such that cutting edges are formed at the flat top side. Pairs of the
 5 stationary knives 506A-B and 506C-D may generally be considered to be inner cutting
   surfaces 508A and 508B, respectively. Inner cutting surfaces 508A and 508B are
   generally V-shaped. Alternatively, knives 506A-D may be considered to collectively
   constitute a cutting area 510 extending between the first and second lateral ledgers
   502A, 502B.
 0 [0041]      The stationary knife 501 defines a lateral width 512 between the lateral planar
   faces 503A, 503B. As shown in FIG. 4, the stationary knife assembly 500 also includes
   a center guard 514 and first and second lateral guards 516A, 516B. The center guard
   514 defines a center guard width 518 at a rearward base of the center guard, i.e., at a
   proximal end of the center guard nearest the sickle drive 122.
 5 [0042]      In the exemplary embodiment, the stationary knife assembly 500 is fixedly
   mounted to the header 102 so as to extend across the centerline 132, which is where
   the variable gap 310 is formed and is between the first and second knife drive
   mechanisms 124A, 124B. However, the first and second knife drive mechanisms 124A,
   124B may be mounted at other locations across the header and knife heads 130 of
 O different sizes may be used, such that the variable gap 310 is not located about the
   centerline 132. In such embodiments the stationary knife assembly 500 is located so as
   to overlap with the variable gap 310 and thus overlap with operational stroke
   movements of both the moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B.
   [0043]      Operational stroke movement of the moveable first and second sickle knife
25 assemblies 302A, 302B is illustrated in FIGS. 6A-C. FIG. 6A illustrates a most inward
   stroke position of the moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B. In
   this position, the minimum gap 312 is less than the width 518 of the center guard 514,
   but the moveable ledgers 304 do not come in contact.
   [0044]      FIG. 6B illustrates an intermediate stroke position of the moveable first and
30 second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B. In the intermediate position during use, the
                                              9

   first and second moveable ledgers 304 interact with the stationary knife 501 to cause
   crop cutting by the stationary knives 506A-D and the lateral ledgers 502A, 502B interact
   with the moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B to cause crop
   cutting by the knives 308A-D, as further discussed below.
 5 [0045]     FIG. 6C illustrates a most outward stroke position of the moveable first and
   second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B. In this position, the lateral planar faces 306
   of the moveable ledgers 304 do not extend laterally beyond the first and second lateral
   ledgers 502A, 502B.
   [0046]     When assembled, the stationary knife assembly 500 ensures sufficient and
 0 consistent crop cutting about the centerline 132 of the header 102. That is, the
   stationary knife assembly 500 ensures sufficient and consistent crop cutting at the
   variable gap 310 between the moveable ledgers 304 of the moveable first and second
   sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B. Moreover, the stationary knife assembly 500
   prevents superfluous wasted motion of the sickle cutter 300 because the moveable first
 5 and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B can provide sufficient crop cutting
   without passing completely across the centerline 132 of the header. In alternative
   embodiments not positioned about the centerline 132, the stationary knife assembly 500
   prevents any overlap in the most inward stroke positions of the moveable first and
   second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B.
 O [0047]     The stationary knife assembly 500 also allows for the substantially opposite
   reciprocating motions of the moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A,
   302B because there is no risk of the moveable ledgers 304 colliding when at a most
   inward stroke position as in FIG. 6A. This is accomplished by the center guard 514
   extending across the minimum gap 312 position of the variable gap 310, so as to
25 prevent loss of crop within the minimum gap 312.
   [0048]     In operation, the moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A,
   302B are arranged to maximize efficiency and balance of the sickle cutter 300. The
   reciprocating motion at an offset phase of about 1800 minimizes vibrations and stresses
   within the sickle cutter 300 and the header 102. The bottom sides 316 of the moveable
30 first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B are placed at substantially the
                                            10

    same height as each other so as to provide consistent cutting and to provide clean
    cutting when passing over the stationary knife assembly 500.
    [0049]      As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, when the moveable first and second sickle knife
    assemblies 302A, 302B oscillate during use, the flat bottom sides 316 pass along the
 5  flat top side 504 of the stationary knife assembly such that the respective cutting edges
    are closely adjacent. This arrangement provides efficient and clean cutting of crop
    stalks with minimal bending or tearing. To ensure this closely adjacent position, the
    countersink in the flat bottom side 316 is provided for fasteners connecting the
    moveable sickle knife assembly 302A, 302B to a respective knife head 130.
 0  [0050]      Generally, the moveable ledgers 304 of the moveable first and second sickle
    knife assemblies 302A, 302B have generally flat planar faces that are not intended for
    cutting crops. Because the moveable ledgers 304 never extend outwardly beyond the
    first and second lateral ledgers 502A, 502B of the stationary knife 501, crop stalks
    cannot pass between the ledgers or, more generally, between the stationary knife 500
 5  and either of the moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B. This
    advantageously ensures that crop cutting occurs at the knives 308A-D and/or the
    stationary knives 506A-D.
    [0051]      During reciprocating motion of the moveable first and second sickle knife
    assemblies 302A, 302B, the lateral planar face 306 and the inner planar face 307 form
 '0 blunt edges that tend to push crop material as opposed to cutting it. In particular, as
    shown in FIGS. 3A and 6B, during inward stroke movement, the lateral planar face 306
    of the moveable first sickle knife assembly 302A pushes a crop against stationary
    knives 506B and 506D. During outward stroke movement, the inner planar face 307 of
    the moveable first sickle knife assembly 302A pushes a crop against stationary knives
25  506A and 506C. The height of the first and second moveable ledgers 304 provides a
    relatively large surface to push a crop consistently and promote a clean cut of the crop
    by the stationary knives 506A-D.
    [0052]      The lateral planar faces 503A, 503B of the stationary knife assembly 500 aid
    in cutting by the knife sections 309A, 309B. In particular, as shown in FIGS. 3A and 5,
30  during inward stroke movement, the lateral planar faces 503A, 503B hold a crop against
                                               11

  knives 308A and 308C of the moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A,
  302B.
  [0053]      While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary
  embodiments, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various changes may
5 be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing
  from the scope of the present invention. In addition, modifications may be made to
  adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the present invention without
  departing from the essential scope thereof. For example, the stationary knife assembly
  500 may be widened and provided with additional knives 506 and additional inner
0 cutting surfaces 508. Likewise, a header may support one or more sickle drives 122
  (e.g., one, two, three, four or five sickle drives 122) each having a first and second drive
  mechanism 124A, 124B, moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B
  and a stationary knife assembly 500 mounted at a respective variable gap 310.
  Moreover, as noted above, although the exemplary embodiment shows the stationary
5 knife assembly 500 and moveable first and second sickle knife assemblies 302A, 302B
  as being centered about the centerline 132 of the header, other embodiments may be
  slightly offset from the centerline 132 (e.g., offset by about the width of one, two, or
  three knife sections 309) or located at any position across the lateral width of the
  header. It is to be understood, therefore, that the present invention not be limited to the
O particular aspects disclosed, but it is intended to cover modifications within the spirit and
  scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
