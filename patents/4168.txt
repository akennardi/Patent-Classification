     6-SUBSTITUTED ESTRADIOL DERIVATIVES AND METHODS OF USE
  CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
  [0001]        This       application         claims      the     priority       benefit
  from   U.S.    Application         No.     12/627,874,        filed      November 30,
 2009.    The    teachings        of   this     application         are    incorporated
 herein by their entirety.
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
  [0002]       The      present      invention       relates          to   compositions
 and methods        of     making     and using        6-substituted           estradiol
 compounds      and     their     pharmaceutically           acceptable         salts      or
 prodrugs thereof as articulated and described herein. The
present        invention           also       pertains        to         pharmaceutical
 compositions comprising such compounds, present either in
 vitro    or   in    vivo,       for   both     diagnostic         applications         and
also     treatment           of   proliferative            conditions,          such      as
cancer.
BACKGROUND OF THEI            INVENTION
 [0003]        Proliferative cell disorders such as tumors and
primary        malignant            tumors        {herein,            cancer(s)}          in
particular are problematic given their tendency to invade
surrounding       tissues        and metastasize           to   distant organs            in
the    body.    To    date      the   most     frequently        used      methods      for
treating      neoplasia,           especially         solid        tumor      forms      of
neoplasia,          include          surgical         procedures,             radiation
therapy,      drug       chemotherapies,          and      combinations          of    the
foregoing.
[0004]        With        over      million       cases        of        cancer      being
diagnosed annually, and cancer                    claiming more than half a
million     lives      in     the  United       States     each      year,    there      is
increased need in new therapeutic modalities against such

   condition.             Prostate,          lung and           colorectal            remain       the most
   common         cancers         among        men;       while       breast,           colorectal         and
   lung cancers are the most common cancers among women.
    [0005]             In     recent        years,         there        have       been       significant
   gains in the management of                            these conditions. At least one
   of     the     success          stories         in     the     clinical          management          of a
   cancer        is      the    early        diagnosis           and treatment               options now
   available              for      primary           breast          cancer.           The       other      is
   employment of effective and nontoxic anti-estrogen agents
   that block the actions of estrogen either at its receptor
   sites or at a point of its synthesis.
   [0006]             Obviously           research          on the        function         and activity
  of     estrogen           receptors,           the      structure           and      their       function
  has       been         the     subject           of      many       recent          investigations.
  Estrogen              receptors             belong           to       a      large          family        of
  structurally                  related             ligand-inducible                     transcription
  factors,            including            steroid           receptors,            thyroid/retinoid
  receptors,               vitamin            D       receptors             known          as       nuclear
  receptors.              While       the     true       ligand         for     nuclear          receptors
  have        not        been        described,              there         are      distinct           small
 molecules             that      are      able       to     bind      to     such       receptors         and
  trigger a cellular response.
  £0007]             Estrogens and estrogen receptor modulators bind
 to     estrogen           receptors,           classified            into       two     types;       a  and
 P,       to      form        discrete           molecular             complexes             that     exert
 pleiotropic               tissue-specific                  effects          by     modulating           the
 expression              of    target         genes.           The      ligand-bound              estrogen
 receptor           acts       as     a   key      transcription               factor         in   various
molecular              pathways,             and       modulation             of       ER      expression
 levels          is        important            in      determining               cellular           growth
potential.
 [0008]              While       both        these        types       of      receptors           bind     to
estrogen,            as     well      as other agonists                   and antagonists,               the
two        receptors             have        distinctly             different             localization

   concentration within the body. Aside from some structural
   differences          between      the   a    and     p    types,      when     complexes
  with estrogen,             the   two were       shown      to    signal     in   opposite
  way,         with     estrogen       activating           transcription           in     the
  presence         of    Estrogen       Receptor         a    (ERa)     and      inhibiting
  transcription            in    the    presence         of    Estrogen        Receptor
   (ER).
   [0009]          Tamoxifen         is    primarily           one      of     the      first
  selective         estrogen      receptor       modulators          that     have    become
  first-line           therapy       for    hormonal          treatment         of    breast
  cancer,        both     for   adjuvant      treatment          and    for    therapy      of
 metastatic          disease.       Tamoxifen       is    a   competitive         inhibitor
 of    estradiol         binding     to the      estrogen receptor               inhibiting
  its     estrogen       binding      to the     estrogen         binding      element      on
 DNA.       It   has    been     suggested       that      Tamoxifen' s        binding      to
 the         estrogen          receptors         significantly              alters        the
 structural           configuration           of       the     estrogen         receptors,
 rendering          the     binding      sites      dysfunctional            towards      any
 endogenous          estrogen.       Such    structural          deformation         of   the
 receptor         could     explain     the    profound        side     effect      profile
 associated with the use of Tamoxifen.
  [0010]          At    least     another       shortcoming          of    Tamoxifen       is
 its     ineffectiveness against non-estrogen-dependent tumors
 and         lower             efficacy         in        pre-menopausal             women.
Additionally,            Tamoxifen       undergoes         an   isomerization          under
physiological             conditions       from       a    therapeutically           useful
 antiestrogenic compound to an estrogenic isomer which can
 stimulate         the    growth     of   estrogen-dependent               tumor     cells,
providing           an    undesired       clinical          outcome,        particularly
among patients suffering from estrogen dependent tumors.
 [0011]           U.S.     Patent    No.   4,732,904          discloses       other     type
of    estrogen        receptor      antagonists          conventionally           known as
hydrazone            compounds.          It       is       thought         that        these
antiestrogenic               hydrazone        compounds            do     not      undergo

  isomerization to estrogenic compounds under physiological
  conditions           and   the   estrogenic          side    effects     observed         for
  Tamoxifen are therefore absent. These hydrazone                                compounds
  have          been     proposed         as      alternative          treatments           for
  estrogen-dependent               breast          cancers.       Among      these,         the
  substituted           benzophenone         nitrophenyl         hydrazones,         such as
  4,4' -dihydroxybenzophenone-2,4-                           dinitrophenylhydrazone
  are described to be superior.
   [0012]            The     complex          of       the      receptor         and        the
  antiestrogen             such    as       hydrazone          based     compounds            or
  Tamoxifen           may    then    bind        to    nuclear       chromatin         in     an
 atypical manner for a longer time than the normal hormone
 receptor            complex.     Antiestrogens             may    also     be     able       to
 deplete the cytoplasm of free receptor. Either or both of
 these        effects      could   severely         impair     the    continued       growth
 of an estrogen-dependent tumor.
  [0013]            There    has   also       been      an   increased      interest         in
 the use of aromatase inhibitors to block specifically the
 local           production       of      estrogens          that      may    contribute
 substantially             to    hormone         responsive         disease       such       as
 breast           cancer.     Aromatase(CYP19)              is    described         as     the
 principal           enzyme     that      converts         androgens      to    estrogens
 both          in     pre-     and       postmenopausal             women.        Estrogen
 deprivation           through aromatase             inhibition       is   described as
 an         effective         and      selective            treatment         for        some
postmenopausal              patients         with       hormone-dependent             breast
 cancer.

    [0021]           US    Patent      5,892,069         to      D'Amato          describes
   estradiol derivatives that inhibit tubulin polymerization
   during cell mitosis. Given the above, a need still exists
   to identify new and effective agents for treating cancer.
    [00221          Another     point    of    concern       in    the     field       is      the
  eventual          conversion      of   some     estrogen-dependent                cancers,
   i.e.      breast      cancer,    to   estrogen-independent                 types.        This
  may be accounted for by a natural loss of differentiation
  by the         tumor cells.      Estrogen-dependent             cancer        cells       have
  often        been    observed    to eventually           lose     their      ability          to
  produce estrogen-binding               protein      receptors          and degenerate
  into        much      more    aggressive        estrogen-independent                    life
  threatening           cancers.    Indeed,     the    use of        antiestrogens              to
  treat        estrogen-dependent          tumors     may      lead      to    the     clonal
  selection           of     estrogen-independent                tumor         cells          and
 therefore           may    promote     the     conversion          of    an      estrogen
 dependent cancer to a non-estrogen-dependent cancer.
  [0023]            Cancers     of    other     organs,         such      as      lung        and
 colon,         may not    concern estrogen-binding protein receptors
 and thus are considered independent of estrogens for cell
 replication.            Such   estrogen-independent             tumors       are     not as
 susceptible            to   the   antiestrogenic           properties            of     drugs
 such        as    Tamoxifen,      aromatase        inhibitors.               Thus       other
 chemotherapeutic              agents     must      be     used       to     treat         such
 tumors.          Many     compounds       have      been       documented            to       be
 effective         to varying degrees          against estrogen-independent
 tumors.
 [00243            These    compounds     are    reviewed in many references
and         typically         administered         in       combination              regimen
chemotherapy             causing      substantial          side       effect        to       the
patients.            The    underlying       principle          of     using        general
cytotoxic            agents     in   chemotherapy           is     based         upon        the
observation            that    malignant      tumor      cells       replicate           at      a
higher          rate    than    normal    body     cells        and     are      therefore

   correspondingly                  more    susceptible             to     these    compounds.
  Similarly,             normal       tissues      that      proliferate         rapidly      (for
  example,             bone       marrow      and      intestinal           epithelium)        are
  subject           to      substantial         damage         once       exposed     to    these
  potent          cytotoxic          drugs,     and      such     toxicity       often    limits
  utility.
   [0025]             On     the    other hand,          slow growing          tumors     with a
  small          growth        fraction,        for      example         carcinomas      of    the
  colon or lung, are often unresponsive to cytotoxic drugs.
  Aside          from        the      treatment         of      estrogen-dependent             and
  estrogen-independent                   tumors,      many of         the    cytotoxic     drugs
  are currently being used for other proliferative diseases
  with rapidly growing cells involved non-cancerous or non
 malignant hyperproliferative conditions.
  [00261             Also        the    increasing           importance         of   effective
 therapeutic              management         of   viral       diseases        such    as   AIDS,
 herpes,            various           types      of       hepatitis          and     bacterial
 infections,              especially        among      immune        suppressed      patients,

 side effect profile.
  [0027]             Accordingly,          there      is     not    only a      need   for new
 and improved cancer chemotherapeutics that can be used to
 treat         both        estrogen-dependent               and      estrogen-independent
 tumors with minimal risk of systemic toxicity challenging
 the       quality          of      life    for     such       fragile        population        of
 patients,            but     also     for   therapeutic           remedies       that   target
 non-cancerous                hyperproliferative                conditions         which      can
benefit           from       effective       doses        of    estradiol        derivatives.
The        hyperproliferative                 cells        can      be     normal,     rapidly
growing           cells       or    abnormal      cells       and     can    include     tissue

Methods of Use
 [00 84]               The        present             invention             relates             to     a   method         of
treating               cancer            in     a     mammalian              subject             (e.g.,       a     human
patient).                 In        this       aspect          of     the      invention,               methods         are
provided              for       inhibiting                tumor         or     cancerous              cell     growth.
In     such a           method,              the      cells        are       exposed to                or contacted

  patients in need of such therapy.
   [0086]                These     methods        may be used              to treat        any     tumor
  which         may     be    either       directly          or     indirectly         effected          by
  hormonal           and/or       estrogen-related                activity,         including         but
  not       in     any    way     limited       to    solid         tumors      associated           with
  breast,            pancreatic,             lung,         colon,           prostate,          ovarian
  cancers,           as    well     as   brain,        liver,         spleen,       kidney,       lymph

  skin, head and neck, esophagus, or bone marrow cancer; as
  well       as     hematological             cancers,          such      as    leukemia,         acute
  promyelocytic                 leukemia,            lymphoma,             multiple          myeloma,
  myelodysplasia,                myeloproliferative                 disease,        or refractory
  anemia.
   [00873            Among other            things,       the      invention         offers      a    new
 mode          of      action        for      treating            estrogen          dependent           or
  independent             tumors.        Traditional             approach        employed        drugs
 once        bound to         the     ERs    modified the              ERs    configuration             to
 the        extent         that       in     effect         rendered           them      destroyed.
 Accordingly,              destruction            of    such       bound       ERs     would     cease
 transmission                of      all      external             and       internal         signals
 essential            for vitality            of    the     cells,        creating       a    stop in
 cellular growth.
  [00883             It    is     believed          that       the      presently         disclosed
 compounds              are     able      to      bind        to     number        of     receptors
 including               the      estrogen,           testosterone                and       androgen
 receptors.             The     inventor         has     unexpectedly             observed          that
upon binding,               the     compounds         of     the     present       invention         are
able        to modulate            the    cellular          first       or    second      messenger
 signaling pathways                   and    further        potentiate           their      clinical
effects             through         gene       dependent             or     gene       independent
mechanisms,               e.g.      gene      dependent            estrogen         activity         has
been        well       described         in     the     art       and     those       of    ordinary

  involved inactivation of a estrogen dependent gene.
   [00893          However,        in    the     present       invention,            the claimed
  compounds         are     able      to     modulate        cellular          activity        at    a
  level        independent           of      the      traditional            gene       regulated
  mechanisms.            In     this        aspect        of       the      invention,           the
  compounds of the instant invention are capable of binding
  directly         to    multiple          steroid        receptors           at     the     plasma
  membrane          and     trigger           internal         cell       mediated           stress

  ("UPR")        at    the     endoplasmic             reticulum.           The      UPR     stress
  response subsequently lead to growth inhibition, and cell
  death through modulation of stress response genes such as
  CHOP also known as GADD153, TRIB3, etc.

 the     present        invention           for     treatment         of     various        cancer
 states         may    comprise          administration               of     a    compound        of
 formulas          I-IV,     including           IVa-IVf,         in     combination           with
 other       adjunct        cancer        therapies,          such       as     chemotherapy,
 radiotherapy,            gene       therapy,         hormone         therapy          and    other
 cancer        therapies       known       in    the    art.        Combinations            of  the
 presently         disclosed          compounds         with      other      anti-cancer          or

   ovarian cancers was observed for the NDC-1011 enantiomer.
   For example, in vitro studies of tumor cell growth is the
  highest          in    cell     lines that are CYP19 positive                     (MDA-MB-213

  compound 24 may act as a pro-drug.
   [0108)              While not bound by any theory,                      for example,             if
  compound           24    is    a pro-drug,        then any number of the body's
  normal          steroidogenic             enzymes       should     be     active        towards
  compound             24      thereby       converting        compound        24     into        the
  active          metabolite (s) .           This    aspect      of   the     invention           can
 apply           in     the      same    manner        to    both    the      S    and       the      R
 diastereomers.
   [0109)             The      prodrug      compounds       of  the     instant       invention
 act in          a manner analogous to that observed for endogenous
 androstonedione.                  Compound      24    is   converted       to an aromatic
 ring        by hydroxylation                at   the     C-3  carbon      of     compound         24
 via       CYP19        to      give   rise      to    the    metabolite          compound         2.
 Compound 2             could undergo           further       hydroxylation          at     the C
 17 carbon via the reversible action                             of 17-hydroxysteroid
 dehydrogenase                 (17j-HSD) resulting in the diol compound 4.
  [01103              As    with Estradiol,            the    diol    compound        4    has an
 aromatic ring, but differs from estradiol with respect to
 the       methyloxyalkyl             substituent           at   the     C-6     carbon.         The
 metabolism of compound                      24 into the        diol     compound        4    could
 occur         in     any      order.     For    example,       compound        6    formed        by

 reaction             mixture        is    cooled    to     5   +   5'     C.  The    resulting
 compound is then collected and washed with cold denatured
 ethanol. Yields                  are     typically      70-80% on a          dry basis with
 purities typically 90-95% by HPLC area percent.

  Example 2
   [0148]            Methods of preparing compounds 3 and 4.
   [0149]            As outlined        in     Scheme     2,   estradiol         compounds 3
  and       4    are      synthesized        in     the    following        manner.          The
  protected             estradiol       is       prepared       by    reaction           of     3
  estradiol          with dihydropyran             in  THF,    using toluenesulfonic
  acid        or   camphorsulfonic             acid    as    catalyst.            As    one     of
  ordinary         skill       in   the  art      can   appreciate,         this     reaction
  is an equilibrium reaction and would not go to completion
  under         such      conditions.         Thus,       both    the     mono-protected
  estradiols            can    be   found     in    the    reaction      mixture.           Such
  crude        reaction        mixture     would      undergo     a  trituration            step
 with        acetonitrile          causing       the    desired     bis-THP         estradiol
 to crystallize in approximately 70 % yield.
  [0150]            As shown in Scheme 2, the intermediate aldehyde
 is obtained via acylation at the benzylic 6-position with
 a     strong        base       mixture      referred        to   as     LiDAKOR:         butyl
 lithium,           diisopropylamine,              and     potassium        tert-amylate.
 Under such conditions at                    -70 OC, one of ordinary skill in
 the      art     can appreciate          the     abstraction       of    a   proton at a
 benzylic          position.           The     intermediate         aldehyde         is    then
 purified          by     column      chromatography           to   give       a    syrup      in
 approximately 50 % yield.                       Reduction of the aldehyde with
 an     excess        of     lithium    aluminum         hydride     results         in    high
yields of the racemic hydroxymethyl estradiol compound as
a glassy foam.

   paying special             attention       to the      level     of    confluence.          If

   hour incubation period,                  the experiment            is    terminated and
   cell viability measured as described below.
   [0188]            Cell       viability            is      determined             using        a

  removed         and replaced with 100               pL of     fresh media,           and the
  buffer and lyophilized substrate are equilibrated to room
  temperature.                The   buffer       is    used     to     reconstitute          the
  substrate just prior to addition to the wells of the cell
 plate         (100    AL per     well) .        The     plate    is     placed      into    the
  Infinite          M200      plate     reader,        allowed       to     shake      for     10
 minutes followed by a 10 minute wait period. The plate is
 then        read    using an       integration          time    of      0.5   sec    with no
 attenuation.
  [0189]            The     mean   baseline         controls      (wells       with     Triton
 X-100          or    no      cells)     are       subtracted          from      the      total
 luminescence             to give     the net        luminescence          for   that well.
This        total     is    compared      to the       control      of DMSO        only.      An
 IC5       is     calculated       as    the     concentration            that     led    to    a
response           of    50%    compared       to    the    vehicle        control      cells.
Accordingly,               those    of    ordinary          skill      in    the     art    can
appreciate            that      the    R    configuration            (at     C-6)     of    the
