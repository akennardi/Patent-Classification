                                         BACKGROUND
   [0002]     Shape memory materials are defined by their capacity to recover a
   predetermined shape after significant mechanical deformation (K. Otsuka and C. M.
10 Wayman, "Shape Memory Materials" New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998).
   The shape memory effect is typically initiated by a change in temperature and has
   been observed in metals, ceramics, and polymers. From a macroscopic point of
   view, the shape memory effect in polymers differs from ceramics and metals due to
   the lower stresses and larger recoverable strains achieved in polymers.
15 [0003]     The basic thermomechanical response of shape memory polymer (SMP)
   materials is defined by four critical temperatures. The glass transition temperature,
   Tg, is typically represented by a transition in modulus-temperature space and can be
   used as a reference point to normalize temperature for some SMP systems. SMPs
   offer the ability to vary Tg over a temperature range of several hundred degrees by
20 control of chemistry or structure. The predeformation temperature, Td, is the
   temperature at which the polymer is deformed into its temporary shape. Depending
   on the required stress and strain level, the initial deformation Td can occur above or
   below Tg (Y. Liu, K. Gall, M. L. Dunn, and P. McCluskey, "Thermomechanical
   Recovery Couplings of Shape Memory Polymers in Flexure." Smart Materials &
25 Structures, vol. 12, pp. 947-954, 2003). The storage temperature, Ts, represents the
   temperature in which no shape recovery occurs and is equal to or is below Td. The
   storage temperature Ts is less than the glass transition temperature Tg. At the
   recovery temperature, Tr, the shape memory effect is activated, which causes the
   material to substantially recover its original shape. Tr is above Ts and is typically in
30 the vicinity of Tg. Recovery can be accomplished isothermally by heating the
   material to a fixed T, and then holding, or by continued heating up to and past Tr.

   From a macroscopic viewpoint, a polymer will demonstrate a useful shape memory
   effect if it possesses a distinct and significant glass transition (B. Sillion, "Shape
   memory polymers," Act. Chimique., vol. 3, pp. 182-188, 2002), a modulus
   temperature plateau in the rubbery state (C. D. Liu, S. B. Chun, P. T. Mather, L.

   Synthesis, characterization, and shape memory behavior." Macromolecules. vol. 35,
   no. 27, pp. 9868-9874, 2002), and a large difference between the maximum
   achievable strain, Emax, during deformation and permanent plastic strain after
   recovery, Ep (F. Li, R. C. Larock, "New Soybean Oil-Styrene-Divinylbenzene
10 Thermosetting Copolymers. V. Shape memory effect." J. App. Pol. Sci., vol. 84, pp.
   1533-1543, 2002). The difference Emax - Ep is defined as the recoverable strain,
   Recover, while the recovery ratio is defined as Erecover/ Emax.
   [0004]       The microscopic mechanism responsible for shape memory in polymers
   depends on both chemistry and structure (T. Takahashi, N. Hayashi, and S. Hayashi,

   polymers is the low conformational entropy state created and subsequently frozen
   during the thermomechanical cycle (C. D. Liu, S. B. Chun, P. T. Mather, L. Zheng, E.
   H. Haley, and E. B. Coughlin, "Chemically cross-linked polycyclooctene: Synthesis,
   characterization, and shape memory behavior." Macromolecules. Vol. 35, no. 27, pp.
 5 9868-9874, 2002). If the polymer is deformed into its temporary shape at a
   temperature below Tg, or at a temperature where some of the hard polymer regions
   are below Tg, then internal energy restoring forces will also contribute to shape
   recovery. In either case, to achieve shape memory properties, the polymer must
   have some degree of chemical crosslinking to form a "memorable" network or must
10 contain a finite fraction of hard regions serving as physical crosslinks.
   [0005]    SMPs are processed in a manner that is termed programming, whereby the
   polymer is deformed and set into a temporary shape. ( A. Lendlein, S. Kelch, "Shape
   Memory Polymer," Advanced Chemie, International Edition, 41, pp. 1973-2208,
   2002.) When exposed to an appropriate stimulus, the SMP substantially reverts
15 back to its permanent shape from the temporary shape. The stimulus may be, for
   example, temperature, magnetic field, water, or light, depending on the initial
   monomer systems.
   [0006]    For SMPs used in medical devices, wherein temperature is the chosen
   stimulus, an external heat source may be used to provide discretionary control of the
20 shape recovery by the physician, or the body's core temperature may be utilized to
   stimulate the shape recovery upon entry or placement within the body from the
   environmental temperature, which may be room temperature. (Small W, et al
   "Biomedical applications of thermally activated shape memory polymers" Journal of
   Materials Chemistry, Vol 20, pp 3356-3366, 2010.)
25 [0007]    For implantable medical devices, the life expectancy of the device can be
   defined by the duration that it must maintain its mechanical properties and
   functionality in the body. For biodegradable devices, this life expectancy is
   intentionally short, providing a mechanism for the material and device to degrade
   over time and be absorbed by the body's metabolic processes. For non
30 biodegradable devices, referred to as biodurable devices, or devices exhibiting
                                                3

    WO 2014/124225                                                          PCT/US2014/015250
   biodurability, they are not intended to degrade and they must maintain their material
   properties and functionality for longer periods, possibly for the life the patient.
   [0008]    For medical devices used within the body, either permanent implants or
   instrumentation used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, the ability to visualize
 5 the device using typical clinical imaging modalities, e.g. X-ray, Fluoroscopy, CT
   Scan, and MRI is typically a requirement for clinical use. Devices intended to be
   imaged by X-ray and Fluoroscopy, typically contain either metals or metal
   byproducts to induce radiopacity. Radiopacity refers to the relative inability of
   electromagnetism, particularly X-rays, to pass through dense materials, which are
10 described as 'radiopaque' appearing opaque/white in a radiographic image. A more
   radiopaque material appears brighter, whiter, on the image. (Novelline, Robert.
   Squire's Fundamentals of Radiology. Harvard University Press. 5th edition. 1997.)
   Given the complexity of the content within an X-ray or Fluoroscopic image, clinicians
   are sensitive to the quality of the image regarding the brightness or signal strength of
15 the material in the image. The two main factors that contribute to radiopacity
   brightness, or signal strength of a material are density and atomic number. Polymer
   based medical devices requiring radiopacity typically utilize a polymer blend that
   incorporates a small amount, by weight percent, of a heavy atom, radiopaque filler
   such as Titanium Dioxide (TiO 2), or Barium Sulfate (BaSO 4). The device's ability to
20 be visualized on fluoroscopy is dependent upon the amount, or density, of the filler
   mixed into the material, which is typically limited to a small quantity as the filler can
   detrimentally affect the base polymer's material properties. Meanwhile, medical
   device imaging companies have developed standardized liquid contrast media to be
   intermittently used by physicians to highlight vascular structures, etc. during X-ray or
25 Fluoroscopy when filled with this contrast media. This media commonly contains a
   heavy atom fluid, such as iodine, to induce radiopacity.
   [0009]    Iodine-incorporating monomers were reported by Mosner et al., who
   reported 3 different triiodinated aromatic monomers, which differed in the degree to
   which they could be homopolymerized or required copolymerization in order to be
30 incorporated. (Moszner et al "Synthesis and polymerization of hydrophobic iodine
   containing methacrylates" Die Angewandte Makromolekulare Chemie 224 (1995)

   115-123) lodinating monomers were also pursued by Koole et al in the Netherlands,
   as published from 1994-1996 with a range of monoiodinated to triiodinated aromatic
   monomers (Koole et al "Studies on a new radiopaque polymeric biomaterial,"
   Biomaterials 1994 Nov; 15(14):1122-8. Koole et al "A versatile three-iodine
 5 molecular building block leading to new radiopaque polymeric biomaterials," J
   Biomed Mater Res, 1996 Nov; 32(3):459-66). This included biocompatibility results
   of a 2-year implantation study in rats of monoiodinated aromatic methacrylate
   copolymer systems. (Koole et al "Stability of radiopaque iodine-containing
   biomaterials," Biomaterials 2002 Feb; 23(3):881-6) They are also discussed by
10 Koole in US Patent 6,040,408, filed initially as a European patent application in
   August, 1994, which limits its claims to aromatic monomers containing no more than
   two covalently bonded iodine groups. (US Patent 6,040,408, "Radiopaque Polymers
   and Methods for Preparation Thereof," Koole, 21 Mar 2000). Also, US Patent
   Application 20060024266 by Brandom et al. claimed polyiodinated aromatic
15 monomers in shape memory polymers, emphasizing the use of crystallizable
   polymer side-groups (US Patent Application 20060024266, "Side-chain crystallizable
   polymers for medical applications, Brandom et al, 05 Jul 2005).
   [0010]    The information included in this Background section of the specification,

                                      BRIEF SUMMARY
   [0011]    In one aspect, the invention provides radiopaque polymers. In one aspect,
25 the radiopaque polymers are shape memory polymers (SMPs). In one aspect, the
   compositions and compounds disclosed are useful for medical devices. In one
   aspect, the compositions and compounds disclosed may be shape memory
   polymers as defined herein and known in the art, but are not used in a manner in
   which they are externally triggered. In one aspect, the compositions and compounds
30 disclosed are "space-triggered", as the phrase is conventionally used. In a space
   triggered material the materials return to their original shape upon removal of a
                                               5

    WO 2014/124225                                                        PCT/US2014/015250
   spatial constraint, as is the case when a coil-shaped specimen emerges from its
   temporary elongated configuration within a deployment catheter and regains its coil
   shape, for example.     It should be made clear that certain compositions and
   compounds described herein may technically have shape memory properties, but
 5 those properties may or may not be used in the devices and methods of the
   invention. As used herein, the compounds and compositions described and
   disclosed here are intended to include shape memory aspects and non-shape
   memory aspects as applicable. If a particular embodiment is described using a
   shape memory polymer, it is recognized that other compounds and compositions
10 that are not specifically defined as having shape memory properties may be
   interchangeable and used in that embodiment.
   [0012]      In an embodiment, the polymers of the invention do not contain any metal
   materials or metal components or elements but still exhibit suitable radiopacity for
   clinical viewing using conventional imaging systems. Clinicians are commonly
15 challenged by obscuring artifacts from metal and metal based implanted devices
   when attempting to image using either CT scan (Computed Tomography) or MRI
   (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). The significance of the artifact is typically based
   upon the amount of metal content and can be so excessive as to inhibit the ability to
   clinically image the device. This situation can require an alternative means to
20 clinically evaluate the patient or device (e.g. angiogram, etc.) which may not only be
   more costly, but more invasive and risky to the patient. As such, a non-metallic,
   radiopaque polymer reflects a significant advantage and differentiation from other
   approaches for radiopaque devices. In an embodiment, a device disclosed contains
   metal. In one aspect, a device disclosed contains metal in the form of marker bands,
25 as conventionally used for visualization. In one aspect, the devices disclosed
   comprise platinum-iridium or gold marker bands, as known in the art. As known in
   the art, "marker bands" may be used to achieve a specific product requirement, such
   as demarcation of an edge of the device or alignment of two devices for proper use,
   for example. The use of marker bands is optional with the devices described herein.
30 [0013]      The compositions and compounds disclosed comprise a radiopaque
   functionality. In an aspect, the radiopaque functionality is one or more iodine atoms.
                                                6

    WO 2014/124225                                                        PCT/US2014/015250
   In an aspect, the radiopaque functionality is one or more Br or Bi atoms. In an
   embodiment, the compositions and compounds of the invention include covalently
   bound heavy atoms such as iodine. In this embodiment, the distribution of iodine or
   other radiopaque functionality within the polymer is sufficiently homogeneous so as
 5 to be efficacious for imaging applications.
   [0014]     In an embodiment, the polymers of the present invention are sufficiently
   amorphous that some conventional analysis methods do not indicate the presence of
   residual amounts of crystallinity. In an embodiment, the polymers described herein
   are not sufficiently crystalline as to cause devices incorporating the polymers to be
10 inoperative in the desired uses. In general, if shape memory polymers are
   semicrystalline, shape change can be hindered and slowed, and device performance
   can become clinically undesirable. The crystallinity of the shape memory polymer
   and non-shape memory polymers described here can be affected by the selection of
   the components used to form the polymer, as further described herein.
15 [0015]     In an embodiment, the glass transition temperature and rubbery modulus of
   the polymers of the present invention can be adjusted independently, as further
   described herein.
   [0016]     In an embodiment, the invention provides a polymer which has sufficient
   resistance to water absorption that it can be used to fabricate medical devices or
20 device components for use in a physiological environment with exposure to body
   fluid(s).  In an embodiment, the medical devices or device components show little
   change in their mechanical properties or degradation of their mechanical integrity
   during the useful lifetime of the device. In an embodiment, the devices and
   compositions described here are useful for permanent (or long-term) implantation or
25 use in a biological system. In an embodiment, devices or device components
   formed using the polymer compositions of the invention exhibit a water uptake of
   less than 1.0% by weight over a 24 hour period. In an embodiment, devices or
   device components formed using the polymer compositions of the invention exhibit a
   water uptake of less than 0.5% by weight over a 24 hour period.

   [0017]     In one embodiment, the invention provides a polymer composition
   comprising a crosslinked polymer network, the network comprising a first repeating
   unit derived from a monofunctional radiopaque monomer and a second repeating
   unit derived from a multifunctional non-radiopaque monomer wherein neither the first
 5 nor the second monomer is fluorinated. The first repeating unit may be derived from
   the monomer of any of Formulas 8, 8-A, 8-B, 8-C, 13, 13-A, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18.      In
   an embodiment, the second monomer is a multifunctional "hydrophobic" crosslinking
   monomer that imparts enhanced biodurability properties. In an embodiment, the
   crosslinking monomer is other than poly(ethylene glycol) di(meth)acrylate (PEGDA
10 or PEGDMA). The multifunctional crosslinker molecule may have two or more
   polymerizable functional groups, such as acrylate groups. The second repeating unit
   may be derived from the monomer of any of formulas 9, 9-A, 9-B, 9-C, or 19. In
   different embodiments, the polymer composition may include repeating units derived
   from one or more monofunctional iodinated and/or non-iodinated co-monomers
15 and/or one or more multifunctional crosslinking monomers.        In an embodiment, the
   amount of the first repeating unit derived from the radiopaque monomer may be from
   15wt% to 35 wt% or 20-30 wt% of the polymer composition, while the amount of the
   repeating unit(s) derived from the crosslinking monomer(s) may be from 85wt% to 65
   wt% or 80-70 wt% of the monomer mixture. In an embodiment, the relative amount
20 of the repeating units in the network derived from each type of monomer is the same
   as the relative amount of the respective monomers in the monomer mixture.
   [0018]     In an embodiment, the crosslinked network is characterized by covalent
   bonding between said first repeating unit and said second repeating unit such that
   the second repeating unit forms the crosslinking of the crosslinked network.
25 [0019]     In an embodiment, the iodinated monomer contains an average of between
   1 to 4, 2 to 4 or 3 to 4 iodine atoms per repeating unit. In an embodiment, the first
   repeating unit is an acrylate ester of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid. In an embodiment,
   the second monomer is a multifunctional "hydrophobic" crosslinking monomer. In an
   embodiment, the crosslinking monomer is other than poly(ethylene glycol)
30 di(meth)acrylate (PEGDA or PEGDMA). The multifunctional crosslinker molecule
   may have two or more polymerizable functional groups, such as acrylate groups. In

   different embodiments, the polymer composition may include repeating units derived
   from one or more monofunctional iodinated and/or non-iodinated co-monomers
   and/or one or more multifunctional crosslinking monomers. In different
   embodiments, there is more than one crosslinking monomer used in the compounds
 5 and compositions provided. In an embodiment, a crosslinking monomer is
   polycarbonate diacrylate. In an embodiment, a crosslinking monomer is decanediol
   diacrylate. In an embodiment, a crosslinking monomer has a polymer backbone that
   causes the structure to have the characteristics of an elastomer, a reinforced plastic,
   or any other polymer backbone capable of producing a desirable functional outcome
10 for the final crosslinked product. In an embodiment, a crosslinking monomer is
   multifunctional.
   [0020]     Use of monomers with different chemical structures and amounts thereof
   can be used to suppress formation of crystalline regions in the polymer. In an
   embodiment, the monomers are selected for phase compatibility in the liquid and
15 solid state. Phase compatibility of the monomers can facilitate random incorporation
   of the monomer units during free radical polymerization and homogeneity in the
   resulting polymer.

   catheter or other delivery device, the material may already transition to its rubbery
   state in the delivery device. This can allow achievement of a more rapid response
   (elastic response) from the device after delivery (e.g. in the vessel). The polymer
   composition may be a shape memory polymer having a glass transition temperature
15 (Tg) between 15     0C to 75 0C and a rubbery modulus between 0.1 MPa and 500 MPa

   polymer exhibits a glass transition temperature (Tg) and a Tan Delta (Loss
   Modulus/Storage Modulus ratio) curve related to temperature; the polymer's
   maximum rate of shape change occurs at an environmental operating temperature

   [0046]     As used herein, a crosslinked network is a polymer composition comprising
   a plurality of polymer chains wherein a large portion (e.g.,     80%) and optionally all
15 the polymer chains are interconnected, for example via covalent crosslinking, to form
   a single polymer composition. In an embodiment, the invention provides a
   radiopaque polymer in the form of a crosslinked network in which at least some of
   the crosslinks of the network structure are formed by covalent bonds. Radiopacity
   refers to the relative inability of electromagnetism, particularly X-rays, to pass
20 through dense materials. The two main factors contributing to a material's
   radiopacity are density and atomic number of the radiopaque element. In an
   embodiment, this invention utilizes incorporated (trapped) iodine molecules within
   the polymer matrix to induce radiopaque functionality. In an embodiment, the
   radiopaque polymer is an iodinated polymer. As referred to herein, iodinated
25 polymers are produced by incorporating (trapping) iodine molecules on a select
   monomer prior to formulation of the monomer into a polymer. In different
   embodiments, the concentration of iodine in the radiopaque polymer is at least 200
   or at least 300 mg/mm 3. Although iodine is used in some examples and descriptions
                                                22

    WO 2014/124225                                                       PCT/US2014/015250
   herein, it is recognized that other radiopaque materials may be used, such as Bi and
   Br and that the descriptions here apply to and may be used with other radiopaque
   materials.
   [0047]     In an embodiment, the iodinated crosslinked polymers of the invention are
 5 formed by the polymerization of a monomer mixture comprising an iodinated
   monofunctional monomer, a multifunctional crosslinking monomer, and an initiator.
   The monomer mixture may also comprise one or more additional iodinated
   monofunctional monomers, one or more additional crosslinking monomers, and/or
   one or more additional monofunctional monomers. As used herein, "monofunctional"
10 refers to a monomer containing only one polymerizable group, while "multifunctional"
   refers to a monomer containing more than one polymerizable group. Upon
   polymerization, the monomers in the monomer mixture contribute constitutional units
   to the network, with each constitutional unit being an atom or group of atoms (with
   pendant atoms or groups, if any) comprising a part of the essential structure of a
15 macromolecule, an oligomer molecule, a block or a chain. Since the constitutional
   units typically appear multiple times in the network, they may also be termed
   repeating units. Repeating units derived from a given type of monomer need not be
   located adjacent to one another in the network or in a given sequence in the
   network. In an embodiment, the monofunctional iodinated monomer comprises an
20 acrylate polymerizable group. In another embodiment, the monofunctional iodinated
   monomer comprises a styrene, acrylamide, or methacrylamide polymerizable group.
   In an embodiment, the polymerizable group is an end group. In an embodiment, the
   polymer compositions further comprise repeating units derived from a
   monofunctional iodinated monomer comprising a styrene, acrylamide or
25 methacrylamide polymerizable group.
   [0048]     As used herein, an iodinated monomer comprises an iodine-containing
   moiety. In an embodiment, the iodinated monomer comprises an iodine-containing
   moiety which is an iodinated aryl or heteroaryl group. In an embodiment, the iodine
   containing moiety is C5-C30 aryl or C5-C30 heteroaryl having at least 1 iodine atom. In
30 an embodiment, the iodine-containing moiety is C5-C3o aryl or C5-C30 heteroaryl
   having at least 2 iodine atoms. In an embodiment, the iodine-containing moiety is

   C5-C30  aryl or C5-C30 heteroaryl having at least 3 iodine atoms. In an embodiment,
   the iodine-containing moiety is C6 aryl with iodine atoms attached directly to the ring,

   description herein can be used for embodiments using Br or Bi as radiopaque

   [0056]     In an embodiment, use of two iodinated monomers with related but different

   and/or the number or arrangement of iodine atoms on the aryl ring.
   [0057]     The crosslinking monomer, in combination with the other monomers in the
   mixture, allows formation of a crosslinked network. The structure and amount of
15 crosslinker(s) in the monomer mixture may be selected to provide a sufficiently high
   crosslink density to achieve the desired modulus in the composition. In different
   embodiments, the molecular weight of the crosslinker is in the range from 200 to
   1000, 200 to 2000 or 200-5000, or any other useful molecular weight range. Blends
   of crosslinkers can allow shorter and longer crosslinkers to be used together.

   [0068]     An optional monofunctional non-radiopaque co-monomer can be used to
   adjust the properties of the polymer. For example, the co-monomer can be used to
   modify the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer. As another example,
   the co-monomer can be selected to assist in system compatibilization.
 5 [0069]     In an embodiment, the non-radiopaque co-monomer is a vinyl monomer. A
   wide range of commercially-available vinyl monomers can be utilized, including but
   not limited to butyl acrylate, which imparts a Tg value near -40 0C. Such a low glass
   transition temperature can help to offset the typically higher Tg contribution of
   radiopaque monomer and crosslinkers having relatively low molecular weight values.
10 The amenability of a wide cross section of vinyl monomers to polymerization or
   copolymerization by a free radical mechanism facilitates access to useful structure
   property modifications.
   [0070]     In an embodiment, the monofunctional non-radiopaque co-monomer
   comprises an acrylate polymerizable group. In another embodiment, the
15 monofunctional co-monomer comprises a styrene, acrylamide, or methacrylamide
   polymerizable group. In an embodiment, the polymerizable group is an end group.
   Though styrene monomers typically do not polymerize as aggressively and to as
   high a conversion as acrylates, in copolymerization reactions with acrylates styrene
   monomers propagate more readily and can be used to good advantage where
20 required. In different embodiments, the amount of comonomer may be from 2.5-90
   wt%, 5-80 wt%,10-80 wt%, 20-90 wt%, 2.5-10 wt%, 5-50 wt%, 5-25 wt%, 25-50

   As will be understood, any permutation of the components that produces a functional

   [0088]     A wide range of free radical initiating systems may be used for
   polymerization. In different embodiments, the initiator may be a photoinitiator, a
30 thermal initiator or a redox (reduction oxidation) initiator. Photoinitiating systems are
   particularly useful, provided that a photoinitiator is chosen that does not require
                                                48

   wavelengths of light that are absorbed excessively by the base monomer ingredients
   of the formulation.     Irgacure 819 (Ciba (BASF), Bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)
   phenylphosphineoxide) is one example of a photoinitiator that has been found to be
   particularly useful for the curing system.
 5 [0089]      Photopolymerization occurs when monomer solution is exposed to light of
   sufficient power and of a wavelength capable of initiating polymerization. The
   wavelengths and power of light useful to initiate polymerization depends on the
   initiator used. Light used in the invention includes any wavelength and power
   capable of initiating polymerization. Preferred wavelengths of light include
10 ultraviolet. In different embodiments, the light source primarily provides light having
   a wavelength from 200 to 500 nm or from 200 to 400 nm.           In an embodiment, 1-100
   mW/cm 2 of 200-500nm light is applied for a time from 10 sec to 60 mins. Any
   suitable source may be used, including laser sources. The source may be filtered to
   the desired wavelength band. The source may be broadband or narrowband, or a
15 combination. The light source may provide continuous or pulsed light during the
   process.
   [0090]      Thermal initiating systems, with low-temperature or high-temperature
   initiators, common examples being benzoyl peroxide and azobisisobutyronitrile
   (AIBN), are also useful in situations where a particularly large or irregularly-shaped
20 object that is difficult to illuminate uniformly is to be prepared. Also of use in the
   latter scenario are free radical initiating systems that produce free radicals by any
   type of redox reaction, such as the Fenton system involving ferrous salts with tert
   butyl hydroperoxide, or other metal-organic, organic such as triethylamine     +
   hydroperoxides, or photo-organic redox systems, an example of the latter being the
25 Eosin-Y + triethanolamine visible light initiating system.
   [0091]      A number of pseudo-living free radical polymerization systems, some of
   which are capable of producing polymers with narrower molecular weight
   distributions than conventional free radical polymerizations, are also described in the
   art and can be amenable to production of crosslinker segments for SMPs or for SMP
30 curing. For example, styrene monomers that polymerize to low conversion in a
                                                  49

   conventional system may be driven to high conversion in a pseudo-living system.
   These pseudo-living systems typically involve variable combinations of reversible
   chain propagation-termination and/or chain transfer steps. "Living" free radical
   polymerizations known to the art include, but are not limited to, NMP, RAFT, and
 5 ATRP.
   [0092]     Additionally; any other type of non-conventional free radical polymerization
   process, whether pseudo-living or not, that produces free radicals capable of
   initiating polymerization of the radiopaque and non-radiopaque monomers and
   crosslinkers comprising the SMPs of this invention, fall within the scope of potential
10 initiating-polymerization methods. These and other free radical initiating systems are
   conceivable and known to those skilled in the art.
   [0093]      In embodiments, examples of the useful initiating systems include anionic,
   cationic, free radical polymerizations that are non-living, pseudo-living or living as
   well as Ziegler-Natta and olefin metathesis. The use of these systems is known in
15 the art. In an embodiment, these systems are useful if a prepolymerized segment is
   at least difunctional and has hydroxyl or other groups known in the art which can be
   used to attach polymerizable groups, including acrylate groups in an embodiment.
   [0094]      In an embodiment, some or all of the components of the monomer mixture
   are combined at a temperature greater than ambient temperature. In different
20 embodiments, the initiator may be added at the same time as the monomer
   components or added just prior to or at the time of molding. In another embodiment
   where a thermal initiator is used, the monomer mixture ingredients may be divided
   into two parts; wherein the high storage temperature ingredients are in Part A, and
   the lower storage temperature ingredients are in Part B. The thermal initiator may be
25 added to the lower storage temperature ingredients in Part B at a storage
   temperature that is below the initiator's polymerization temperature. In an
   embodiment, forming the monomer mixture (or a portion of the monomer mixture) at
   greater than ambient temperature can assist in maintaining solubility of the monomer
   mixture components, thereby enabling formation of a homogenous mixture.

   [0095]     In an embodiment, the monomer mixture is held at a temperature greater
   than ambient temperature during free radical polymerization. In an embodiment, the
   monomer mixture is held a temperature between 65'C and 150'C or from 65'C and
   100C during the polymerization step. In an embodiment, a pre-cure step is
 5 performed in a vacuum environment. In separate embodiments, the curing step is
   performed using free radical, anionic, cationic, Diels-alder, thiol-ene,
   polycondensation, or other mechanisms known in the art. During molding, pressure
   may be applied during polymerization to ensure mold filling.
   [0096]     In an embodiment, an additional curing or heat treatment step is employed
10 after the polymerization step (e.g. after photopolymerization). In an embodiment, the
   cured parts are removed from the mold and then undergo additional curing

   [00103] As used herein, a crystalline material displays long range order. The
   crystallinity of polymers is characterized by their degree of crystallinity, or weight or
20 volume fraction of crystalline material in the sample ranging from zero for a
   completely non-crystalline polymer to one for a theoretical completely crystalline
   polymer.
   [00104] Ifa polymer is semicrystalline, shape change can be hindered and slowed,
   and performance of devices incorporating the polymer can become clinically
25 unacceptable. In an embodiment, the polymer compositions of the invention are
   considered substantially amorphous. As used herein, substantially amorphous is
   defined as the absence of crystalline features as detected by differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), or by inconsistency and lack of reproducibility in mechanical
   tensile test results, e.g. stress-strain curve at a fixed temperature. In an
                                                54

    WO 2014/124225                                                         PCT/US2014/015250
   embodiment, lack of reproducibility may be indicated by reproducibility of less than
   95% at 95% confidence interval. A substantially amorphous polymer may
   incorporate relatively small amounts of crystallinity. As is typical of amorphous
   polymers, the substantially amorphous polymer compositions of the invention show a
 5 transition from a glassy state to a rubbery state over a glass transition temperature
   range. Crystallinity can be reduced or eliminated by reducing the concentration of
   specific monomers that enhance this condition, and/or by introducing dissimilar
   structures to ensure that the polymer's molecular structure doesn't align during
   polymerization to result in crystallinity.
10 [00105] In an embodiment, the monomers (including crosslinking monomers) used
   to form the radiopaque polymer are selected to assure compatibility (e.g.
   homogeneity after polymerization). In an embodiment, the radiopaque polymer is
   sufficiently homogenous in terms of solid-phase compatibility of the polymerized
   units and in the sufficiently random incorporation of units throughout polymerization
15 to obtain the desired performance characteristics. Phase incompatibility can lead to
   voids in the polymer morphology. Voids in the polymer matrix compromise
   mechanical performance and can lead to uptake of water and other fluids that
   displace the generated void volume, even when the incompatible phases are
   hydrophobic or even "water-repellant." Excessively non-random incorporation of
20 comonomers, especially diacrylate or other polyacrylate crosslinkers, as
   polymerization proceeds from low conversion to high conversion can lead to a non
   uniform crosslink density, with regions of higher (brittle) and lower (rubbery) crosslink
   density.
   [00106] In an embodiment, the radiopaque polymer is homogenous enough that
25 repeatable results (95% reproducible data at 95% confidence interval) can be
   obtained in a simple ultimate tensile test at a fixed temperature.    In an embodiment,
   homogeneity of the polymer may be improved by selection of the components of the
   monomer solution to reduce phase separation in the liquid or solid state. In addition,
   the monomer components and polymerization technique may be selected to facilitate
30 random incorporation of monomer and crosslinker groups by free radical
   polymerization during the cure. In an embodiment, the same type of polymerizable
                                               55

    WO 2014/124225                                                          PCT/US2014/015250
   groups is present in each of the monomers. For example, for monomers (and
   crosslinking monomers) having acrylate polymerizable groups and aliphatic
   hydrocarbon linkers, the inductive effect exerted upon the acrylate group by the
   typically aliphatic linker attachments is expected to be similar.
 5 [00107] In many applications, biodurability can be defined as durability for the
   period of time necessary to assure that the body has overcome the need of the
   device's function, e.g. a fallopian tube occlusion device that relies upon scar tissue
   formation to close the lumen no longer needs the device to generate scar tissue
   once the lumen is fully closed. If that period of time is 90 days, for example, then the
10 biodurable life of the device can be this value plus a suitable safety factor used in the
   design. Biodurability then is the ability of the device, and its material, to withstand
   the environmental challenges at its location of placement in the body, e.g. if in the
   bloodstream, it must withstand a bloody environment. In an embodiment, the
   radiopaque polymer is not biodegradable within the desired lifetime of the medical
15 device. In another embodiment, the radiopaque polymer is not biodegradable within
   three years. In an embodiment, the non-biodegradable polymer does not include
   aromatic groups other than those present in naturally occurring amino acid. In an
   embodiment, the non-biodegradable polymer does not contain esters that are readily
   hydrolyzed at physiological pH and temperature.
20 [00108] For almost all locations within the body, one of the several primary
   mechanisms of degradation can be caused by absorption of water or moisture.
   Whether the environment contains interstitial fluids, blood, saliva, urine, bile,
   intracranial fluid, etc., these environments are aqueous based. If the device or its
   material absorbs water, the material properties and device dimensions can change
25 due to swelling, or the device function can be affected, such as the autogenesis of
   an errant electrical path, or the material properties can degrade causing the device
   to weaken or break apart. Therefore a primary consideration for biodurability of an
   implanted device is the device and all of its material's ability to not absorb water.
   [00109] In an embodiment, water uptake, or water absorption, can change the
30 device's characteristics or detrimentally affect the device's performance over its
                                                56

    WO 2014/124225                                                          PCT/US2014/015250
   intended life. In an embodiment, medical devices fabricated from the polymers of
   the invention will exhibit minimal water uptake. The water uptake can be measured
   over a test period equivalent to the lifetime or the device or can be measured over a
   shorter screening period. In an embodiment, the extent of water uptake is <1% by
 5 weight over 24 hours. For devices which exhibit water uptake of greater than 1% by
   weight over 24 hours, typically continuous exposure results in material changes such
   as brittleness and eventual mechanical failure in standard testing.
   [00110] The minimal level of iodine concentration needed to achieve sufficient
   radiopacity to provide clinically acceptable imaging may be determined empirically.
10 In an embodiment, evaluation of identically sized devices formulated from polymers
   using different weight percentages of iodinated monomer can be compared under
   simulated clinical use conditions. Using physicians' subjective review and correlating
   their opinion with the results from an image analysis program, such as Image J, to
   quantify signal levels, clinically imaging quality is correlated with iodine
15 concentration. The result is a determination of the minimum iodine concentration to
   assure acceptable image quality. In an embodiment, the minimum iodine
   concentration value was established at 511 mg/cm 3. In an embodiment, the
   minimum iodine concentration value is above 200 mg/cm 3. In an embodiment, the
   iodine concentration value is between 50 and 600 mg/cm 3. As is recognized in the
20 art, the radiopaque atom incorporation range for suitable visualization is dependent
   on the configuration of the device. In an embodiment, the first repeating unit
   contains the radiopaque atom(s) and is present in an amount of above 15 wt% of the
   network. In an embodiment, the first repeating unit contains the radiopaque atom(s)
   and is present in an amount of above 20 wt% of the network. In an embodiment, the
25 first repeating unit contains the radiopaque atom(s) and is present in an amount of
   above 30 wt% of the network. In an embodiment, any incorporation of radiopaque
   moieties that produces a functional product can be used. As described elsewhere,
   the radiopaque atom(s) can include atoms other than iodine, including bromine or
   bismuth.
30 [00111] In another embodiment, the signal obtained from a radiopaque polymer
   device may be compared with that of a platinum device of similar dimensions. In an

   [00112] Any polymer that can recover an original shape from a temporary shape by
 5 application of a stimulus such as temperature is considered a shape memory
   polymer (SM P). The original shape is set by processing and the temporary shape is
   set by thermo-mechanical deformation. A SMP has the ability to recover large
   deformation upon heating. Shape memory functionality can be utilized to develop
   medical devices that can be introduced into the body in a less invasive form, wherein
10 the pre-deployed, or temporary, shape is intentionally smaller, or thinner, resulting in
   a lower profile and a smaller opening (smaller catheter or incision) to introduce the
   device into the patient than would otherwise be required without the shape change
   functionality. Then, when stimulated by temperature, typically body temperature but
   can also be greater than body temperature, the device undergoes shape recovery to
15 return to its permanent, larger form.
   [00113] A polymer is a SMP if the original shape of the polymer is recovered by
   heating it above a shape recovery temperature, or deformation temperature (Td),
   even if the original molded shape of the polymer is destroyed mechanically at a
   lower temperature than Td, or if the memorized shape is recoverable by application
20 of another stimulus. Any polymer that can recover an original shape from a
   temporary shape by application of a stimulus such as temperature may be
   considered a SMP.
   [00114] From a biomedical device perspective, there are characteristics that are
   considered favorable in device design. They are quantified in terms of stimuli (such
25 as temperature) driven response, well-defined response temperature, modulus, and
   elongation. In an embodiment, the thermomechanical properties of the shape
   memory polymer used to form the device are optimized for one or more of the
   following: Rubbery modulus (Erub), Glass transition temperature (Tg), and Speed of
   recovery (S).

    WO 2014/124225                                                           PCT/US2014/015250
   [00115] The preferred ranges of rubbery modulus can be different for different
   applications. The range of moduli of biological tissue can vary from 20 GPa (bone)
   to 1 kPa (eye) In an embodiment, the rubbery modulus is between 0.1MPa and 15
   MPa at 370C. In an embodiment, the rubbery modulus is between 0.1 MPa and 50
 5 MPa for the flexible state and between 0.1 to 500 MPa for the rigid state at 370C.
   Any rubbery modulus value that produces a functional product can be used. By
   polymer formulation adjustments, the SMP's modulus, e.g. stiffness, can be
   established as very soft, on the order of 0.1 MPa. In one embodiment, for use as a
   device such as an embolic coil, this soft material enhances compaction of the coil
10 pack, shortening the resulting pack for easier placement and ultimately increasing
   the speed of occlusion. Through other formulations, a higher value can be achieved
   for the SMP's modulus, such as 15MPa, to enhance stiffness. In another
   embodiment, stiffer SMPs can be used to form a tube stent wherein localized
   stiffness is used to generate outward radial force against a vessel wall when
15 deployed which is required for retention.
   [00116] In an embodiment, the polymers are selected based on the desired glass
   transition temperature(s) (if at least one segment is amorphous) taking into
   consideration the environment of use.        In one method, the polymer transition
   temperature is tailored to allow recovery at the body temperature, Tr ~ Tg ~ 37 0C (A.
20 Lendlein and R. Langer, "Biodegradable, elastic shape-memory polymers for
   potential biomedical applications." Science, vol. 296, pp. 1673-1676, 2002). The
   distinct advantage of this approach is the utilization of the body's thermal energy to
   naturally activate the material. The disadvantage of this approach, for some
   applications, is that the mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness) of the material are
25 strongly dependent on Tg, and can be difficult to alter in the device design process.
   In particular, it would be difficult to design an extremely stiff device when the polymer
   Tg is close to the body temperature due to the compliant nature of the polymer.
   Another possible disadvantage is that the required storage temperature, Ts, of a
   shape memory polymer with Tg ~ 37         0C will typically be below room temperature
30 requiring "cold" storage prior to deployment. In different embodiments, the glass
   transition temperature of the SMP of the present invention as determined from the
                                                 59

    WO 2014/124225                                                         PCT/US2014/015250
   peak of tan 6 is from 10 C to 75 C, 20 C to 50 0C, from 25 C to 50 0C, or from
   30 0C to 45 0C. In different embodiments, the glass transition temperature may be
   below body temperature (e.g. 25-35 OC ), near body temperature (32-42 0C) or
   above body temperature (40-500C). Any Tg value that produces a functional product
 5 can be used.
   [00117] The storage modulus of at least partially non-crystalline polymers
   decreases in the glass transition region. DMA results highlight the changes that
   occur as the material is heated from its storage temperature (T ) to its response
   temperature ( T,) and above. Figure 1 illustrate curves for storage modulus (E') and
10 Tan Delta (ratio of the material's Loss Modulus (E") to Storage Modulus (E'))
   obtained from dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) curve of an SMP formulation.
   This curve illustrates the recovery temperature (Tr), the glass transition temperature
   (Tg), the operating temperature (To) and Tan Delta Peak. Several methods may be
   used for determining the glass transition temperature; these include the peak or
15 onset of the tan delta curve and the onset of the drop in the storage modulus. The
   width of the tan A peak is an indication of the breadth of the glass transition region.
   In an embodiment, the glass transition temperature is in the specified ranges and the
   full width of the tan A peak at half maximum is from 10-30 0C or from 10-20 0C. The
   glass transition temperature determined by DMA is frequency dependent and
20 generally increases with increasing frequency. In an embodiment, the measurement
   frequency is 1 Hz. The glass transition temperature may also depend upon the
   heating rate and the applied stresses or strains. Other methods of measuring the
   glass transition temperature include thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); TMA and DSC are heating rate dependent.
25 [00118] Typically, for each medical device application that incorporates shape
   recovery, the clinician is anticipating relatively rapid and repeatable shape recovery.
   In an embodiment, the shape memory polymer devices of the invention produce
   shape recovery that is fast enough to be detected, completes in a reasonable
   (intraoperative) time, and repeatable from one device to another. In an embodiment,
30 the shape recovery time can be measured in use or from a screening procedure.
                                                 60

    WO 2014/124225                                                        PCT/US2014/015250
   The shape recovery time can be measured either from release to 100% recovery or
   from release to a predetermined amount of recovery.
   [00119] The rate of shape change correlates with the rate of storage modulus
   change on the DMA curve between the operating temperature and Tr. For SMPs,
 5 rate of shape change can be primarily affected by the temperature difference
   between To, the operating temperature (external heating or body core temperature if
   self actuated), and the polymer's Tg (derived from the formulation).    To is typically set
   above Tr. Typically, a larger difference between these temperatures will produce a
   faster rate of change up to an inherent rate limit, or asymptote of the change rate, of
10 the material and device. This limit can be identified by monitoring shape change
   response time at different temperatures and plotting this relationship. Typically, the
   amount of response time decreases until it reaches an asymptote. The
   corresponding To reflects the lowest, optimum temperature for the fastest rate of
   shape change for that material. Increasing the temperature above this point does
15 not induce further reductions in the shape change recover time, e.g. does not further
   increase the rate of shape change (refer to Figure 2). In an embodiment this inherent
   limit, or asymptote begins when To is set at the temperature at which the Tan Delta
   curve is about 60% of its maximum value (refer to Figures 1 and 2, when To is set
   above the material's Tg ). In an embodiment, the polymer's maximum rate of shape
20 change occurs at an environmental operating temperature (To) that is coincident with
   the temperature above Tg at which the material's Tan Delta value is equal to 60% of
   its peak value. The device may be designed so that this optimum temperature is at a
   useful operating temperature for the device (e.g. at body temperature or another
   preselected temperature).
25 [00120] In an embodiment, the device is operated at a temperature which is the
   lowest temperature at which no further increase in shape change rate is seen. In
   another embodiment, the device is operated at a temperature which is within +/- 5- C
   of this optimum temperature.

   [00122] In general, the ability of the device (whether technically shape memory or
   not) to change conformation or configuration (e.g. to expand) is made possible by
15 manufacturing a device having a first conformation or configuration (initial
   configuration) and, thereafter configuring the device into a second conformation or
   configuration (temporary or storage configuration), wherein this configuration is at
   least partially reversible upon the occurrence of a triggering event. After the
   triggering event, the device assumes a third configuration. In an embodiment, the
20 third configuration (deployed configuration) is substantially similar to the first
   configuration. However, for an implanted medical device, the device may be
   constrained from assuming its initial shape (first configuration). In an embodiment,
   the device is capable of self-expansion to the desired dimensions under
   physiological conditions.
25 [00123] The invention can provide a variety of radiopaque polymer devices for
   medical applications, these devices incorporating the polymer compositions of the
   invention. The devices of the invention can be non-metallic. In different
   embodiments, these devices can be for purposes of an indwelling, permanent
   implant to provide the function of: opening, or maintaining an open anatomical
30 lumen; closing an anatomical lumen, either partially as a valve, or complete lumen
   occlusion for any physiological fluid or gas flow or for a applied therapeutic fluid or
                                              62

   gas flow; support of an anatomical structure to assist in therapeutic restoration of an
   organ, vascular, digestive, excrement, or airway function; support of an anatomical
   structure to assist in therapeutic restoration of an orthopaedic, maxillofacial, spinal,
   joint or other skeletal or function; to support hemostasis by covering an area inside
 5 the body after tissue dissection or resection, a patch, such as for hemostasis of the
   liver, or other organ, In other embodiments, these devices can be used for purposes
   of a diagnostic or therapeutic instrument or device to provide the function of: a
   catheter for the purposes of accessing an anatomical location; delivering another
   device and/or therapeutic agent; or controlling the access or delivery of another
10 device and/or therapeutic agent; a temporarily indwelling device to provide a limited
   time therapeutic benefit, such as a vena cava filter that is placed in a vessel, left
   indwelling for a period of time, for example to capture blood clots, and subsequently
   removed when the therapeutic period is completed.
   [00124] In one embodiment for neurovascular cases, wherein intracranial
15 aneurysms are repaired, current state of care may use very fine metal (platinum)
   based embolic coils delivered into the aneurysm sack to fill this space and effect an
   isolation of the weakened vessel wall from the parent vessel thereby reducing the
   risk of rupture and stroke. However, because of the metallic nature of these devices,
   two deficiencies typically occur: 1. Approximately 25% of these patients must return
20 for retreatment as the aneurysm continues to grow, and 2. To diagnose the need for
   retreatment, many of these patients must have an invasive angiogram (contrast
   injection) of the aneurysm area under fluoroscopy to be able to visualize the
   condition given that the metal coil materials are not compatible with MRI or CT Scan
   imaging modalities. A non-metallic, radiopaque SMP embolic device for aneurysm
25 repair does not suffer this limitation in imaging capability    Although the
   description herein contains many specificities, these should not be construed as
   limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the
   presently preferred embodiments of the invention. For example, thus the scope of
   the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their equivalents,
30 rather than by the examples given.

   EXAMPLE 1: Water Uptake of Radiolpaque SMPs with Hydrolphilic and Hydrophobic
   Crosslinkers
   [00134] All polymers tested included the iodinated monomer of Formula 15 (TIA).
20 Compositions with hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) (MW
   550 and 1000) or poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGIDA) (MW 575 and 700)
   crosslinkers were demonstrated to result in water absorption in test samples of more
   than 1% by weight in a 24 hour period. Subsequent continuous exposure resulted in
   material changes such as brittleness and eventual mechanical failure in standard
25 testing. Conversely, in a different embodiment, use of hydrophobic crosslinker or
   crosslinkers, such as poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTHF) or the monomer of formula 9 with
   R9 being C10 (Cl 0-DA), was demonstrated to result in very low water absorption,
   below 1% by weight in a 24 hour period. Similarly, these materials incorporating
   hydrophobic crosslinkers have shown negligible deterioration with continued
30 exposure to an aqueous environment.

   EXAMPLE 2: DSC Measurements on a Radioipaque SMP
   [00135] Figure 3 illustrates a DSC curve for a radiopaque SMP formulation
   employing "TIA" monomer (Formula 15) and decanedioldiacryalate (DDA)
   crosslinker. Figure 3 indicates that no crystalline features were observed in the
 5 scan.
   EXAMPLE 3: Exemplary Radiopaque Polymer Devices
   [00136] Shape memory polymer devices and other non-shape memory polymer
   devices of the invention can incorporate material formulations that utilize a suitable
   glass transition temperature within a range about body core temperature. To
10 achieve different performance requirements, the polymer's Tg may be intentionally
   suppressed below body temperature resulting in shape change occurrence
   immediately upon release from any physical constriction.
   [00137]   In one embodiment, an SMP with a Tg of 250C has been utilized to
   accelerate the rate of shape change of an embolic coil upon expulsion from a small
15 lumen catheter. One form of embolic devices forms a large curl of 10mm in diameter
   but is constructed of an SMP wire that is only 0.032" in diameter. The wire can be
   formed into a pre-deployed curled shape that is straightened to allow delivery of
   these devices in a small diameter catheter (<5fr). When deployed into the blood
   stream, these devices recovered their curl shape to effectively occlude a 9mm
20 vessel, with the 1mm oversize assuring sufficient radial force from the material
   modulus and deflection to provide effective anchoring so that the embolic device
   doesn't migrate under the influence of blood flow in the vessel. Figures 4a-b show
   images embolic coils exit from very thin, single lumen catheters to form an occlusive
   mass much larger than the diameter of the coil. Figure 4a shows the coil after initial
25 entry. Figure 4b shows the coil after deployment.
   [00138] Likewise, the polymer's Tg may be set above body temperature wherein an
   external heating device is used to provide the physician with a discretionary shape
   change function. In another embodiment, an SMP with a Tg of 500C has been used
   to place and accurately position a tube stent within an anatomical lumen.
30 Maintaining its low profile, predeployed temporary shape benefits the physician's
                                              67

    WO 2014/124225                                                          PCT/US2014/015250
   ability to move and accurately locate the device prior to deployment. When held in
   the desired position, the device is heated to its Tr by flushing with warmed saline
   irrigation which causes shape recovery to occur to the stent's permanent shape.
   [00139] Yet, another embodiment is the use of an SMP with an elevated Tg of 420C
 5 (just above body core temperature) that is used as a clasp for retaining a deployed
   device. In its permanent shape, the clasp is open, in its temporary shape, the clasp
   is closed. The clasp connects a device, such as a vena cava filter, the filter itself
   may be made from a different SMP, to a delivery guidewire that contains electrical
   conductors joined to a heating element adjacent to the clasp. With the SMP clasp
10 closed in its temporary shape (below Tg), the device is advanced into the
   bloodstream. Upon reaching its desired position, the clasp is heated through an
   external low voltage passing down the conductors and through the heating element.
   Upon the temperature reaching Tr, the clasp opens to its recovered, permanent
   shape, releasing the vena cava filter.
15 [00140]    In yet another embodiment, an SMP with an elevated Tg of 420C (just
   above body core temperature) is used within a section of a mono-directional
   catheter. The catheter section is formed with a permanent curved shape to allow
   specific direction of the tip of the catheter. As a straight catheter is easier to
   manipulate into position, the temporary shape is straight but not necessarily stiff.
20 Upon entry into the body, below Tg, the straight catheter is easily manipulated to a
   target location wherein it is warmed by an externally heated, internal delivery wire, or
   by warmed saline solution flushed through the catheter. Upon the material
   temperature reaching Tr, the catheter section curls, returning to its recovered,
   permanent shape, providing specific direction for the catheter tip during use.
25 Meanwhile, the curvature is not so stiff as to preclude simply retrieving the catheter
   after use.

   using a small quantity of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and pyridine (19 g; 240
 5 mmoles). The solution of 2-hydroxyethyl-acrylate and pyridine in toluene was added
   to the acid chloride solution, followed by mixing. The supernatant solution was
   decanted, extracted with 1N HCI, 1N sodium bicarbonate and water, then dried with
   anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solution volume was reduced to half
   by rotary evaporation, and then the solution was allowed to precipitate which was
10 purified by dissolving in hexane, and filtered at chilled temperature. The
   recrystallized solid was filtered and dried.

   extracted with 150 mL of 1 N HCI, 150 mL of 1N sodium bicarbonate, and 150 mL of
   distilled water. The organic layer was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and
20 filtered. 0.3 g of 1% hydroquinone in acetone was added, then all solvent removed
