   Field of the invention
 5        The present invention pertains to a synergistic insecticidal composition
   comprising methomyl and fipronil and its use in controlling insects. The present
   invention also relates to the use of the aforementioned composition, in particular in the
   treatment of seeds, foliage and soil applications.
 0 Background
          Chemical control is an important way for preventing and controlling pests in
   agriculture. However, current chemical agents show an unsatisfactory effect to certain
   kinds of pests. Furthermore, many pests have developed resistance to commonly
   used pesticides due to long time use of pesticides. Therefore, there is an urgent need
 5 to develop new methods and pesticides to control these pests. Moreover, the
   environmental and economic requirements imposed on modern-day insecticides are
   continually increasing, with regard, for example, to the spectrum of action, toxicity,
   selectivity, application rate, formation of residues, and favorable preparation ability.
   Since there may be problems, for example, with resistances developing to known
20 active compounds, a constant task is to develop new insecticide agents which in some
   areas at least have advantages over their known counterparts.
           Methomyl ((E,Z)-methyl N-{[(methylamino)carbonyl]oxy}ethanimidothioate), also
   known as Lannate, Mesomile, Methomex, and Nudrin, is a plant protectant belonging
   to the group of carbamates. It is commonly used as an insecticide against
25 Lepidopterous insect pests, and Coleopterous and some Hemipterous insect pests. It
   acts by reversibly inactivating the insecticidal acetylcholinesterase. Common trade
   names include Acinate, Agrinate, DuPont 1179, Flytek, Kipsin, Lannate, Lanox,
   Memilene, Methavin, Methomex, Nudrin, NuBait, Pillarmate and SD 14999.
           Fipronil   (5-amino-1 -(2,6-dichloro-a,a,a-trifluoro-p-toly)-4-[(trifluoromethy)sulfi
30 nyl]pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) belongs to a class of insecticides known as phenyl-

                                                 2
   pyrazoles. Fipronil interferes with the passage of chloride ions through the gamma
   aminobutyric acid (GABA)-regulated chloride channel disrupting CNS activity. It is
   moderately systemic and can be used to control insects when applied as a soil or seed
   treatment. A method to prepare fipronil is disclosed in W02013037291 Al.

   Summary of the invention
           The    present invention    relates to a     synergistic insecticidal composition
   comprising an effective amount of (A) methomyl; and an effective amount of (B)
   fipronil.
 0         The term "effective amount" means the quantity of such a compound or
   combination of such compounds that is capable of preventing, controlling and/or
   treating insect infestations in a synergistic manner.
           "Plant" as used herein, refers to all plant and plant populations such as desired
   and undesired wild plants or crop plants.
 5         "Plant parts" as used herein, refers to all parts and organs of plants, such as
   shoot, leaves, needles, stalks, stems, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and
   rhizomes. Harvested materials, and vegetative and generative propagation materials,
   for example, cutting, tubers, meristem tissue, rhizomes, offsets, seeds, single and
   multiple plant cells and any other plant tissues, are also included.
20         The word "surrounding" or "locus" refers to the place on which the plants are
   growing, the place on which the plant propagation materials of the plants are sown or
   the place on which the plant propagation materials of the plants will be sown.
           The invention also relates to a method of preventing, controlling and/or treating
   insecticidal infestations, and to the use of this synergistic composition.
25          It has now surprisingly been found that when applying a synergistic insecticidal
   composition comprising (A) methomyl; and (B) fipronil on the plants, plant parts and/or
   their surroundings, particularly on cereals, coffee, fiber plants, leguminous plants, oil
   plants, pastures, sugarcane, trees and vegetables, an excellent performance in
   preventing, controlling and/or treating insect infestations may be observed. Further,
30 the rates of application of the individual components can be markedly reduced while

                                                3
   maintaining a high level of insecticidal efficacy. The composition has been found to
   exhibit a considerably broader spectrum against infestation as compared to the
   components alone. The composition can have the potential to control insect infestation
   at a low application rate at which the individual compounds alone were ineffective. The
 5 composition can have a speed of action which is faster than that which would have
   been predicted from the speed of the individual components.
           (A) Methomyl may be present in the composition of the present invention in any
   suitable amount, and is generally present in an amount of from about 1% to about 80%
   by weight of the composition, preferably from about 1% to about 75% by weight of the
 0 composition, more preferably from about 1% to about 70% by weight, from about 1%
   to about 65% by weight or from about 1% to about 60% by weight of the composition.
           (B) Fipronil may be present in the composition of the present invention in any
   suitable amount, and is generally present in an amount of from about 1% to about 80%
   by weight of the composition, preferably from about 1% to about 75% or from about
 5 1% to about 70% by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 1% to
   about 65%, from about 1% to about 60%, or from about 1% to about 40% by weight of
   the composition.
          The components (A) and (B) together may be present in the composition in any
   suitable amount, and is generally present in an amount of from about 2% to about 95%
 0 by weight of the composition, preferably from about 10% to about 80% by weight of
   the composition, more preferably from about 15% to about 70%, and even more
   preferably from about 20% to about 65% by weight of the composition.
          The components (A) and (B) may be present in the composition or applied in
   any amounts relative to each other, to provide the enhanced or synergistic effect of the
25 mixture. In particular, the weight ratio of the components (A) and (B) in the
   composition independently is preferably in the range of from about 90:1 to about 1:90
   or from about 50:1 to about 1:50, more preferably from about 25:1 to about 1:25, and
   even more preferably from about 12:1 to about 1:12, from about 10:1 to about 1:10,
   from about 9:1 to about 1:9, from about 8:1 to about 1:8, from about 7:1 to about 1:7,
30 from about 6:1 to about 1:6, from about 5:1 to about 1:5, from about 4:1 to about 1:4,
   from about 3:1 to about 1:3, from about 2:1 to about 1:2, about 1:1.           In some

                                               4
   embodiments, the weight ratio of the components (A) to (B) in the composition is about
   12:1 or 10:1 or 9:1 or 8:1 or 7:1 or 6:1 or 5: 1 or 4:1 or 3:1 or 2:1 or 1:1. In some
   embodiments, the weight ratio of the components (A) to (B) in the composition is about
   8:1. In some embodiments, the weight ratio of the components (A) to (B) in the
 5 composition is about 1:1.
            In a preferred embodiment of the invention, each combination is a composition
   comprising, components (A) and (B), and optionally one or more auxiliaries. The
   auxiliaries employed in the composition will depend upon the type of formulation
   and/or the manner in which the formulation is to be applied by the end user.
 0 Formulations incorporating the composition of the present invention are described
   hereinafter. Suitable auxiliaries which may be comprised in the composition according
   to the invention are all customary formulation adjuvants or components, such as
   extender, carriers, solvents, surfactants, stabilizers, anti-foaming agents, anti-freezing
   agents, preservatives, antioxidants, colorants, thickeners, solid adherents and inert
 5 fillers. Such auxiliaries are known in the art and are commercially available. Their use
   in the formulation of the composition of the present invention will be apparent to the
   person skilled in the art.
            The composition may further comprise one or more inert fillers. Such inert fillers
   are known in the art and available commercially. Suitable fillers in a form of a solid
 0 include, for example, natural ground minerals, such as kaolins, aluminas, talc, chalk,
   quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite, and diatomaceous earth, or synthetic ground
   minerals, such as highly dispersed silicic acid, aluminium oxide, silicates, and calcium
   phosphates and calcium hydrogen phosphates. Suitable inert fillers for granules
   include, for example, crushed and fractionated natural minerals, such as calcite,
25 marble, pumice, sepiolite, and dolomite, or synthetic granules of inorganic and organic
   ground materials, as well as granules of organic material, such as sawdust, coconut
   husks, corn cobs, and tobacco stalks.
            The composition optionally includes one or more surfactants which are
   preferably non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic in nature and surfactant mixtures which
30 have good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties, depending on the nature of
   the active compound to be formulated. Suitable surfactants are known in the art and
   are commercially available. Suitable anionic surfactants can be both so-called water-

                                                  5
   soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic surface-active compounds. Soaps which
   may be used are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or substituted or unsubstituted
   ammonium salts of higher fatty acid (C10 -C2 2 ), for example the sodium or potassium
   salt of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures. The surfactant can be an
 5 emulsifier, dispersant or wetting agent of ionic or nonionic type. Examples which may
   be used are salts of polyacrylic acids, salts of lignosulphonic acid, salts of
   phenylsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene oxide
   with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, substituted phenols,
   especially alkylphenols, sulphosuccinic ester salts, taurine derivatives, especially
 0 alkyltaurates, or phosphoric esters of polyethoxylated phenols or alcohols. The
   presence of at least one surfactant is generally required when the active compound
   and/or the inert carrier and/or auxiliary/adjuvant is/are insoluble in water and the
   vehicle for the final application of the composition is water.
           The composition optionally further comprises one or more polymeric stabilizer.

                                                 6
   SOLVESSOTM200, a mixture of paraffinic, isoparaffinic, cycloparaffinic and aromatic
   hydrocarbons. Suitable solvents are commercially available.
          Suitable preservatives include all substances which can normally be used for
   this purpose in agrochemical compositions of this type and again are well known in the
 5 art. Suitable examples include PREVENTOL* (from Bayer AG) and PROXEL* (from
   Bayer AG).
          Suitable antioxidants are all substances which can normally be used for this
   purpose in agrochemical compositions, as is known in the art. Preference is given to
   butylated hydroxytoluene.
 0        Suitable thickeners include all substances which can normally be used for this
   purpose in agrochemical compositions. For example xanthan gum, PVOH, cellulose
   and its derivatives, clay hydrated silicates, magnesium aluminium silicates or a mixture
   thereof. Again, such thickeners are known in the art and available commercially.
          The composition may further comprise one or more solid adherents. Such
 5 adherents are known in the art and available commercially. They include organic
   adhesives, including tackifiers, such as celluloses of substituted celluloses, natural and
   synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules, or lattices, and inorganic
   adhesives such as gypsum, silica or cement.
           In addition, depending upon the formulation, the composition according to the
 0 invention may also comprise water.

           The composition of the present invention is suitable for plants of the crops:
   cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, corn, rice, sorghum, triticale and related crops); beet
 5 (such as sugar beet and fodder beet); fruit, such as pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit,
   such as apples, grapes, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, and berries, for
   example strawberries, raspberries and blackberries; leguminous plants (beans,
   drybeans,      lentils,  peas,   soybeans);    oil   plants   (rape,   mustard,     sunflowers);
   cucurbitaceae (marrows, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute);
LO citrus, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit and mandarins; vegetables (spinach,
   lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika, broccoli,

   embodiments, the composition of the present invention is applied on cereals, coffee,
25 fiber plants, leguminous plants, oil plants, pastures, sugarcane, trees and vegetables.
   In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention is applied on barley,
   bean, broccoli, cabbage, coffee, corn, cotton, cucumber, eucalyptus, pastures, potato,
   rice, soybean, sugarcane, sunflower, tomato and wheat.
           The synergistic composition comprising (A) methomyl; and (B) fipronil, is
30 particularly effective in preventing, controlling and/or treating insect infestations as

                                                8
   mentioned above in barley, bean, broccoli, cabbage, coffee, corn, cotton, cucumber,
   eucalyptus, pastures, potato, rice, soybean, sugarcane, sunflower, tomato, wheat,
   their plant parts and/or surroundings.
           The rates of application (use) of the composition of the present invention may
 5 vary, for example, according to the degree of control required, type of use, type of
   crop, the specific active compounds in the combination, type of plants, but is such that
   the active compounds are present in combination in an effective amount to provide the
   desired action (such as insect control). The application rate of the composition for a
   given set of conditions can readily be determined by trials. In general the composition
 0 of the invention can be applied at an application rate of between about 0.01
   kilograms/hectare (kg/ha) and about 4 kg/ha, based on the total amount of active
   ingredient (component (A) + component (B)) in the composition. An application rate of
   between about 0.05 kg of active ingredient (a.i.)/ha and 2.5 kg a.i./ha is preferred.
           The composition of the present invention is useful as an insecticide,
 5 demonstrating synergistic activity for preventing, controlling and/or treating insect
   infestations. The composition can be formulated in the same manner in which
   insecticides are generally formulated. The compounds may be applied either
   separately or combined as part of a two-part system. The components (A) and (B) may
   be    applied   in  any    desired   sequence,     any   combination,     consecutively   or
 0 simultaneously. In the event that the components (A) and (B) or active ingredients are
   applied simultaneously in the present invention, they may be applied as a composition
   containing components (A) and (B) or active ingredients, in which case components
   (A) and (B) can be obtained from a separate formulation source and mixed together
   (known as a tank-mix, ready-to-apply, spray broth, or slurry), optionally with other
25 pesticides, or components (A) and (B) or active ingredients can be obtained as a
   single formulation mixture source (known as a pre-mix, concentrate, formulated
   compound (or product)), and optionally mixed together with other pesticides.
           The composition of the present invention can be applied in a variety of ways
   known to those skilled in the art, at various concentrations. The composition is useful
30 in preventing, controlling and/or treating insect infestations in plants, plant parts and/or
   surroundings by pre-emergence or postemergence application to plants, plant parts
   and/or surroundings is desired.

                                                9
           The synergistic composition of this invention preferably also comprises an
   agriculturally acceptable carrier therefor. In practice, the compounds are applied as
   formulations containing the various adjuvants and carriers known to or used in the
   industry for facilitating dispersion. The choice of formulation and mode of application
 5 for any given compound may affect its activity, and selection will be made accordingly.
   The compositions of the invention may thus be formulated as:
   a water-soluble concentrate (SL), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), an emulsion (EW),
   a micro-emulsion (ME), a suspension concentrates (SC), an oil-based suspension
   concentrates (OD), a flowable suspension (FS), a water-dispersible granule (WG), a
 0 water-soluble granule (SG), a water-dispersible powder (WP), a water soluble powder
   (SP), a granule (GR), an encapsulated granule (CG), a fine granule (FG), a
   macrogranule     (GG),    an aqueous     suspo-emulsion    (SE),  a   micro-encapsulated
   suspension (CS), and a microgranule (MG), or preferably as an emulsifiable
   concentrate (EC), a suspension concentrates (SC), a water-dispersible granule (WG)
 5 or a flowable suspension (FS).
           Using such formulations, either straight (that is undiluted) or diluted with a
   suitable solvent, especially water, plants, plant parts and/or the surroundings can be
   treated and protected against insects by spraying, pouring immersing or treating.
           The composition can be applied with the methods known in the art. These
 0 methods include coating, spraying, dipping, soaking, injection, irrigation etc.
           Further, other biocidally active ingredients or compositions may be combined
   with the synergistic composition of this invention. For example, the compositions may
   contain, in addition to components (A) and (B), herbicides, insecticides, fungicides,
   bactericides, acaracides or nematicides, in order to broaden the spectrum of activity.
25 The compositions according to the invention are distinguished by the fact that they are
   especially well tolerated by plants and are environmentally friendly.
           As one skilled in the art is aware, in insect, nematode and fungal testing, a
   significant number of factors that are not readily controllable can affect the results of
   individual tests and render them non-reproducible. For example, the results may vary
30 depending on environmental factors, such as amount of sunlight and water, soil type,
   pH of the soil, temperature, and humidity, among other factors. Also, the depth of

                                               10
   planting, the application rate of individual and combined insecticides and fungicides,
   and the ratio of each insecticide and fungicide, as well as the nature of crops or weeds
   being tested, can affect the results of the test. Results may vary from crop to crop
   within the crop varieties.
