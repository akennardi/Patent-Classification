                         A BENEFICIATION PLANT
                         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]     The invention relates to a beneficiation plant. In particular, the
invention relates, but is not limited, to a beneficiation plant for processing
coal.
                   BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]     Reference to background art herein is not to be construed as an
admission that such art constitutes common general knowledge in Australia or
elsewhere.
[0003]     In the mining industry, beneficiation includes a process that
improves (benefits) the economic value of the material by removing
undesirable materials therefrom. By way of example, de-stoning coal (i.e.
removing excess dilution) improves the quality and value of the coal. To this
end, in contractual arrangements, significant financial bonuses or penalties
may be based on coal recovery and the dilution levels achieved.
[0004]     Ongoing attempts are being made to improve the beneficiation
process with respect to coal. One approach has been to modify current
mining techniques and equipment to achieve further coal recovery. However,
this approach has led to, amongst other things, production being sacrificed as
smaller equipment has been required.
[0005]      Mixed results have also been achieved in the beneficiation
process to date, with respect to coal, due to the reliance on human
intervention and the extent of management and supervision required for the
systems and processes. This has led to the present technological
3442078v1

                                         -2
developments being potentially unsustainable, particularly in view of the
increasingly complex site geology.
                          OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0006]       It is an aim of this invention to provide a beneficiation plant which
overcomes or ameliorates one or more of the disadvantages or problems
described above, or which at least provides a useful alternative.

               DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0046]      Figure 1 illustrates a schematic diagram having a beneficiation
plant 10, according to an embodiment of the invention. The beneficiation plant
10 includes a feeding module 100, a processing module 200, a rejection
stockpiler 300 and a product stockpiler 400.
[0047]     The feeding module 100, according to an embodiment of the
invention, is further illustrated in figures 2 and 3. The feeding module 100
includes a supporting structure 110, a feed hopper 120, a feed conveyor
assembly 130 and a feed breaking assembly 140. The supporting structure
110 supports the feed hopper 120, the feed conveyor assembly 130 and the
feed breaking assembly 140. The supporting structure 110 includes one or
more skids 112 that assist in moving the feeding module 100. The structural
members of the supporting structure 110 are configured to fit within a
standard shipping container. Attached to the feed hopper 120 are grizzly bars
122 with a mechanical cleaning rake 124.
[0048]     The feed conveyor assembly 130 includes an input conveyor 132,
a fines conveyor 134 and an output conveyor 136. The feed hopper 120
assists in enclosing an area around the input conveyor 132. The input
conveyor 132 is located above the fines conveyor 134. The input conveyor
132 and the fines conveyor 134 each extend substantially from the bottom of
the supporting structure 110 to the top of the supporting structure 110. In this
regard, the input conveyor 132 and the fines conveyor 134 extend in a
transverse direction to a horizontal ground plane. The input conveyor 132 is
configured to deliver relatively large pieces of feed material to the feed
breaking assembly 140. The fines conveyor 134 assists in delivering relatively
small pieces of feed material directly to the output conveyor 136.
[0049]     The feed breaking assembly 140 includes a primary sizer 142 and
a secondary sizer 144. The input conveyor 132 delivers the feed material to
3442078v1

                                      -9
the primary sizer 142. The primary sizer 142 is configured to size the feed
material to a nominal size of approximately 250mm or less. The primary sizer
142 ejects the sized material in a downward direction towards the secondary
sizer 144. The secondary sizer 144 is configured to size the feed material to a
nominal size of 100mm or less. The secondary sizer 144 is configured to eject
the feed material onto the output conveyor 136 therebelow. The output
conveyor 136 is configured to convey the feed material to the processing
module 200. The output conveyor 136 extends at an acute angle (e.g.
approximately 30 degrees), relative to the horizontal ground plane, towards
the processing module 200.
[0050]      The processing module 200, which is more clearly shown in figures
4-7, includes a supporting structure 210, a feed material elevator 220, a
screen assembly 230, a separator 240, a dewatering assembly 250, a
collection tank 260 and a screw press 270. The supporting structure 210 is
configured to support the feed material elevator 220, screen assembly 230,
the separator 240, the dewatering assembly 250, the collection tank 260 and
the screw press 270. As outlined further below, the supporting structure 210
is also configured to support, amongst other things, parts of the rejection and
product stockpilers 300, 400. The supporting structure 210 includes a plurality
of level modules that build the multilevel structure of the processing module
200. In particular, the supporting structure includes a first level module 212, a
second level module 214 and a third level module 216. The level modules
212, 214, 216 are releasably connected in manner that allows for relatively
quick and easy assembly / disassembly of the processing module 200. The
structural members of the supporting structure 210 are configured to fit within
a standard shipping container. The supporting structure 210 includes one or
more skids 213 that assist in moving the processing module 200.
[0051]      The feed material elevator 220 extends in a substantially vertical
direction away from a base of the support structure 210. The feed material
3442078v1

                                       - 10
elevator 220 is in the form of a bucket elevator. The feed material elevator
220 transports the feed material in a substantially vertical direction to an
upper portion of the processing module 200. In this regard, the feed material
elevator 220 extends substantially perpendicular to a horizontal ground plane.
The feed material elevator 220 extends past the level modules 212, 214, 216
of the supporting structure 210. The feed material elevator 220 is configured
to receive feed material from the output conveyor 136. The feed material
elevator 220 includes a split chute at an upper portion thereof. The split chute
provides feed material to the screen assembly 230. The feed material elevator
220 is configured to transport at least 600 tonnes per hour of feed material. In
a further embodiment, the feed material elevator 220 may also be releasably
connected to the support structure 210. In this further embodiment, the feed
material elevator 220 may be detached from the support structure 210 to
further assist in, for example, moving the beneficiation plant 10 to a different
location.
[0052]      In this embodiment, the screen assembly 230 includes two feed
screens 232 and two vibrating feeders 234. The feed screens 232 are
respectively associated with one of the chutes of the feed material elevator
220. The feed screens 232 are configured to pass material of a
predetermined size, being approximately 6mm or less, therethrough to a
product conveyor 420 of the product stockpiler 400, which can be seen in
figures 6 and 8, and is further illustrated in figure 9. This assists in improving
the efficiency of the beneficiation plant 10, as further outlined below. Material
that is above approximately 6mm is configured to travel into the vibrating
feeders 234. The vibrating feeders 234 are configured to vibrate the feed
material in order to detach, for example, coal from stones that are attached
thereto. The vibrating feeders 234 deliver the feed material to the separator
240.
3442078v1

                                       -11
[0053]      The separator 240 is configured to separate coal and its
associated dilution (i.e. stones) on the basis of different specific gravities of
the two or more materials. This is done on a bed which is fluidised by a
pulsating current of fluid which produces stratification. In other words, the
separator 240 includes a fluid that allows the stone material to sink through
the separator 240 whilst the coal is collected along the top portion of the fluid.
Fluid (i.e. water) for the separator 240 is sourced from the tank 260.
[0054]       In this embodiment, the stones that separate from the coal and sink
through the separator 240 are collected by a waste elevator 320 of the
rejection stockpiler 300. The separator 240 has an offset bottom portion to
deliver the stones to the waste elevator 320. That is, the bottom portion of the
separator 240 is skewed towards the elevator 320 to assist in delivering
stones to the waste elevator 320. This is shown further in figures 4 and 8
where the bottom portion of the separator 240 is skewed both across and
along the processing module 200 to deliver stones to the waste elevator 320.
In this regard, at least one of the side walls of the bottom portion of the
separator 240 is more skewed in comparison to an opposing side wall.
[0055]      The waste elevator 320, as shown further in figure 8, is configured
to deliver the stones to a rejection carrier 330, which is supported by a
support structure 310. The length of the rejection carrier 330 assists in
removing waste from the beneficiation plant 10 in a manner that creates a
sufficient buffer therebetween.
[0056]       In addition, it is noted that the separator 240 includes a bleed
system to renew the fluid (i.e. water) travelling therethough. This keeps the
concentration of contaminants to an acceptable level. This is achieved by
employing a density meter in a recirculating circuit of the separator 240. In
response to a predetermined set point being reached, water will be sent to an
extractor in the form of the screw press 270. The screw press 270 is
configured to extract coal, which is subsequently delivered onto the product
3442078v1

                                      - 12
conveyor 420. The screw press 270 includes a tapered screw drive. The
threads of the tapered screw drive increase in diameter towards an end of the
screw drive. The larger diameter threads assist in caking the coal together as
the coal moves along the screw drive. Water from the screw press 270 is
returned to the tank 260.
[0057]      The coal that is collected from a top portion of the fluid in the
separator 240 is delivered to the dewatering assembly 250. The dewatering
assembly 250 includes static screen 252. The static screen 252 is a wire type
screen. The discharge of coal from the static screen 252 is fed onto a
vibrating screen 254 that further assists in removing fluid from the coal. The
vibrating screen 254 is also configured to deliver the coal to a vibrating feeder
430, which subsequently delivers the coal to the product conveyor 420.
[0058]      The product conveyor 420, which extends substantially across the
processing module 200, is configured to convey the coal product to a product
carrier 440 of the product stockpiler 400. The product carrier 440 is supported
by the support structure 410. The support structure 410 includes one or more
motion members that allow the product carrier 440 to be moved to different
positions. By way of example, the product carrier may be rotated (or slewed)
to different positions to deliver the coal product to a stockpile.
[0059]      In use, feed material is dumped into the feed hopper 120 of the
beneficiation plant 10. This feed material, depending on its size, is moved in
upward direction either along the input conveyor 132 or the fines conveyor
130. That is, the feed material is moved in upward direction at angle of
approximately 30 degrees to a horizontal plane. It will be appreciated that this
angle may be changed. The input conveyor 132 conveys the feed material to
the feed breaking assembly 140 where the feed material is: i) first processed
by the primary sizer 142 to have a nominal size of approximately 250mm or
less; and ii) then processed by the secondary sizer 144 to have a nominal
size of approximately 100mm or less. The feed material is ejected from the
3442078v1

                                     - 13
secondary sizer 144 and travels in a downward direction to the output
conveyor 136. Similarly, for feed material that is relatively small and travels
along the fines conveyor 130, this feed material moves off the fines conveyor
130 and travels in a downward direction to the output conveyor 136. The
output conveyor 136 conveys the feed material in an upward direction
towards an inlet of the feed material elevator 220.
[0060]      In this embodiment, the feed material elevator 220 moves the feed
material in a substantially vertical direction to an upper portion of the
processing module 200. It will be appreciated that the feed material may also
be moved in other directions. The feed material exits the feed material
elevator 220 via one of two chutes and falls onto one of the feed screens 232.
Material which is below a predetermined size (i.e. 6 mm or less) falls through
the feed screens 232 and is directed to the product conveyor 420. Material
that is above the predetermined size travels to the vibrating feeders 234. The
vibrating feeders 234 assist in disassociating stones from the coal and
moving the feed material to the separator 240.
[0061]      As indicated above, in the separator 240, the coal in the feed
material remains at the top potion of the water in the separator 240. Water is
circulated through the separator 240 to assist in separating the coal from the
stones. As the water is circulated through the separator 240, in response to
the water reaching a predetermined set point (i.e. contamination point), water
is diverted to the screw press 270 to extract coal therefrom and return the
processed water, having less coal content, to the tank 260. The coat
extracted via the screw press 270 is delivered to the product conveyor 420.
[0062]      The stones in the feed material, due to their different specific
gravity, sink towards the bottom of the separator 240 and are then removed
by waste elevator 320. The waste elevator 320 elevates the stones towards
an upper chute where the stones are then ejected, in a downward direction, to

                                        - 14
the rejection carrier 330. The stones are carried in an upwardly inclined angle
by the rejection carrier 330 to a stockpile.
[0063]      The coal remaining at an upper portion of the separator 240 is
directed towards the static screen 252, where the coal is assisted in drying.
Following this, the coal is fed to the vibrating screen 254 where the coal is
further assisted in drying. The coal is then directed to a vibrating feeder 430
that feeds the coal onto the product conveyor 420. The coal on the product
conveyor 420 is then conveyed onto the product carrier 440. The coal is then
carried in an upwardly inclined angle by the product carrier 340 to a stockpile.
[0064]      In response to coal processing being required at a different
location on site, the beneficiation plant 10 may be towed to the different
location. That is, the skids 112, 213 of the beneficiation plant 10 allow the
beneficiation plant to be slid to a different location, as required. This improves
efficiency on the coal processing site and allows for optimal placement of the
mining fleet. It is also noted that in further embodiments that, for example, the
beneficiation plant 10 may include a crawler mounted unit to assist in moving
the beneficiation plant 10.
[0065]      In addition, it is noted that the beneficiation plant 10 reduces the
dependency on human intervention and in field geology assessments for coal
quality. The beneficiation plant 10 also works well with both current and future
mining techniques including truck shovel and continuous mining systems. The
beneficiation plant 10 is also capable of processing at least 600 tonnes of
feed material per hour.
[0066]      The sizing of the feed material through the feed breaking assembly
140 is able to reduce the large lumps of feed material without performing
undue work on smaller particles and thus inherently produces fewer fines
than other types of crushers and sizers.

[0067]       The feed material elevator 220, extending somewhat in a vertical
direction, allows for a compact processing module 200. This assists in moving
the beneficiation plant 10 and simplifies the design of the beneficiation plant
10. By way of example, bucket elevators that are arranged laterally may have
a larger footprint and inherent instability as a mobile unit. Furthermore, the
bucket elevator 10 is located to one side of the processing module 200 and
parallel to a central axis of the processing module 200. This is to preserve
balance with a small sacrifice in height. This arrangement also allows, for
example, an offset dewatering screen 254, which is located more towards one
side of the processing module 200.
[0068]       The use of the screw press 270 assists in removing contaminants
(i.e. coal) that will lead to accelerated wear of pipes, tank pumps and the like.
Furthermore, the screw press 270 assists in recovering coal, which is of
commercial value.
