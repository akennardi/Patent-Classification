BACKGROUND
              Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a common nosocomial pathogen and a major
cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients throughout the world. Kelly
et al., New Eng. J. Med., 330:257-62, 1994. The increased use of broad spectrum
antibiotics and the emergence of unusually virulent strains of C. difficile have lead to the
idea that vaccines may be well suited to reduce disease and death associated with this
bacterium. C. difficile has few traditional antibiotic options and frequently causes a
recurring disease (25% of cases). C. difficile claims about 20,000 lives in the USA alone
per year and causes around 500,000 confirmed infections. Recently, more virulent strains
of C. difficile have emerged that produce more toxin such as the B1/NAB1/027 strain,
which also has a decreased susceptibility to metronidazole. Outbreaks of C. difficile have

necessitated ward and partial hospital closure. With the increasing elderly population and
the changing demographics of the population, C. difficile is set to become a major
problem in the 21"' century. The spectrum of C. difficile disease ranges from
asymptomatic carriage to mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis.
               C. difficile has a dimorphic lifecycle whereby it exists both as an infectious and
tough spore form and a metabolically active toxin-producing vegetative cell. C. difficile
associated disease (CDAD) is believed to be caused by the vegetative cells and more
specifically the actions of two toxins, enterotoxin toxin A and cytotoxin toxin B.
Vaccines and therapy for C. difficile have been to date focused upon the toxins (A and B),
toxoids of A and B, recombinant fragments of A and B, and vegetative cell surface layer
proteins (SLPAs).
               Toxin A is a high-molecular weight protein that possesses multiple functional
domains. The toxin is broken up into 4 functional domains: an amino-terminal
glucosyltransferase that modifies Rho-like GTPases leading to cytoskeletal dysregulation
in epithelial cells, an autocatalytic cysteine protease domain, a hydrophobic membrane
spanning sequence, and a highly repetitive carboxy-terminal host-cell binding domain.
The carboxy terminal domain anchors the toxin to the host cell carbohydrate receptors on
intestinal epithelial cells which initiates the internalization process thereby delivering the
amino-terminal enzymatic domains to the cytoplasm of the target cells. The delivery of
the enzymatic domain and glucosyltransferase activity leads to diarrhea and inflammation
due to the apoptotic cell death of the intoxicated cells.
               Many studies have shown the importance of antibodies against the toxins in
affecting the disease outcome. Studies have also shown the correlation between serum
anti-toxinA antibodies with protection from CDAD and relapse. These studies have led to
the creation of toxin mAb therapies for CDAD.

               Despite these advances, there is an unmet need for effective treatment and/or
prevention of C. difficile associated infections including prevention from relapse of
CDAD. The present invention provides mouse and humanized antibodies to toxin A to
satisfy these and other needs.

compositions contain antibodies (or an antigen-binding portion thereof) that recognize
toxin A of C. difficile, including mouse monoclonal antibodies, humanized antibodies,
chimeric antibodies, or antigen-binding portions of any of the foregoing. These antibodies
(or antigen-binding portion thereof) can neutralize toxin A in vitro and in vivo, and/or
inhibit binding of toxin A to mammalian cells. Therefore, the present antibodies or
antigen-binding portion thereof can be used in passive immunization to prevent or treat
C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD).
              In one embodiment, the present antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof
provide one or more of the following effects: protect from or treat C. difficile-mediated
colitis, antibiotic-associated colitis, pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) or other intestinal
disease in a subject; protect from or treat diarrhea in a subject; and/or treat or inhibit
relapse of C. difficile-mediated disease.              When administered to a mammal, the present
antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof protect the mammal against toxin A
administered in an amount that would be fatal to the mammal had the antibody or
antigen-binding portion thereof not administered.
              The present antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof include antibodies
produced by hybridoma clone CAN20G2, CAN20G1, CAN20G5, CAN20G8,
CAN19G1, CAN19G2 or CAN19G3 described herein.
             Also encompassed by the present invention are antibodies or antigen-binding
portions thereof that include an antigen-binding portion of an antibody produced by
hybridoma clone CAN20G2, CAN20G1, CAN20G5, CAN20G8, CAN19G1, CAN19G2
or CAN19G3.
             As used herein, CAN20G1, CAN20G2, CAN20G5, CAN20G8, CAN19G1,
CAN 19G2 and CAN 19G3 refer to the hybridoma clones or the monoclonal antibodies
generated by the corresponding hybridoma clones.

              The antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof can specifically bind to an
epitope within fragment 4 of toxin A, e.g., an epitope between amino acid residues 1853
2710 of toxin A. Babcock, G.J. et al., Infection and Immunity, 74: 6339-6347 (2006). In
other embodiments, the antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof specifically bind to
an epitope within fragment 1 (amino acid residues 1-659), fragment 2 (amino acid
residues 660-1256) or fragment 3 (amino acid residues 1257-1852) of toxin A. In other
embodiments, the antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof specifically bind an
epitope within amino acid residues 1-600, 400-600, 415-540, 1-100, 100-200, 200-300,

2300, 2300-2400, 2400-2500, 2500-2600, 2600-27 10 of toxin A, or any interval, portion
or range thereof.
              The present antibodies, or antigen-binding portions thereof, include, but are not
limited to, monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, polyclonal
antibodies, recombinant antibodies, as well as antigen-binding portions of the foregoing.
An antigen-binding portion of an antibody may include a portion of an antibody that
specifically binds to a toxin of C. difficile (e.g., toxin A).
              The humanized antibody of the present invention is an antibody from a non
human species where the amino acid sequence in the non-antigen binding regions (and/or
the antigen-binding regions) has been altered so that the antibody more closely resembles
a human antibody, and still retains its original binding ability.
              Humanized antibodies can be generated by replacing sequences of the variable
region that are not directly involved in antigen binding with equivalent sequences from
human variable regions. Those methods include isolating, manipulating, and expressing
the nucleic acid sequences that encode all or part of variable regions from at least one of a
heavy or light chain. Sources of such nucleic acid are well known to those skilled in the
art and, for example, may be obtained from a hybridoma producing an antibody against

toxin A. The recombinant DNA encoding the humanized antibody, or fragment thereof,
can then be cloned into an appropriate expression vector.
              An antibody light or heavy chain variable region consists of a framework region
interrupted by three hypervariable regions, referred to as complementarity determining
regions (CDRs). In one embodiment, humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from
non-human species having one, two or all CDRs from the non-human species and a
framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule.
              The humanized antibodies of the present invention can be produced by methods
known in the art. For example, once non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are obtained,
variable regions can be sequenced, and the location of the CDRs and framework residues
determined. Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,
Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91
3242. Chothia, C. et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917. The light and heavy chain
variable regions can, optionally, be ligated to corresponding constant regions. CDR
grafted antibody molecules can be produced by CDR-grafting or CDR substitution. One,
two, or all CDRs of an immunoglobulin chain can be replaced. For example, all of the
CDRs of a particular antibody may be from at least a portion of a non-human animal
(e.g., mouse such as CDRs shown in Table 1) or only some of the CDRs may be replaced.
It is only necessary to keep the CDRs required for binding of the antibody to a
predetermined antigen (e.g., toxin A of C. difficile). Morrison, S. L., 1985, Science,

              A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from
different animal species. For example, an antibody may contain a variable region derived
from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Chimeric antibodies
can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Morrison, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci,
81:6851-6855 (1984). For example, a gene encoding a murine (or other species)
monoclonal antibody molecule is digested with restriction enzymes to remove the region
encoding the murine Fc, and the equivalent portion of a gene encoding a human Fc
constant region is substituted. Chimeric antibodies can also be created by recombinant
DNA techniques where DNA encoding murine V regions can be ligated to DNA
encoding the human constant regions. Better et al., Science, 1988, 240:1041-1043. Liu et

               The antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof of the present invention may
be monospecific, bi-specific or multispecific. Multispecific or bi-specific antibodies or
fragments thereof may be specific for different epitopes of one target polypeptide (e.g.,
toxin A) or may contain antigen-binding domains specific for more than one target
polypeptide (e.g., antigen-binding domains specific for toxin A and toxin B; or antigen
binding domains specific for toxin A and other antigen of C. difficile; or antigen-binding
domains specific for toxin A and other kind of bacterium or virus). In one embodiment, a
multispecific antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof comprises at least two different
variable domains, wherein each variable domain is capable of specifically binding to a
separate antigen or to a different epitope on the same antigen. Tutt et al., 1991, J.
Immunol. 147:60-69. Kufer et al., 2004, Trends Biotechnol. 22:238-244. The present
antibodies can be linked to or co-expressed with another functional molecule, e.g.,
another peptide or protein. For example, an antibody or fragment thereof can be
functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or
otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another antibody or antibody
fragment to produce a bi-specific or a multispecific antibody with a second binding
specificity. For example, the present invention includes bi-specific antibodies wherein
one arm of an immunoglobulin is specific for toxin A, and the other arm of the
immunoglobulin is specific for a second therapeutic target or is conjugated to a
therapeutic moiety such as a trypsin inhibitor.
              All antibody isotypes are encompassed by the present invention, including IgG
(e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), IgM, IgA (IgAl, IgA2), IgD or IgE. The antibodies or
antigen-binding portions thereof may be mammalian (e.g., mouse, human) antibodies or
antigen-binding portions thereof. The light chains of the antibody may be of kappa or
lambda type.
               The CDRs of the present antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof can be
from a non-human or human source. The framework of the present antibodies or antigen
binding portions thereof can be human, humanized, non-human (e.g., a murine

              In one embodiment, the present antibodies, or antigen-binding portions thereof,

region. The heavy chain variable region (or light chain variable region) contains three
CDRs and four framework regions (FRs), arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy
terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. Kabat, E.

              In certain embodiments, a variable heavy chain region of the antibodies or

CAN20G8 (SEQ ID NOs: 53 - 55).
              In certain embodiments, CDRs corresponding to the CDRs in Table 1 have
sequence variations. For example, CDRs, in which 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 residues, or less
than 20%, less than 30%, or less than about 40% of total residues in the CDR, are
substituted or deleted can be present in an antibody (or antigen-binding portion thereof)
that binds toxin A.
              In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof contains a
variable light chain region and variable heavy chain region homologous to a variable light
chain region and variable heavy chain region of the antibody produced by clone
CAN20G1 (SEQ ID NO: 4 and SEQ ID NO:12, respectively), CAN20G2 (SEQ ID

              The antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof are peptides. The peptides
may also include variants, analogs, orthologs, homologs and derivatives of peptides, that
exhibit a biological activity, e.g., binding of an antigen. The peptides may contain one or
more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, non-naturally occurring amino
acids, amino acids which only occur naturally in an unrelated biological system, modified

amino acids from mammalian systems etc.), peptides with substituted linkages, as well as
other modifications known in the art.
              Also within the scope of the invention are antibodies or antigen-binding portions
thereof in which specific amino acids have been substituted, deleted or added. These
alternations do not have a substantial effect on the peptide' sbiological properties such as
binding activity. For example, antibodies may have amino acid substitutions in the
framework region, such as to improve binding to the antigen. In another example, a
selected, small number of acceptor framework residues can be replaced by the
corresponding donor amino acids. The donor framework can be a mature or germline
human antibody framework sequence or a consensus sequence. Guidance concerning
how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie et al.,

              The antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, can be derivatized or linked to
another functional molecule. For example, an antibody can be functionally linked (by
chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent interaction, etc.) to one or more other
molecular entities, such as another antibody, a detectable agent, a cytotoxic agent, a
pharmaceutical agent, a protein or peptide that can mediate association with another
molecule (such as a streptavidin core region or a polyhistidine tag), amino acid linkers,
signal sequences, immunogenic carriers, or ligands useful in protein purification, such as
glutathione-S-transferase, histidine tag, and staphylococcal protein A. One type of
derivatized protein is produced by crosslinking two or more proteins (of the same type or
of different types). Suitable crosslinkers include those that are heterobifunctional, having
two distinct reactive groups separated by an appropriate spacer (e.g., m
maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) or homobifunctional (e.g.,

disuccinimidyl suberate). Such linkers are available from Pierce Chemical Company,
Rockford, Ill. Useful detectable agents with which a protein can be derivatized (or
labeled) include fluorescent compounds, various enzymes, prosthetic groups, luminescent
materials, bioluminescent materials, and radioactive materials. Non-limiting, exemplary
fluorescent detectable agents include fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine,
and, phycoerythrin. A protein or antibody can also be derivatized with detectable
enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, beta-galactosidase,
acetylcholinesterase, glucose oxidase and the like. A protein can also be derivatized with
a prosthetic group (e.g., streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin).

               Nucleic acid molecules encoding a functionally active variant of the present
antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof are also encompassed by the present
invention. These nucleic acid molecules may hybridize with a nucleic acid encoding any
of the present antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof under medium stringency, high
stringency, or very high stringency conditions. Guidance for performing hybridization
reactions can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons,
N.Y. 6.3.1-6.3.6, 1989, which is incorporated herein by reference. Specific hybridization
conditions referred to herein are as follows: 1) medium stringency hybridization
conditions: 6XSSC at about 450C, followed by one or more washes in 0.2XSSC, 0. 1%
SDS at 60 0 C; 2) high stringency hybridization conditions: 6XSSC at about 450 C,
followed by one or more washes in 0.2XSSC, 0. 1% SDS at 65 0 C; and 3) very high

               A nucleic acid encoding the present antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof
may be introduced into an expression vector that can be expressed in a suitable
expression system, followed by isolation or purification of the expressed antibody or
antigen-binding portion thereof. Optionally, a nucleic acid encoding the present antibody
or antigen-binding portion thereof can be translated in a cell-free translation system. U.S.

               Anti-toxin antibodies or portions thereof can be produced by host cells
transformed with DNA encoding light and heavy chains (or portions thereof) of a desired
antibody. Antibodies can be isolated and purified from these culture supernatants and/or
cells using standard techniques. For example, a host cell may be transformed with DNA
encoding the light chain, the heavy chain, or both, of an antibody. Recombinant DNA
technology may also be used to remove some or all of the DNA encoding either or both
of the light and heavy chains that is not necessary for binding, e.g., the constant region.
               The present nuceic acids can be expressed in various suitable cells, including
prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, e.g., bacterial cells, (e.g., E. coli), yeast cells, plant cells,
insect cells, and mammalian cells. A number of mammalian cell lines are known in the
art and include immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). Non-limiting examples of the cells include all cell lines of
mammalian origin or mammalian-like characteristics, including but not limited to,
parental cells, derivatives and/or engineered variants of monkey kidney cells (COS, e.g.,
COS-1, COS-7), HEK293, baby hamster kidney (BHK, e.g., BHK21), Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO), NSO, PerC6, BSC-1, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2),
SP2/0, HeLa, Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK), myeloma and lymphoma cells. The
engineered variants include, e.g., glycan profile modified and/or site-specific integration
site derivatives.

              The present invention provides for methods for making an antibody or antigen
binding portion thereof that specifically binds to toxin A of C. difficile. For example, a
non-human animal is immunized with a composition that includes an inactivated toxin A,
and then a specific antibody is isolated from the animal. The method can further include
evaluating binding of the antibody to toxin A.
              Any of a variety of Clostridium difficile toxin proteins, particularly toxin A, may
be used in the practice of the present invention. C. difficile disease is mediated primarily
by toxin A and toxin B. Both toxins are cytotoxic, and lethal when injected intravenously
or intraperitoneally into a mouse. Toxin A is also a potent enterotoxin, as demonstrated
by the induction of fluid accumulation in the mouse ligated intestinal loop diarrhea
model. See, e.g., Babcock, G.J. et al., Infection and Immunity, 74: 6339-6347 (2006) and
references contained therein for background.

              In one embodiment, the present invention provides for a method for making a
hybridoma that expresses an antibody that specifically binds to toxin A of C. difficile.
The method contains the following steps: immunizing an animal with a composition that
includes inactivated toxin A (e.g., toxoid A); isolating splenocytes from the animal;
generating hybridomas from the splenocytes; and selecting a hybridoma that produces an
antibody that specifically binds to toxin A. Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256: 495, 1975.

              Toxins can be inactivated, for example, by treatment with formaldehyde,
glutaraldehyde, UDP-dialdehyde, peroxide, oxygen or by mutation (e.g., using
recombinant methods). Relyveld et al., Methods in Enzymology, 93:24, 1983. Woodrow
and Levine, eds., New Generation Vaccines, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1990.

reduced toxicity can be produced using recombinant methods. U.S. Patent Nos.

fragment of the toxins or toxoids can be used as immunogens.
              In one embodiment, inactivated toxin A is used to immunize mice
intraperitoneally or intravenously. One or more boosts may or may not be given. The
titers of the antibodies in the plasma can be monitored by, e.g., ELISA (enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay) or flow cytometry. Mice with sufficient titers of anti-toxin A
antibodies are used for fusions. Mice may or may not be boosted with antigen 3 days
before sacrifice and removal of the spleen. The mouse splenocytes are isolated and fused
with PEG to a mouse myeloma cell line. The resulting hybridomas are then screened for
the production of antigen-specific antibodies. Cells are plated, and then incubated in
selective medium. Supernatants from individual wells are then screened by ELISA for
human anti-toxin monoclonal antibodies. The antibody secreting hybridomas are replated,
screened again, and if still positive for anti-toxin monoclonal antibodies, can be
subcloned by limiting dilution. For example, the hybridoma clone CAN20G2 of the
present invention has been subcloned. One of the subclones is CAN20G2-2-1.
              Adjuvants that may be used to increase the immunogenicity of one or more of the
Clostridium difficile toxin antigens, particularly toxin A include any compound or
compounds that act to increase an immune response to peptides or combination of
peptides. Non-limiting examples of adjuvants include alum, aluminum phosphate,
aluminum hydroxide, MF59 (4.3% w/v squalene, 0.5% w/v polysorbate 80 (Tween 80),

              The immunized animal can be any animal that is capable of producing
recoverable antibodies when administered an immunogen, such as, but not limited to,
rabbits, mice, rats, hamsters, goats, horses, monkeys, baboons and humans. In one
aspect, the host is transgenic and produces human antibodies, e.g., a mouse expressing
the human immunoglobulin gene segments. U.S. Patent No. 8,236,311; 7,625,559 and
5,770,429, the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety. Lonberg et al., Nature 368(6474): 856-859, 1994. Lonberg, N., Handbook of

             After the host is immunized and the antibodies are produced, the antibodies are
assayed to confirm that they are specific for the antigen of interest and to determine
whether they exhibit any cross reactivity with other antigens. One method of conducting
such assays is a sera screen assay as described in U.S. Patent Publication No.
2004/0126829. Anti-toxin antibodies can be characterized for binding to the toxin by a
variety of known techniques. For example, in an ELISA, microtiter plates are coated with
the toxin or toxoid antigen in PBS, and then blocked with irrelevant proteins such as
bovine serum albumin (BSA) diluted in PBS. Dilutions of plasma from toxin-immunized

mice are added to each well and incubated. The plates are washed and then incubated
with a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase). After
washing, the plates are developed with the enzyme's substrate (e.g., ABTS), and analyzed
at a specific OD. In other embodiments, to determine if the selected monoclonal
antibodies bind to unique epitopes, the antibody can be biotinylated which can then be
detected with a streptavidin labeled probe. Anti-toxin antibodies can be tested for
reactivity with the toxin by Western blotting.
              Neutralization assays can also be used to measure activity of the anti-toxin
antibodies. For example, in vitro neutralization assays can be used to measure the ability
of an antibody to inhibit a cytopathic effect on cells in culture (see Examples 7 and 12
below). In one embodiment, the present antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, at a
concentration ranging from about 1 pM to about 50 pM, from about 2 pM to about 40
pM, from about 3 pM to about 30 pM, from about 4 pM to about 20 pM, from about 4
pM to about 17 pM, from about 5 pM to about 15 pM, or about 10 pM neutralizes
greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, greater than
about 50%, greater than about 60%, greater than about 70%, greater than about 80%, or
greater than about 90% of about 150 ng/ml C. difficile toxin A in an in vitro
neutralization assay. In vivo assays can be used to measure toxin neutralization as well.
In another embodiment, in an in vivo toxin A challenge experiment (e.g., procedures as
described in Examples 5, 6, and 7, as well as Babcock et al., Human Monoclonal
Antibodies Directed against Toxins A and B prevent Clostridium difficile-Induced
Mortality in Hamsters. Infection and Immunity (2006) 74(11):6339), when the antibody,
or an antigen-binding portion thereof, is administered to a mammal at a dosage ranging
from about 1 mg/kg body weight to about 50 mg/kg body weight, from about 2 mg/kg
body weight to about 40 mg/kg body weight, from about 3 mg/kg body weight to about
30 mg/kg body weight, from about 5 mg/kg body weight to about 20 mg/kg body weight,
from about 8 mg/kg body weight to about 13 mg/kg body weight, or about 10 mg/kg
body weight about 24 hours before the mammal is exposed to greater than about 100 ng,

than about 40%, greater than about 50%, greater than about 60%, greater than about 70%,
greater than about 80%, or greater than about 90% within about 7 days.
              Hybridomas that produce antibodies that bind, preferably with high affinity, to the
toxin can than be subcloned and further characterized. One clone from each hybridoma,
which retains the reactivity of the parent cells (by ELISA), can then be chosen for making
a cell bank, and for antibody purification.
              To purify the anti-toxin antibodies, supernatants from the cultured hybridomas
can be filtered and concentrated before affinity chromatography with protein A
Sepharose (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.).
              Antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments, variants or derivatives thereof of the
present disclosure can also be described or specified in terms of their binding affinity to
an antigen. The affinity of an antibody for an antigen can be determined experimentally
using any suitable method (see, e.g., Berzofsky et al., "Antibody-Antigen Interactions,"
In Fundamental Immunology, Paul, W. E., Ed., Raven Press: New York, N.Y. (1984);
Kuby, Janis Immunology, W. H. Freeman and Company: New York, N.Y. (1992); and
methods described herein). The measured affinity of a particular antibody-antigen
interaction can vary if measured under different conditions (e.g., salt concentration, pH).
Thus, measurements of affinity and other antigen-binding parameters (e.g., KD, Ka, Kd)
are preferably made with standardized solutions of antibody and antigen, and a
standardized buffer.
              The present antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof have in vitro and in
vivo therapeutic, prophylactic, and/or diagnostic utilities. For example, these antibodies
can be administered to cells in culture, e.g., in vitro or ex vivo, or to a subject, e.g., in
vivo, to treat, inhibit, prevent relapse, and/or diagnose C. difficile and disease associated
with C. difficile.
              The antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof can be used on cells in culture,
e.g., in vitro or ex vivo. For example, cells can be cultured in vitro in culture medium and

contacted by the anti-toxin antibody or fragment thereof. The methods can be performed
on cells present in a subject, as part of an in vivo (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic)
protocol. For in vivo embodiments, the contacting step is effected in a subject and
includes administering an anti-toxin antibody or portion thereof to the subject under
conditions effective to permit binding of the antibody, or portion thereof, to a toxin (e.g.,
toxin A) expressed by C. difficile in the subject, e.g., in the gut.
              The antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof can be administered alone or in
combination with another therapeutic agent, e.g., a second monoclonal or polyclonal
antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof. In one example, the antibody or antigen
binding portion thereof specifically binds to C. difficile toxin A is combined with a
antibody (monoclonal or polyclonal) or antigen-binding portion thereof specifically binds
to C. difficile toxin B. In another example, the second agent is an antibiotic, e.g.,
vancomycin, bacitracin or metronidazole. The antibodies can be used in combination with
probiotic agents such as Saccharomyces boulardii. The antibodies can also be
administered in combinations with a C. difficile vaccine, e.g., a toxoid vaccine.
              The present invention also provides compositions containing an antibody or
antigen-binding portion thereof described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier. The composition may contain an isolated nucleic acid encoding the present
antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include any and all solvents, dispersion media,
isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible.
In one embodiment, the composition is effective to reduce, eliminate, or prevent
Clostridium difficile bacterial infection in a subject.
              The invention also features methods of treating C. difficile disease in a subject by
administering to the subject the present antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof in an
amount effective to inhibit C. difficile disease. Routes of administration of the present
compositions include, but are not limited to, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous,

              The compositions of the present invention can be prepared as injectables, either as
liquid solutions or suspensions, or as solid forms which are suitable for solution or
suspension in liquid vehicles prior to injection. The composition can also be prepared in
solid form, emulsified or the active ingredient encapsulated in liposome vehicles or other
particulate carriers used for sustained delivery. For example, the composition can be in
the form of an oil emulsion, water-in-oil emulsion, water-in-oil-in-water emulsion, site

as ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers and Hytrel@ copolymers, swellable polymers such
as hydrogels, or resorbable polymers such as collagen and certain polyacids or polyesters
such as those used to make resorbable sutures, that allow for sustained release of the
vaccine.
              The present antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof are formulated into
compositions for delivery to a mammalian subject. The composition is administered
alone, and/or mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or excipient. Suitable
vehicles are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like, and
combinations thereof. In addition, the vehicle can contain minor amounts of auxiliary
substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, or adjuvants. The
compositions of the present invention can also include ancillary substances, such as
pharmacological agents, cytokines, or other biological response modifiers.
              Furthermore, the compositions can be formulated into compositions in either
neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts
(formed with the free amino groups of the active polypeptides) and which are formed

              Compositions can be administered in a single dose treatment or in multiple dose
treatments on a schedule and over a time period appropriate to the age, weight and
condition of the subject, the particular composition used, and the route of administration.
              In one embodiment, a single dose of the composition according to the invention is
administered. In other embodiments, multiple doses are administered. The frequency of
administration can vary depending on any of a variety of factors, e.g., severity of the
symptoms, degree of immunoprotection desired, whether the composition is used for
prophylactic or curative purposes, etc. For example, in one embodiment, the composition
according to the invention is administered once per month, twice per month, three times
per month, every other week (qow), once per week (qw), twice per week (biw), three
times per week (tiw), four times per week, five times per week, six times per week, every
other day (qod), daily (qd), twice a day (qid), or three times a day (tid).
              The duration of administration of a polypeptide according to the invention, e.g.,
the period of time over which the composition is administered, can vary, depending on
any of a variety of factors, e.g., subject response, etc. For example, the composition can
be administered over a period of time ranging from about one day to about one week,
from about two weeks to about four weeks, from about one month to about two months,
from about two months to about four months, from about four months to about six
months, from about six months to about eight months, from about eight months to about
 1 year, from about 1 year to about 2 years, or from about 2 years to about 4 years, or
more.

              The compositions can be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
(excipient) to form a pharmacological composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers
can contain a physiologically acceptable compound that acts to, e.g., stabilize, or increase
or decrease the absorption or clearance rates of the pharmaceutical compositions of the
invention. Physiologically acceptable compounds can include, e.g., carbohydrates, such
as glucose, sucrose, or dextrans, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid or glutathione,
chelating agents, low molecular weight proteins, detergents, liposomal carriers, or
excipients or other stabilizers and/or buffers. Other physiologically acceptable
compounds include wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents or
preservatives. See e.g., the 21st edition of Remington' s Pharmaceutical Science, Mack
Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. ("Remington' s").
              In one aspect, a solution of the composition are dissolved in a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier, e.g., an aqueous carrier if the composition is water-soluble. Examples
of aqueous solutions include, e.g., water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, Hank' s
solution, Ringer' s solution, dextrose/saline, glucue solutions and the like. The
formulations can contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to
approximate physiological conditions, such as buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents,
wetting agents, detergents and the like. Additives can also include additional active
ingredients such as bactericidal agents, or stabilizers. For example, the solution can
contain sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium
chloride, sorbitan monolaurate or triethanolamine oleate.
              Solid formulations can be used in the present invention. They can be formulated
as, e.g., pills, tablets, powders or capsules. For solid compositions, conventional solid
carriers can be used which include, e.g., mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate,
sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like.
Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include e.g., starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose,
sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate,

              When administered orally, the present compositions may be protected from
digestion. This can be accomplished either by complexing the antibody or antigen
binding portion thereof with a composition to render it resistant to acidic and enzymatic
hydrolysis or by packaging the antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof in an
appropriately resistant carrier such as a liposome. Means of protecting compounds from
digestion are well known in the art. Fix, Pharm Res. 13: 1760-1764, 1996. Samanen, J.
Pharm. Pharmacol. 48: 119-135, 1996. U.S. Patent No. 5,391,377.
              For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the
barrier to be permeated can be used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally
known in the art, and include, e.g., for transmucosal administration, bile salts and fusidic
acid derivatives. In addition, detergents can be used to facilitate permeation.
Transmucosal administration can be through nasal sprays or using suppositories. Sayani,
Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. 13: 85-184, 1996. For topical, transdermal
administration, the agents are formulated into ointments, creams, salves, powders and
gels. Transdermal delivery systems can also include, e.g., patches.
              The present compositions can also be administered in sustained delivery or
sustained release mechanisms. For example, biodegradeable microspheres or capsules or
other biodegradeable polymer configurations capable of sustained delivery of a peptide
can be included in the formulations of the invention (see, e.g., Putney, Nat. Biotechnol.

form of an aerosol or mist. For aerosol administration, the formulation can be supplied in
finely divided form along with a surfactant and propellant. In another aspect, the device
for delivering the formulation to respiratory tissue is an inhaler in which the formulation
vaporizes. Other liquid delivery systems include, e.g., air jet nebulizers.
              Compositions or nucleic acids, polypeptides, or antibodies of the invention can be
delivered alone or as pharmaceutical compositions by any means known in the art, e.g.,
systemically, regionally, or locally; by intra-arterial, intrathecal (IT), intravenous (IV),
parenteral, intra-pleural cavity, topical, oral, or local administration, as subcutaneous,
intra-tracheal (e.g., by aerosol) or transmucosal (e.g., buccal, bladder, vaginal, uterine,
rectal, nasal mucosa). For a "regional effect," e.g., to focus on a specific organ, one mode
of administration includes intra-arterial or intrathecal (IT) injections, e.g., to focus on a
specific organ, e.g., brain and CNS (see e.g., Gurun, Anesth Analg. 85: 317-323, 1997).
For example, intra-carotid artery injection can be used where it is desired to deliver a
nucleic acid, peptide or polypeptide of the invention directly to the brain. Actual methods
for preparing parenterally administrable compositions will be known or apparent to those
skilled in the art and are described in detail. Bai, J. Neuroimmunol. 80: 65-75, 1997.

              In one aspect, the compositions are prepared with carriers that will protect the
peptide against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation,
including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable,
biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides,
polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation
of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Liposomal suspensions
can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811.
              It is advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit
form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used
herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be
treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to
produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical
carrier.
              The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in
formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. In one embodiment, the dosage of such
compounds lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED 50 with
little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage
form employed and the route of administration utilized. In another embodiment, the
therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose

              An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically
effective amount of an antibody or antigen-binding portion of the invention is from about
0.001 to about 60 mg/kg body weight, about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg body weight, about

               The composition is formulated to contain an effective amount of the present
antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof, wherein the amount depends on the animal
to be treated and the condition to be treated. In one embodiment, the present antibody or
antigen-binding portion thereof is administered at a dose ranging from about 0.01 mg to
about 10 g, from about 0.1 mg to about 9 g, from about 1 mg to about 8 g, from about 1

the specific peptide, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of
administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the
severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.
              In therapeutic applications, the present compositions are administered to a subject
at risk for Clostridium difficile bacterial infection or suffering from active infection in an
amount sufficient to at least partially arrest or prevent the condition or a disease and/or its
complications.
              An anti-toxin antibody (e.g., monoclonal antibody) can also be used to isolate
toxins by standard techniques, such as affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation.
Moreover, an anti-toxin antibody can be used to detect the toxin, e.g., to screen samples
(e.g., in a stool sample) for the presence of C. difficile. Anti-toxin antibodies can be used
diagnostically to monitor levels of the toxin in tissue as part of a clinical testing
procedure, e.g., to, for example, determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen.
              The invention also provides kits containing an anti-toxin antibody or antigen
binding portion thereof. Additional components of the kits may include one or more of
the following: instructions for use; other reagents, a therapeutic agent, or an agent useful
for coupling an antibody to a label or therapeutic agent, or other materials for preparing
the antibody for administration; pharmaceutically acceptable carriers; and devices or
other materials for administration to a subject.
              Various combinations of antibodies can be packaged together. For example, a kit
can include antibodies that bind to toxin A and antibodies that bind to toxin B (e.g.,
monoclonal anti-toxin B antibodies, or polyclonal antisera reactive with toxin B). The
antibodies can be mixed together, or packaged separately within the kit.
              Instructions for use can include instructions for therapeutic application including
suggested dosages and/or modes of administration, e.g., in a patient with a symptom of
CDAD. Other instructions can include instructions on coupling of the antibody to a label

possible components of the kit include expression vectors and cells.
               The present antibodies, antigen-binding portions thereof, compositions and
methods can be used in all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non-mammals, including
human, mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, dogs, cats, cows, horses, goats, sheep, pigs,

EXAMPLES
Example 1: Hybridoma Fusion
              A classical hybridoma fusion was performed. Mice receive their first
immunization with toxoid A using Complete Freund' s Adjuvat (CFA) and two
subsequent boosters on days 28 and 48 with toxoid A and Incomplete Freund' s Adjuvant
(IFA). A trial bleed was performed at day 55 and the serum was tested to check for titres
of anti-toxoid A antibody. If IgG titres were high enough fusions were performed. If not,
mice received two more boosts with IFA and a second trial bleed was taken. Fusions
were performed using 2 mice at a time. Mice were given a final push intraperitoneally
(i.p.) with toxoid A in PBS three days prior to the fusion.
              On the day of the fusion, mice are sacrificed and their spleens removed.
Splenocytes are washed from the spleen using a syringe and needle and collected in a 50
ml tube for fusion with myeloma cells. Myelomas are an immortal tumor cell line used as
fusion partners, grown in the presence of 8-azaguanine, a toxic nucleotide analog which
blocks the salvage pathway. Cells grown in the presence of 8-aza survive only by
incurring defective mutations in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase
(HGPRT) gene. B cells are fused with the myeloma cells using Polyethylene Glycol
(PEG) 1500. Fused cells are mixed into semi-solid agarose with drug selection and plated
out into petri dishes. HAT media containing Hypoxanthine, Aminopterin, and Thymidine
is used for drug selection. Aminopterin is a drug which inhibits the de novo pathway for
nucleotide metabolism which is absolutely required for survival/cell growth in myeloma
lines defective in HGPRT, and allows selection usually within 24-48 hours.
Example 2: Hybridoma Screening
              The next step is screening of the growing hybridomas. A commercial semisolid
agarose within which the cells grow as "balls" of cells in the 3 -D matrix was used. This
facilitates the picking of these balls by hand (by visual inspection) and transferring these

                                                       - 65
clonal balls into a 96 well plate containing suitable media. The cells were allowed to
grow for 3-7 days and then the supernatant removed for screening and replaced with fresh
media. Positive binding in ELISA (or other tests) resulted in continuing to grow the
hybridomas by transferring them up into larger tissue culture vessels with increasing
volume. The mAbs were isotyped using a suitable commercial isotyping kit for murine
mAbs using the spent supernatant. The decision to move a clone to the next stage of
selection is based on its reactivity to native toxin A using an ELISA and its survival,
usually based upon serial dilutions and reactivity of at least 1/8 or 1/16 or higher, as well
as IgG class; therefore the number of clones decreased throughout the selection
procedure. The mAbs that underwent further characterization were: CAN20G2,
CAN20G1, CAN20G5 & CAN20G8 and CAN19G1, CAN19G2, CAN19G3.
Example 3: ELISA Assay of Mouse Monoclonal Antibodies
              An ELISA was used to test the binding of the toxA mAbs against whole toxin A
and recombinant toxin A fragment 4 as well as to determine if they were cross-reactive to
whole toxin B and toxin B fragment 4. The mAb clones were compared to CDA1 (Merck
anti-toxin A mAb used as a control). The ELISA plate was coated with 100 pg/ml of
Toxin fragment 4 and 400 pg/ml of whole Toxin so that the coatings were equimolar. The
wells were blocked with 1% skim milk then probed with serially diluted CAN 19 or
CAN20 mAbs (0.1 pg/ml tot ptg/ml) and binding was detected with a commercial goat
anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody. Negative and positive controls were also run. The
chimeric human mAb 13C6 is specific to Ebolavirus GP and served as the negative
control for human the Fc of CDA- 1. The CDA- 1 mAb and the polyclonal toxoid A
antibody (pAb) served as positive controls, however, the CDA-1 mAb is human and the
polyclonal is rabbit, thus, they both used a different secondary antibody making direct
comparisons between them and the murine mAbs impossible. The secondary antibody
control is for the murine secondary antibody. The plate was read at 405 nm after 60 min
incubation with substrate. The titration data for each antibody is shown in Figure 1.

               Results: As shown in Figures 2 and 3, CAN19G1 and CAN19G2 mAbs bind to
whole toxin A and toxin A fragment 4 at a similar level to CDA1. The CAN19 mAbs
showed little cross-reactivity to toxin B. CAN20 mAbs bind to toxin A. CAN20G2 and
CAN20G5 bind to toxin A fragment 4 at a similar level to CDA1. None of CAN20
mAbs showed cross-reactivity to toxin B.
Example 4: Western Blot of Mouse Monoclonal Antibodies
              A 4-12% SDS-PAGE gel was run for 1.5 hours at 200 volts with a combination of
C.difficile proteins; whole toxin A, toxoid A (commercial), recombinant toxin fragment 4
and toxin B (whole, toxoid and fragment 4). The gel was then transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane for 45 min at 45 volts. The membrane was blocked overnight at
4'C with 1% skim milk in 1xTBST and the next day washed with 1xTBST to remove the
skim milk. The mAbs (1 Ab) were diluted in 1xTBST at a concentration of l pg/ml and
used to probe the membrane containing the transferred products for 2 hours at room
temperature (RT) on a shaker. The membranes were then washed with 1xTBST to
remove unbound 10 Ab and probed with anti-mouse IgG-HRP (2' Ab) at a dilution of
 1:4000 for 1 hour at RT on a shaker.
               Results: As shown in Figures 4 and 5, all three CAN19 mAbs showed binding to
whole toxin A, toxoid A and toxin A fragment 4. They all showed only weak or no
cross-reactivity to toxin B or to the negative control. CAN20G1, CAN20G2, CAN20G5
and CAN20G8 mAbs all showed strong binding to whole toxin A and toxin A fragment
4. There was no cross-reactivity to toxin B or to the negative control.
Example 5: Affinity Analysis of Mouse Monoclonal Antibodies
               Biolayer interferometry was used to measure the interactions between whole
Toxin A and the anti-toxin A antibodies. The Octet QKe instrument (ForteBio) was
equipped with Streptavidin (SA) biosensors. 40pg/ml of biotinylated whole Toxin A was
coupled to SA sensors and the toxin A mAbs, in a dilution series from 100 nM to 1.56

nM, were reacted on the toxin-coated pins for 10 minutes followed by a dissociation step
in PBS for another 10 minutes. The results were then analyzed using ForteBio Data
Analysis software to determine the dissociation constant (KD), which is the measure used
to describe the binding strength between antibody and antigen, ko            0 (1/Ms), the on-rate at
which antibody antigen complexes form, and kdis(1/s), the off-rate at which the antibody
antigen complexes dissociate. The samples were run over two separate days. Table 4
shows affinity data for purified CAN20G versions, as well as CDA1.

Example 6: Epitope Binning of Mouse Monoclonal Antibodies
               The Octet QKe is a label free real-time biosensor that uses disposable fiber-optic
sensors that detect biomolecular interactions via biolayer interferometry. The epitope
binning assay was performed against the previously characterized CDA1 anti-toxin A
mAb to examine whether the present toxin A mAbs share a similar or a different epitope
with CDA- 1. Secondly, the assay was used to confirm shared single or potentially
multiple epitope bins between the toxin A mAbs. The classical sandwich method was
used and involves coupling the mAb to sensor, binding antigen, and then binding to
another mAb. The second mAb can bind the captured Ag only if its epitope does not
overlap that of the immobilized mAb.
               Results: The strong nM shift in wavelength above the CAN20G1 and PBS control
(a vertical increase in the binding curve) indicates more binding is able to occur and that
the test antibody is binding to an exposed and distinct epitope. As shown in Figures 6a
and 6b, the results indicate that there is an elevated shift in wavelength for the CDA1

antibody. This indicates that the CDA1 and CAN20 mAbs bind to distinct epitopes. All
the CAN20 mAbs share the same epitope. There is a slight nm elevation for the
CAN20G2 indicating a slight increase in binding which could be due to a somatic
mutation between the known VH and VL chains of CAN20G1 and CAN20G2, different
antibody epitopes or both.

              Sample addition to cell plates: (1) Following 1 hour incubation, cell plates were
removed from incubator. (2) Removed 50 pL of cell suspension carefully with
multichannel pipette being sure not to disturb cell monolayer. (3) Transfered 100 pL of
samples from dilution plate to appropriate wells of cell plate. (4) Mixed on plate shaker
for a homogeneous solution. Incubated 72 hours at 37'C with a 5% C02 overlay.
              Data analysis: The xCelligence system captures data in real-time. For the
purposes of comparison to the conventional bioassay methods, the final read time data is
analyzed. For this, we normalized the cell index at the time point before toxin / antibody
addition to the plate, using the appropriate toxin wells as baseline. This will create a
baseline normalized cell index on the Y axis versus log concentration of antibody.
We analyzed the data to determine potency of CAN 19 mAbs in comparison to CDA.
% Neutralization is calculated as follows with xCelligence:
% Neutralization = (Sample CI index / Antibody Control CI index) * 100
% Neutralization is calculated as follows with Bioassay fluorescence:
% Neutralization = (Mean Sample RFU/ Mean Toxin RFU)/ (Mean Cell RFU/ Mean

Example 8: Mouse in vivo toxin challenge
                    The mouse in vivo toxin challenge test was based on previous publications
(Babcock et al., Human Monoclonal Antibodies Directed against Toxins A and B prevent
Clostridium difficile-Induced Mortality in Hamsters. Infection and Immunity (2006)
74(11):6339). Swiss webster mice weighing 20-30 g were given 250 pg of mAb or
controls at day 0 and allowed to rest. After 24 hrs (day 1), the mice were given a lethal
dose of TcdA (100 ng). This dose kills 90-100% of animals by 24 hours in an unprotected
state. The mice were observed for 7 days (days 1 - 7) for signs of abnormality and local
and systemic disease. The mice were euthanized on Day 7. All observations were
recorded and the % survival was determined for each treatment group.
                    Results: As shown in Figures 7, 8, and 9, the study results indicate that the
CAN 19 and CAN20 mAbs protect mice against toxin A. There was > 90% survival with

CAN19G1, G2 and G3. All three CAN19 mAbs showed efficacy. All the CAN20 mAbs
were efficacious. CAN20G1, G2, G5 and G8 showed 100% protection at a dose of 0.25
mg/mouse. CAN20G2 showed 100% protection at 0.125 mg/mouse. The experiment was
repeated to confirm the efficacy of CAN20G2. The results confirmed the previous study.
CAN20G2 showed 100% protection at the full does of 0.25 mg/mouse and 90%
protection at the half dose 0.125 mg/mouse.
Example 9: muCAN20G2 V Gene Sequencing
                    RNA was isolated from the CAN20G2 parental hybridoma clonal cell line
using the RNeasy Mini Kit. The amplification of V genes from the RNA was performed
using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Kit. Several combinations of primer sets were used as
follows: for immunoglobulin variable region gene sequence confirmation from the
hybridomas, a set of Variable region gene (V-gene) subgroup-specific oligonucleotide
primers are used. These include 5' mVKLead-1, 3' KappaConstRT, 5' mVkLead-2,
5' mVHLead-2A, and 3' mIG 12C RT. In order to rule out potential contamination from
the known and endogenous aberrant kappa light chain V-gene mRNA (found within
P3X63 myelomas) (Yuan, X. et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 294: 199-207 (2004)), the RT
PCR was also performed using non-subgroup specific primer sets, 5' mVKLead-1A,
5' mVKLead-1A, 5' mVKLead-3, 5' mVKLead-3A, 5' mVHIGHV1-Lead, 5' mVH
Lead-1, 5' mVHLead-3, 5' mVHLead-4, and 5' mVHLead-5. Refer to Figure 10 for a
list of the primers and their sequences. The results of the PCR amplification reactions
were determined by examining the PCR products on an analytical agarose gel, and the
visualized bands at approximately 500bp were gel isolated for cloning. The extracted
DNA was directly TA cloned into the pCR2. 1-TOPO vector using the low melt agarose
method in the TOPO TA Cloning manual. Five colonies of each CAN20G clone reaction
were sequenced in both directions using the M13 Forward and M13 Reverse primers.
Sequence data was analyzed using DNAStar Lasergene software. The resulting
rearranged V-gene sequences were compared to IMGT/V-Quest reference directory sets
and to the NCBI immunoglobulin blast search (Figure 11).

Example 10: Humanization of muCAN20G2
                      Three humanized IgG/k versions of CAN20G2 mAb have been created as
well as a chimeric IgG 1/k. For the humanized versions, maximum identity alignment
with human germline alleles was used (from the IMGT and NCBI websites) to help to
identify acceptor frameworks. All 6 CDRs were inserted. Other residues were changed or
maintained due to surface exposure or involvement in folding or interchain contacts,
respectively. The CDRs of the murine mAb sequence (CAN20G2) match very well with
the germline CDRs of the closest human alleles. This resembles the "superhumanization"
approach where CDR matching rather than total framework is used in a variation of the
use of germline sequences as acceptor frameworks. In the case of Tan et al., J. Immunol.
2002, 169:1119-1125, the authors used the CDR sequences and tried to match the so
called canonical classes of CDRs based upon the Chothia classification system. However,
because particular CDRs are germline encoded and particular canonical conformations
tend to be found in certain frameworks, the "Superhumanization" method of choosing
acceptor frameworks does not in all cases result in the selection of a different candidate
acceptor framework. It is empirical and remains to be tested for multiple mAb
specificities. This is in part because the straight-up alignment of frameworks for identity
inherently encompasses the CDRs as well in the comparison. Table 11 shows the percent
humanness, at the amino acid level, of each of the humanized constructs of CAN20G2.

Figure 12 shows the alignment of muCAN20G2 v-regions with the closest human
germline v-region. The human germlines were used as acceptor frameworks for
humanization.
                     CDR-huCAN20G2 - CDR Grafted only. The best matching germline allele
for both VH and Vk were used as an acceptor framework for grafting the CDRs. No other
changes were made to the acceptor frameworks. Figures 13a and 13b show the design of
the CDR-huCAN20G2 design we used. The closest matching human frameworks are
IGHV7-4-1*02 and IGKV1-39*01. The CDRs (IMGT Numbering) of the muCAN20G2
were inserted into the human framework. The heavy CDR3 contained a HpaI restriction
site that was altered for cloning into pcDNA3002Neo. A 5' Kozak and HAVT20 leader
sequence was added for correct translation and trafficking.
                     HE-huCAN20G2 "Human engineered" This humanized version was generated
using a strategy most similar to the "human engineering" strategy used by Studnicka et al
(1994) used to humanize a murine mAb to CD5. Essentially, the closest human germline
allele for both CAN20G2 VH and Vk were identified, individually, and designed for use
as acceptor frameworks. The CAN20G2 VH has a 76% identity with the human IgVH7-4
 1*02 allele. The CDRs were grafted or altered to match the CAN20G2 mAb sequences.
The HE-hCAN20G2 antibodies are shown in Figures 14, 15, and 16. Some residues were
modified or maintained as described in the legend. In this case, crystal structural
inference was taken from Avastin / Bevacizumab. Avastin is a humanized monoclonal
antibody that recognizes and blocks vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and
is marketed for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Avastin turns out to have
highest identity with the same human germline gene as CAN20G2 VH and the crystal
structure of its variable region structure has been determined.

humanized capitalizing on the natural sequence pairing of VH and VL found in other
mAbs with crystal structural data. In this case, we used the same VH as in Version 1 - HE
(which has high identity with Avastin VH), and we used the Avastin Vk as the Light chain
acceptor framework. This allowed us to exploit the known interchain contacts and
modification in our design (Figure 18).
                      Chimeric-huCAN20G2 Chimeric Version: A chimeric CAN20G2 was
designed as a control. Certain residues outside the CDRs are involved in the structure of
the hypervariable regions. During the humanization process some of the residues may be
altered. Because sequence variation within the canonical structures will modulate the
conformation of the paratope, it is essential to determine whether the loss/gain in
affinity/function/neutralization is due to the humanization process or the human Fc
region. The CAN20G2 murine v-regions were designed onto human IgGI and human
Kappa constant regions. The construct contains Kozak, HAVT20 Leader and double stop
sequences (Figures 19A and 19B).
Example 11: SDS Page and Western Blot Analyses of Humanized Antibodies
                    A large scale transfection (300ml) was performed in HEK293F cells to obtain
a large quantity of each huCAN20G2 mAb. A total of 3x 108 cells were transfected with
300 pg of huCAN20G2 plasmid DNA. The supernatant was harvested by centrifugation
(3000 rpm, 15 min, RT) 3 days and 7 days post-transfection. The transfected supernatant
was filtered through a 0.22 pm filter. The filtered sup was purified on a Protein G column
(HiTRAP HP, GE Healthcare) using the AktaPurifier FPLC. The eluted protein was
buffer exchanged into D-PBS and the concentration determined by BCA assay. A range
of 30-45 mg was purified from the 300 ml cultures. The purified protein was run on an
SDS-page to confirm its size (Figure 22). The purified mAb was also used to probe a
membrane with whole toxin A and toxin A fragment 4 to confirm the binding
characteristics of the mAbs (Figure 23).

                     An in vitro neutralization assay for C.difficile Toxins using CT-26 cells was
performed to test the neutralization capability of the humanized mAb clones against C.
difficile toxin A. The CT-26 cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a concentration of 2.5
3x10 4 cells/100ul/well and the plate was incubated in a CO 2 incubator for 4-5 hrs at 37'C.
Two blank wells containing only media (no cells) were also included in the plate.
                     The toxin and toxin/Ab mixtures were prepared in tubes and diluted to the
desired concentrations using RPMI media. The tubes were left to incubate at room
temperature for 1 hour. The media was removed from the wells of the plate and each of
the tubes, containing either media alone, toxin alone, or toxin/Ab mixtures, was
transferred to its designated well. The plates were left to incubate for 48 hours at 37'C
and 5% CO 2. The WST-1 detection reagent was added to each well (10 pl of reagent/100
  tl volume in the well) and incubated for 1 hour at 370C and 5% CO 2. The plate was
shaken for 1 min and then read at 450 nm.
Cell viability was determined based on the cell controls as below:
% Cell viability =Mean OD of test/MeanOD of cell control x 100.
Toxin neutralization is calculated by the formula as below:
    % Neutralization = (Sample OD - Toxin control OD)/ (Cell control OD - toxin control
OD)* 100
                     Results: As shown in Figures 20a and 20b, the chimeric CAN20G2 and the
HE-CAN20G2 are the most neutralizing at all mAb concentrations. The HE-CAN20G2 is
more neutralizing at most mAb concentrations at either Toxin A concentration. The
Medarex CDA IgG and the hCDR mAbs show similar modest neutralization ability and
the AVA-CAN20G2 shows very little neutralization ability.

Example 13: Affinity Assay of Humanized Antibodies
                    Biolayer interferometry was used to measure the interactions between whole
Toxin A and the humanized CAN20G2 antibodies. The Octet QKe instrument was
equipped with Streptavidin (SA) biosensors. 40 pg/ml of biotinylated whole Toxin A was
coupled to SA sensors and the humanized versions, in a dilution series from 100nM to
 1.56nM, was allowed to associate with the toxin for 10 minutes followed by a
dissociation step in PBS for another 10 minutes. The results were then analyzed using
ForteBio Data Analysis software to determine KD (nM), the measure used to describe the
binding strength between antibody and antigen, ko,(1/Ms), the rate at which antibody
antigen complexes form, and kdi(1/s), the rate at which the antibody antigen complexes
dissociate.
                    Results: The results from two experiments were averaged and show that the
muCAN20G2 and the chCAN20G2 are within threefold indicating no loss in affinity
(Table 10). In contrast, the AVA-CAN20G2 showed almost a full log loss in affinity. The
CDR-huCAN20G2 showed loss in affinity nearing that of the AVA humanized version.
The binding affinity of the HE-huCAN20G2 version is slightly higher than all the other
humanized versions but within the acceptable threefold range showing little or no loss of
affinity compared to the chimeric CAN20G2. We believe this is the optimal comparator
because we cannot predict the effects of exchanging the human constant regions for the
murine IgG2a constant regions and this comparison takes this into account. The three fold
range comparison is considered by the ForteBio experts as insiginificant variation.

Example 14: ELISA Testing of Humanized Antibodies
                     A medium scale (150 ml) transfection was performed in HEK293F cells to
test for expression of the huCAN20G2 mAb. A total of 1.5x108 cells were transfected
with 150 pg of DNA. The supernatant was harvested by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 15
min, RT) 3 days and 7 days post-transfection. The transfected supernatant was filtered
through a 0.22 pm filter. The filtered supernatant from the medium scale transfection was
screened with an ELISA prior to purification. An ELISA was run to test the binding of
the human mAb clones against whole toxin A and toxin A fragment 4. The human mAb
clones were compared to CDA1 and the chimeric CAN20G2. The ELISA plate was
coated with 100 pg/ml of Toxin A fragment 4 and 400 tg/ml of whole Toxin A so that
the coats were equimolar. The coats were probed with serially diluted mAb (0.128 ng/ml
tol0 pg/ml) and binding was detected with anti-human IgG-HRP antibody. The plate was
read at 405 nm after 60 min incubation with substrate.
                     Results: As shown in Figures 21 a-d, all three humanized versions of mAb
CAN20G2, in addition to the chimeric version, bind to whole toxin A with similar
intensity in ELISA. In contrast, there are clearly differences in the binding of the
humanized mAbs to recombinant toxin A fragment 4, which is the domain of Ted A to
which the parental CAN20G2 is known to map and bind. This may be indicative of the
functionality if this binding to fragment 4 correlates with in vitro and in vivo protection
and may allow the development of domain 4 assays as a surrogate for CAN20G2
efficacy. The chimeric and HE mAbs appear to bind similarly whereas the CDR mAb
binds to a lesser degree and the AVA mAb does not appear to bind to the toxin A
fragment 4.

Example 16: Immunogenicity Analysis of Humanized Antibodies
                      In order to determine their immunogenicity, CDR-huCAN20G2 and HE
huCAN20G2 were tested in the EpiScreenTM (Antitope Ltd) time course T cell assays,
using two markers (proliferation and IL-2 production) to measure T cell activation.
Specifically, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared from a cohort
of 21 healthy donors with representing HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) allotypes. Bulk
cultures were established using CD8+-depleted PBMCs. CD4+ T cell proliferation by
incorporation of [3H]-Thymidine was measured at various time points after the addition
of the antibodies. IL-2 secretion was also measured using ELISpot assays in parallel to
the proliferation analysis.

Methods
Preparation and selection of donor PBMCs
              Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy
community donor buffy coats (from blood drawn within 24 hours). PBMCs were isolated
from buffy coats by Lymphoprep (Axis-shield, Dundee, UK) density centrifugation and
CD8+ T cells were depleted using CD8+ RosetteSepTM (StemCell Technologies Inc,
London, UK). Donors were characterized by identifying HLA-DR haplotypes using an
HLA SSP-PCR based tissue-typing kit (Biotest, Solihull, UK). T cell responses to a
control antigen (Keyhole Limpet Haemocyanin (KLH), [Pierce (Perbio), Cramlington,
UK]), as well as peptides derived from Influenza A and Epstein Barr viruses were also
determined. PBMCs were then frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until required.
Preparation of Antibodies
              The two test antibodies were diluted in AIM-V@ culture medium (Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK) just before use and the final assay concentration was 0.3mM. KLH was used
as a reproducibility control and stored at -20 0 C as a 1Omg/ml stock solution in water. For
the studies, an aliquot of KLH was thawed before immediately diluting to 400pg/ml in
AIM-V@ (final concentration 1OOpg/ml). Phytohaemagglutanin (PHA, Sigma, Poole,
UK) was used as a positive control in the ELISpot and a 1mg/ml stock was stored at
20 0C before diluting to a final concentration of 2.5pg/ml in cell cultures.
Assessment of cell viability
              On day 7, bulk cultures (previously established for the proliferation assay) were
gently resuspended and 1Oml of each sample was removed from all donors and mixed
with 1Oml trypan blue. These samples were then assessed for viability using trypan blue
dye exclusion with a Countess@ Automated Cell Counter instrument (Invitrogen).

EpiScreenTM time course T cell proliferation assays
               PBMCs from each donor were thawed, counted and viability assessed. Cells were
revived in room temperature AIM-V@ culture medium, washed and resuspended in AIM
V to 4-6x106 PBMC/ml. For each donor, bulk cultures were established in which 1ml
proliferation cell stock was added to the appropriate wells of a 24 well plate. 0.5ml of
culture medium and 0.5ml of each diluted antibody were added to the PBMC to give a
final concentration of 0.3pM. For each donor, a reproducibility control (cells incubated
with 1OOpg/ml KLH), a positive control (cells incubated with 2.5pg/ml PHA) and a
culture medium-only well were also included. Cultures were incubated for a total of 8
days at 37'C with 5% CO 2. On days 5, 6, 7 and 8, the cells in each well were gently
resuspended and 3 x 100pl aliquots transferred to each well of a round bottomed 96 well
plate. The cultures were pulsed with 0.75pCi [3H]-Thymidine (Perkin ElmerR,
Beaconsfield, UK) in 100pl AIM-VR culture medium and incubated for a further 18
hours before harvesting onto filter mats (Perkin ElmerR) using a Skatron Micro 96S
 10056 cell harvester. Counts per minute (cpm) for each well were determined by
MeltilexTM (Perkin ElmerR) scintillation counting on a 1450 Microbeta Wallac Trilux
Liquid Scintillation Counter (Perkin ElmerR) in paralux, low background counting.
EpiScreenTM IL-2 ELISpot assays
               Homologous donors to those used in the proliferation assay were also used for the
IL-2 ELISpot assay. Cells were thawed and revived as described above. ELISpot plates
(Millipore, Watford, UK) were pre-wetted and coated overnight with 100 l/well IL-2
capture antibody (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) in PBS. Plates were then washed 3
times in PBS, incubated overnight in blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS) and washed in
AIM-V medium. The cell density for each donor was adjusted to 4-6x106 PBMC/ml in
AIM-V@ culture medium and 100pl of cells were added to each well. 50pl of samples
and controls were added to the appropriate wells as well as 50ml of AIMV to bring the
total volume to 200ml/well. Antibodies were tested in sextuplicate cultures and, for each

donor, a negative control (AIM-V@ medium alone), no cells control and a mitogen
positive control (PHA at 2.5pg/ml - used as an internal test for ELISpot function and cell
viability), were also included on each plate. After an 8 day incubation period, ELISpot
plates were developed by sequential washing in dH 2 0 and PBS (x3) prior to the addition
of 100pl filtered, biotinylated detection antibody (R&D Systems) in PBS / 1% BSA.
Following incubation at 370 C for 1.5 hours, plates were further washed in PBS (x3) and
 100pl filtered streptavidin-AP (R&D Systems) in PBS /1% BSA was added for 1.5 hours
(incubation at room temperature). Streptavidin-AP was discarded and plates were washed
in PBS (x4). 100pl BCIP/NBT substrate (R&D Systems) was added to each well and
incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Spot development was stopped by
washing the wells and the backs of the wells three times with dH 2 0. Dried plates were
scanned on an Immunoscan@ Analyser and spots per well (spw) were determined using
ImmunoscanR Version 4 software.
EpiScreenTM data analysis
               For proliferation and IL-2 ELISpot assays, an empirical threshold of a stimulation
index (SI) equal to or greater than 2 (SI2.00) has been previously established, whereby
samples inducing responses above this threshold are deemed positive (borderline SIs >
 1.90 are also highlighted). Extensive assay development and previous studies have shown
that this is the minimum signal-to-noise threshold allowing maximum sensitivity without
detecting large numbers of false positive responses or omitting subtle immunogenic
events. For both proliferation (n=3) and IL-2 ELISpot data (n=6) sets, positive responses
were defined by statistical and empirical thresholds as follows:
               1. Significance (p<0.05) of the response by comparing cpm or spw of test wells
               against medium control wells using unpaired two sample student' s ttest.
               2. Stimulation index greater than or equal to 2 (SI2.00), where SI = mean of test
              wells (cpm or spw) / baseline (cpm or spw). Data presented in this way is
               indicated as SI2.00, p<0.05.

In addition, intra-assay variation was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variance
and standard deviation (SD) of the raw data from replicate cultures.
Results & Discussion
              While there is generally a good correlation between IL-2 production and
proliferation after T cells have been activated, proliferation and IL-2 ELISpot assays have
been interpreted independently. Inter-assay variability was assessed using KLH as a
reproducibility control where the frequency of positive T cell responses against KLH
were compared in two separate EpiScreenTM assays. The results show that interassay
variability for KLH-specific T cell responses is within the acceptable range and
consistent with previous studies (40 %).
Assessment of cell viability
              An initial assessment of any gross effect of the antibodies and the buffer on
PBMC viability was performed for 10 donors used in the EpiScreenTM time course
assays. Cell viabilities were calculated using trypan blue dye exclusion of PBMC 7 days
after culture with the antibodies. It was clear that the two test antibodies and buffer
formulation did not significantly affect the viability of the cells because PBMC from
medium alone cultures had a mean viability similar to that of the samples and KLH
treated cells (between 93-97%).
EpiScreenTM time course proliferation assay
              Figure 24 and Table 12 show the results obtained in the EpiScreenTM time course
T cell proliferation assay of CD4+ T cell responses induced by the antibodies. Both test
antibodies induced positive proliferation responses with SI2.00 ( p<0.05) in one or more
donors in the proliferation assay. Borderline responses SI1.90 ( p<0.05) are also
highlighted. Positive proliferation responses ranged between 5% and 24% of the donor
cohort (Table 14).

In Table 14, during the entire time course (days 5-8), positive T cell proliferation
responses (SI2.00, significant p<0.05) were indicated as "P", a nd positive T cell IL-2
ELISpot responses (SI2.00, significant p<0.05) were indicated as "E". B orderline
responses (significant p<0.05 with SI1.90) was shown as (*). No data was obtained on
day 8 of the proliferation assay for donor 7 ($). Formulation buffer was tested on donors
 1-10 only donor 11-21 were not tested with the buffer (grey boxes). N/A indicated no
data is available.
              Antibody CDR-HuCAN20G2 was associated with the most frequent T cell
proliferation response, inducing positive responses in 24% (5 donors) of the study cohort.
In contrast, antibody HE-HuCAN20G2 induced fewer T cell proliferation responses with
only 5% of the cohort responding positively. These results showed that the frequency of
T cell proliferation responses is high for antibody CDR-HuCAN20G2 but low for HE
HuCAN20G2. No T cell proliferation responses were detected against the buffer control.
              Analysis of the magnitude of T cell proliferation responses showed that although
antibody CDR-HuCAN20G2 had a high frequency of response, the magnitude of
responses were low (mean SI 2.13). For antibody HE-HuCAN20G2 no conclusions can
be made regarding the magnitude of the T cell response due to the low number of
responding donors (Table 15). Thus, the overall immunogenic potential of the antibodies
was determined based on the frequency (%) of the positive T cell proliferation responses
in the study cohort with CDR-HuCAN20G2 being more immunogenic than HE
HuCAN20G2.

The mean SI was calculated from the average of all positive donor responses observed
during the entire time course (days 5-8). The data includes borderline proliferation
responses (SII.90, p<0.05).
Kinetics of T cell responses
                The overall timing of the proliferative responses can provide information as to the
potential type of T cell response (naive or recall). Maximal T cell proliferation detected
on day 5 indicates that existing T cell precursor frequencies are high, whereas maximal
proliferation on later days indicates a low existing T cell precursor frequency. A high
immunogenic potential would be concordant with stimulation of T cells during the early
phase of the time course. Figure 25 summarizes the number of positive proliferation
responses occurring against the samples on each day of the four day time course. The T
cell responses against antibody CDR-HuCAN20G2 were observed mostly on days 7 and
8, suggesting that for this antibody the number of existing T cell precursors is low.
Antibody HE-HuCAN20G2 induced one donor to respond and this was observed on days
6, 7 and 8. However, since only one responding donor was detected it is difficult to make
a conclusion as to the number of T cell precursors for antibody HE-HUCAN20G2.

EpiScreenTM IL-2 ELISpot assay
               Figure 26 and Table 12 show the responses obtained in the IL-2 ELISpot assay
which measures IL-2 secretion by CD4+ T cells following stimulation with the two test
antibodies. Similar to the proliferation assay, positive responses were recorded in donors
that produced an SI2.00 with a significant (p<0.05) difference observ ed between test
spw and background (untreated medium control). Borderline responses SI1.90 (p<0.05)
are also highlighted. All samples induced positive IL-2 ELISpot responses in one or more
donors and these were all significant (p<0.05) using an unpaired, two sample student' s t
test. All PHA wells were positive for the presence of spots although SI values were not
prepared for the ELISpot data as, after 8 days, the majority of wells contained spots too
numerous to count (data not shown).
               For the two test antibodies, the overall results of the IL-2 ELISpot assay were
homologous to those obtained in the proliferation assay with both antibodies inducing the
same frequency of T cell responses (Table 16). As in the proliferation assay, antibody
CDR-HuCAN20G2 induced the most frequent T cell responses in the study cohort with
24% of donors responding positively (SI2.00, p<0.05), whereas antibody HE
HuCAN20G2 induced T cell responses in 5% of the study cohort. Assessment of the
mean magnitude of positive (including borderline SI1.90, p<0.05) T cell responses
against both antibodies was low (mean positive SI 2.39 for CDR-HuCAN20G2).
               The frequency of T cell responses was low for HE-HuCAN20G2 which precludes
making any direct correlation between strength of T cell response (magnitude) and
immunogenicity. Assessment of the relative risk of immunogenicity of the test antibodies
(based on the frequency of positive responses in the IL-2 ELISpot assay) showed that

Interpretation of results
                The proliferation and IL-2 ELISpot assay data show that positive T cell responses
were detected against both test antibodies in a proportion of the donors. The overall
correlation between proliferation and IL-2 ELISpot assays was high (94% for KLH,
Table 14) and thus, as in previous studies, responding donors were defined as those that
mounted a positive response to each sample in both IL-2 ELISpot and proliferation
assays. Table 14 shows a summary of positive responses against the antibodies in both
proliferation and IL-2 ELISpot assays. Comparison of the data obtained from the
proliferation and IL-2 ELISpot assays showed that the antibodies tested induced
homologous frequencies of positive T cell responses between the assays. All donors
produced a positive T cell response against PHA in the IL-2 ELISpot assay indicating
that cells in the ex vivo cultures were functional (data not shown). Analysis of the
combined datasets from these two assays revealed that the overall frequency and
magnitude of responses was high for antibody CDR-HuCAN20G2 with 24% of donors
responding in both proliferation and ELISpot assays and low for antibody HE
HuCAN20G2 with 5% of donors responding.

Conclusion
              The overall correlation between proliferation and IL-2 ELISpot assay was high,
responding donors were defined as those that mounted a positive response to each sample
in both assays. Analysis of the combined datasets from two assays reveals that overall
response was high for antibody CDR-huCAN20G2 with 24% of donors responding in
both assays and low for antibody HE-huCAN20G2 with 5% of donors responding.
Previous EpiScreenTM T cell assays with a range of biologics have showed a clear
correlation between the percentage of donor T cell responses in the assay and the level of
immunogenicity observed in clinic, whereas the protein therapeutics that induced >o0%
positive response are associated with risk of immunogenicity in the clinic. The current
study results showed that, in comparison with other protein therapeutics tested in
EpiScreenTM assays, antibody CDR-huCAN20G2 would be considered as having a risk of
clinical immunogenicity. In contrast, antibody HE-huCAN20G2 would be considered as
having a low risk of clinical immunogenicity.
Example 17: In vivo efficacy of humanized CAN20G2 mAbs against toxin A
challenge
              The in vivo protective efficacy of the two humanized CAN20G2 anti-TcdA mAbs,
HE-CAN20G2 and CDR-CAN20G2 were evaluated in the mouse lethal toxin challenge
model (as noted in Example 8 above) by testing a low dose of antibody. Swiss Webster
mice weighing 20-30g were given 50ug of mAb or controls at day 0 and allowed to rest.
After 24 hrs, the mice were given a lethal dose of TcdA (100 ng). This dose kills 90
 100% of animals by 24 hours in an unprotected state. The mice were observed for a
period of 14 days for clinical symptoms, abnormality and local and systemic disease. All
observations were recorded and the % survival was determined for each treatment group.

Results
              As shown in Figures 27 and 28, both humanized CAN20G2 mAbs were
efficacious in protecting against toxin A in vivo challenge. HE-CAN20G2 conferred
better in vivo protection compared to CDA1 and CDR-CAN20G2. At the low dose of
0.05mg/mouse, HE-CAN20G2 recipient mice had a higher survival rate (90%) compared
to those treated with CDA1 (80%) and CDR-CAN20G2 (70%) against TcdA lethal
challenge.
Example 18: Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Humanized Antibodies
                            Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted for CDR-huCAN20G2 and HE
huCAN20G2 in hamster model and rat model. In hamster study, Golden Syrian hamsters
were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg of CDR-huCAN20G2. Blood samples were
collected at 2h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 168h, 240h and 336h post-injection. Control samples
were collected from test animal 5 days before injection and sentinel group at different
time points. The blood samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain
sera. In rat study, two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented with a femoral
vein catheter (FVC) for intravenous dosing and a jugular vein catheter (JVC) for blood
collection. Two antibodies, CDR-huCAN20G2 and HE-huCAN20G2, were injected to
each group of rats at 10 mg/kg dose level via single IV bolus followed by 0.5 mL saline
flush. Blood samples were collected at pre-dose, 0.083, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,
 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, 288 and 312 hours post-dose from the JVC. Whole blood
(300 pL) samples were centrifuged at 2200 x g for 10 minutes to isolate sera.
              The antibody concentration in the sera was determined via ELISA. 96-well
ELISA plate were coated overnight with goat anti-human IgG, affinity purified and
monkey serum adsorbed (Novus Biologicals) at 1pg/mL. Plates were washed with PBS-T
and blocked with blocking buffer. The antibody reference standard was diluted in 1%
pooled naive hamster serum to generate a standard curve with a range of 0.098 - 100
ng/mL. Diluted test samples and standards were incubated 1.5 hours at room temperature.

Plates were washed and incubated with HRP-goat anti-human IgG, affinity purified and
monkey serum adsorbed (Novus Biologicals), developed with TMB peroxidase substrate
system (R&D systems) and stopped with TMB peroxidase stop solution (R&D system).
Plates were read on a SpectraMax plate reader at 450 nm. Antibody concentration in each
animal at different time points as calculated using the standard curves.
               Results: For hamster PK study, noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was
performed using SAS Version 9.2 for Windows, the data are shown in Table 17. As
indicated, CDR-huCAN20G2 demonstrated a terminal half life around 6 days with 50
mg/kg administration dose, which ensured antibody retention in future efficacy studies.
               For rat PK study, noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed
using Watson, version 7.2.0.02 and the data are illustrated in Table 18 and Figures 29A
and 29B. As indicated, the PK profiles of the two monoclonal antibodies are very
similar. Comparable levels of exposure were exhibited and metabolism was close to the
same rate.
