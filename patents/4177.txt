                                           FIELD OF THE INVENTION
             The invention relates generally to pharmaceutically active compounds, pharmaceutical
   compositions and methods of use thereof, to treat beta-secretase mediated diseases and conditions,
   including, without limitation, Alzheimer's disease, plaque formation and associated central nervous
 5 system (CNS) disorders.
                                     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
             Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects greater than 12 million aging people worldwide, and
   importantly, the number affected continues to grow. AD accounts for the majority of dementias
 O clinically diagnosed after the age of 60. AD is generally characterized by the progressive decline of
   memory, reasoning, judgement and orientation. As the disease progresses, motor, sensory, and vocal
   abilities are affected until there is global impairment of multiple cognitive functions. The loss of
   cognitive function occurs gradually, typically leading to a diminished cognition of self, family and
   friends. Patients with severe cognitive impairment and/or diagnosed as end-stage AD are generally
25 bedridden, incontinent, and dependent on custodial care. The AD patient eventually dies in about nine
   to ten years, on average, after initial diagnosis. Due to the incapacitating, generally humiliating and
   ultimately fatal effects of AD, there is a need to treat AD effectively upon diagnosis.
             AD is characterized by two major physiological changes in the brain. The first change, beta
   amyloid plaque formation, supports the "amyloid cascade hypothesis" which conveys the thought that
30 AD is caused by the formation of characteristic beta amyloid peptide (A-beta), or A-beta fragments
   thereof, deposits in the brain (commonly referred to as beta amyloid "plaques" or "plaque deposits")
   and in cerebral blood vessels (beta amyloid angiopathy). A wealth of evidence suggests that beta
   amyloid and accompanying

                                                -2
   amyloid plaque formation is central to the pathophysiology of AD and is likely to play an
   early role in this intractable neurodegenerative disorder. Vassar & Yan, Lancet
   Neurology, 13:319-329 (2014). The second change in AD is the formation of
   intraneuronal tangles, consisting of an aggregate form of the protein tau. Besides being
 5 found in patients with AD, intraneuronal tangles are also found in other dementia
   inducing disorders. Joachim et al., Alz. Dis. Assoc. Dis., 6:7-34 (1992).
            Several lines of evidence indicate that progressive cerebral deposition of A-beta
   plays a seminal role in the pathogenisis of AD and can precede cognitive symptoms by
   years or even decades. Selkoe, Neuron, 6:487 (1991). Release of A-beta from neuronal
10 cells grown in culture and the presence of A-beta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of both
   normal individuals and AD patients has been demonstrated. Seubert et al., Nature,
   359:325-327 (1992). Autopsies of AD patients have revealed large numbers of lesions
   comprising these 2 factors in areas of the human brain believed to be important for
   memory and cognition.
15          Smaller numbers of these lesions in a more restricted anatomical distribution are
   found in the brains of most aged humans who do not have clinical AD. Amyloid
   containing plaques and vascular amyloid angiopathy were also found in the brains of
   individuals with Down's Syndrome, Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis
   of the Dutch-type (HCHWA-D), and other neurodegenerative disorders.
20          It has been hypothesized that A-beta formation is a causative precursor or factor
   in the development of AD. More specifically, deposition of A-beta in areas of the brain
   responsible for cognitive factors is believed to be a major factor in the development of
   AD. Beta amyloid plaques are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptide (A-beta
   peptide). A-beta peptide is derived from the proteolytic cleavage of a large
25 transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP), and is a peptide comprised of about 39
   42 amino acid residues. A-beta 42 (42 amino acids long) is thought to be the major
   component of these plaque deposits in the brains of Alzheimer's Disease patients. Citron,
   Trends in PharmacologicalSciences, 25(2):92-97 (2004).
            Similar plaques appear in some variants of Lewy body dementia and in inclusion
30 body myositis, a muscle disease. A also forms aggregates coating cerebral blood vessels
   in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These plaques are composed of a tangle of regularly
   ordered fibrillar aggregates called amyloid fibers, a protein fold shared by other peptides
   such as prions associated with protein misfolding diseases. Research on laboratory rats
   suggest that the dimeric, soluble form of the peptide is a causative agent in the

                                                  -3
   development of Alzheimer's and is the smallest synaptotoxic species of soluble amyloid
   beta oligomer. Shankar, G.M., Nature Medicine (June 22, 2008) online doi 10:1038 nm
   1782.
            Several aspartyl proteases, including beta-secretase and gamma-secretase, are
 5 thought to be involved in the processing or cleavage of APP, resulting in the formation of
   A-beta peptide. Beta secretase (BACE, also commonly referred to as memapsin) is
   thought to first cleave APP to generate two fragments: (1) a first N-terminus fragment
   (beta APP) and (2) a second C-99 fragment, which is subsequently cleaved by gamma
   secretase to generate the A-beta peptide. APP has also found to be cleaved by alpha
10 secretase to produce alpha-sAPP, a secreted form of APP that does not result in beta
   amyloid plaque formation. This alternate pathway precludes the formation of A-beta
   peptide. A decription of the proteolytic processing fragments of APP is found, for
   example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,441,870, 5,712,130 and 5,942,400.
            BACE is an aspartyl protease enzyme comprising 501 amino acids and
15 responsible for processing APP at the beta-secretase specific cleavage site. BACE is
   present in two forms, BACE 1 and BACE 2, designated as such depending upon the
   specific cleavage site of APP. Beta secretase is described in Sinha et al., Nature, 402:537
   554 (1999) (p510) and PCT application WO 2000/17369. It has been proposed that A
   beta peptide accumulates as a result of APP processing by BACE. Moreover, in vivo
20 processing of APP at the beta secretase cleavage site is thought to be a rate-limiting step
   in A-beta production. Sabbagh, M. et al., Alz. Dis. Rev. 3:1-19 (1997). Thus, inhibition of
   the BACE enzyme activity is desirable for the treatment of AD.
            Studies have shown that the inhibition of BACE may be linked to the treatment
   of AD. The BACE enzyme is essential for the generation of beta-amyloid or A-beta.
25 BACE knockout mice do not produce beta-amyloid and are free from Alzheimer's
   associated pathologies including neuronal loss and certain memory deficits. Cole, S.L.,
   Vasser, R., MolecularDegeneration2:22, 2007. When crossed with transgenic mice that
   over express APP, the progeny of BACE deficient mice show reduced amounts of A-beta
   in brain extracts as compares with control animals (Luo et al., Nature Neuroscience,
30 4:23 1-232 (2001)). The fact that BACE initiates the formation of beta-amyloid, and the
   observation that BACE levels are elevated in this disease provide direct and compelling
   reasons to develop therapies directed at BACE inhibition thus reducing beta-amyloid and
   its associated toxicities. To this end, inhibition of beta secretase activity and a

                                                 -4
   corresponding reduction of A-beta in the brain should provide a therapeutic method for
   treating AD and other beta amyloid or plaque related disorders.
             Consequently, the approach of regulating or reducing the formation of A-beta
   peptide formation and deposition as a potential treatment for AD has received tremendous
 5 attention, support and commitment from both researchers and investors alike. A small
   molecule gamma-secretase inhibitor, LY450139 ("Semagacestat"), an A-beta lowering
   agent, advanced to phase III clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. The
   pharmacokinetics of semagacestat in plasma, as well as the plasma and cerebral spinal
   fliud (CSF) A-Beta peptide levels as pharmacodynamic responses to semagacestat
10 administration were evaluated in healthy human subjects in single and multiple doses, and
   pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes were also assessed in mild to moderate
   AD patients in two (2) clinical trials (Expert Opin. Pharmacother.(2009), 10 (10); Clin.
   Neuropharmacol.2007; 30 (pgs 317-325); and Neurology, 2006, 66 (pgs 602-624)).
             Additional approaches have been taken in attempts to treat AD and plaque-related
15 disorders. One such approach to reduce the formation of plaque deposits in the brain
   involves the inhibition of and, therefore, the reduction of BACE activity. Vassar & Yan,
   Lancet Neurology, 13:319-329 (2014). For example, each of the following PCT

   of neurological disorders of the general formula:

            The lysosomal aspartic protease Cathepsin D (CatD) is ubiquitously expressed in
   eukaryotic organisms. CatD activity is essential to accomplish the acid-dependent
   extensive or partial proteolysis of protein substrates within endosomal and lysosomal
 5 compartments therein delivered via endocytosis, phagocytosis or autophagocytosis. CatD
   may also act at physiological pH on small-size substrates in the cytosol and in the
   extracellular milieu. Mouse and fruit fly CatD knock-out models have highlighted the
   multi-pathophysiological roles of CatD in tissue homeostasis and organ development.
            Inhibition of protein Cathepsin D has been implicated in undesirable side effects.
10 For instance, the inhibition of Cathepsin D is believed to be linked to adverse retinal
   development and retinal atrophy. Particularly, in mice it was found that cathepsin D is
   essential for the metabolic maintenance of retinal photoreceptor cells and that its
   deficiency induces apoptosis of the cells, while the loss of INL neurons is mediated by
   nitrc oxide release from microglial cells. However, in the very same mice, it was also
15 found that no atrophic change was detected in the retina of mice deficient in cathepsin B
   or L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci, 2003, Feb 22(2):146-161. Further, Animal models of cathepsin
   D (CatD) deficiency are characterized by a progressive and relentless neurodegenerative
   phenotype similar to that observed in Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCL), a group of
   pediatric neurodegenerative diseases known collectively as Batten Disease. It has been
20 shown that the targeted deletion of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax prevents apoptotic
   markers but not neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration induced by CatD deficiency,
   which suggests that alterations in the macroautophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway
   can mediate neuronal cell death in NCL/Batten Disease in the absence of apoptosis.
   Autophagy, 2007, Sept-Oct;3(5):474-476. Finally, an adverse effect of the inhibition of
25 Cat D is evident from the data presented in PLoS One, 2011; 6(7):e21908, published 7-1
   2011. The authors of the PLoS One paper found that knock-down of cathepsin D affects
   the retinal pigment epithelium, impairs swim-bladder ontogenesis and causes premature
   death in zebrafish. The main phenotypic alterations produced by CatD knock-down in
   zebrafish were: 1. abnormal development of the eye and of retinal pigment epithelium; 2.

                                                  -6
   absence of the swim-bladder; 3. skin hyper-pigmentation; 4. reduced growth and
   premature death. Rescue experiments confirmed the involvement of CatD in the
   developmental processes leading to these phenotypic alterations.
             Moreover, such toxicity findings which, in view of the literature, may have
 5 played a role in the termination of a human Bace-mediated Alzheimer's Disease clinical
   trial. Eli Lilly terminated a phase I clinical trial of LY 2811376 after rat toxicology
   studies showed that a higher compound dose given for three months damaged the pigment
   epithelium of the rat's eye. The retinal layer had inclusions and extensive damage. The Ph
   I dosing trial was terminated and people brought in for eye assessments did not show any
10 abnormalities. (Alzheimer's Research Forum News, 3-31-2011 reporting on Martin
   Citron's presentation at the AD/PD Conference 3-2011 in Barcelona, Spain)
             Hence, it is desirable to provide compounds which modulate the activity of and
   are reasonably selective for BACE, while not suffering from undesirable side effects
   possibly due to intervention with or the reduction and/or direct or indirect inhibition of
15 the expression and/or function of other proteins or biological pathways.
                           BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
             The present invention provides a new class of compounds useful for the
   modulation of beta secretase activity, and as treatment of AD. Particularly, the
20 compounds of the invention are useful for the regulation or reduction of the formation of
   A-beta peptide and, consequently, the regulation and/or reduction of formation of beta
   amyloid plaque both on the brain, as well as in the CNS. To this end, the compounds are
   useful for the treatment of AD and other beta secretase and/or plaque-related and/or
   mediated disorders. For example, the compounds are useful for the prophylaxis and/or
25 treatment, acute and/or chronic, of AD and other diseases or conditions involving the
   deposition or accumulation of beta amyloid peptide, and formation of plaque, on the
   brain.

                                          DEFINITIONS
            The following definitions should assist in understanding the metes and bounds of
20 the invention.
            The term "comprising" is meant to be open ended, i.e., all encompassing and non
   limiting. It may be used herein synonymously with "having." Comprising is intended to
   include each and every indicated or recited component or element(s) while not excluding
   any other components or elements.

                                               - 69
            The term "Cc_palkyl", when used either alone or within other terms such as
   "haloalkyl" and "alkylamino", embraces linear or branched radicals having a to f number
   of carbon atoms (such as CI-Cio; Ci-C6 ; or CI-C4. Unless otherwise specified, one or
   more carbon atoms of the "alkyl" radical may be substituted, such as with a cycloalkyl
 5 moiety. Examples of "alkyl" radicals include methyl, cyclopropylmethyl,
   cyclobutylmethyl, cyclopentylmethyl, ethyl, cyclopropylethyl, cyclobutylethyl,
   cyclopentylethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, cyclopropylbutyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert
   butyl, pentyl, isoamyl, hexyl and the like.
            The term "Cpalkenyl", when used alone or in combination, embraces
10 linear or branched radicals having at least one carbon-carbon double bond in a
   moiety having a number of carbon atoms in the range from a and           P. Included
   within alkenyl radicals are "lower alkenyl" radicals having two to about six carbon
   atoms and, for example, those radicals having two to about four carbon atoms.
   Examples of alkenyl radicals include, without limitation, ethenyl, propenyl, allyl,
15 propenyl, butenyl and 4-methylbutenyl. The terms "alkenyl" and "lower alkenyl",
   embrace radicals having "cis" and "trans" orientations, or alternatively, "E" and
   "Z" orientations, as appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.
            The term "C,_palkynyl", when used alone or in combination, denotes linear or
   branched radicals having at least one carbon-carbon triple bond in a moiety having a
20 number of carbon atoms in the range from a and        P. Examples of alkynyl radicals
   include "lower alkynyl" radicals having two to about six carbon atoms and, for example,
   lower alkynyl radicals having two to about four carbon atoms. Examples of such radicals
   include, without limitation, ethynyl, propynyl (propargyl), butynyl, and the like.
            The term "Cup-alkyl", "C,_p-alkenyl" and "C,_p-alkynyl", when used with other
25 terms such as "wherein 1, 2 or 3 carbon atoms of said Cc-p-alkyl, Ca-p-alkenyl or C2,-p
   alkynyl is optionally replaced with a heteroatom selected from 0, S, S(O), S(O) 2 and N"
   embraces linear or branched radicals wherein one or more of the carbon atoms may be
   replaced with a heteroatom. Examples of such "alkyl" radicals include -0-methyl, -0
   ethyl, -CH 2-0-CH 3, -CH 2CH 2-0-CH3, -NH-CH 2, -CH 2CH 2-N(CH3)-CH 3, -S-(CH 2) 3CH 2 ,
30 -CH 2CH 2-S-CH 3 and the like. Accordingly, such radicals also include radicals
   encompassed by -OR 7 where R7 may be defined as a C,_p-alkyl. Examples of such
   "alkenyl" radicals include -NH-CH 2CH=CH 2, -S-CH 2CH 2CH=CHCH 3 and the like.

                                               - 70
   Simlar examples exist for such "alkynyl" radicals, as appreciated by those skilled in the
   art.
            The term "C,_palkoxyl" or "-OC,_palkyl" when used alone or in combination,
   embraces linear or branched oxygen-containing alkyl radicals each having a to     3number
 5 of carbon atoms (such as CI-Cio). The terms "alkoxy" and "alkoxyl", when used alone or
   in combination, embraces linear or branched oxygen-containing radicals each having
   alkyl and substituted alkyl portions of one or more carbon atoms. Examples of such
   radicals include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, tert-butoxy and neopentoxy. Alkoxy
   radicals may be further substituted with one or more halo atoms, such as fluoro, chloro or
10 bromo, to provide "haloalkoxy" radicals or with other substitution. Examples of such
   radicals include fluoromethoxy, chloromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, trifluoroethoxy,
   fluoroethoxy and fluoropropoxy.
            The term "aryl", when used alone or in combination, means a carbocyclic
   aromatic moiety containing one, two or even three rings wherein such rings may be
15 attached together in a fused manner. Every ring of an "aryl" multi-ring system need not
   be aromatic, and the ring(s) fused to the aromatic ring may be partially or fully
   unsaturated and include one or more heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and
   sulfur. Thus, the term "aryl" embraces aromatic radicals such as phenyl, naphthyl,
   indenyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, dihydrobenzafuranyl, anthracenyl, indanyl, benzodioxazinyl,
20 and the like. The "aryl" group may be substituted, such as with 1 to 5 substituents
   including lower alkyl, hydroxyl, halo, haloalkyl, nitro, cyano, alkoxy and lower
   alkylamino, and the like. Phenyl substituted with -O-CH 2-0- or -O-CH 2-CH 2-0- forms an
   aryl benzodioxolyl substituent.
            The term "Cp-cycloalkyl", also referred to herein as "carbocyclic", when used
25 alone or in combination, denotes a partially or fully saturated ring radical having a
   number of carbon atoms in the range from a and         P. The "cycloalkyl" may contain
   one ("monocyclic"), two ("bicyclic") or even three ("tricyclic") rings wherein such rings
   may be attached together in a fused manner and each formed from carbon atoms.
   Examples of saturated carbocyclic radicals include saturated 3 to 6-membered
30 monocyclic groups such as cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane.
   Cycloalkyls may be substituted as described herein.
            The terms "ring" and "ring system" refer to a ring comprising the delineated
   number of atoms, the atoms being carbon or, where indicated, a heteroatom such as

                                                   -  71
   nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. Where the number of atoms is not delineated, such as a
   "monocyclic ring system" or a "bicyclic ring system", the numbers of atoms are 3-8 for a
   monocyclic and 6-12 for a bicyclic ring. The ring itself, as well as any substitutents
   thereon, may be attached at any atom that allows a stable compound to be formed. The
 5 term "nonaromatic" ring or ring system refers to the fact that at least one, but not
   necessarily all, rings in a bicyclic or tricyclic ring system is nonaromatic.
            The terms "partially or fully saturated or unsaturated" and "saturated or partially
   or fully unsaturated" with respect to each individual ring, refer to the ring either as fully
   aromatic (fully unsaturated), partially aromatic (or partially saturated) or fully saturated
10 (containing no double or triple bonds therein). If not specified as such, then it is
   contemplated that each ring (monocyclic) in a ring system (ifbicyclic or tricyclic) may
   either be fully aromatic, partially aromatic or fully saturated, and optionally substituted
   with up to 5 substituents. This includes carbocyclics, heterocyclics, aryl and heteroaryl
   rings.
15          The term "halo", when used alone or in combination, means halogens such as
   fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms.
            The term "haloalkyl", when used alone or in combination, embraces radicals
   wherein any one or more of the alkyl carbon atoms is substituted with halo as defined
   above. For example, this term includes monohaloalkyl, dihaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl
20 radicals such as a perhaloalkyl. A monohaloalkyl radical, for example, may have either
   an iodo, bromo, chloro or fluoro atom within the radical. Dihalo and polyhaloalkyl
   radicals may have two or more of the same halo atoms or a combination of different halo
   radicals. Examples of haloalkyl radicals include fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl,
   trifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, dichloromethyl, trichloromethyl, pentafluoroethyl,
25 heptafluoropropyl, difluorochloromethyl, dichlorofluoromethyl, difluoroethyl,
   difluoropropyl, dichloroethyl and dichloropropyl. "Perfluoroalkyl", as used herein, refers
   to alkyl radicals having all hydrogen atoms replaced with fluoro atoms. Examples include
   trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl. Similarly, the term " C- haloalkyl" when used
   herein embraces linear or branched alkyl radicals having a to       f number of carbon atoms
30 (such as C 1 -C6 ; C1-C 4 ; or CI-C 3 ) and substituted with one or more halogen atoms, such as
   with one or more fluorine (F), chlorines (Cl), bromine (Br) or iodine (I) atoms, or a
   combination thereof. As described above, non-limiting, representative examples of a
   C 1haloalkyl are CH 2F, CHF 2, CF3 and the like.

                                                 - 72
            The term "heteroaryl", as used herein, either alone or in combination, means a
   fully unsaturated (aromatic) ring moiety formed from carbon atoms and having one or
   more heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. The ring moiety or ring
   system may contain one ("monocyclic"), two ("bicyclic") or even three ("tricyclic") rings
 5 wherein such rings are attached together in a fused manner. Every ring of a "heteroaryl"
   ring system need not be aromatic, and the ring(s) fused thereto (to the heteroaromatic
   ring) may be partially or fully saturated and optionally include one or more heteroatoms
   selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. The term "heteroaryl" does not include rings
   having ring members of -O-0-, -O-S- or -S-S-.
10          Examples of unsaturated heteroaryl radicals, include unsaturated 5- to 6

   isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl [e.g., 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl, 1,3,4-thiadiazolyl, 1,2,5-thiadiazolyl].
25          The terms "heterocycle" or "heterocyclic", when used alone or in combination,
   means a partially or fully saturated ring moiety containing one, two or even three rings
   wherein such rings may be attached together in a fused manner, formed from carbon
   atoms and including one or more heteroatoms selected from N, 0 or S. Examples of

   said ring system formed of carbon atoms optionally including 1-3 heteroatoms if
25 monocyclic or 1-6 heteroatoms if bicyclic, said heteroatoms selected from 0, N, or S,
   wherein said ring system is optionally substituted" refers to a single ring of 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-,
   7- or 8-atom memberd or a 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11 or 12-atom membered bicyclic ring
   system comprising the delineated number of atoms, the atoms being carbon or, where
   indicated, a heteroatom such as nitrogen (N), oxygen (0) or sulfur (S). Where the number
30 of atoms is not delineated, such as a "monocyclic ring system" or a "bicyclic ring
   system", the numbers of atoms are 3-8 for a monocyclic and 6-12 for a bicyclic ring. The
   ring or ring system may contain substitutents thereon, attached at any atom that allows a
   stable compound to be formed. A bicyclic ring is intended to include fused ring sytems as

                                               - 74
   well as spiro-fused rings. This phrase encompasses carbocyclics, heterocyclics, aryl and
   heteroaryl rings.
            The term "alkylamino" includes "N-alkylamino" where amino radicals are
   independently substituted with one alkyl radical. Preferred alkylamino radicals are "lower
 5 alkylamino" radicals having one to six carbon atoms. Even more preferred are lower
   alkylamino radicals having one to three carbon atoms. Examples of such lower

   Similar with Formulas II and III, in that they include sub-formulas where described.
            The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable" when used with reference to a
   compound of Formulas I-III is intended to refer to a form of the compound that is safe for
   administration. For example, a salt form, a solvate, a hydrate, a prodrug or derivative
25 form of a compound of Formulas I-III, which has been approved for mammalian use, via
   oral ingestion or other routes of administration, by a governing body or regulatory
   agency, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States, is
   pharmaceutically acceptable.
            Included in the compounds of Formulas I-III are the pharmaceutically acceptable
30 salt forms of the free-base compounds. The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable salts"
   embraces salts commonly used to form alkali metal salts and to form addition salts of free
   acids or free bases. As appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, salts may be
   formed from ionic associations, charge-charge interactions, covalent bonding,

                                                - 75
   complexation, coordination, etc. The nature of the salt is not critical, provided that it is
   pharmaceutically acceptable.
            Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of
   Formulas I-III may be prepared from an inorganic acid or from an organic acid. Examples
 5 of such inorganic acids are hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, hydrofluoric, nitric,
   carbonic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid. Appropriate organic acids may be selected from
   aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, arylaliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic and sulfonic
   classes of organic acids, examples of which include, without limitation, formic, acetic,
   adipic, butyric, propionic, succinic, glycolic, gluconic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric,
10 ascorbic, glucuronic, maleic, fumaric, pyruvic, aspartic, glutamic, benzoic, anthranilic,
   mesylic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, mandelic, embonic (pamoic), methanesulfonic,
   ethanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, benzenesulfonic, pantothenic, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic,
   toluenesulfonic, sulfanilic, cyclohexylaminosulfonic, camphoric, camphorsulfonic,
   digluconic, cyclopentanepropionic, dodecylsulfonic, glucoheptanoic, glycerophosphonic,
15 heptanoic, hexanoic, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonic, nicotinic, 2-naphthalenesulfonic, oxalic,
   palmoic, pectinic, persulfuric, 2-phenylpropionic, picric, pivalic propionic, succinic,
   thiocyanic, undecanoic, stearic, algenic, 0-hydroxybutyric, salicylic, galactaric and
   galacturonic acid. Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable base addition salts of compounds
   of Formulas I - III include metallic salts, such as salts made from aluminum, calcium,
20 lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc, or salts made from organic bases
   including, without limitation, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines
   including cyclic amines, such as caffeine, arginine, diethylamine, N-ethyl piperidine,
   histidine, glucamine, isopropylamine, lysine, morpholine, N-ethyl morpholine,
   piperazine, piperidine, triethylamine, disopropylethylamine and trimethylamine. All of
25 these salts may be prepared by conventional means from the corresponding compound of
   the invention by reacting, for example, the appropriate acid or base with the compound of
   Formulas I-III.
            Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as
   lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides and
30 iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates, long chain
   halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl
   halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides, and others. Water or oil-soluble or
   dispersible products are thereby obtained.

                                                 - 76
             Additional examples of such salts can be found in Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci.,
   66:1 (1977). Conventional methods may be used to form the salts. For example, a
   phosphate salt of a compound of the invention may be made by combining the desired
   compound free base in a desired solvent, or combination of solvents, with phosphoric acid
 5 in a desired stoichiometric amount, at a desired temperature, typically under heat
   (depending upon the boiling point of the solvent). The salt can be precipitated upon
   cooling (slow or fast) and may crystallize (i.e., if crystalline in nature), as appreciated by
   those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, hemi-, mono-, di, tri- and poly-salt forms of the
   compounds of the present invention are also contemplated herein. Similarly, hemi-,
10 mono-, di, tri- and poly-hydrated forms of the compounds, salts and derivatives thereof,
   are also contemplated herein.
             The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable derivative" as used herein, denotes a
   derivative which is pharmaceutically acceptable.
             The compound(s) of Formulas I-III may be used to treat a subject by
15 administering the compound(s) as a pharmaceutical composition. To this end, the
   compound(s) can be combined with one or more excipients, including without limitation,
   carriers, diluents or adjuvants to form a suitable composition, which is described in more
   detail herein.
             The term "excipient", as used herein, denotes any pharmaceutically acceptable
20 additive, carrier, adjuvant, or other suitable ingredient, other than the active
   pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which is typically included for formulation and/or
   administration purposes. "Diluent" and "adjuvant" are defined hereinafter.
             The terms "treat", "treating," "treatment," and "therapy" as used herein refer to
   therapy, including without limitation, curative therapy, prophylactic therapy, and
25 preventative therapy. Prophylactic treatment generally constitutes either preventing the
   onset of disorders altogether or delaying the onset of a pre-clinically evident stage of
   disorders in individuals.
             The phrase "effective dosage amount" is intended to quantify the amount of each
   agent, which will achieve the goal of improvement in disorder severity and the frequency
30 of incidence over treatment of each agent by itself, while avoiding adverse side effects
   typically associated with alternative therapies. Accordingly, this term is not limited to a
   single dose, but may comprise multiple dosages required to bring about a therapeutic or
   prophylactic response in the subject. For example, "effective dosage amount" is not

                                                 - 77
   limited to a single capsule or tablet, but may include more than one capsule or tablet,
   which is the dose prescribed by a qualified physician or medical care giver to the subject.
             The term "leaving group" (also denoted as "LG") generally refers to groups that
   are displaceable by a nucleophile. Such leaving groups are known in the art. Examples of
 5 leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halides (e.g., I, Br, F, Cl), sulfonates (e.g.,
   mesylate, tosylate), sulfides (e.g., SCH3, N-hydroxsuccinimide, N-hydroxybenzotriazole,
   and the like. Nucleophiles are species that are capable of attacking a molecule at the point
   of attachment of the leaving group causing displacement of the leaving group.
   Nucleophiles are known in the art. Examples of nucleophilic groups include, but are not
10 limited to, amines, thiols, alcohols, Grignard reagents, anionic species (e.g., alkoxides,
   amides, carbanions) and the like.

                Scheme 1-A describes an exemplary method for preparing compounds 1k of
   Formulas I, II and III, wherein A 4 is CR 4 and R4 is F, each of A5 , A6 and A' is,
   independently, as deified hereunder, each R2, independently, is H, and one R1 is H and the
 5 other R1 is CF 3. This procedure may be employed to prepare compounds of Formulas I, II
   and III wherein R3 is CH 3, CH 2F, CHF 2 or CF 3. Beginning with compound la, one of
   ordinary skill in the art may acylate at the position of the iodine using an ester and a
   strong base, such as BuLi as described herein, under suitable conditions, to afford the
   corresponding acylated intermediate compound 1b. The ketone of the lb may be
10 converted to the corresponding sulfinamide using tetraethoxytitanium under suitable
   conditions, such as those described in Example 1 herein, to generate compound
   intermediate 1c. The coresopnding methyl acetate adduct id may be prepared from
   intermediate 1c using a strong base such as LDA to afford the corresponding intermediate
   1d. Note that one may also use the tert-butyl ester instead of the methyl ester 1d.
15 Intermediate id may be reduced to the corresponding alcohol adduct via use of a suitable
   reducing agent such as a borohydride, to provide compounds le. Intermediate le can then
   be oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde using a suitable oxidizing agent such as dess
   marin periodinane, under suitable conditions to afford aldehydre 1f. The aldehyde can be
   reduced using a suitable silane and quenched with TBAF to provide the corresponding
20 CF 3 adduct Ig (mixture of diastereomers). The diastereomers lg-1 and lg-2 as drawn in
   scheme 1 may be separated using silica gel chromatography, such as that described in
   Example 1, step 6 below, or by other conventional techniques. The desired diastereomer

                                                  - 81
   may then be deprotected under a suitable acid, such as HCl, to free the amine lh, and then
   reacted with benzoylisothiocyante under suitable conditions to afford ring closure to the
   corresponding benzoyl adduct 11. The bromide of Ii can then be converted to the
   corresponding amine using known techniques, such as going through the corresponding
 5 azide, which in turn can be reduced to the corresponding amine compound 1k by
   treatment with a suitable phosphine, such as trimethylphosphine under suitable
   conditions.

             As shown, desired R -amide-linked compounds 3 can be prepared as desired,
             such as by treatment with an activated acid in conjunction with an activating
   reagent, such as HATU or DMTMM (see Method A and B for Examples 2-7 in Table 1)
   to afford the desired protected amide-linked adduct. Compound 3 can be deprotected
15 using known conditions, such as with a base, like DBU in a suitable solvent, to afford
   final compounds of Formula I-A.
             Acid activating groups convert the OH of the acid into a strong leaving group
   "LG." A "leaving group" which may be a halide such as an iodide, bromide, chloride or
   fluoride. LG may also be a non-halide moiety such as an alkylsulfonate or other known
20 groups which generally form an electrophilic species (E). Coupling reactions generally
   occur more readily in one or a combination of solvents and a base. Suitable solvents
   include, without limitation, generally non-nucleophilic, anhydrous solvents such as
   toluene, CH 2Cl 2, THF, DMF, N,N-dimethylacetamide and the like. The solvent may
   range in polarity, as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Suitable bases include, for
25 example, tertiary amine bases such as DIEA, TEA, carbonate bases such as Na2CO 3,
   K 2CO 3 , Cs2 CO 3 , hydrides such as NaH, KH and the like, alkoxides such as NaOCH 3 , and
   the like. The base itself may also serve as a solvent. These coupling reactions are

   upon the particular substrate, such reactions may require heat, as appreciated by those
   skilled in the art.

10 having a suitable leaving group, such as a chloride (Cl) or other aromatic leaving group,
   can be reacted with compound 5 in the presence of a suitable acid, such as of sulfuric
   acid. This allows coupling of the bicycilc heteroaromatic R' group to the amine to form 6

   stirred mixture of selectfluor (6.41 g, 18.09 mmol) in MeCN (23 mL). The reaction
   mixture was stirred at room temperature. The mixture was concentrated and the residue
   was diluted with EtOAc and water. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous
 5 layer was extracted with EtOAc three times. The combined organic layers were washed
   with brine, dried on sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The crude material was
   purified by column chromatography using a gradient of EtOAc/hexane 5-20 % to give 1

15 the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature under inert
   atmosphere overnight. The material was poured slowly into a vigourously stirring
   solution of ice water. The resulting suspension was stirred vigourously for 20 min. Then
   methylene chloride was added into the mixture and the overall mixture was allowed to stir
   an additional 30 min. The mixture was filtered through a pad of celite and the filter cake
20 was washed with methylene chloride. The organic layer was separated and the remaining
   aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride three times. The combined organic
   extracts were washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated
   in-vacuo. The crude material was absorbed onto a plug of silica gel and purified by
   chromatography through a Redi-Sep pre-packed silica gel column, eluting with a gradient

   and (R)-2-methylpropane-2-sulfinamide (5.72 g, 47.2 mmol) in THF (50.0 mL) was
   added tetraethoxytitanium (16.50 mL, 79 mmol) and the overall bright yellow solution
   was heated at 70 C for overnight. The reaction was slightly cooled with ice-water bath,

   filtered through a short path of Celite and the wet cake was washed with EtOAc. The
   resulted bright yellow solution was phase seperated, and the organic layer was
   concentrated to afford the title compound (8.3 g, 30.1 mmol, 96 % yield) as a light yellow
   oil. This material was used in the next step without purification.

            General amidation procedures: The following method may be used to couple the
 5 amine core intermediates (see examples and intermediates).
   Method: HATU procedure
            To a solution of the aniline (1 equivalent) and the carboxylic acid (1.1 equivalent)
   in DCM is added triethylamine (1.5 eq) and 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3
   triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate (HATU, 1.1 equivalent). The
10 reaction mixture is stirred at RT for 3 hours, diluted with DCM, and washed with water
   and brine. The organic layer is concentrated.
            The amine protecting group, where applicable, may be removed using DBU and
   MeOH. The residue is taken up in MeOH, to which DBU is added and the reaction is
   heted in the microwave for about 1.5 hours at 75C. Standard work-up protocols can be
15 employed to isolate a crude product. The crude product may be purified by silica-gel
   chromatography to provide the title compound.
            Alternatively, the protecting group may be removed by taking the intermediate up
   in MeOH and treating it with 2M ammonia, then heating it at 75C overnight in a
   microwave, and working it up the next morning using convention methods.

            As can be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the above synthetic schemes and
   representative examples are not intended to comprise a comprehensive list of all means by
   which the compounds described and claimed in this application may be synthesized.
   Further methods will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the
 5 various synthetic steps described above may be performed in an alternate sequence or
   order to give the desired compounds.
            For example, in these procedures, the steps may be preceded, or followed, by
   additional protection/deprotection steps as necessary. Particularly, if one or more
   functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy, amino, or mercapto groups, are or need
10 to be protected in preparing the compounds of the invention, because they are not
   intended to take part in a specific reaction or chemical transformation, various known
   conventional protecting groups may be used. For example, protecting groups typically
   utilized in the synthesis of natural and synthetic compounds, including peptides, nucleic
   acids, derivatives thereof and sugars, having multiple reactive centers, chiral centers and
15 other sites potentially susceptible to the reaction reagents and/or conditions, may be used.
            Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies
   (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the inhibitor compounds described
   herein are known in the art and include, for example, those such as described in R.

   may also be converted into a salt with one acid molecule per compound (for example a
   monohalogenide); this may be done by heating to a melt, or for example by heating as a

                                                - 342
   solid under a high vacuum at elevated temperature, for example from 50 0C to 170 0C,
   one molecule of the acid being expelled per molecule of the compound.
            Acid salts can usually be converted to free-base compounds, e.g. by treating the
   salt with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal
 5 hydrogen carbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium
   hydroxide. Exemplary and suitable salts, and their preparation, are described herein in the
   Definition section of the application.
            All synthetic procedures described herein can be carried out under known
   reaction conditions, advantageously under those described herein, either in the absence or
10 in the presence (usually) of solvents or diluents. As appreciated by those of ordinary skill
   in the art, the solvents should be inert with respect to, and should be able to dissolve, the
   starting materials and other reagents used. Solvents should be able to partially or wholly
   solubilize the reactants in the absence or presence of catalysts, condensing agents or
   neutralizing agents, for example ion exchangers, typically cation exchangers for example
15 in the H form. The ability of the solvent to allow and/or influence the progress or rate of
   the reaction is generally dependant on the type and properties of the solvent(s), the
   reaction conditions including temperature, pressure, atmospheric conditions such as in an
   inert atmosphere under argon or nitrogen, and concentration, and of the reactants
   themselves.
20          Suitable solvents for conducting reactions to synthesize compounds of the
   invention include, without limitation, water; esters, including lower alkyl-lower
   alkanoates, e.g., EtOAc; ethers including aliphatic ethers, e.g., Et 20 and ethylene glycol
   dimethylether or cyclic ethers, e.g., THF; liquid aromatic hydrocarbons, including
   benzene, toluene and xylene; alcohols, including MeOH, EtOH, 1-propanol, IPOH, n- and
25 t-butanol; nitriles including CH 3CN; halogenated hydrocarbons, including CH 2Cl 2, CHCl 3
   and CCl4; acid amides including DMF; sulfoxides, including DMSO; bases, including
   heterocyclic nitrogen bases, e.g. pyridine; carboxylic acids, including lower
   alkanecarboxylic acids, e.g., AcOH; inorganic acids including HCl, HBr, HF, H 2SO 4 and
   the like; carboxylic acid anhydrides, including lower alkane acid anhydrides, e.g., acetic
30 anhydride; cyclic, linear, or branched hydrocarbons, including cyclohexane, hexane,
   pentane, isopentane and the like, and mixtures of these solvents, such as purely organic
   solvent combinations, or water-containing solvent combinations e.g., aqueous solutions.
   These solvents and solvent mixtures may also be used in "working-up" the reaction as

                                               - 343
   well as in processing the reaction and/or isolating the reaction product(s), such as in
   chromatography.
             Purification methods are known in the art and include, for example,
   crystallization, chromatography (liquid and gas phase, and the like), extraction,
 5 distillation, trituration, reverse phase HPLC and the like. Reactions conditions such as
   temperature, duration, pressure, and atmosphere (inert gas, ambient) are known in the art
   and may be adjusted as appropriate for the reaction.
             The invention further encompasses "intermediate" compounds, including
   structures produced from the synthetic procedures described, whether isolated or
10 generated in-situ and not isolated, prior to obtaining the finally desired compound.
   Structures resulting from carrying out steps from a transient starting material, structures
   resulting from divergence from the described method(s) at any stage, and structures
   forming starting materials under the reaction conditions are all "intermediates" included
   in the invention. Further, structures produced by using starting materials in the form of a
15 reactive derivative or salt, or produced by a compound obtainable by means of the process
   according to the invention and structures resulting from processing the compounds of the
   invention in situ are also within the scope of the invention.
             The invention also provides new starting materials and/or intermediates, as well
   as processes for the preparation thereof. In select embodiments, such starting materials
20 are used and reaction conditions so selected as to obtain the desired compound(s).
   Starting materials of the invention, are either known, commercially available, or can be
   synthesized in analogy to or according to methods that are known in the art. Many
   starting materials may be prepared according to known processes and, in particular, can
   be prepared using processes described in the examples. In synthesizing starting materials,
25 functional groups may be protected with suitable protecting groups when necessary.
   Protecting groups, their introduction and removal are described above.
             Compounds of the present invention can possess, in general, one or more
   asymmetric carbon atoms and are thus capable of existing in the form of optical isomers
   as well as in the form of racemic or non-racemic mixtures thereof. While shown without
30 respect to stereochemistry in Formulas I-III, the present invention includes such optical
   isomers and diastereomers, as well as the racemic and resolved, enantiomerically pure R
   and S stereoisomers, as well as other mixtures of R and S stereoisomers and
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

                                                 - 344
             The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures
   according to conventional processes, e.g., by formation of diastereoisomeric salts, by
   treatment with an optically active acid or base. Examples of appropriate acids are
   tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric, and camphorsulfonic acid
 5 and then separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers by crystallization followed by
   liberation of the optically active bases from these salts. A different process for separation
   of optical isomers involves the use of a chiral chromatography column optimally chosen
   to maximize the separation of the enantiomers. Still another available method involves
   synthesis of covalent diastereoisomeric molecules by reacting compounds of the
10 invention with an optically pure acid in an activated form or an optically pure isocyanate.
   The synthesized diastereoisomers can be separated by conventional means such as
   chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation, and then hydrolyzed to
   deliver the enantiomerically pure compound. The optically active compounds of the
   invention can likewise be obtained by using optically active starting materials. These
15 isomers may be in the form of a free acid, a free base, an ester or a salt. All such isomeric
   forms of such compounds are expressly included in the present invention.
             The compounds of the invention may also be represented in multiple tautomeric
   forms. Tautomers often exist in equilibrium with each other, and interconvert under
   environmental and physiological conditions. The compounds of the invention may also
20 occur in cis- or trans- or E- or Z- double bond isomeric forms. The invention expressly
   includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds described herein.
             All crystal forms of the compounds described herein are expressly included in
   the present invention.
             The present invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are
25 identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an
   atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass
   number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into
   compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
   phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H (deuterium), 3H (tritium), "C, 4C, N,
30 160, 170, 3P, 3P,     5S, "F, and 36Cl.
             Compounds of the present invention that contain the aforementioned isotopes
   and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain
   isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which
   radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or

                                                - 345
   substrate tissue distribution assays. Deuterated (2H), Tritiated (3H) and carbon-14, i.e.,
   14
      C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detection. Further,
   substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain
   therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in
 5 vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some
   circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention can generally be
   prepared by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non
   isotopically labeled reagent.
10                                 BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION
             The compounds of the invention may be modified by appending appropriate
   functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. The pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic properties of a compound relate, directly and indirectly, to the ability
   of the compound to be effective for its intended use.
15           Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the invention
   (Formulas I-III) vary with structural change, in general, activity possessed by compounds
   of Formulas I-III may be demonstrated both in vitro as well as in vivo. The following
   exemplified pharmacological assays have been carried out with the compounds according
   to the invention, to assess and characterize the compound's ability to modulate BACE
20 activity and to regulate the cleavage of amyloid beta precursor protein, thereby reducing
   or inhibiting the production of amyloid beta.
   In Vitro Enzymatic BACE FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) Assay
   (Enzyme Assay data in the Example Table I)
25           The assay buffer used in this screen is 0.05 M acetate, pH 4.2, 10% DMSO final,
   100 uM genapol (which is a nonionic detergent, below its Critical Micelle Concentration).
   The Beta Secretase enzyme (0.2nM) is pre-incubated for one hour with inhibitors,
   typically in about luL of DMSO according to a serial dilution, are added thereto. This
   assay is effectively started by the addition of FRET substrate (50nM) and the combination
30 is incubated for one hour. The FRET assay is terminated with by addition of Tris buffer,
   which raises the pH to neutrality, and the fluorescence is determined. The FRET substrate
   is a peptide with commercially available fluorophore and quencher, on opposite sides of
   the BACE cleavage site. Proteolytic cleavage of the FRET substrate releases quenching of
   fluorescence (excitation 488 nm and emission 425 nm).

            Where available, the in-vitro BACE FRET enzyme data for each of the Examples
   is provided in Table 1.
                                  In Vitro BACE cell-based assay
 5          The cell-based assay measures inhibition or reduction of A040 in conditioned
   medium of test compound treated cells expressing amyloid precursor protein.
            Cells stably expressing Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) were plated at a density
   of 40K cells/well in 96 well plates (Costar). The cells were cultivated for 24 hours at 37
   'C and 5% CO 2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The test compounds were then
10 added to cells in 10-point dose response concentrations with the starting concentration
   being either 100 pM or 10 pM. The compounds were diluted from stock solutions in
   DMSO and the final DMSO concentration of the test compounds on cells was 0.1%.
   After 24 h of incubation with the test compounds the supernatant conditioned media was
   collected and the AP 40 levels were determined using a sandwich ELISA. The IC50 of the
15 compound was calculated from the percent of control or percent inhibition of AP 40 as a
   function of the concentration of the test compound.
            The sandwich ELISA to detect AP 40 was performed in 96 well microtiter plates,
   which were pre-treated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce). The capture and detecting
   antibody pair that were used to detect AP 40 from cell supernatants were affinity purified
20 pAb40 (Biosource) and biotinylated 6E10 (Signet Labs Inc.), respectively. The optimal
   concentration for the pAb40 antibody was 3 pg/ml in Superblock/TBS (Pierce) that was
   supplemented with 0.05%Tween 20 (Sigma). Optimal concentration for the detection
   antibody 6E10-biotinylated was 0.5 pg/ml in Superblock/TBS (Pierce) that had been
   supplemented with 2% normal goat serum and 2 % normal mouse serum.
25          Cellular supernatants were incubated with the capture antibody for 3 h at 4 'C,
   followed by 3 wash steps in TBS-tween (0.05%). The detecting antibody incubation was
   for 2 h at 4 'C, again followed by the wash steps as described previously. The final
   readout of the ELISA is Time-Resolved Fluorescence (counts per minute) using Delfia
   reagents Streptavidin-Europium and Enhancement solutions (Perkin Elmer) and the
30 Victor 2 multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer).
            Where available, the in-vitro BACE cell based data for each of the Examples is
   provided in Table 1.

    In Vitro Enzymatic Cathepsin D (Cat D) FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)
                                               Assay
             Recombinant Cat D was expressed in CHO cells. The assay buffer for
   CathepsinD is 0.05 M citrate pH 3.5, 10% DMSO final, 5 mM CHAPS. The Cat D
 5 enzyme (9 nM) is pre-incubated for one hour with inhibitors, typically in about luL of
   DMSO according to a serial dilution, is added thereto. The assays are effectively started
   by the addition of different FRET substrates (20 nM for Cat D) and the combination is
   incubated for one hour. The FRET assay is terminated with by addition of Tris buffer,
   which raises the pH to neutrality, and the fluorescence is determined. The FRET substrate
10 is a peptide with commercially available fluorophore and quencher, on opposite sides of
   the BACE cleavage site. The Cat D substrate peptide sequence is based on sequence #1 of
   Table 1 from Gulnik et al. FEBS Letters v413 p 3 7 9 - 3 8 4 1997. Proteolytic cleavage of
   the FRET substrate releases quenching of fluorescence (Cat D excitation 500 nm and
   emission 580 nm).
15           Alternatively, a Cat D assay may also be run according to the procedure
   described in the article, Characterization of new fluorgenic substrates for the rapid and
   sensitive assay of cathepsin E and cathepsin D, J Biochem., 125:1137, 1999. In addition,
   the cathepsin D and cathepsin E assays are described in PCT publication
   W02011069934. This WIPO publication describes BACE inhibitor compounds having an
20 amide linker connecting two aromatic groups with extremely poor cathepsin D and/or
   cathepsin E inhibitory activity (see Table 1).
             Where available, the in-vitro Cat D FRET assay data for each of the Examples,
   conducted by the first procedure, is provided. For example, the compound of example 43
   has a Cat D IC50 value of >400 uM. As shown by the high micromolar Cat D data (very
25 poorly active or inactive against cat D), the compounds of the present invention possess
   the unexpected property of little to no ability to inhibit the activity of Cat D. It was
   surprisingly found that incorporation of an amino- or amido- linker between the core of
   the compounds and the R7 and R 9 groups, respectively, has conferred a significantly
   reduced, poor or no potency on the protein Cat D. Thus, with this surprising selectivity
30 profile, the compounds of the present invention are believed to minimize, reduce or
   completely eliminate any risk of retinal atrophy and abnormal development of the eye and
   of the retinal pigmented epithelium as it relates to the normal function and activity of Cat
   D.

                                In vivo Inhibition of Beta-Secretase
            Several animal models, including mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, may be used to
   screen for inhibition of beta-secretase activity in vivo following administration of a test
   compound sample. Animals used in this invention can be wild type, transgenic, or gene
 5 knockout animals. For example, the Tg2576 mouse model, prepared and conducted as
   described in Hsiao et al., 1996, Science 274, 99-102, and other non-transgenic or gene
   knockout animals are useful to analyze in vivo inhibition of Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)
   production in the presence of inhibitory test compounds. Generally, 2 to 18 month old
   Tg2576 mice, gene knockout mice or non-transgenic animals are administered test
10 compounds formulated in vehicles, such as cyclodextran, phosphate buffers,
   hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or other suitable vehicles. One to twenty-four hours
   following the administration of compound, animals are sacrificed, and brains as well as
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma are removed for analysis of A-beta levels and drug
   or test compound concentrations (Dovey et al., 2001, JournalofNeurochemistry, 76,173
15 181) Beginning at time 0, animals are administered by oral gavage, or other means of
   delivery such as intravenous injection, an inhibitory test compound of up to 100 mg/kg in
   a standard, conventional formulation, such as 20%hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 1%
   Tween80. A separate group of animals receive 2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 1%
   Tween80 alone, containing no test compound, and serve as a vehicle-control group. At
20 the end of the test period, animals are sacrificed and brain tissues, plasma or cerebrospinal
   fluid are collected. Brains are either homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of 0.2%
   diethylamine (DEA) in 50 mM NaCl (Best et al., 2005, JournalofPharmacologyand
   Experimental Therapeutics, 313, 902-908), or in 10 volumes of 0.5% TritonX-100 in
   Tris-buffered saline (pH at about 7.6). Homogenates are centrifuged at 355,000g, 4'C for
25 30 minutes. CSF or brain supernatants are then analyzed for the presence of A-beta
   peptide by specific sandwich ELISA assays based on ECL (Electrochemiluminescence)
   technology. For example, rat Abeta40 is measured using biotinylated-4G8 (Signet) as a
   capture antibody and Fab40 (an in-house antibody specific to the C-terminal of Abeta40)
   as a detection antibody. For example, 4 hours after administration of 30 mg/kg oral dose
30 of the test compound in 2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 1%Tween80 (pH2.2) to
   200g male Sprague Dawley rats, amyloid beta peptide levels are measured for reduction
   by X% and Y% in cerebrospinal fluid and brain, respectively, when compared to the
   levels measured in the vehicle-treated or contol mice.

10                                        INDICATIONS
             According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, cerebral deposition of amyloid
   beta peptide (A) is critical for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. A generation is

   al re-affirm the believed role which the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (A-beta) in
15 cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in a subject plays in the progression of symptoms, initially
   revealed as mild cognitive impairment, which ultimately leads to AD. Arch Neurol.

   67(8):949-956, 2010. Amyloid-b (Ab) peptides generated from amyloid precursor protein
   (APP) by proteolytic cleavage, such as by aspartyl protease enzymes including beta
   secreatase (BACE) and gamma-secretase, likely play a causal role in AD pathogenesis
   (Tanzi and Bertram, Cell, (120): 545-555, 2005; Walsh and Selkoe, Neuron, (44): 181
 5 193, 2004). Although the precise mechanisms of Ab toxicity are unclear, oligomeric
   forms of Ab may contribute to cognitive decline by altering synaptic structure and
   function (Palop and Mucke, Nat. Neuroscience, (13): 812-818, 2010; Selkoe, Behavioral
   Brain Res., (192): 106-113, 2008; Shankar et al., Nat. Medicine (14): 837-842, 2008).
   Transgenic mouse models that overexpress mutant APP and produce high levels of Ab
10 show amyloid plaque deposition, synaptic deficits, learning and memory impairments,
   and other behavioral abnormalities (Games et al., Nature, (373): 523-527, 1995; Go" tz et
   al., Molecular Psychiatry (9): 664-683, 2004; Hsia et al., Proc. Natl. Academy of Science

   Neuron (68): 428-441, 2010).
15          For more than a decade, BACE1 has been a prime target for designing drugs to
   prevent or treat AD. However, development of such agents has turned out to be extremely
   challenging, with major hurdles in cell penetration, oral bioavailability/metabolic
   clearance, and brain access.
            MK-8931, a small molecule inhibitor of BACE (structure unknown) was tested in
20 a two-part randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase Iclinical trial in 88
   healthy individuals (18-45 years old). MK-8931 seemed to be generally well tolerated (66
   patients), and no serious adverse events were reported. A major goal of the trial was to
   determine whether MK-8931 was able to enter thebrain and block      B secretase. To monitor
   this, biomarkers of BACE 1 activity in the CSF were measured, including A 40 and
25 Af42, as was soluble peptide APP (sAPP), a direct product of BACE1 cleavage of APP.
   MK-8931 signifi cantly reduced CSF A concentrations in a sustained and dose
   dependent manner. At 36 h post-dose, a single dose of 100 mg reduced CSF A 40
   concentrations by 7 5% and a single dose of 550 mg by 92%. Similar reductions of CSF
   concentrations of A42 and sAPP, the BACE 1-cleaved ectodomain of APP, were also
30 observed. Vassar & Yan, Lancet Neurology, 13:319-329 (2014). Currently, MK-8931 is
   enrolling mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease patients in a Ph 2/3 trial; and enrolling
   participants with prodomal Alzheimer's disease in a Ph III safety and efficacy trial. (US
   clinical trials; Merck Newsroom, 2014).

   Therapy, 1:2, 2009. Each of the known genetic causes of AD is linked to A-beta.
   Dementia, Down's Syndrome to APP over-production, are all believed to be linked to the
 5 deposition of A-beta on the brain. With methods for identifying brain amyloid deposition,
   positron emission scanning (PET) and CSF measurements of Ab42, identification of AD
   suffering individuals needing treatment is becoming easier amd more common. It is
   firmly believed that by reducing the formation of A-beta, one can begin to pre-treat AD.

            The US biotech company CoMentis is developing an orally bioavailable small
   molecule CTS-21166, a highly potent, highly selective and efficacious brain-penetrating
   beta -secretase inhibitor. CoMentis successfully completed a Phase I study of CTS-21166
15 in healthy volunteers in 2008. Results indicated that CTS-21166 was safe, well-tolerated
   and pharmacodynamically active at all dose levels. All clinical subjects administered
   CTS-21166 showed area-under-curve (AUC) reduction in plasma A-Beta40 reductions
   ranging from 40-75%. Because of the urgent need for AD treatment, Phase II studies for
   CTS-2166 are planned, or ongoing, for AD patients. In preclinical studies, CTS-21166
20 exhibits excellent efficacy, selectivity, brain penetration and pharmacologic activity.
            Using afragment-based chemistry strategy, Eli Lilly and company generated
   LY2811376 [(S)-4-(2,4-difluoro-5-pyrimidin-5-yl-phenyl)-4-methyl-5,6-dihydro
   4H-[1,3]thiazin-2-ylamine], an orally available non-peptidic BACE1 inhibitor that
   produces profound Af-lowering effects in animals. The biomarker changes obtained in
25 preclinical animal models translate into man at doses of LY2811376 that were safe and
   well tolerated in healthy volunteers (US Ph I Clinical trial - www.clinicaltrials.gov).
   Prominent and long-lasting A reductions in lumbar CSF were measured after oral dosing
   of 30 or 90 mg of LY2811376. This represents the first translation of BACEl-driven
   biomarker changes in CNS from preclinical animal models to man. Because of toxicology
30 findings identified in longer-term preclinical studies, this compound is no longer
   progressing in clinical development. However, BACE 1 remains a viable target because
   the adverse effects reported here were recapitulated in LY2811376-treated BACE1 KO
   mice and thus are unrelated to BACE 1 inhibition. The magnitude and duration of central
   A3 reduction obtainable with BACE1 inhibition positions this protease as a tractable

            The compounds of the invention have been shown to modulate, and specifically
   inhibit the activity of the beta-secretase enzyme, thereby reducing the A-beta peptide
 5 fragments. Accordingly, compounds of the invention are useful for, but not limited to, the
   prevention or treatment of beta-secretase related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.
   The compounds of the invention have the ability to modulate the activity of beta secretase
   enzyme, thereby regulating the production of amyloid beta (Abeta peptide) and reducing
   the formation and deposition of Abeta peptide in both the cerebral spinal fluid as well as
10 in the brain, resulting in a decrease of amyloid plaque on the brain. In one embodiment of
   the invention, there is provided a method of treating a disorder related to a beta-secretase
   enzyme in a subject, the method comprising administering to the subject an effective
   dosage amount of a compound of Formulas I, II, III, and sub-formulae thereof. In another
   embodiment, there is provided a method of reducing production of amyloid beta, and of
15 reducing plaque formation on the brain. In another embodiment, there is provided a
   method for the treatment, prevention or amelioration of a disease or disorder
   characterized by the elevated beta-amyloid deposits or beta-amyloid levels in a subject,
   the method comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of
   a compound according to any of Formulas I - III. In yet another embodiment, the
20 invention provides a method of treating Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment
   including mild, moderate and/or severe, Down's Syndrome, cognitive decline, senile
   dementia, cerebral amyloid angiopathy or a neurodegenerative disorder.
            Accordingly, the compounds of the invention would be useful in therapy as CNS
   agents in treating neurological disorders and related conditions in subjects.
25          In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are provided for the
   manufacture of a medicament, or a pharmaceutical composition, for the therapeutic and/or
   prophylactic treatment of diseases and disorders characterized by elevated levels of B
   amyloid and/or    B-amyloid oligomers and/or b-amyloid plaques and further deposits,
   including Alzheimer's Disease. In another embodiment, the invention provides
30 compounds, in effective dosage amounts, for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic
   treatment of AD. Thus, the compounds of the invention may be used to treat prodromol
   patients, i.e., subjects exhibiting the biomarkers and/or hallmarks of developing AD.
            Besides being useful for human treatment, the compounds of the invention may
   be useful for veterinary treatment of companion animals, exotic animals and farm

                           FORMULATIONS AND METHOD OF USE
 5           Treatment of diseases and disorders herein is intended to also include therapeutic
   administration of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutical salt thereof, or a
   pharmaceutical composition of either to a subject (i.e., an animal, preferably a mammal,
   most preferably a human) which may be in need of preventative treatment, such as, for
   example, for pain, inflammation and the like. Treatment also encompasses prophylactic
10 administration of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutical salt thereof, or a
   pharmaceutical composition of either to a subject (i.e., an animal, preferably a mammal,
   most preferably a human). Generally, the subject is initially diagnosed by a licensed
   physician and/or authorized medical practitioner, and a regimen for prophylactic and/or
   therapeutic treatment via administration of the compound(s) or compositions of the
15 invention is suggested, recommended or prescribed.
             The amount of compound(s) which is/are administered and the dosage regimen
   for treating neurological disorders and beta-secretase mediated diseases with the
   compounds and/or compositions of this invention depends on a variety of factors,
   including the age, weight, sex and medical condition of the subject, the type of disease,
20 the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the particular
   compound employed. Thus, the dosage regimen may vary widely, but can be determined
   routinely using standard methods. A daily dose of about 0.01 to 500 mg/kg,
   advantageously between about 0.01 and about 50 mg/kg, more advantageously about 0.01
   and about 30 mg/kg, and even more advantageously between about 0.1 and about 10
25 mg/kg body weight may be appropriate, and should be useful for all methods of use
   disclosed herein. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day.
             While it may be possible to administer a compound of the invention alone, in the
   methods described, the compound administered normally will be present as an active
   ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition. Thus, in another embodiment of the
30 invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of this
   invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, which includes
   diluents, carriers, adjuvants and the like (collectively referred to herein as "excipient"
   materials) as described herein, and, if desired, other active ingredients. A pharmaceutical
   composition of the invention may comprise an "effective amount" of a compound of the

                                                 - 354
   invention or an "effective dosage amount" of a compound of the invention. An "effective
   dosage amount" of a compound of the invention includes an amount less than, equal to or
   greater than an effective amount of the compound. For example, a pharmaceutical
   composition in which two or more unit dosages, such as in tablets, capsules and the like,
 5 are required to administer an effective amount of the compound, or alternatively, a multi
   dose pharmaceutical composition, such as powders, liquids and the like, in which an
   effective amount of the compound is administered by administering a portion of the
   composition.
            The compound(s) of the present invention may be administered by any suitable
10 route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route,
   and in a dose effective for the treatment intended. The compounds and compositions of
   the present invention may, for example, be administered orally, mucosally, topically,
   rectally, pulmonarily such as by inhalation spray, or parentally including intravascularly,
   intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly intrasternally and
15 infusion techniques, in dosage unit formulations containing conventional
   pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles.
            For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of,
   for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is
   preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active
20 ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are tablets or capsules. For example, these
   may contain an amount of active ingredient from about 1 to 2000 mg, advantageously
   from about 1 to 500 mg, and typically from about 5 to 150 mg. A suitable daily dose for
   a human or other mammal may vary widely depending on the condition of the patient and
   other factors, but, once again, can be determined using routine methods and practices.
25          For therapeutic purposes, the active compounds of this invention are ordinarily
   combined with one or more adjuvants or other "excipients" appropriate to the indicated
   route of administration. If orally administered on a per dose basis, the compounds may
   be admixed with lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids,
   cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium
30 and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate,
   polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, to form the final formulation. For
   example, the active compound(s) and excipient(s) may be tableted or encapsulated by
   known and accepted methods for convenient administration. Examples of suitable
   formulations include, without limitation, pills, tablets, soft and hard-shell gel capsules,

                                                - 355
   troches, orally-dissolvable forms and delayed or controlled-release formulations thereof.
   Particularly, capsule or tablet formulations may contain one or more controlled-release
   agents, such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, as a dispersion with the active
   compound(s).
 5          Formulations for parenteral administration may be in the form of aqueous or non
   aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or suspensions. These solutions and
   suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders or granules using one or more of the
   carriers or diluents mentioned for use in the formulations for oral administration or by
   using other suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The compounds
10 may be dissolved in water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil,
   cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, tragacanth gum,
   and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well and widely
   known in the pharmaceutical art. The active ingredient may also be administered by
   injection as a composition with suitable carriers including saline, dextrose, or water, or
15 with cyclodextrin (ie. Captisol), cosolvent solubilization (ie. propylene glycol) or micellar
   solubilization (ie. Tween 80).
            The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or
   suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a
   solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be
20 employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In
   addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending
   medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic
   mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the
   preparation of injectables.
25          The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition
   with suitable carriers including saline, dextrose, or water. The daily parenteral dosage
   regimen will be from about 0.1 to about 30 mg/kg of total body weight, and preferably
   from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg.
            For pulmonary administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be
30 administered in the form of an aerosol or with an inhaler including dry powder aerosol.
            The pharmaceutical compositions may be subjected to conventional
   pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and/or may contain conventional
   adjuvants, such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, buffers etc.
   Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Such compositions

                                               - 356
   may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming
   agents. Accordingly, in yet another embodiment of the present invention, there is
   provided a method of manufacturing a medicament, the method comprising combining an
   amount of a compound according to Formulas I- III with a pharmaceutically acceptable
 5 carrier to manufacture the medicament.
            In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method of manufacturing a
