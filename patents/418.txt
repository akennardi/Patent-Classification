    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    1.      Field of the Invention
             [0002] The subject disclosure is directed to surgical implants, and more
    particularly, to orthopedic bone plates for internally fixating and dynamically
    stabilizing fractured bones and to screws for use with such bone plates.
    2.      Description of Related Art
             [0003] Bone fractures often require stabilization by internal fixation. Bone
    plates are among the most common orthopedic implants used to stabilize and internally
    fixate bone fractures. A typical bone plate is a rigid metal plate with guide holes
    through which bone screws can be passed. Bone screws are usually threaded into the
    bone above and below the fracture to secure the bone plate, thereby rigidly stabilizing
    and fixating the fracture.
             [0004] There has been increasing emphasis on bone plates that are capable of
    providing compression of the fracture as well as stabilization. Most conventional
    compression plates however, are made of metal with a modulus of elasticity that is
    higher than that of bone and therefore, these compression plates have a limited ability
    to apply controlled amounts of compressive force to a fracture. Moreover, the use of
    such bone plates produces a mechanical system in which the majority of the stress is
    borne by the plate rather than the bone. This can impair the healing process in a
    fractured bone. Furthermore, it is now known that a controlled compressive load
    should be maintained across a fracture to promote rapid healing. Conventional, static
    bone plates do not provide or maintain such conditions.
             [0005] An example of a dynamic vertebral column plate is disclosed in U.S.
    Patent PG Publication No. 2010/0234895 to Hess published on September 16, 2010, the

WO 2013/170164                                                              PCT/US2013/040570
    disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for purposes of
    enablement.
    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
             [0006] Clearly, there is a need in the art for a dynamic bone plate that can be
    readily used to stabilize bone fractures.
             [0007] In one embodiment, the subject technology is directed to a bone fracture
    plate assembly including a female plate portion and a male plate portion. The female
    plate portion has an upstanding post, a female dovetail, two apertures for fasteners, and
    an arm extending from a first end parallel to the female plate portion. The arm has a
    plurality of ratchet teeth grouped together. The male plate portion has two upstanding
    posts, a male dovetail for coupling into the female dovetail so that the plate portions
    only move linearly with respect to each other, a slot for receiving the arm, two
    apertures for fasteners, and a pawl for engaging the ratchet teeth. A spring dynamically
    connects the plate portions by applying a compressive load therebetween. The spring
    has a head portion defining a hole for coupling to the post of the female plate portion as
    well as a pair of elongated ears extending from the head portion. Each ear defines a
    slot for coupling to the posts of the male plate portion, respectively. The male dovetail
    inserts in the female dovetail so that the arm extends into the slot of the male plate
    portion and the ratchet teeth are engaged by the pawl to retain the plate portions
    together, and the spring mounts on the posts of the plate portions such that the spring
    biases the male and female plate portions together.
             [0008] The arm may also include a first tooth on a distal end, the first tooth
    being linearly spaced from the plurality of ratchet teeth. The first tooth interacts with a
    second pawl on the male plate portion for selectively locking the bone fracture plate
    assembly in an open position in which the male and female plate portions are held
    apart. The arm is deflectable so that the first tooth can be disengaged from the second
    pawl to unlock the plate portions.
             [0009] A top plate couples to the male and female plate portions for covering
    the spring. The top plate defines a hole for allowing a user to deflect the arm to
    separate the first tooth from the second pawl so that the spring dynamically biases the
    male and female plate together. The spring has a generally V-shape. The hole of the
    spring and the post of the female plate portion are square-shaped to prevent rotation of
    the spring with respect to the female plate portion.

WO 2013/170164                                                               PCT/US2013/040570
             [0010] In another embodiment, the subject technology is directed to a bone
    plate assembly including at least first and second plate segments adapted and
    configured for movement relative to one another from a spaced apart position and an
    approximated position. Ratchet means allowing the first and second plate segments to
    move from the approximated position while preventing the first and second plate
    segments from moving toward a spaced apart position. The ratchet means includes a
    ratcheting pawl member operatively associated with the first plate segment and a rack
    of ratchet teeth provided on the second plate segment for interacting with the pawl
    member.
             [0011] In still another embodiment, the subject technology is directed to a bone
    fracture plate assembly including a first plate portion, a second plate portion coupled to
    the first plate portion so that the plates move with respect to each other linearly, and a
    spring tensioning mechanism for dynamically connecting the first and second plate
    portions such that when mounted on opposite sides of a bone fracture, the first and
    second plate portions apply a compressive load to the bone fracture.
             [0012] Preferably, first means are provided for selectively limiting travel
    together between the first and second plate portions to create an open position and
    second means are provided for selectively limiting separation between the first and
    second plate portions to create a closed position. The first means can be a distal ratchet
    tooth and a first pawl associated with the first and second plate portions, respectively,
    and the second means can be a set of ratchet teeth and a second pawl associated with
    the first and second plate portions, respectively. Adjustment means are associated with
    at least one of the plate portions for adjusting a force vector of the spring tensioning
    means relative to an angle of the bone fracture. In one embodiment, the spring
    tensioning mechanism is a spring mounted on posts and the adjustment means is a
    plurality of mounting locations for the spring. Also, adjustment means can be
    associated with at least one of the plate portions for applying a pre-load to the
    compression mechanism (e.g., spool can be turned, plate can be selectively ratcheted by
    surgeon, etc.).
             [0013] It should be appreciated that the present technology can be implemented
    and utilized in numerous ways, including without limitation as a kit, a process, an
    apparatus, a system, a device, a method for applications now known and later
    developed. These and other unique features of the technology disclosed herein will

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
            [0058] The present disclosure overcomes many of the prior art problems associated
    with dynamic bone fracture plates. The advantages, and other features of the
    technology disclosed herein, will become more readily apparent to those having
    ordinary skill in the art from the following detailed description of certain preferred
    embodiments taken in conjunction with the drawings which set forth representative
    embodiments of the present invention and wherein like reference numerals identify
    similar structural elements.
            [0059] All relative descriptions herein such as left, right, up, and down are with
    reference to the Figures, and not meant in a limiting sense. The illustrated
    embodiments can be understood as providing exemplary features of varying detail of
    certain embodiments, and therefore, features, components, modules, segments,
    mechanisms, elements, and/or aspects of the illustrations can be otherwise combined,
    interconnected, sequenced, separated, interchanged, positioned, and/or rearranged
    without materially departing from the disclosed systems or methods. Additionally, the
    shapes and sizes of components are also exemplary and unless otherwise specified, can
    be altered without materially affecting or limiting the disclosed technology.
             [0060] Referring to Figure 1, a perspective view of a bone fracture plate
    assembly 100 in a static or open position in accordance with the subject technology is
    shown. In brief overview, the bone fracture plate assembly 100 provides not only
    stabilization but compression to facilitate advantageous healing of the bone fracture. In
    some embodiments, the compression force or vector is parallel to the length of the bone
    fracture plate assembly 100. The compression force may also be at an angle with
    respect to the length and even variable to match a particular application as described
    below with respect to different embodiments.
             [0061] The bone fracture plate assembly 100 includes a female plate portion
     102 coupled to a male plate portion 120. The plate segments or plate portions 102, 120
    are adapted and configured for movement relative to one another from a spaced apart or
    "open" position and an approximated or "closed" position. Various means allow the
    plate portions 102, 120 to move from open to closed while preventing the plate portions
                                                  -7-

WO 2013/170164                                                             PCT/US2013/040570
     102, 120 from moving toward a spaced apart position. Further, the open position is
    static, in which the bone fracture plate assembly 100 does not apply compression
    whereas the closed position is dynamic, in which the bone fracture plate assembly 100
    applies compression.
             [0062] Referring now to Figure 2, an exploded perspective view of the bone
    fracture plate assembly of Figure 1 is shown. The female plate portion 102 has an
    upstanding post 104 located near a first end 106. The female plate portion 102 defines
    a female dovetail 108. A second end 110 of the female plate portion 102 defines two
    apertures 112 for fasteners (not shown) that attached the female plate portion 102 to
    bone.
             [0063] An arm 114 extends from the first end 106 parallel to the female plate
    portion 102. The arm 114 has a plurality of ratchet teeth 116 grouped in an
    intermediate location. The arm 114 also includes a tooth 118 on a distal end 119, the
    tooth 118 being linearly spaced from the grouped teeth 116.
             [0064] The male plate portion 120 has two upstanding posts 122. A first end
     124 of the male plate portion 120 defines a male dovetail 126 that couples into the
    female dovetail 108 so that the plate portions 102, 120 only move linearly with respect
    to each other when the dovetails 108, 126 are engaged. The dovetail shapes may be
    rounded, L-shaped, angular and other configurations to allow substantially only linear
    movement when coupled. A second end 130 of the male plate portion 120 defines two
    apertures 132, similar to the female plate portion 102, for bone fasteners (not shown).
    Each plate portion 102, 120 defines a tack hole 129.
             [0065] The male plate portion 120 defines a slot 128 for receiving the arm 114,
    wherein the slot 128 terminates in an open area 131 that is lower than the adjacent area
     127. In one embodiment, the open area 131 is about 0.6 mm lower that the adjacent
    area 127. The male plate portion 120 has a first pawl 134 for engaging the ratchet teeth
     116 in the closed position (see Figure 7) and a second pawl 135 for engaging the distal
    tooth 118 in the open position (see Figure 4). The pawls 134, 135 may extend into the
    slot 128 or the teeth 116, 118 may extend upward out of the slot 128, or both to
    accomplish the interaction.
             [0066] As best seen in Figure 4, in the open position, only the distal tooth 118
    and second pawl 135 are engaged. This engagement prevents the bone fracture plate
    assembly 100 from moving to the closed position. In other words, the distal tooth 118
    and second pawl 135 are configured to hold the plate portions 102, 120 slightly
                                                 -8-

WO 2013/170164                                                             PCT/US2013/040570
    separated, hence in the open position. The amount of separation or gap 143 between
    the plates 102, 120 is preferably about 2 mm. In other embodiments, the gap 143 is
    less or more than 2 mm with a range of 2-5 mm being appropriate for most
    applications. As best seen in Figure 6, in order to release the engagement of the distal
    tooth 118 and second pawl 135, the arm 114 is deflectable so that the distal tooth 118
    can be disengaged from the second pawl 135. When released, the plate portions 102,
     120 are pulled into the closed position by a spring 140.
             [0067] Referring to Figures 2 and 3 and 5, the spring 140 extends from the
    female plate portion post 104 to the male plate portions posts 122 to dynamically
    connect the plate portions 102, 120 by applying a compressive load therebetween. The
    spring 140 has an apex or head portion 142 defining a hole 144 for coupling to the post
     104. Preferably, the hole 144 of the spring 140 and the post 104 of the female plate
    portion 102 are square-shaped to prevent rotational movement of the spring 140.
    Triangular, star, rectangular, trapezoidal, hexagon, key-hole and many shapes as well as
    simply spot welding, clipping, pinning, and screwing the spring 140 to the female plate
    portion 102 would accomplish the same result of rotationally fixing the spring 140 with
    respect to the female plate portion 102. The post 104 and hole 144 may also be round
    to allow for rotation.
             [0068] A pair of elongated ears 146 extend from the head portion 142. Each
    ear 146 defines a slot 148 for coupling to the posts 122 of the male plate portion 120,
    respectively. The posts 122 are shaped so that the posts 122 can freely move within the
    slots 148. The generally V-shape of the spring 140 creates a compression force
    between the plates 102, 120 that generally biases the plates 102, 120 together. As
    noted above, in the open position, the engagement of the distal tooth 118 and second
    pawl 135 prevents the spring's compression force from bringing the plates 102, 120
    together.
             [0069] In a preferred embodiment, the spring 140 is fabricated from a memory
    alloy such as nitinol so that the ears will press outward on the posts 122 to create a
    force vector that pulls the plates 102, 120 together. The spring may take many different
    shapes as well such as a C-shape, a U-shape, a M-shape with two flex points, a V-shape
    as well as more typical coil and flexure spring arrangements, whether it be one or a
    plurality of springs to create the desired force.
             [0070] Referring to Figures 1-7, the bone fracture plate assembly 100 also
    includes a top plate 150 coupled to the plate portions 102, 120 for covering the spring
                                                  -9-

WO 2013/170164                                                               PCT/US2013/040570
    140. The top plate 150 is preferably welded to one of the plate portions 102, 120. In
    another embodiment, the top plate includes a lip that is captured in the dovetails 108,
    126 when assembled. The top plate may also include a depending projection (not
    shown) that engages the female plate portion 102 and the spring 140 to fix the head
    portion 142 to the female plate portion 102. The top plate 150 defines a hole 152 for
    allowing the surgeon to deflect the arm 118 as described below with respect to Figures
    6, 7 and 9.
             [0071] Referring now to Figure 4, as noted above, when assembled, the male
    dovetail 126 inserts in the female dovetail 108 so that the arm 114 extends into the slot
    128 and the spring 140 is placed over the posts 104, 122. Although the spring 140
    urges the plate portions 102, 120 together, the distal tooth 118 engages the second pawl
    135 to maintain the bone fracture plate assembly 100 open. The top cover 150 is in
    place and the bone fracture plate assembly 100 is ready for deployment.
             [0072] Referring now to Figure 8, a perspective view of the bone fracture plate
    assembly 100 being fastened to a bone 50 with a fracture 52 is shown. Preferably, the
    fracture 52 has a gap 54 that will be closed by the bone fracture plate assembly 100.
    Initially, the bone fracture plate assembly 100 is in the static or open position. The
    surgeon places the bone fracture plate assembly 100 on the bone 50 so that the length of
    the bone fracture plate assembly 100 is perpendicular to the bone fracture 52. This
    aligns the compression force vector to be perpendicular to the bone fracture 52 as well.
             [0073] To hold the bone fracture plate assembly 100 in place, the surgeon may
    use a temporary fastener (not shown) in the tack holes 129 to temporarily mount the
    bone fracture plate assembly 100. The tack holes 129 are particularly useful when the
    bone fracture plate assembly 100 is not preassembled and/or does not include a locking
    mechanism to maintain the open condition. In such case, the surgeon partially
    assembles the bone fracture plate assembly in place, may tack it down and engage the
    spring mechanism. The tack holes 129 can also be used after screw insertion with a
    tool to "pre-compress" the plate by pinching the plate segments together.
             [0074] Still referring to Figure 8, after tacking the bone fracture plate assembly
    100 temporarily in place in the open position, the surgeon fixes the bone fracture plate
    assembly 100 more permanently by inserting bone fasteners 56 through the holes 112,
    132 and into the bone 50 with a screwdriver 58.
             [0075] Referring to Figures 6 and 9, after fixing the bone fracture plate
    assembly 100 about the fracture, the surgeon uses a pointed tool 60 to momentarily
                                                  - 10 -

WO 2013/170164                                                                PCT/US2013/040570
    deflect the arm 114 so that the distal tooth 118 disengages the second pawl 135. At this
    point, the compression force of the spring 140 pulls the plate portions 102, 120 together
    to close not only the plate gap 143 but the bone fracture 52/bone fracture gap 54 as
    well. It is envisioned that the plate portions 102, 120 do not need to completely close.
             [0076] Referring now to Figure 7, a sectional local view taken at line 7-7 of
    Figure 5 illustrates the dynamic closed position. As the plate portions 102, 120 come
    together into the closed position, the distal tooth 118 moves away from the second pawl
    135 so that when the arm 114 returns to the normal position, the distal tooth 118 no
    longer engages the second pawl 135. In another embodiment, the arm 118 bends
    permanently out of the way. For example, the arm 118 may have a crease, indentation
    or other predefined weak area upon which the arm 118 bends so that once pushed out of
    the way, the distal tooth 118 and the second pawl 135 do not re-engage.
             [0077] As the plate portions 102, 120 come together, the first pawl 134 and the
    plurality of teeth 116 become engaged to prevent the plate portions 102, 120 from
    subsequently moving apart. Even though the bone fracture has been closed by the bone
    fracture plate assembly 100, the spring 140 continues to apply a compressive force
    across the fracture to aid in the healing process.
            [0078] Referring now to Figures 10-12, a top open, an open sectional and a closed
    sectional view, respectively, of another bone fracture plate assembly 200 in accordance
    with the subject technology is shown. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in
    the pertinent art, the bone fracture plate assembly 200 utilizes similar principles to the
    bone fracture plate assembly 100 described above. Accordingly, like reference
    numerals preceded by the numeral "2" instead of the numeral "1", are used to indicate
    like elements. The primary difference of the bone fracture plate assembly 200 in
    comparison to the bone fracture plate assembly 100 is the modification of the structure to
    maintain the bone fracture plate assembly 200 in the open position. Thus, the following
    description mainly addresses this modification.
            [0079] In the open position shown in Figure 11, the male plate portion 220 still
    defines a slot 228 into which the arm 214 extends but a captive screw 256 extends into the
    slot 228 to act as a stop against the distal end 219 of the arm 214. Once the bone fracture
    plate assembly 200 is fixed in place about a fracture, the surgeon backs out the captive
    screw 256 (or removes the screw 256 altogether depending upon how it is configured), to
    allow the plate segments 202, 220 to come together in the dynamic or closed position.

WO 2013/170164                                                                PCT/US2013/040570
            [0080] Referring now to Figures 13 and 14, a perspective open and a perspective
    closed view, respectively, of another bone fracture plate assembly 300 in accordance
    with the subject technology is shown. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in
    the pertinent art, the bone fracture plate assembly 300 utilizes similar principles to the
    bone fracture plate assemblies 100, 200 described above. Accordingly, like reference
    numerals preceded by the numeral "3 instead of the numeral "1"or "2", are used to
    indicate like elements. The primary difference of the bone fracture plate assembly 300
    is again modification of the structure to maintain the bone fracture plate assembly 300 in
    the open position. Thus, the following description mainly addresses this modification.
            [0081] In the open position shown in Figure 13, the male plate portion 320
    includes a selectively rotatable cam 360 that engages a block 362 on the distal end 319 of
    the arm 314. The block 362 may define a cupped surface (not explicitly referenced), that
    helps capture the cam 360. The cam 360 and block 362 are sized so that when engaged,
    the bone fracture plate assembly 300 remains open against the spring force. To transition
    to the dynamic closed position in Figure 14, the surgeon simply rotates the cam 360 off
    the block 362. The cam 360 can be rotated back to re-engage the block 362 to spread the
    plate segments 302, 320 back to the open position.
             [0082] Referring now to Figure 15, a perspective view of yet another bone
    fracture plate assembly 400 in the static or open position in accordance with the subject
    technology is shown. Again, the bone fracture plate assembly 400 utilizes similar
    principles to the previously discussed bone fracture plate assemblies 100, 200, 300 so
    similar numbering is used. The bone fracture plate assembly 400 includes a central
    female plate segment 402 and two outer male plate segments 420.
             [0083] To lock the bone fracture plate assembly 400 in the open position, cams
    460 are set against cupped blocks 462. To unlock the bone fracture plate assembly 400,
    the cams 460 are rotated away from the blocks 462. Rather than central dovetails, the
    bone fracture plate assembly 400 has at least one bar 466 extending from the male plate
    segments 420 into a groove 468 formed in the female plate segement 402. In the
    preferred embodiment, each male plate segment 420 has an outer bar 466 on each side
    of the spring 440 within a corresponding groove 468 in a sliding arrangement to act as
    a linear guide. Each bar 466 is coupled to the female plate segment 402 by a pin 470
    extending into the female plate segment 402 through a slot 472 formed in the bar 466.
    Alternatively, the bars 466 and groove 468 may be a dovetail arrangement. The bone
    fracture plate assembly 400 also includes a fastener locking member 469 that partially
                                                   - 12 -

WO 2013/170164                                                             PCT/US2013/040570
    extends into the mounting holes to engage a ridge in the fasteners (not shown) or
    completely cover the fasteners to retain the fasteners. Alternatively, the locking
    member 469 may seat on top of a shoulder on the fastener to retain the fastener.
             [0084] It is noted that the bone fracture plate assembly 400 does not include
    ratchet means for allowing the plate segments 402, 420 to move closer together while
    preventing the plate segments 402, 420 from moving toward a spaced apart position.
    Referring now to Figure 16, a top view of an alternative spring 540 with a locking
    feature 576 that can be utilized with all of subject technology is shown. The spring 540
    is V-shaped with an apex hole 544 coupled to a post 504. The slots 548 similarly
    couple to posts 522 however the slots 548 form a triangular locking feature 576 such
    that upon the posts 522 moving down the slot 548, the locking feature 576 prevents the
    posts 522 from moving upward to, in effect, prevent the plates 502, 520 from
    separating once brought together. The posts 522 may also have a triangular shape to
    more effectively interact with the triangular locking feature 576. In another
    embodiment, the slots 548 are arcuate or kidney shaped so that once the posts 522
    move from the outer end and overcome the intermediate hump, the posts 522 come to
    rest in the inner end and are effectively retained there. In another embodiment, the
    locking feature 576 is simply semi-circular ridges that the posts 522 can pass over but
    effectively rest in as a plurality of detent positions.
             [0085] Referring now to Figure 17, a top view of another alternative spring 640
    with a locking feature 676 is shown. The locking feature 676 includes a ratcheting
    pawl member 678 on the female plate segment 602 and a rack 680 of ratchet teeth
    provided on the male plate segment 620 for interacting with the pawl member 678.
             [0086] Referring now to Figure 18, there is illustrated another dynamic bone
    plate assembly 700 that includes at least first and second plate segments 722 and 724,
    which are adapted and configured for movement relative to one another from a spaced
    apart position shown in Figure 19 to an approximated position shown in Figure 20. A
    ratcheting pawl member 782 is on the first plate segment 722 and a rack of ratchet teeth
    784 are provided on the outer bar 766 of the second plate segment 724 for interacting
    with the pawl member 782. This ratchet mechanism allows the first and second plate
    segments 722, 724 to move from the spaced apart position of Figure 19 to the
    approximated position of Figure 20, while preventing the first and second plate
    segments 722, 724 from moving back toward a spaced apart position.

WO 2013/170164                                                            PCT/US2013/040570
             [0087] Referring now to Figure 21, is a somewhat schematic perspective view
    of a bone fracture plate assembly 800 fastened to a bone 50 in the dynamic or closed
    position in accordance with the subject technology. The bone fracture plate assembly
    800 provides an ability to vary the position of the compressive force vector with respect
    to the length of the bone fracture plate assembly 800. As a result, for an angled bone
    fracture 52, the compressive force vector can be aligned to be substantially
    perpendicular to the angled bone fracture 52.
             [0088] The bone fracture plate assembly 800 has two opposing plate segments
    802, 820 each plate segment 802 defining holes 804 for fasteners 806 for mounting to
    the bone 50. A first central plate 808 is mounted on one of the plate segments 802 such
    as by a rivet (not shown). A second central plate 810 is mounted on the other of the
    plate segments 802. The first central plate 808 has preferably fixed two upstanding
    posts 814. The second central plate 810 has one upstanding post 816 that movably
    mounts within an arcuate slot 818. Thus, when the spring 840 is mounted on the posts
    814, 816, the post 816 can be moved and locked within the arcuate slot 818 to rotate the
    compressive force vector to align substantially perpendicularly to the bone fracture 52.
    The spring 840 may be any of the versions disclosed herein, an elastic, a coiled wire
    and the like.
             [0089] Figure 21a is a perspective view of another bone plate assembly 800a
    fastened to a bone 50 in the dynamic or closed position in accordance with the subject
    technology. The bone plate assembly 800a has outer plates 802a that mount to the
    bone 50. Each outer plate 802a has a central plate 810a that rotatably extends to
    cooperate with the opposing central plate 810a via a spring 840a. Linear guides 811a
    are provided on each side of the spring 840a so that the force vector align with the
    length of the central plates 810a. Once the bone plate assembly 800a is in place, the
    pivot point 813a of the central plates 810a can be locked down. For example, the pivot
    point 813a may be a partially inserted screw, which is fully inserted to lock down the
    central plates 810a.
             [0090] Figure 22 is a perspective view of another bone plate assembly 900
    fastened to a bone 50 in the dynamic or closed position in accordance with the subject
    technology. The bone plate assembly 900 includes outer plates 902, which may or may
    not be linearly aligned lengthwise. Instead of opposing central plates 810a like in
    Figure 21a, the bone plate assembly 900 has a central disc 911 that can be selectively
    rotated. The disc 911 has two-sub parts 913 that are separated to allow linear
                                                 - 14 -

    movement therebetween. A spring 940 spans the parts 913 to create a compressive
    force. Once the bone plate assembly 900 is in place, the pivot point 915 of the disc 911
    can be locked down. As noted herein, the disc 911 can be adapted to any of the bone
    plate assemblies of the subject technology to provide adjustments of the compression
    force vector to be about perpendicular to the bone fracture.
            [0091] Figure 23 is a modular plate system 1000 in perspective view. The
    modular plate system 1000 again allows aligning the compression force vector of one
    or more bone fracture plate assemblies 1002 perpendicularly to one or more bone
    fractures 52. The modular plate system 1000 includes a frame 1004 that couples to one
    or more bone fracture plate assemblies 1002 by one or more bolts 1006.
            [0092] In Figure 23, one bone fracture plate assembly 1002 is shown and the
    ends 108 of the frame 1004 are coupled to the bone 50 by simple plates 1010 and
    fasteners 1012. Alternatively, additional and intermediate bone fracture plate
    assemblies may couple to the frame 1004 so that the frame 1004 provides structural
    support to the bone 50 or spine as the case may be.
            [0093] Figure 24 is an exploded view of another bone plate assembly 1100 in
    accordance with the subject technology. The male plate portion 1120 of the bone plate
    assembly 1100 has an engagement member 1181 with a central flexible tab 1180 with
    ratchet teeth 1182 thereon. The male plate portion 1120 also defines a distal cavity
     1184 in the engagement member 1181. The female plate portion 1102 defines a hollow
     1186 (shown in phantom line), or a dovetail as the case may be, that snugly receives the
    engagement member 1181. A passage 1188 through the female plate portion 1102
    allows a linear spring 1190 to extend through the female plate portion 1102 so that a
    head 1190 of the linear spring 1190 is captured in the cavity 1184. Another end of the
    spring 1194 is enlarged to be captured in a hollow 1196 of the female plate portion
     1102. Thus, when assembled, the linear spring 1190 will urge the plate portions 1102,
     1120 together. The female plate portion 1102 forms a window 1198 so that the ratchet
    teeth 1182 couple thereto for preventing the plate portions 1102, 1120 from separation
    unless the flexible tab 1180 is pushed downward.
            [0094] Figure 25 is an exploded view of still another bone plate assembly 1200
    in accordance with the subject technology. The bone plate assembly 1200 is quite
    similar to the bone plate assembly 1100 except that the flexible tab 1280, spring 1290,
    cavity 1284 and hollow 1188 are reconfigured. Hence, like reference numerals are

    bone plate assembly 1300. The bone plate assembly 1300 has a male plate portion
     1320 and a female plate portion 1302, each of which forms several dovetail fingers
     1327, 1329 that, when interlocked, only allow linear travel of the plate portions 1302,
     1320. The outer fingers 1327 of the female plate portion 1302 and the outer fingers
     1329 of the male plate portion 1320 include ratchet teeth 1382, 1383 that interact to
    deter the plates 1302, 1320 separating once engaged. Preferably, the outer fingers 1327
    are sized and configured to deflect or flex to facilitate smooth operation of the ratchet
    mechanism.
            [0096] Figure 27 is a perspective view of a modular wedge 60 for use with a
    bone plate assembly (shown in Figure 28). The modular wedge 60 is dimensioned and
    configured to operatively engage an outer profile of at least one of the plate portions to
    act as a spacer. The modular wedge 60 may be formed from a metal material, a
    biologic material, titanium, bone, PEEK, combinations thereof and the like.
            [0097] Referring now to Figure 28, a perspective view of the modular wedge
    60 on a bone plate assembly 1400 is shown. The bone plate assembly 1400 is shown in
    the closed position as it would be with the modular wedge 60 in place after final
    placement to provide separation and support between the ends 1401, 1403 of the bone
    plate assembly 1400.
            [0098] As can be seen upon review of the subject disclosure, selection of the
    configuration of the spring largely determines the compression force. Different cross
    sections and angle combinations at the flex points of the spring result in different
    compression forces. Table 1 below illustrates some exemplary data for various
    configuration springs of a U-shape as drawn in Figure 15. The cross-section is taken at
    the flex points (reference numeral 481 as seen in Figure 15) and the springs are 0.5 mm
    thick. The angle would be the inner angle between the extending ears. Typically, the
    resulting force is about 9-10 lbs.

             [0099] The springs were fabricated from nitinol. A preferred cross-section and
    angle combination will be approximately 1.36-1.40 mm and 97-100', respectively. The
    springs are designed so that compression is maintained even when the plates have fully
    closed.
             [0100] The bone plates and systems of the subject technology would be
    advantageous to provide support and/or stabilization and/or compression in a wide
    variety of applications. For example, without limitation, the subject technology is
    useful in applications related to the clavicle, humerus, jaw bone, ulna, radius, hand (1-5
    metacarpal), rib, scapula, parts of the lower body such as the femur, tibia, fibula, pelvis,
    and parts of the foot or ankle such as the calcaneus, metatarsal bones, talus and cuboid
    among many other possibilities. The subject technology is particularly useful to
    stabilize the spine after, for example, a spinal procedure like disk removal.
             [0101] The bone plates disclosed herein may utilize screws with a retention
    feature. Any of the following screws and variations thereof would be adaptable to the
    subject technology.
             [00] Referring to Figs. 29a-d, there is shown a bone screw wherein two strips
    of flexible material are contained in the plate. The strips partially obstruct the screw
    aperture. As a screw is inserted into the aperture it pulls the strip down, thereby pulling
    the plate down as well. Also shown is a bone screw with an O-ring captured by the
    head of the screw. The O-ring cross-section is larger than the screw aperture cross
    section. When the screw is inserted, the O-ring pulls downward on top plate.
             [00] Figures 30a-c show a screw and plate arrangement wherein flexible O-ring
    type material is contained in the fracture plate aperture, with an inner diameter that is
    smaller than that of the bone screw. As the screw is advanced, the O-ring stretches
    around the screw and it is pulled downward, thereby forcing the plate downward.
             [00] Referring to Fig. 31, there is illustrated a domed spring washer disc
    connected to the neck of a bone screw. The spring washer disc will flex and maintain
    tension between the screw head and bone plate within a counter-sunk bore in the plate.

             [00] In Fig. 32, there is shown a spring within a threaded body anchor that is
    put into bone and a screw is threaded into the internal spring to create the constant
    tension force.
             [00] Referring to Figs 33a-c, there is illustrated a screw body with a hexagonal
    stem that engages a screw head to allow the longitudinal travel of the head relative to
    the body. An internal spring forces the screw head towards the screw body flange.
    When implanted, the head maintains a constant tension between to bones or bone
    fragments. One possible use in Scaphoid fusions
             [00] Figures 34a-b show a two-piece screw, wherein a bottom portion of the
    screw has a tab that rides inside of an upper portion of the screw. A thread pattern
    allows the bottom portion to extend away from top portion, compressing a spring
    associated with the tab. The compressed spring leads to a compressive force between
    two screw portions.
             [00] Fig. 35 shows a similar device as that which is shown in Fig. 34, except it
    uses a shape memory alloy such as Nitinol (or other suitable material) band instead of a
    compression spring.
             [00] Referring to Fig. 36, there is illustrated a bone screw having two pin arms
    that are captured in the head of the screw for engaging a complementary feature in a
    screw receiving apertures of a bone plate. An internal spring loaded plunger keeps the
    pin arms in an expanded out locked position. When the plunger is compressed the pin
    arms are able to retract inward.
             [00] Fig. 37 illustrates a two-piece screw consisting of a headless threaded stud
    and a compression head that is threaded onto the stud. The compression head contains
    inner and outer bodies and a wave spring that acts on the two bodies. The inner body is
    connected to the stud and the wave spring facilitates a compressive force action relative
    to the outer body of the compression head and the stud.
             [00] Referring to Fig. 38, there is shown a bone screw with an internal plunger
    that is forced upward to spread the screw head outward relative to a counter-sunk bone
    plate aperture. As the screw head spreads outward the geometry will naturally pull the
    bone plate downward.
             [00] Referring to Figs. 39 and 40, there is shown a bone screw having an
    axially movable internal spring loaded plunger that is mounted to interact with a pair of
    engagement pins. When the plunger interacts with the pins, they are driven radially
                                                  - 18 -

    outwardly from an unlocked position (Fig. 39) to a locked position (Fig. 40), wherein
    the pins will engage a complementary feature in the aperture wall of a bone plate.
             [00] Referring now to Figs. 4la-b, there is illustrated a bone screw assembly
    which includes a bone screw and a threaded cap. The threaded cap is provided with
    tabs, flanges or an O-ring that is captured in an annular groove formed in the aperture
    wall of a bone plate. As the cap is threaded into the central threaded bore of a bone
    screw, it pulls the bone plate downward toward the bone.
             [00] Referring now to Figure 42, another bone plate assembly 1500 is shown.
    The bone plate assembly 1500 includes wires 1590 extending between hubs 1592
    located on each plate portion 1502, 1520. The wires 1590 connect to one of the plate
    segments 1502, 1520 and a spool 1594 which is free to rotate. When the spool 1594 is
    rotated, the wires 1592 wrap around the spool 1594 thereby shortening the wire length
    and pulling the plate segments 1502, 1520 inward. Preferably, multiple wires 1590 are
    used. Also, the spool 1594 may be made with ratchet teeth to selectively rotate in one
    direction and, in turn, the wires 1590 could be tightened before implantation, thereby
    creating a pre-load.

    to preferred embodiments of dynamic bone fracture plates, those skilled in the art will
    readily appreciate that various changes and/or modifications may be made thereto
    without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject invention as defined by the
