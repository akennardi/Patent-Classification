     SULFONYL AMIDE DERIVATIVES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ABNORMAL CELL
                                            GROWTH
           The present application is a divisional application of Australian Application
   No. <removed-apn>, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
 5                                 Background of the Invention
           This invention relates to novel sulfonyl amide derivatives that are useful in the
   treatment of abnormal cell growth, such as cancer, in mammals. This invention also
   relates to a method of using such compounds in the treatment of abnormal cell growth
   in mammals, especially humans, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such
 0 compounds.
           It is known that a cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of
   a portion of its DNA into an oncogene (i.e., a gene which, on activation, leads to the
   formation of malignant tumor cells). Many oncogenes encode proteins that are
   aberrant tyrosine kinases capable of causing cell transformation. Alternatively, the
 5 overexpression of a normal proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase may also result in
   proliferative disorders, sometimes resulting in a malignant phenotype.
           Receptor tyrosine kinases are enzymes which span the cell membrane and
   possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors such as epidermal growth
   factor, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular portion which functions as a
?0 kinase to phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues in proteins and hence to influence
   cell proliferation. Other receptor tyrosine kinases include c-erbB-2, c-met, tie-2,
   PDGFr, FGFr, and VEGFR. It is known that such kinases are frequently aberrantly
   expressed in common human cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer
   such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer, leukemia, and ovarian, bronchial or
?5 pancreatic cancer. It has also been shown that epidermal growth factor receptor
   (EGFR), which possesses tyrosine kinase activity, is mutated and/or overexpressed in
   many human cancers such as brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, breast,
   head and neck, oesophageal, gynecological and thyroid tumors.
           Accordingly, it has been recognized that inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases
30 are useful as selective inhibitors of the growth of mammalian cancer cells. For

                                              - 1a
   example, erbstatin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, selectively attenuates the growth in
  athymic nude mice of a transplanted human mammary carcinoma that expresses
  epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR) but is without effect on the
  growth of another carcinoma that does not express the EGF receptor. Thus, selective
5 inhibitors of certain receptor tyrosine kinases, are useful in the treatment of abnormal
  cell growth, in

                                                     -2
        particular cancer, in mammals. In addition to receptor tyrosine kinases, selective
        inhibitors of certain non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as FAK (focal adhesion kinase),
        Ick, src, abl or serine/threonine kinases (e.g., cyclin dependent kinases), are useful in
       the treatment of abnormal cell growth, in particular cancer, in mammals. FAK is also
   5   known as the Protein-Tyrosine Kinase 2, PTK2.
                Convincing evidence suggests that FAK, a cytoplasmic, non-receptor tyrosine
       kinase, plays an essential role in cell-matrix signal transduction pathways (Clark and
       Brugge 1995, Science 268: 233-239) and its aberrant activation is associated with an
       increase in the metastatic potential of tumors (Owens et at. 1995, Cancer Research 55:
 10   2752-2755). FAK was originally identified as a 125 kDa protein highly tyrosine
      phosphorylated in cells transformed by v-Src. FAK was subsequently found to be a
      tyrosine kinase that localizes to focal adhesions, which are contact points between
      cultured cells and their underlying substratum and sites of intense tyrosine
      phosphorylation. FAK is phosphorylated and, thus, activated in response to extracellular
 15   matrix (ECM)-binding to integrins. Recently, studies have demonstrated that an
      increase in FAK mRNA levels accompanied invasive transformation of tumors and
      attenuation of the expression of FAK (through the use of antisense oligonucleotides)
      induces apoptosis in tumor cells (Xu et al. 1996, Cell Growth and Diff. 7: 413-418). In
      addition to being expressed in most tissue types, FAK is found at elevated levels in most
20    human cancers, particularly in highly invasive metastases.
               Various compounds, such as styrene derivatives, have also been shown to
     possess tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties. Five European patent publications,
     namely EP 0 566 226 Al (published October 20, 1993), EP 0 602 851 Al (published
     June 22, 1994), EP 0 635 507 Al (published January 25, 1995), EP 0 635 498 Al
25   (published January 25, 1995), and EP 0 520 722 Al (published December 30, 1992),
     refer to certain bicyclic derivatives, in particular quinazoline derivatives, as possessing
     anti-cancer properties that result from their tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties.
               Also, World Patent Application WO 92/20642 (published November 26, 1992),
     refers to certain bis-mono and bicyclic aryl and heteroaryl compounds as tyrosine kinase
30   inhibitors that are useful in inhibiting abnormal cell proliferation. World Patent
     Applications W096/16960 (published June 6, 1996), WO 96/09294 (published March 6,
     1996), WO 97/30034 (published August 21, 1997), WO 98/02434 (published January
     22, 1998), WO 98/02437 (published January 22, 1998), and WO 98/02438 (published
     January 22, 1998), also refer to substituted bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives as

                                                   -3
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are useful for the same purpose. In addition, the following
      list of publications relate to bis-mono and bicyclic aryl and heteroaryl compounds that
      may optionally be used as tyrosine kinase inhibitors: WO 03/030909, WO 03/032997,

  5   No. 2003/0162802, US Patent No. 5,863,924, WO 03/078404, US Patent No. 4,507146,
      WO 99/41253, WO 01/72744, WO 02/48133, US Patent Application Publication No.
      2002/156087, WO 02/102783, and WO 03/063794.
               U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040220177 relates to a broad class of
      novel pyrimidine derivatives that are kinase inhibitors, and more specifically, inhibitors of
 10   FAK. Moreover, U.S. Patent No. 7,107,335 relates more specifically to a subset of
     pyrimidine derivatives, i.e., those bearing a 5-aminooxindole, which are tyrosine kinase
     inhibitors, and more particularly, FAK inhibitors. Compounds such as these are useful in
     the treatment of abnormal cell growth.
              Accordingly, a need exists for additional selective inhibitors of certain receptor
 15  and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, useful in the treatment of abnormal cell growth, such
     as cancer, in mammals. The present invention provides novel sulfonyl amide
     derivatives that are kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase,
     FAK, Aurora (e.g., Aurora-1 and Aurora-2), Pyk, HgK, and are useful in the treatment of
     abnormal cell growth.

                                                         0
     Compounds of the invention can accommodate up to three such replacements.
15           The present invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are
     identical to those recited in formulae 1,la, lb, Ic,Id and II, but for the fact that one or
    more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different
    from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes
    that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen,
20  carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as, but not limited to,
         3
    2H, H, 13C, C,

                          N, 1, 17, 31P, 32 p, 35S, 'OF, and 3Cl, respectively. Compounds of
    the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said
    compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other
    isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically
25  labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive
    isotopes such as 3H and "C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue
    distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3 H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly
    preferred for their ease of preparation and delectability. Further, substitution with

                                                     -44
      heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2 H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages
      resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or
      reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances.
      Isotopically-labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be
  5   prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the
      Examples and Preparations below, by substituting a readily available isotopically
      labeled reagent for a non-isotopically-labeled reagent.
              The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s)", as used herein, unless otherwise
      indicated, includes salts of acidic or basic groups which may be present in the compounds
 10   of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention that are basic in nature
      are capable of forming a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids.
     The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of
     such basic compounds are those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts
     containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride,
 15  hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate,
     isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, pantothenate,
     bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate,
     saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate,
     benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate [i.e., 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3
20   naphthoate)] salts. The compounds of the present invention that include a basic moiety,
     such as an amino group, may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with various amino
     acids, in addition to the acids mentioned above.
             The invention also relates to base addition salts of the compounds of the invention.
    The chemical bases that may be used as reagents to prepare pharmaceutically
25  acceptable base salts of those compounds of the compounds of the invention that are
    acidic in nature are those that form non-toxic base salts with such compounds. Such non
    toxic base salts include, but are not limited to those derived from such pharmacologically
    acceptable cations such as alkali metal cations (e.g., potassium and sodium) and alkaline
    earth metal cations (e.g., calcium and magnesium), ammonium or water-soluble amine
30  addition salts such as N-methylglucamine-(meglumine), and the lower alkanolammonium
    and other base salts of pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines.
             Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Non
    limiting examples of suitable base salts include the aluminum, arginine, benzathine,

                                                    -45
        calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine,
        olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts.
                Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate
        and hemicalcium salts.
   5            For a review on suitable salts, see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts:
        Properties, Selection, and Use by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, 2002). Methods for
        making pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the invention are known to
        one of skill in the art.
                This invention also encompasses compounds of the invention containing
 10    protective groups. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that compounds of the
       invention can also be prepared with certain protecting groups that are useful for
       purification or storage and can be removed before administration to a patient. The
       protection and deprotection of functional groups is described in "Protective Groups in
       Organic Chemistry", edited by J.W.F. McOmie, Plenum Press (1973) and "Protective
 15    Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd edition, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley
       Interscience (1999).
               The compounds of this invention include all stereoisomers (e.g., cis and trans
      isomers) and all optical isomers of compounds of the invention (e.g., R and S
      enantiomers), as well as racemic, diastereomeric and other mixtures of such isomers.
20             The compounds, salts and prodrugs of the present invention can exist in several
      tautomeric forms, including the enol and imine form, and the keto and enamine form and
      geometric isomers and mixtures thereof. All such tautomeric forms are included within
      the scope of the present invention. Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in
     solution. In solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. Even though one tautomer
25   may be described, the present invention includes all tautomers of the present
     compounds.
              The present invention also includes atropisomers of the present invention.
     Atropisomers refer to compounds of the invention that can be separated into rotationally
     restricted isomers.
30            The compounds of this invention may contain olefin-like double bonds. When such
     bonds are present, the compounds of the invention exist as cis and trans configurations
     and as mixtures thereof.
             The compounds of the invention may also exist in unsolvated and solvated forms.
     Accordingly, the invention also relates to the hydrates and solvates of the compounds of

                                                     - 46
        the invention. Thus, it will be understood that the compounds of formula 1,and
        pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof also include hydrates and solvates of said
        compounds of formula I, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as discussed
        below.
   5            The term "solvate" is used herein to describe a noncovelent or easily reversible
        combination between solvent and solute, or dispersion means and disperse phase. It
       will be understood that the solvate can be in the form of a solid, slurry (e.g., a
       suspension or dispersoid), or solution. Non-limiting examples of solvents include
       ethanol, methanol, propanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuan,
  10   methylene chloride, and water. The term 'hydrate' is employed when said solvent is
       water.
                A currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines
       isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates - see Polymorphism in
       Pharmaceutical Solids by K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995). Isolated
 15   site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with
      each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules
      lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal-ion
      coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion.
               When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined
 20   stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly
      bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content
      will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry
      will be the norm.
               The invention also relates to prodrugs of the compounds of the invention. Thus
25    certain derivatives of compounds of the invention which may have little or no
      pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be
     converted into compounds of the invention having the desired activity, for example, by
     hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as "prodrugs". Further information
     on the use of prodrugs may be found in Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14,
30   ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and W. Stella) and Bioreversible Carriers in Drug
     Design, Pergamon Press, 1987 (Ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical
     Association).
              Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by
     replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of the invention with

                                                     - 47
        certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-moieties' as described, for
        example, in Design of Prodrugs by H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).
                  Some non-limiting examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include
                  (I)   where the compound of the invention contains a carboxylic acid
   5    functionality (-COOH), an ester thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen
        of the carboxylic acid functionality of the compound of formula (I) is replaced by (C
        C0 )alkyl;
                 (ii)   where the compound of the invention contains an alcohol functionality (
        OH), an ether thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol
 10    functionality of the compound of the invention is replaced by (01 -C6)alkanoyloxymethyl;
       and
                 (iii)  where the compound of the invention contains a primary or secondary
       amino functionality (-NH 2 or -NHR where R # H), an amide thereof, for example, a
       compound wherein, as the case may be, one or both hydrogen atoms of the amino
 15    functionality of the compound of the invention is/are replaced by (C-CG)alkanoyl.
                Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing
      examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned
      references.
                Moreover, certain compounds of the invention may themselves act as prodrugs of
20    other compounds of the invention.
               Also included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of
      the invention, that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some
      examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include:
               (i)     where the compound of the invention contains a methyl group, an
25    hydroxymethyl derivative thereof (e.g., -CH3 -> -CH2OH):
               (ii)    where the compound of the invention contains an alkoxy group, an
     hydroxy derivative thereof (e.g., -OR' -> -OH);
               (iii)   where the compound of the invention contains a tertiary amino group, a
     secondary amino derivative thereof (e.g., -NR3 R4 -> -NHR 3 or -NHR4);
30             (iv)    where the compound of the invention contains a secondary amino group, a
     primary derivative thereof (e.g., ~NHRa -> -NH2);
              (v)      where the compound of the invention contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol
     derivative thereof (e.g., -Ph-> -PhOH); and

                                                     -48
                 (vi)   where the compound of the invention contains an amide group, a
         carboxylic acid derivative thereof (e.g., -CONH 2 -> COOH).
                 Compounds of the invention containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms
         can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of the invention contains
    5    an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible.
         Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric
         isomerism ('tautomerism') can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in
        compounds of the invention containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or
        so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It
  10    follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.
                Included within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers,
        geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including
        compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more
        thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically
 15     active, for example, d-lactate or -lysine, or racemic, for example, dltartrate or dl
        arginine.
               Cis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to
       those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallization.
               Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers
 20    include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the
       racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high
       pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).
               Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a
       suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the
25     compound of the invention contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1
       phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be
      separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the
      diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well
      known to a skilled person.
30            Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be
      obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on
      an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane
      or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of an alcoholic solvent such as

                                                        - 49
          isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine,
         typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.
                   When any racemate crystallizes, crystals of two different types are possible. The
         first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one
   5     homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar
         amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of
         crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.
                  While both of the crystal forms present in a racemic mixture have identical
         physical properties, they may have different physical properties compared to the true
 10      racemate. Racemic mixtures may be separated by conventional techniques known to
        those skilled in the art - see, for example, Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by E.
        L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, 1994).

                FAK cell-based Protocol for selectivity of kinase-dependent phosphoFAKY397
       Procedure:
               An inducible FAK cell-based assay in ELISA format for the screening of chemical
       matter to identify tyrosine kinase specific inhibitors was developed. The cell-based
 15    assay exploits the mechanism of the GeneSwitchTM system (InVitrogen) to
      exogenously control the expression and phosphorylation of FAK and the kinase
      dependent autophosphorylation site at residue Y397.
               Inhibition of the kinase-dependent autophosphorylation at Y397 results in a
      reduced absorbance signal at OD450. The signal is typically 0.9 to 1.5 00450 units
 20   with the noise falling in the range of 0.08 to 0.1 OD450 units. The values are reported
      as IC50s, pM concentration.
              On day 1, grow A431 -FAKwt in Ti 75 flasks. On the day prior to running the FAK
      cell-assay, seed A431.FAKwt cells in growth media on 96-well U-bottom plates. Allow
      cells to sit at 370C, 5% C02 for 6 to 8 hours prior to FAK induction. Prepare
25    Mifepristone stock solution of 10 pM in 100 % Ethanol. The stock solution is
      subsequently diluted to 10 X of the final concentration in Growth Media. Transfer 10 pl
     of this dilution (final concentration of 0.1 nM Mifepristone) into each well. Allow cells to
     sit at 37'C, 5% C02 overnight (12 to 16 hours). Also, prepare control wells without
     Mifepristone induction of FAK expression and phosphorylation.
30            On day 2, coat Goat Anti-Rabbit plate(s) with 3.5 pg/ml of phosphospecific
     FAKpY397 polyclonal antibody prepared in SuperBlock TBS buffer, and allow plate(s) to
     shake on a plate shaker at room temperature for 2 hours. Optionally, control wells may
     be coated with 3.5 pg/mI of control Capture antibody (Whole Rabbit igG molecules)
     prepared in SuperBlock TBS. Wash off excess FAKpY397 antibody 3 times using

                                                       - 78
          buffer. Block Anti-FAKpY397 coated plate(s) with 200 pl per well of 3%BSA/0.5%Tween
          Blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature on the plate shaker. While the plate(s)
          are blocking, prepare compound stock solutions of 5 mM in 100 % DMSO. The stock
          solutions are subsequently serially diluted to 10OX of the final concentration in 100%
    5     DMSO. Make a 1:10 dilution using the 1OOX solution into growth media and transfer 10
         pl of the appropriate compound dilutions to each well containing either the FAK induced
         or uninduced control A431 cells for 30 minutes at 370 C, 5% C02. Prepare RIPA lysis
         buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH7.4, 1%NP-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1
         mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, and one CompleteTM EDTA-free protease
  10     inhibitor pellet per 50 ml solution). At the end of 30 minutes compound treatment, wash
         off compound 3 times using TBS-T wash buffer. Lyse cells with 100 p1/well of RIPA
        buffer.
                 To the coated plate, remove blocking buffer and wash 3 times using TBS-T wash
        buffer. Using a 96-well automated microdispenser, transfer 100 pl of whole cell-lysate
  15    (from step 6) to the Goat Anti-Rabbit FAKpY397 coated plate(s) to capture
        phosphoFAKY397 proteins. Shake at room temperature for 2 hours. Wash off unbound
        proteins 3 times using TBS-T wash buffer. Prepare 0.5 pg/mi (1:2000 dilution) of UBI
        aFAK detection antibody in 3%BSA/0.5% Tween blocking buffer. Dispense 100 pl of
        UBI aFAK solution per well and shake for 30 minutes at room temperature. Wash off
 20    excess UBI aFAK antibody 3 times using TBS-T wash buffer. Prepare 0.08 pg/mI
       (1:5000 dilution) of secondary Anti-Mouse Peroxidase (Anti-2MHRP) conjugated
       antibody. Dispense 100 pl per well of the Anti-2MHRP solution and shake for 30 minutes
       at room temperature. Wash off excess Anti-2MHRP antibody 3 times using TBS-T wash
       buffer. Add 100 pl per well of room temperature TMB substrate solution to allow for
25     color development. Terminate the TMB reaction with 100 pl per well of TMB stop
       solution (0.09M H2SO4) and quantitate the signal by measurement of absorbance at
       450 nm on the BioRad microplate reader.

          than 25 nM.
                 Administration of the compounds of the present invention (hereinafter the "active
         compound(s)") can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to
   5     the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral
         injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion),
         topical, and rectal administration.
                 The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject
         being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the
 10     disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an
        effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per
        day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kgfday, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg
        human, this would amount to about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, preferably about 0.2 to about
        2.5 g/day. Insome instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range
 15     may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed
       without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided
        into several small doses for administration throughout the day.
                The active compound may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve one or
       more other anti-tumour substances, for example those selected from, for example, mitotic
20     inhibitors, for example vinblastine; alkylating agents, for example cis-platin, carboplatin
      and cyclophosphamide; anti-metabolites, for example 5-fluorouracil, cytosine arabinoside
      and hydroxyurea, or, for example, one of the preferred anti-metabolites disclosed in
      European Patent Application No. 239362 such as N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4
      oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino]-2-thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid; growth factor
25    inhibitors; cell cycle inhibitors; intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin and
      bleomycin; enzymes, for example interferon; and anti-hormones, for example anti
      estrogens such as Nolvadex@ (tamoxifen) or, for example anti-androgens such as
      Casodex@ (4'-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3'
     (trifluoromethyl)propionanilide). Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the
30   simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of the
     treatment.
               The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in aform suitable for oral
     administration as atablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution,
     suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for

                                                      - 80
        topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a
        suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for
        single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a
        conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the
   5    invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or
        pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.
                Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of
        active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or
        dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.
 10             Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various
       organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional
       ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral
       administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed
       together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex
 15    silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally,
       lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often
       useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed
      in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefor, include lactose or
      milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions
20    or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be
      combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if
      desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water,
      ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.
