              NEGATIVE PRESSURE STORAGE CONTAINER
   ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
 5           A negative pressure storage container includes a container cover, a
   container body, a rotary device, a gear transmission mechanism and a vacuum
   pump so arranged that rotating the rotary device drives a driving gear of a
   transmission gear set of the gear transmission mechanism to rotate an eccentric
   wheel, causing a link to reciprocate a reciprocating piston of a vacuum pump in
10 creating a negative pressure in the container body. When the negative pressure
   reaches a certain level, the bottom wall of a plastic inner cover member of the
   container cover is forced to curve and to carry the driving gear away from the
   rotary device; at this time, and thus, the rotary device runs idle at this time,
   preventing overloading the transmission gear set and prolonging the service life
15 of the gear transmission mechanism.

                      NEGATIVE PRESSURE STORAGE CONTAINER
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 5 1. Field of the Invention
              The present invention relates to storage container technology and
   more particularly, to a negative pressure storage container, which uses a rotary
   device to drive a vacuum pump in drawing air out of the container body, and the
   rotary device will run idle when a certain level of negative pressure is created in
10 the container body, avoiding damage to the transmission gear set.
   2. Description of the Related Art
              US Patent Number 9,296,542, issued to the present inventor, discloses
   a vacuum storage container, which includes a container housing, a drawer
15 mounted in the container housing and movable between a closed position and an
   open position, a rotary knob pivotally mounted in a door cover of the drawer,
   clockwork coupled to the rotary knob, a drive gear affixed to the rotary knob, a
   transmission gear set rotatable by the drive gear, an eccentric wheel rotatable by
   the transmission gear set, a pumping pump mounted in the drawer and coupled
20 to the eccentric wheel for creating a vacuum in the container housing, an
   ejection mechanism adapted for ejecting the drawer out of the container housing,
   and an operating member control mechanism adapted for locking the drawer to
   the container housing and operable to unlock the drawer for enabling the drawer
   to be ejected out of the container housing by the ejection mechanism.
25
              According to the aforesaid prior art mechanical type vacuum storage
   container, when the internal air of the container housing leaks out, the container
   housing cannot be automatically fills up with air. There are electronic type
   negative pressure storage containers commercially available. However, if the
30 internal air of an electronic type negative pressure storage container leaks out, a
   vacuum pumping operation must be performed again, bringing inconvenience.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
                                             1

              The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances
   in view. It is therefore the main object of the present invention to provide a
   negative pressure storage container, which comprises a container cover, a
   container body, a rotary device, a gear transmission mechanism and a vacuum
 5 pump that are so configured that when the negative pressure created in the
   container body reaches a certain level, the bottom wall of the plastic inner cover
   member of the container cover is forced to curve in direction toward the inside
   of the container body, and thus, the transmission gear set of the gear
   transmission mechanism is moved with the deformed bottom wall of the inner
10 cover member toward the inside of the container body to disengage the driving
   gear from the gear portion of the inner shaft of the rotary device; at this time, the
   rotary device     runs idle and cannot drive the gear transmission mechanism to
   rotate, preventing overloading the transmission gear set and prolonging the
   service life of the gear transmission mechanism.
15
              It is another object of the present invention to provide a negative
   pressure storage container, which is so configured that when a certain level of
   negative pressure is created in the container body, the storage food ingredients
   and eatable items in the container body can be maintained fresh.
20
              It is still another object of the present invention to provide a negative
   pressure storage container, which is so configured that the relief valve rod
   comprises an internal passageway cutting through the opposing top and bottom
   ends thereof with a bottom end thereof disposed in communication with the
25 bottom side of the relief channel of the inner cover member and a top end
   thereof fixedly mounted with a flexible end cap, thus, when a negative pressure
   is created in the container body, the flexible end cap is sucked by the negative
   pressure in the internal passageway to curve inwards, exhibiting a sign
   indicative of the presence of a negative pressure; the flexible end cap further
30 comprises a top protruding portion located at the center of the top surface
   thereof and made of a different material with a different color relative to the
   flexible end cap, enhancing the negative pressure identification indication effect.

30 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
              Referring to Figs. 1-8, a negative pressure storage container in
   accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention is shown. The
   negative pressure storage container of this first embodiment comprises a
                                              4

   container cover 1, a container body 2, a rotary device 3, a gear transmission
   mechanism 4, and a vacuum pump 5.
              The container body 2 defines therein a storage chamber with an open
 5 side 21 for storing foods, having a bottom surface thereof mounted with an
   anti-slip pad 22.
              The container cover 1 covers the container body 2, comprising an
   outer cover member 11, an inner cover member 12 and an inner plastic cushion
10 member 13. The outer cover member 11 and the inner cover member 12 are
   fastened together by first fastening members 61 (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 6), or by
   means of grooves (not shown) and tenons (not shown). The inner cover member
   12 is made of a plastic material, having a top side thereof fastened to the outer
   cover member 11 and an opposing bottom side thereof fastened to the inner
15 plastic cushion member 13 (see Fig. 3 and Figs. 10 and 11). Further, the inner
   cover member 12 has a suction hole 1211 located on a bottom wall 121 thereof
   (see Fig. 9). The inner plastic cushion member 13 has a suction through hole
   131 (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 9) corresponding to the suction hole 1211. After
   covered the container cover 1 on the container body 2, the suction hole 1211 is
20 kept in communication with the inside space of the container body 2.
              The rotary device 3 in this first embodiment is a rotary knob rotatably
   connected to the outer cover member 11 of the container cover 1, having an
   inner shaft 30 fixedly fastened to a bottom end thereof by second fastening
25 members 62 (see Fig. 6 and Fig. 7). The inner shaft 30 has a gear portion 301
   located at a distal end thereof and suspending inside the outer cover member 11.
   The gear portion 301 of the inner shaft 30 is adapted for driving the gear
   transmission mechanism 4.
30            The gear transmission mechanism 4 is mounted at the bottom wall 121
   of the inner cover member 12 of the container cover 1, comprising a
   transmission gear set 41, an eccentric wheel 42 and a link 43. The transmission
   gear set 41 comprises a driving gear 411 meshed with the gear portion 301 of
   the inner shaft 30 of the rotary device (rotary knob) 3 so that rotating the rotary
                                              5

   device (rotary knob) 3 drives the transmission gear set 41 to rotate the eccentric
   wheel 42. The eccentric wheel 42 is eccentrically and pivotally connected to one
   end of the link 43. The opposite end of the link 43 is pivotally connected to the
   reciprocating piston 51 of the vacuum pump 5.
 5
              The vacuum pump 5 is mounted at the bottom wall 121 of the inner
   cover member 12 of the container cover 1 and disposed in communication with
   the suction hole 1211 of the inner cover member 12 (see Fig. 9). The
   reciprocating piston 51 of the vacuum pump 5 is driven by the gear transmission
10 mechanism 4 to reciprocate, drawing air out of the container body 2. Further, a
   balance spring 50 is mounted between the reciprocating piston 51 and the
   vacuum pump 5 (see Fig. 9) to balance the reciprocating motion of the
   reciprocating piston 51. In the suction action during the reciprocating motion,
   the load is heavy. On the contrary, in the return action during the reciprocating
15 motion, the load is light. Subject to the arrangement of the balance spring 50,
   the user's hand can feel smooth when rotating the rotary device (rotary knob) 3.
              As illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. 8, when a user rotates the rotary
   device (rotary knob) 3, the gear portion 301 of the inner shaft 30 is forced to
20 drive the driving gear 411, thereby rotating the transmission gear set 41 of the
   gear transmission mechanism 4 (see Fig. 6 and Fig. 8). During rotation of the
   transmission gear set 41, the eccentric wheel 42 is driven to move the link 43,
   causing reciprocation of the reciprocating piston 51 to draw air out of the
   container body 2, and thus, a negative pressure is created in the container body 2.
25 When the negative pressure in the container body 2 reaches a certain level, the
   bottom wall 121 of the plastic inner cover member 12 of the container cover 1 is
   forced to curve in direction toward the inside of the container body 2 (see Fig.
   7), and thus, the transmission gear set 41 of the gear transmission mechanism 4
   is moved with the deformed bottom wall 121 of the inner cover member 12
30 toward the inside of the container body 2 (see Fig. 7) to disengage the driving
   gear 411 from the gear portion 301 of the inner shaft 30 of the rotary device
   (rotary knob) 3. At this time, the rotary device (rotary knob) 3 runs idle and
   cannot drive the gear transmission mechanism 4 to rotate, preventing
   overloading the transmission gear set 41 and prolonging the service life of the
                                            6

   gear transmission mechanism 4.
              Further, the inner cover member 12 of the container cover 1 comprises
   an relief channel 122 (see Fig. 10) located on the bottom wall 121 thereof; the
 5 inner plastic cushion member 13 of the container cover 1 further comprises an
   relief hole 132 disposed in communication with the relief channel 122 (see Fig.
   1 and Fig. 10). Further, a sealing pad 71 is mounted on an relief valve rod 7 (see
   Figs. 10-12) and movable with the relief valve rod 7 upwardly to block the relief
   channel 122 of the inner cover member 12 (see Fig. 10), or downwardly away
10 from the relief channel 122 of the inner cover member 12 to open the passage
   (see Fig. 12). The relief valve rod 7 has the top end thereof inserted through a
   positioning hole 111 on the outer cover member 11. Further, an elastic member
   70 is mounted between the relief valve rod 7 and the relief channel 122 of the
   inner cover member 12 to support the relief valve rod 7, holding the relief valve
15 rod 7 in the position where the sealing pad 71 blocks the relief channel 122 of
   the inner cover member 2 when a negative pressure is created in the container
   body 2 (see Fig. 11). Further, the relief valve rod 7 comprises an external
   passageway 72. When the relief valve rod 7 is pressed down by an external
   force (see Fig. 12), the external passageway 72 reliefs gas through the gap
20 between the sealing pad 71 and the relief channel 122 of the inner cover
   member 12. When the external force is released from the relief valve rod 7, the
   elastic member 70 immediately pushes the relief valve rod 7 upward (see Fig.
   10), forcing the sealing pad 71 to block the relief channel 122. The relief valve
   rod 7 further comprises an internal passageway 73 cutting through the opposing
25 top and bottom ends thereof (see Figs. 10-12). The bottom end of the internal
   passageway 73 is disposed in communication with the bottom side of the relief
   channel 122 of the inner cover member 12. Further, a flexible end cap 74 is
   fixedly mounted on the top end of the relief valve rod 7 (see Figs. 10-12). When
   a negative pressure is created in the container body 2, the flexible end cap 74 is
30 sucked by the negative pressure in the internal passageway 73 to curve inwards
   (see Fig. 11), exhibiting a sign indicative of the presence of a negative pressure.
   The flexible end cap 74 further comprises a top protruding portion 741 located
   at the center of the top surface thereof. The top protruding portion 741 can be
   made of a different material with a different color relative to the flexible end cap
                                              7

   74, enhancing the negative pressure identification indication effect.
               Further, as illustrated in Fig. 13, the suction hole 1211 and relief
   channel 122 on the bottom wall 121 of the inner cover member 12 of the
 5 container cover 1 are respectively mounted with respective dustproof covers
   81,82 and respective dustproof nets 83,84, preventing powder ingredients in the
   container body 2 from affecting the airtight effect or product service life. Further,
   the dustproof covers 81,82 and the dustproof nets 83,84 are detachable,
   facilitating washing or replacement. Further, in order to facilitate the mounting
10 and dismounting of the dustproof covers 81,82 and dustproof nets 83,84, the
   inner plastic cushion member 13 is configured to provide an opening 133.
               Further, in this embodiment, the gear portion 301 of the inner shaft 30
   at the rotary device (rotary knob) 3 is meshed with the driving gear 411 of the
15 transmission gear       set 41   of the gear transmission mechanism 4. The
   transmission gear set 41 further comprises a large gear 412 coaxially mounted at
   a bottom side of the driving gear 411, a first small gear 413 meshed with the
   large gear 412, an intermediate gear 414 coaxially connected to the first small
   gear 413, and a second small gear 415 meshed with the intermediate gear 414.
20 The aforesaid eccentric wheel 42 is coaxially connected to the second small gear
   415 and pivotally coupled to the one end of the link 43 in an eccentric manner.
   The other end of the link 43 is pivotally coupled to the reciprocating piston 51.
   Thus, when the rotary device (rotary knob) 3 is being rotated, the gear portion
   301 of the inner shaft 30 is driven to rotate the driving gear 411 and the large
25 gear 412, causing the large gear 412 to rotate the first small gear 413 and the
   intermediate gear 414, and the second small gear 415 is then driven by the
   intermediate gear 414 to rotate the eccentric wheel 42, driving the link 43 to
   reciprocate the reciprocating piston 51.
30             Referring to Figs. 14-18, a negative pressure storage container in
   accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this
   second embodiment, a motor module is used to substitute for the rotary device 3
   in the aforesaid first embodiment. The other technical features of this second
   embodiment are substantially same as the aforesaid first embodiment. The
                                              8

   negative pressure storage container of this second embodiment comprises a
   container cover 1, a container body 2, a rotary device 3, a gear transmission
   mechanism 4, and a vacuum pump 5.
 5            The container body 2 defines therein a storage chamber with an open
   side 21 for storing foods, having a bottom surface thereof mounted with an
   anti-slip pad 22.
              The container cover 1 covers the container body 2 (see Figs. 15-17),
10 comprising an outer cover member 11, an inner cover member 12 and an inner
   plastic cushion member 13. The outer cover member 11 and the inner cover
   member 12 are fastened together. The inner cover member 12 is made of a
   plastic material, having a top side thereof fastened to the outer cover member 11
   and an opposing bottom side thereof fastened to the inner plastic cushion
15 member 13. Further, the inner cover member 12 has a suction hole 1211 located
   on a bottom wall 121 thereof (see Fig. 17). The inner plastic cushion member 13
   has a suction through hole 131 (see Fig. 17) corresponding to the suction hole
   1211. After covered the container cover 1 on the container body 2, the suction
   hole 1211 is kept in communication with the inside space of the container body
20 2.
              The rotary device 3 in this second embodiment is a motor module,
   having an inner shaft 30 coupled thereto. The inner shaft 30 has a gear portion
   301 located at a distal end thereof and suspending inside the outer cover
25 member 11. The gear portion 301 of the inner shaft 30 is adapted for driving the
   gear transmission mechanism 4. As illustrated in Fig. 18, the rotary device
   (motor module) 3 is electrically coupled to a power supply module 32 (for
   example, battery set). The power supply module 32 is electrically coupled to a
   switch control module 33 that controls on/off of the rotary device (motor
30 module) 3.
              The gear transmission mechanism 4 is mounted at the bottom wall 121
   of the inner cover member 12 of the container cover 1, comprising a
   transmission gear set 41, an eccentric wheel 42 and a link 43. The transmission
                                             9

   gear set 41 comprises a driving gear 411 meshed with the gear portion 301 of
   the inner shaft 30 of the rotary device (motor module) 3 so that rotating the
   rotary device (motor module) 3 drives the transmission gear set 41 to rotate the
   eccentric wheel 42. The eccentric wheel 42 is eccentrically and pivotally
 5 connected to one end of the link 43. The opposite end of the link 43 is pivotally
   connected to the reciprocating piston 51 of the vacuum pump 5.
              The vacuum pump 5 is mounted at the bottom wall 121 of the inner
   cover member 12 of the container cover 1 and disposed in communication with
10 the suction hole 1211 of the inner cover member 12 (see Fig. 17). The
   reciprocating piston 51 of the vacuum pump 5 is driven by the gear transmission
   mechanism 4 to reciprocate, drawing air out of the container body 2. Further, a
   balance spring 50 is mounted between the reciprocating piston 51 and the
   vacuum pump 5 (see Fig. 17) to balance the reciprocating motion of the
15 reciprocating piston 51. In the suction action during the reciprocating motion,
   the load is heavy. On the contrary, in the return action during the reciprocating
   motion, the load is light. Subject to the arrangement of the balance spring 50,
   the user's hand can feel smooth when rotating the rotary device (rotary knob) 3.
20            When the rotary device (motor module) 3 is started up, the gear
   portion 301 of the inner shaft 30 is forced to drive the driving gear 411, thereby
   rotating the transmission gear set 41 of the gear transmission mechanism 4.
   During rotation of the transmission gear set 41, the eccentric wheel 42 is driven
   to move the link 43, causing reciprocation of the reciprocating piston 51 to draw
25 air out of the container body 2, and thus, a negative pressure is created in the
   container body 2. When the negative pressure in the container body 2 reaches a
   certain level, the bottom wall 121 of the plastic inner cover member 12 of the
   container cover 1 is forced to curve in direction toward the inside of the
   container body 2, and thus, the transmission gear set 41 of the gear transmission
30 mechanism 4 is moved with the deformed bottom wall 121 of the inner cover
   member 12 toward the inside of the container body 2 to disengage the driving
   gear 411 from the gear portion 301 of the inner shaft 30 of the rotary device
   (motor module) 3. At this time, the rotary device (motor module) 3 runs idle and
   cannot drive the gear transmission mechanism 4 to rotate, preventing
                                            10

   overloading the transmission gear set 41 and prolonging the service life of the
   gear transmission mechanism 4.
              Further, as illustrated in Fig. 16, the inner cover member 12 of the
 5 container cover 1 comprises an relief channel 122 located on the bottom wall
   121 thereof; the inner plastic cushion member 13 of the container cover 1
   further comprises an relief hole 132 disposed in communication with the relief
   channel 122. Further, a sealing pad 71 is mounted on an relief valve rod 7 and
   movable with the relief valve rod 7 upwardly to block the relief channel 122 of
10 the inner cover member 12, or downwardly away from the relief channel 122 of
   the inner cover member 12 to open the passage. The relief valve rod 7 has the
   top end thereof inserted through a positioning hole 111 on the outer cover
   member 11. Further, an elastic member 70 is mounted between the relief valve
   rod 7 and the relief channel 122 of the inner cover member 12 to support the
15 relief valve rod 7, holding the relief valve rod 7 in the position where the sealing
   pad 71 blocks the relief channel 122 of the inner cover member 2 when a
   negative pressure is created in the container body 2. Further, the relief valve rod
   7 comprises an external passageway 72. When the relief valve rod 7 is pressed
   down by an external force, gas is reliefed from the external passageway 72
20 through the gap between the sealing pad 71 and the relief channel 122 of the
   inner cover member 12. When the external force is released from the relief valve
   rod 7, the elastic member 70 immediately pushes the relief valve rod 7 upward,
   forcing the sealing pad 71 to block the relief channel 122. The relief valve rod 7
   further comprises an internal passageway 73 cutting through the opposing top
25 and bottom ends thereof. The bottom end of the internal passageway 73 is
   disposed in communication with the bottom side of the relief channel 122 of the
   inner cover member 12. Further, a flexible end cap 74 is fixedly mounted on the
   top end of the relief valve rod 7. When a negative pressure is created in the
   container body 2, the flexible end cap 74 is sucked by the negative pressure in
30 the internal passageway 73 to curve inwards, exhibiting a sign indicative of the
   presence of a negative pressure. The flexible end cap 74 further comprises a top
   protruding portion 741 located at the center of the top surface thereof. The top
   protruding portion 741 can be made of a different material with a different color
   relative to the flexible end cap 74, enhancing the negative pressure identification
                                              11

   indication effect.
               In conclusion, the invention has the features and effects as follows:
 5             1. When the negative pressure created in the container body 2 reaches
   a certain level, the bottom wall 121 of the plastic inner cover member 12 of the
   container cover 1 is forced to curve in direction toward the inside of the
   container body 2 (see Fig. 7), and thus, the transmission gear set 41 of the gear
   transmission mechanism 4 is moved with the deformed bottom wall 121 of the
10 inner cover member 12 toward the inside of the container body 2 (see Fig. 7) to
   disengage the driving gear 411 from the gear portion 301 of the inner shaft 30 of
   the rotary device (rotary knob) 3; at this time, the rotary device (rotary knob) 3
   runs idle and cannot drive the gear transmission mechanism 4 to rotate,
   preventing overloading the transmission gear set 41 and prolonging the service
15 life of the gear transmission mechanism 4.
               2. When a certain level of negative pressure is created in the container
   body 2, the storage food ingredients and eatable items in the container body 2
   can be maintained fresh.
20
               3. The relief valve rod 7 comprises an internal passageway 73 cutting
   through the opposing top and bottom ends thereof with a bottom end thereof
   disposed in communication with the bottom side of the relief channel 122 of the
   inner cover member 12 and a top end thereof fixedly mounted with a flexible
25 end cap 74, thus, when a negative pressure is created in the container body 2,
   the flexible end cap 74 is sucked by the negative pressure in the internal
   passageway 73 to curve inwards, exhibiting a sign indicative of the presence of
   a negative pressure; the flexible end cap 74 further comprises a top protruding
   portion 741 located at the center of the top surface thereof and made of a
30 different material with a different color relative to the flexible end cap 74,
   enhancing the negative pressure identification indication effect.
