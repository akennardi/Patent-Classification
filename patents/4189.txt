                                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0024]                      Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be
understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and
the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the
following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or
of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and
terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as
limiting.
[0025]                      FIGS. 1-2 illustrate a garage door system 50 including a garage door opener
100 operatively coupled to a garage door 104. The garage door opener 100 includes a
housing 108 supporting a motor that is operatively coupled to a drive mechanism 116. The
drive mechanism 116 includes a transmission coupling the motor to a drive chain 120 having
a shuttle 124 configured to be displaced along a rail assembly 128 upon actuation of the
motor. The shuttle 124 may be selectively coupled to a trolley 132 that is slidable along the
rail assembly 128 and coupled to the garage door 104 via an arm member.
[0026]                      The trolley 132 is releaseably coupled to the shuttle 124 such that the garage
door system 50 is operable in a powered mode and a manual mode. In the powered mode, the
trolley 132 is coupled to the shuttle 124 and the motor is selectively driven in response to
actuation by a user (e.g., via a key pad or wireless remote in communication with the garage
door opener 100). As the motor is driven, the drive chain 120 is driven by the motor along
9751010_1 (GHMatters) P107448.AU

                                                           -4
the rail assembly 128 to displace the shuttle 124 (and, therefore, the trolley 132), thereby
opening or closing the garage door 104. In the manual mode, the trolley 132 is decoupled
from the shuttle 124 such that a user may manually operate the garage door 104 to open or
close without resistance from the motor. The trolley 132 may be decoupled, for example,
when a user applies a force to a release cord 136 to disengage the trolley 132 from the shuttle
124. In some embodiments, other drive systems are included such that, for example, the drive
mechanism 116 includes a transmission coupling the motor to a drive belt that is operatively
coupled to the garage door 104 via a rail and carriage assembly.
[00271                      The housing 108 is coupled to the rail assembly 128 and a surface above the
garage door (e.g., a garage ceiling or support beam) by, for example, a support bracket 148.
The garage door opener further includes a light unit 152 including a light (e.g., one or more
light emitting diodes (LEDs)) enclosed by a transparent cover or lens 156), which provides
light to the garage. The light unit 152 may either be selectively actuated by a user or
automatically powered upon actuation of the garage door opener 100. In one example, the
light unit 152 may be configured to remain powered for a predetermined amount of time after
actuation of the garage door opener 100.
[0028]                      The garage door opener 100 further includes an antenna 158 enabling the
garage door opener 100 to communicate wirelessly with other devices, such as a smart phone
or network device (e.g., a router, hub, or modem), as described in further detail below. The
garage door opener 100 is also configured to receive, control, and/or monitor a variety of
accessory devices or modules, such as a backup battery unit 190, a speaker 192, a fan 194, an
extension cord reel 196, among others.
[0029]                      FIG. 3 illustrates a block power diagram of the garage door opener 100. The
garage door opener 100 includes a terminal block 202 configured to receive power from an
external power source 204, such as a standard 120 VAC power outlet. The terminal block
202 directs power, via a transformer 208, to a garage door opener (GDO) board 210 for
supply to components thereof as well as a motor 212 (used to drive the drive mechanism 116,
as described above), LEDs 214 (of the light unit 152), and garage door sensors 216. The
terminal block 202 further directs power via the transformer 208 to a wireless board 220 and
components thereof, as well as a wired keypad 222 and module ports 223. The terminal block
9751010_1 (GHMatters) P107448.AU

                                                          -5
202 also directs power to a battery charger 224 and AC ports 228. The module ports 223 are
configured to receive various accessory devices, such as a speaker, a fan, an extension cord
reel, a parking assist laser, an environmental sensor, a flashlight, and a security camera. One
or more of the accessory devices are selectively attachable to and removable from the garage
door opener 100, and may be monitored and controlled by the garage door opener 100.
[0030]                      The wireless board 220 includes a wireless microcontroller 240, among other
components. The GDO board 210 includes, among other components, a garage door opener
(GDO) microcontroller 244 and a radio frequency (RF) transceiver 246.
[0031]                      FIG. 4 illustrates a block communication diagram of the garage door opener
100. The wireless microcontroller 240 is coupled to the antenna 158 and enables wireless
communication with a server 250 via a network device 252 and network 254, as well as with a
smart phone 256 (and other similar external devices, such as tablets and laptops). The
network device 252 may be, for example, one or more of a router, hub, or modem. The
network 254 may be, for example, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), another wide area
network (WAN) or a combination thereof. The wireless microcontroller 240 may include, for
example, a Wi-Fi radio including hardware, software, or a combination thereof enabling
wireless communications according to the Wi-Fi protocol. In other embodiments, the
wireless microcontroller 240 is configured to communicate with the server 250 via the
network device 252 and network 254 using other wireless communication protocols. The
network 254 may include various wired and wireless connections to communicatively couple
the garage door opener 100 to the server 250. As illustrated, the wireless microcontroller 240
also includes wired communication capabilities for communicating with the GDO
microcontroller 244 via the multiplexor 260. In some embodiments, the wireless
microcontroller 240 and the GDO microcontroller 244 are directly coupled for
communication. In some embodiments, the wireless microcontroller 240 and the GDO
microcontroller 244 are combined into a single controller.
[0032]                      The RF transceiver 246 is wirelessly coupled to various user actuation devices,
including one or more wireless remotes 262 and wireless keypads 264, to receive and provide
to the GDO microcontroller 244 user actuation commands (e.g., to open and close the garage
door 104). The smart phone 256 may also receive user input and, in response, provide

(directly or via the network 254) to the wireless microcontroller 240 user actuation commands
for the garage door opener 100 or commands to control one or more of the accessory devices.
The multiplexor 260 enables communication between and among the wireless microcontroller
240, the GDO microcontroller 244, and the accessory microcontrollers 266 (of the accessory
devices previously noted).
[0033]                      With reference to FIG. 5, the housing 108 includes accessory ports 162 that
receive and support accessory devices, as noted above, which are modular, interchangeable
accessory devices and are generically referred to as the accessory devices 200 (see, e.g., FIG.
2) In the illustrated embodiment, the housing 108 has eight accessory ports 162 with two ports
162 disposed on each side of the housing 108. However, this configuration is merely
exemplary - that is, the housing 108 may include more than eight ports 162 or less than eight
ports 162, and each side of the housing 108 may include more or less than two ports 162.
Additionally, the housing 108 may include more or less than four sides with each having one
or more ports 162, and other surfaces of the housing (e.g., the top and bottom) may include
one or more ports 162.
[0034]                      With continued reference to FIG. 5, each port 162 includes a communication
interface 166 and a coupling interface 170. The communication interface 166 includes an
electrical connector 174 disposed within a recess 178. The electrical connector 174 is
configured to facilitate electrical communication and data communication between the
accessory device 200 and the garage door opener 100. The electrical connector 174 may be
any type of powered input/output port. Additionally, in further embodiments the electrical
connector 174 may define separate power connectors and data connectors, which may
similarly be any type of power connectors and data connectors. In the illustrated
embodiment, two slots 182 are formed on either side of the electrical connector 174 and
receive a portion of an accessory device 200 to align and mechanically couple the accessory
device 200 with housing 108. The coupling interface 170 is defined by a pair of spaced apart,
raised surfaces 186 defined on either side of the communication interface 166. Each raised
surface 186 includes a chamfered edge and has an aperture 190 defined there through.
However, the raised surfaces 186 may be omitted in other embodiments. The apertures 190
are configured to receive portions of the accessory devices 200 to facilitate mechanical
coupling of the accessory device 200 to the garage door opener 100.
9751010_1 (GHMatters) P107448.AU

                                                           -7
[00351                      FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate an example of one of the accessory devices 200 - an
accessory speaker 212 - that is configured to be detachably coupled to the garage door opener
100. In the illustrated embodiment, the speaker 212 is a wireless speaker 212 (e.g., a
Bluetooth@ speaker) that may be wirelessly coupled to a peripheral device, such as the smart
phone 256 or a tablet. In one embodiment, the speaker 212 receives an audio stream from the
peripheral device communicating with the garage door opener 100, and subsequently drives a
speaker 212 to output the audio stream using power from the garage door opener 100 via an
electrical mounting interface 400. In another embodiment, the wireless speaker 212 receives
an audio stream wirelessly directly from the peripheral device via an integral transceiver, and
drives a speaker 212 to output the audio stream using power from the garage door opener 100
via the electrical mounting interface 400.
[0036]                      With reference to FIG. 7, the speaker 212 includes a mechanical mounting
interface 300 configured to be coupled to the coupling interface 170 of the housing 108, and
the electrical mounting interface 400 configured to be coupled to the communication interface
166 of the housing 108. The mechanical mounting interface 300 includes a pair of hooks 304
that are received within the apertures 190 of the coupling interface 170, a pair of projections
308 disposed on opposing sides of the electrical mounting interface 400, and at least one
protruding latch member 312 configured to engage a corresponding retention member on the
housing 108. The projections 308 are configured to be received within the slots 182 to assist
with alignment of the electrical mounting interface 400 and the communication interface 166.
When coupled, the speaker 212 receives power from the garage door opener 100 via a
connection defined by the electrical mounting interface 400 and the communication interface
166. The speaker 212 also sends data to and receives data from the garage door opener 100
via a connection defined by the electrical mounting interface 400 and the communication
interface 166.
[00371                      The speaker 212 further includes a controller (e.g., microcontroller 266) in
communication with the wireless microcontroller 240 of the garage door opener 100. The
controller includes a memory storing an initial data set including a unique identifier, a
predetermined initial status field, and a predetermined initial settings field that is
communicated to the garage door opener 100 each time the speaker 212 is coupled to the port
162. Thereafter, the controller is configured to send and receive data from, for example, the
9751010_1 (GHMatters) P107448.AU

                                                           -8
server 250 via the wireless microcontroller 240. More specifically, the controller receives
updates to the settings field of the data set based on data received from the wireless
microcontroller 240. The controller also updates the status field of the data set, which is sent
to the wireless microcontroller 240 for communication to the peripheral device via the server
250.
[00381                      In one embodiment, the status field includes, for example, on/off state of the
speaker, the pairing status (e.g., Bluetooth@ pairing status), and speaker volume, among
others. The settings field includes an on/off toggle, a pairing toggle (e.g., to turn pairing
on/off), and a volume value, among others. In this example, the user may set the values for
the settings field (e.g., via the smart phone 256 or other peripheral device), which updates the
speaker 212 to turn on/off, turn pairing on/off, or alter the volume of the speaker. For
example, the smart phone 256 may communicate updated settings for the settings field on the
server 250. In turn, for example, the server 250 sends the updated settings to the speaker 212
via the network 254, network device 252, and wireless microcontroller 240.
[0039]                      Each of the accessory devices 200 may be interchangeably coupled to the ports
162 of the housing 108 due to the common mechanical mounting interfaces 300 and electrical
mounting interfaces 400. In other words, each accessory device 200 may be coupled to any
port 162 on the housing 108. This modular design allows a user to couple desired accessory
devices 200 to the garage door opener 100 in a preferred location, while removing accessory
devices 200 that the user does not require. This modular design allows the user to customize
the garage door opener 100 to fit their specific needs.
[0040]                      FIGS. 8-16 illustrate an adapter 500 that includes a housing 508 defined by a
main body 525, a battery receiving portion 530, and an accessory receiving portion 535. As
will be described in greater detail below, the adapter 500 is configured to selectively receive a
battery pack 505 (see FIGS. 16-17), such as a power tool battery pack, and one or more of the
accessory devices 200. The adapter 500 couples the battery pack 505 to the accessory device
200 such that the battery pack 505 can power the accessory device 200.
[0041]                      With reference to FIGS. 8 and 11, the accessory receiving portion 535 is
defined by a planar support surface 538 and a lower groove 542 that at least partially supports
the accessory device 200. The accessory receiving portion 535 includes at least one accessory
9751010_1 (GHMatters) P107448.AU

                                                          -9
port 562 that receives and supports modular, interchangeable accessory devices 200. The
accessory port 562 is similar to the ports 162 disposed on the housing 108 of the garage door
opener 100 and may be configured to receive each of the accessory devices 200 described
above. In the illustrated embodiment, the main body 525 includes a single accessory port
562. However, this configuration is merely exemplary - that is, the housing 508 may include
more than one port 562 such that the adapter 500 may be coupled to a plurality of accessory
devices 200.
[0042]                      With continued reference to FIGS. 8 and 11, the accessory port 562 includes a
communication interface 566 and a coupling interface 570. The communication interface 566
includes an electrical connector 574 disposed within a recess 578 on the planar support
surface 538. The electrical connector 574 is configured to facilitate electrical communication
and data communication between the accessory device 200 and the adapter (e.g., to couple the
accessory device 200 to the battery pack). The electrical connector 574 may be any type of
powered input/output port. Additionally, in further embodiments the electrical connector 574
may define separate power connectors and data connectors, which may similarly be any type
of power connectors and data connectors. In the illustrated embodiment, two slots 582 are
formed on either side of the electrical connector 574 and receive a portion of an accessory
device 200 to align and mechanically couple the accessory device 200 with housing 508.
[0043]                      The coupling interface 570 is defined by a pair of spaced apart apertures 590
disposed on an upper end of the support surface and a catch 594 defined in the groove. Each
of the apertures 590 is configured to receive portions of the accessory devices 200 to facilitate
mechanical coupling of the accessory device 200 to the adapter 500. The catch 594 is
configured to receive, for example, the latch member 312 of the accessory device 200 to
secure and maintain engagement of the accessory device 200 to the adapter 500. In addition,
the groove 542 defines lower surfaces for supporting the accessory device 200.
[0044]                       With reference to FIGS. 12 and 13, the planar support surface 538 defines an
axis angled relative to a vertical axis and horizontal axis such that the accessory device rests
on the support surface when attached to the adapter 500. The groove 542 has at least one
surface 544 that defines an axis angled relative to the axis of the planar support surface 538
and the vertical axis.

[00451                      With reference to FIGS. 9 and 15, the battery receiving portion 530 is defined
by a recess 546 that is sized and shaped to receive the battery pack 505. The battery receiving
portion 530 includes adapter electrical contacts that are configured to mechanically and
electrically engage battery contacts (e.g., contacts 1390 of FIG. 17) to communicate electrical
power and/or data signals therebetween. In addition, the battery receiving portion 530
includes two slots 548 disposed on opposed sides of the recess 546 that are configured to
receive battery pack latch members 1370 (see FIG. 17) to secure and maintain engagement of
the battery pack 505 to the adapter 500. In the illustrated embodiment, the battery receiving
portion 530 is configured to receive a battery pack 505 that is inserted along a vertical
insertion axis. However, in other embodiments, the battery receiving portion 530 may be
configured to receive the battery pack 505 configured as a 'slide on' battery pack that is
inserted along a horizontal insertion axis.
[0046]                      FIG. 16 is a block diagram illustrating the adapter 500 and connected
components, including a battery pack 505, the accessory device 200, the network 554, a
server 550, and a peripheral device 556. The adapter 500 includes a display 506, a memory
509, and user input 510. The user input 510 has at least one actuator (e.g., button, switch,
lever, touchscreen, etc.) that is configured to control operation of the adapter 500. In the
illustrated embodiment, the user input 510 includes two actuators that are each configured to
operate a switch, a first switch 512 and a second switch 513, respectively. For example, the
first switch 512 is disposed between the battery pack 505 and an electronic processor 514 of
the adapter as well as the accessory device 200 such that the first switch 512 controls the
on/off state of the adapter 500 (i.e., whether power is supplied from the battery pack 505 to
the adapter 500). When the first switch 512 is closed, the battery pack 505 supplies power to
the processor 514 to turn the adapter 500 to an on or active state. The second switch 513 is
disposed between the battery pack 505 and the accessory device 200 such that the second
switch 513 controls the on/off state of the accessory device 200 (i.e., whether power supplied
to the adapter 500 from the battery pack 505 is passed to the accessory device 200). When the
second switch 513 is closed, the battery pack 505 supplies power (received via the first switch
512 when the first switch 512 is closed) to the accessory device 200. In other words, the
adapter 500 provides power to the accessory device 200 when both the first switch 512 and
the second switch 513 are closed.

[00471                      In one embodiment, the first switch 512 is closed when the battery pack 505 is
fully and properly attached to the adapter 500. That is, the first switch 512 is operated to
close by a mechanism in the coupling of the battery pack 505 to the receiving portion 530.
For example, the engagement of a latch (see latch 1370, FIG. 17) of the battery pack 505 may
close the first switch 512. In other embodiments, the first switch 512 is configured to be
selectively actuated by the user (e.g., by a button, switch, lever, touchscreen, etc. disposed on
the housing 508). In either case, the actuator may physically open or close the first switch
512 upon actuation (i.e., make or break a conductive connection), or the actuator may
communicate a control signal to the processor 514 of the adapter 500 upon actuation, which
causes the processor 514 to control the first switch 512 to open or close.
[0048]                      The second switch 513 is configured to be selectively actuated by the user
(e.g., by a button, switch, lever, touchscreen, etc. disposed on the housing 508). The actuator
for the second switch 513 may physically open or close the second switch 513 upon actuation,
or the actuator may communicate a control signal to the processor 514 of the adapter 500
upon actuation, which causes the processor 514 to control the second switch 513 to open or
close.
[0049]                      In the illustrated embodiment, the adapter 500 further includes a wireless
microcontroller 540 that is similar to the wireless microcontroller 240, described above with
respect to the garage door opener 100, to enable wireless communication. For example, the
adapter 500 is configured to wirelessly communicate via the network 554 with a server 550
and a peripheral device 556 (e.g., a smart phone, tablet, laptop, or the like). The network 554
may be, for example, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), another wide area network
(WAN) or a combination thereof, and may include one or more network devices similar to the
network device 252. The network 554 may also include various wired and wireless
connections to communicatively couple the adapter 500 to the server 550 and peripheral
device 556. The wireless microcontroller 540 may include, for example, a Wi-Fi radio
including hardware, software, or a combination thereof enabling wireless communications
according to the Wi-Fi protocol. In other embodiments, the wireless microcontroller 540 is
configured to communicate with the server 550 via the network 554 using other wireless
communication protocols. Regardless of the protocol, the wireless microcontroller 540
includes a wireless transceiver to enable wireless communications. The wireless

                                                         - 12
microcontroller 540 and processor 514 may be collectively referred to as an electronic
controller or processor of the adapter 500. The electronic controller may execute software,
which may be stored in the memory 509 or a memory of the wireless microcontroller 540, to
carry out the functionality of the adapter 500 described herein.
[0050]                      Although separately labeled and described, the server 550 may be the same
server (in whole or part) as the server 250, the network 554 may be the same network (in
whole or part) as the network 254, and the peripheral device 556 may be the same peripheral
device (in whole or part) as the smart phone 256.
[0051]                      Similar to the communications described above between the peripheral device
(e.g., the smart phone 256) and the accessory device 200 when the accessory device 200 is
coupled with the garage door opener 100, communication may occur between the accessory
device 200 and the peripheral device 556 via the adapter 500. Such communications may
include the communication of a data set including at least identifier (ID) data, settings data,
and status data, from each of the different accessory devices 200 coupled to the adapter 500 to
the peripheral device 556 via the wireless microcontroller 540. In one communication
method, the adapter 500 acts as an intermediary communication device or pass through device
- that is, the wireless microcontroller 540 determines the accessory 200 is received in the port
and understands data sets that it sends and receives is divided into categories (e.g., unique
identifier, status, settings), but does not actually process or 'understand' the data contained
within the data set. Rather, it simply routes the data set associated with each connected port
to the peripheral device 556 via the server 550. This, for example, allows the adapter 500 to
receive one of multiple different accessories in a single port, and allows each accessory device
200 to be moved from a first port to another port (when the adapter 500 includes multiple
ports).
[0052]                      For example, the server 550 may maintain data sets for each accessory device.
The adapter 500 receives data from the accessory device 200 and communicates the data to
the server 550 to update the data set. In turn, the server 550 communicates (e.g., based on a
push or pull operation) the updated data set to the peripheral device 556 via the network 554.
Likewise, the peripheral device 556 may generate (e.g., based on user input) data that is
transmitted, via the network 554, to the server 550 to update the data set associated with the
9751010_1 (GHMatters) P107448.AU

                                                           - 13
accessory device 200. The server 550, in turn, communicates (e.g., based on a push or pull
operation) the updated data set to the accessory device 200 via the network 554 and the
wireless microcontroller 540. In some embodiments, the adapter 500 directly communicates
information between the accessory device 200 and the peripheral device 556 via the network
554, rather than via the server 550.
[0053]                      The communications between the peripheral device 556 and the accessory
device 200 enable the peripheral device 556 to determine the identity of the accessory device
200 (based on obtained ID data), to determine the status and settings of the accessory device
200 (based on received status data and settings data), and to control the accessory device 200
(e.g., to turn on/off the device and to vary settings and thresholds of the device based on
sending settings data).
[0054]                      In other embodiments, however, the adapter 500 is not configured to
communicate with the peripheral device 556. For example, the wireless microcontroller 540
may not be included in some embodiments. In such embodiments, either the accessory device
200 or the adapter 500 includes user input devices to control the operating state of the
accessory device 200. The adapter 500 may further obtain status information from the
accessory device 200 coupled thereto and provide the status information to a user via the
display 506.
[0055]                      FIG. 16 also illustrates one exemplary block diagram of one of the accessory
devices 200 in further detail. The accessory device 200 may be a speaker (e.g., the speaker
212), a fan, an extension cord reel, an environmental sensor, a flashlight, or a security camera,
among others. As illustrated, the accessory device 200 includes a controller 1200 (e.g., the
microcontroller 266 of FIG. 2) having a memory 1205 and an electronic processor 1210, one
or more sensors 1215 (e.g., temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and carbon monoxide
sensors, etc.) and one or more loads 1220 (e.g., indicators, speakers, cameras, lights, motors,
etc.) coupled by a bus 1225. The controller 1200 is coupled to the adapter 500 via the
electrical mounting interface 400 to enable data communications between the controller 1200
and the adapter 500 and to provide power to the accessory 200. The electronic processor
1210 executes software, which may be stored in memory 1205, to carry out the functions of
the accessory device 200 described herein (e.g., to receive and store data from the sensor(s)
9751010_1 (GHMatters) P107448.AU

                                                         - 14
1215, to control the load(s) 1220, to communicate data to and receive data from the adapter
500). The particular sensors 1215, loads 1220, and functionality of the controller 1200 varies
depends on the type of accessory 200. The accessory device 200 may receive settings data
from the peripheral device 556 via the adapter 500, as described above. In response, the
controller 1200 may store the settings data (e.g., in the memory 1205) and control the load(s)
1120, sensor(s) 1215, or both, in accordance with the settings data. For example, when the
accessory device 200 is a fan, in response to received settings data from the peripheral device
556, the electronic processor 1210 may control a fan motor (an example of the load 1220) to
turn on, off, or adjust speed based on the received settings data.
[0056]                      The accessory device 200 is configured to interface with the adapter 500 in the
same way that the accessory device 200 interfaces with the garage door opener 100. The
mechanical mounting interface 300 of the accessory device 200 (see FIGS. 6-7) is configured
to be coupled to the coupling interface 570 of the housing 508, and the electrical mounting
interface 400 of the accessory device 200 (see FIGS. 6-7) is configured to be coupled to the
communication interface 566 of the housing 508. In particular, the hooks 304 of the
mechanical mounting interface 300 are received within the apertures 590 of the coupling
interface 570, the pair of projections 308 are received within the slots 582, the latch member
312 engages the catch 594, and the electrical mounting interface 400 electromechanically
engages the communication interface 566. The projections 308 and the slots 582 assist with
alignment of the electrical mounting interface 400 and the communication interface 566.
When coupled, the accessory device 200 receives power from the adapter 500 via a
connection defined by the electrical mounting interface 400 and the communication interface
166. The accessory device 200 also sends data to and receives data from the adapter 500 via a
connection defined by the electrical mounting interface 400 and the communication interface
566. The accessory/adapter interface 600 illustrated in FIG. 16 includes the mechanical
mounting interface 300, the electrical mounting interface 400, the coupling interface 570, and
the communication interface 566.
[0057]               FIG. 16 also illustrates one exemplary block diagram of the peripheral device 556
in further detail. As illustrated, the peripheral device 556 includes a communications
interface 1150, a memory 1155, an electronic processor 1160, a display 1165, and user
input/output 1170 coupled by bus 1175. The communication interface 1150 is coupled (wired

and/or wirelessly) to the network 554 and enables the electronic processor 1160 (and, thereby,
the peripheral device 556) to communicate with the server 550 (and, thereby, the adapter 500
and the accessory device 200). The electronic processor 1160 executes software, which may
be stored in the memory 1155, to carry out the functionality of the peripheral device 556
described herein (e.g., send data to and from the adapter 500 to control and monitor operation
of the accessory device 200). The user input/output 1170 include one or more push buttons,
toggle switches, speakers, and vibration generators for receiving user input and providing user
output. In some embodiments, the display 1165 is a touch screen display and is part of the
user input/output 1170. The display provides visual output regarding the adapter 500 and the
accessory device 200.
[0058]               FIG. 16 also illustrates an exemplary block diagram of the server 550. As
illustrated, the server 550 includes a network communication interface 1315, a server memory
1305, and a server processor 1310 coupled by bus 1320. The network communication
interface 1315 is coupled (wired and/or wirelessly) to the network 554 and enables the server
processor 1310 (and, thereby, the server 550) to communicate with the adapter 500 (and,
thereby, the accessory device 200) and the peripheral device 556. The server memory 1305
stores the accessory information (e.g., the data set including the ID data, settings data, and
status data for each of the accessory devices 200), as well as operational data and software.
The server processor 1310 executes software, which may be stored in the memory 1305, to
carry out the functionality of the server 550 described herein. For example, the server
processor 1310 reads and writes the accessory information to the memory 1305. Although
illustrated as a single server, the server 550 may be implemented by one or more servers co
located or located separately from one another and, for instance, coupled by various
communication networks.
[0059]                      The battery pack 505 is coupled to the adapter 500 via the adapter/battery
interface 610. The adapter/battery interface 610 includes the electrical and mechanical
connections of the battery pack 505 and the adapter 500, including the battery terminals (e.g.,
contacts 1390 of FIG. 17) and adapter terminals for transmitting power and, in some instances,
data; the battery receiving portion 530 of the adapter 500 described with respect to FIGS. 9
and 15 used to secure the battery pack 505 to the adapter 500; and the portion of the battery
pack 505 received in the battery receiving portion 530 (see insertion portion 1375 of FIG. 17).

[00601                      The battery pack 505 includes battery cells 1350 and a battery controller 1355
having an electronic processor 1360 and a memory 1365. The electronic processor 1360
executes instructions stored in the memory 1365 to control the functionality of the battery
pack 505 described herein, such as to control the charge and discharge of the battery cells
1350 (e.g., via switching elements (not shown)). The battery cells 1350 may provide a
voltage output of about 18 volts, of another value in a range between 17 to 21 volts, or
another value, such as about 12 volts, about 28 volts, about 36 volts, about 48 volts, another
value or range between 12 to 48 volts, or another value. The term "about" may indicate a
range of plus or minus 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, or 1% from an associated value. The battery
cells 1350 may have various chemistry types, such as lithium ion, a nickel cadmium, etc.
[00611                      FIG. 17 illustrates an example of the battery pack 505 that may be coupled to
the adapter 500 via the adapter/battery pack interface 610. The battery pack 505 includes
latches 1370 on either side of the pack for engaging the slots 548 of the battery receiving
portion 530 on the adapter 500. The battery pack 505 further includes an insertion portion
1375 that is received by the battery receiving portion 530 of the adapter 500. The insertion
portion 1375 includes a top support portion 1380 having a stem 1385 extending vertically
from the top support portion 1380. The stem 1385 has contacts 1390 that supply power to the
adapter 500 and may communicate data between the adapter 500 and the battery pack 505.
When coupled to the adapter 500, the battery pack 505 may provide support to the adapter
500. In other words, the adapter 500 may rest on top of the battery pack 505. For example,
the battery pack 505 may engage a support surface (e.g., a table top or floor), and the adapter
500 and coupled accessory device may be positioned above the battery pack 505. The battery
pack 505 further includes a fuel gauge 1395 that indicates a state of charge of the battery
pack. The battery pack 505 may be a power tool battery pack configured to power a power
tools (e.g., drills/drivers, impact drills/drivers, hammer drills/drivers, saws, and routers)
having a battery receiving portion similar to the battery receiving portion 530.
[0062]                      As noted above, although the adapter 500 is illustrated as having one port 562,
in some embodiments, the adapter 500 includes more than one port 562 for coupling to a
plurality of the accessory devices 200. In such embodiments, the adapter 500 is operable to

devices 200, when coupled to the adapter 500, may communicate with the server 550 and
peripheral device 556 for monitoring and control as described above.
[0063]                      Thus, embodiments described herein provide, among other things, a method of
operating an accessory device system including a garage door opener, an adapter, and one or
more accessory devices whereby a first accessory device of the one or more accessory devices
may be coupled to the garage door opener, operated based on power from the garage door
opener, removed from the garage door opener, coupled to the adapter, and then operated
based on power from the adapter received via a battery pack selectively coupled to a battery
receiving portion of the adapter.

opener, an adapter, and one or more accessory devices whereby the garage door opener has a
first accessory device port configured to couple to the one or more accessory devices and the
adapter has a second accessory device port configured to couple to the one or more accessory
devices. The garage door opener is further configured to provide power to a first accessory
device of the one or more accessory devices via the first accessory device port. The adapter
further includes a battery receiving portion configured to be selectively coupled to a battery
pack and to receive power from the battery pack, and the adapter is further configured to
provide power, received from the battery pack, to the first accessory device via the second
accessory device port.
