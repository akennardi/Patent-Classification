                                                          FRAME ASSEMBLY
 [0001]                The present invention relates to frame assemblies for use in or for forming an
article of furniture such as a table, seat, lamp, hat or coat stand and the like.
 [0002]                Furniture designers seek visually striking furniture designs, for example,
incorporating frame assemblies formed by a series of legs inclined and connected together
intermediate their ends to provide the appearance of a group of intersecting legs. However
current such frame assemblies may not assemble or dissemble easily and are flimsy and
unstable without significant reinforcement which adds to their complexity, bulk and weight.

assembly for use in or for forming an article of furniture comprising at least three legs coupled
together intermediate their ends by a connector having for each leg a pin which provides a
pivotal mounting for the associated leg to permit the leg to pivot about an axis perpendicular
to the longitudinal axis of the leg, and, associated with each pin a facet or edge at an angle to
the pin and against which the leg bears, the pins and associated facets or edges being
distributed about a central axis of the connector whereby the legs can pivot into a
configuration in which the legs are mutually inclined and, as a result, of their inclination,
adjacent legs interlock so that the arrangement of inclined legs and connector forms a stable
structure.
 [0004]                According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
connector for use in the frame assembly as described above having at least three pins
distributed about a central axis of the connector, each pin providing a pivotal mounting for an
associated leg.
 [0005]                According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a frame
assembly for use in or for forming an article of furniture comprising at least three legs coupled
together intermediate their ends by a connector having for each leg means which provides a
pivotal mounting for the associated leg to permit the leg to pivot about an axis perpendicular
to the longitudinal axis of the leg, and, associated with each pivotal mounting means a facet or
edge and against which the leg bears, the pivotal mounting means and associated facets or

edges being distributed about a central axis of the connector whereby the legs can pivot into a
configuration in which the legs are mutually inclined and, as a result, of their inclination,
adjacent legs interlock so that the arrangement of inclined legs and connector forms a stable
structure.
[0006]                  According to an embodiment, the pivotal mounting means is a pin.
[0007]                  According to an embodiment, the pivotal mounting is provided by a hole located
in each leg member intermediate their ends thereof, each hole being adapted to pivotally
receive the respective pin of the connector.
[0008]                  According to an embodiment, each leg is releasably attachable to the respective
pin.
[0009]                  According to an embodiment, the pins are releasably attachable to the connector.
[0010]                  According to an embodiment, the attachment of the pins to the connector is by
screw threaded engagement.
[0011]                  According to an embodiment, the pins are formed by bolts.
[0012]                  According to an embodiment, the facet or edge and associated pin are substantially
at right angles to each other.
[0013]                  According to an embodiment, each facet or edge has an associated pin.
[0014]                  According to an embodiment, the releasable attachment of each leg to a respective
pin, when so mounted, is provided by a screw receivable in a threaded hole provided at the end
of the pin.
[0015]                  According to an embodiment, the pins are equiangularly arranged about the central
axis of the connector.
[0016]                  According to an embodiment, the interlocking of the adjacent legs is provided by
each leg member supporting one adjacent leg while being supported by another adjacent leg.

 [0017]                 According to an embodiment, one or more of the adjacent leg contacting-surfaces
of each leg are bevelled for improved contact.
[0018]                  According to an embodiment, the upper surfaces of the legs are bevelled to define
a substantially planar surface for supporting a table-top.
[0019]                  According to an embodiment, the lower surfaces of the legs are bevelled to define
a substantially planar surface for improved contact with the ground.
[0020]                  According to an embodiment, the legs are of rectilinear form.
[0021]                  According to an embodiment, the connector has a central void for receiving wiring
therethrough.
[0022]                  The present invention will now be described, by way of non-limiting example
only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

embodiments of the present invention.
[0030]                  Figures 8A and 8B show the views of Figure 6B and Figure 7B with respective
pins.
[0031]                  Embodiments of the present invention relate to frame assemblies 2, 4 for use in or
for forming an article of furniture 6, 8, such as a table, seat, lamp, hat or coat stand and the
like, having at least three legs 10, 12 which are coupled together intermediate their ends by a
connector 14, 16. The legs 10, 12 are of rectilinear form (i.e. straight) as shown in the Figures,
however bent or curved legs could also be coupled together. Further, the legs are of generally
rectangular cross-section although other cross-sections such as circular, could be adopted.
[0032]                  The generally planar connector 14, 16 has at least three pins 18, 20, each pin
extending at right angles to a respective facet or edge 24, 26. The pins 18, 20 and associated
facets or edges 24, 26 are distributed about a central axis of the connector 14, 16. Each
pin 18, 20 of the connector 14, 16 provides a pivotal mounting for the associated leg 10, 12
which permits the leg 10, 12 to pivot about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis ofthe
leg 10, 12. The legs 10, 12, when so connected, are pivotable into a stable configuration where
the legs 10, 12 are mutually inclined and where each leg 10, 12 bears against its associated
facet or edge 24, 26 or part thereof and as a result, the legs 10, 12 interlock so that the inclined
legs 10, 12 and connector 14, 16 form a stable structure.
[0033]                  In particular, the interlocking of the adjacent legs 10, 12 is provided by each
leg 10, 12 supporting one adjacent leg 10', 12' while being supported by another adjacent
leg 10", 12" with each leg 10, 12 also being supported by an associated facet or edge 24, 26
of the connector 14, 16 so that the structure is inherently stable (see Figures lB and 2B). Such
a stable structure is capable of bearing a great deal of weight, such as a heavy table top,
without collapsing.
[0034]                  In such a frame assembly 2, 4, the lower ends of the legs 10, 12 are spaced apart
from each other to form a stable base on which the frame assembly 2, 4 rests on a flat surface,

Ripx\Interwoven\NRPrtbl\DCC\PX i23728 5_i .d.x-20 122016
                                                         -5
such as the ground, while the upper ends of the legs 10, 12 are spread apart from each other to
form a firm support on which a table top 22 or seat can be located, as exemplified in
Figures IC, 2A and 2B. Advantageously, the frame assembly 2, 4 is usable in or fonning an
article of furniture in a stable arrangement with minimal leg material without the use of
adhesives or significant reinforcement.
[0035]                  Figures IA to IC show an example frame assembly 2 having five legs 10 of equal
length coupled together to support a table top 22, while Figures 2A and 2B show an example
frame assembly 4 having four legs 12 coupled together. The connector 14 used for the frame
assembly 2 of Figures IA to IC has an arrangement of five pins 18 equiangularly distributed
about the central axis where each pin 18 extends transverse from a facet or edge 24 of the
connector 14, the five facets or edges 24 thereby forming the shape of a regular pentagon.
Figures 2A and 2B show the frame assembly 4 having a connector 16 having four pins 20,
each pin 20 extending transverse from a respective facet or edge 26, the facets or edges 26
forming the shape of a rectangle.
 [0036]                 As exemplified in Figures 3A to 3B, each pin 18 is receivable in a pre-drilled
through-hole 28 intennediate the ends of the legs 10, and has a threaded hole at its end which
can receive a screw 34 thereby allowing the releasable attachment of a leg 10 to its respective
pin 18. Alternatively, the pins 18 can have an outer thread which can receive a bolt with a
threaded hole (not shown). The pins 18 and corresponding through-holes 28 have circular
cross-sections, although other suitable cross-sections can be adopted, to allow the legs 10 to be
pivotable into a stable configuration where the legs 10 are mutually inclined and bear against
the associated facet or edge or part thereof 24 and as a result, the legs 10 interlock so that the
inclined legs 10 and connector 14 form a stable structure of Figures lB and IC. The screw and
threaded hole arrangement allows the frame assembly 2 to be fixed as a stable and strong
structure but allows the frame assembly 2 to be easily disassembled or assembled at any time.
The frame assembly 4 of Figures 2A and 2B is also formed and functions in a similar way as
described above.
[0037]                  One or more of the surfaces 36, 38 of each leg 10, 12 which are in contact with
adjacent legs 10', 10", 12',12" are bevelled such that the surfaces 36, 38 incline so as to

Ripx\Interwoven\NRPrtbl\DCC\PX i23728 5_i .d.x-20 122016
                                                         -6
improve the contact between adjacent legs 10, 10', 10", 12, 12',12". The surfaces 40, 42, 44,
46 on the upper and lower ends of the legs 10, 12 are also bevelled so as to define substantially
planar surfaces, i.e. for example, a first planar surface at the upper ends and a second planar
surface at the lower ends, to improve contact with a table top 22 or on the ground.
 [0038]                 Further preferred embodiments of connectors 14, 48 to 68 are shown in Figures 4A
to 5F as having three, four, five, six, eight or ten pins 80 distributed about a central axis of a
respective connector 14, 48 to 68. Each connector 14, 48 to 68 is therefore capable of
mounting a leg 10 on each of the pins 18, 80 provided to form frame assemblies having
between three and ten legs. It can be understood that while the connectors 14, 48 to 68 are
shown in the examples as having between three to ten pins 18, 80 the connectors may have
eleven or more pins to allow the formation of frame assemblies with eleven or more
corresponding legs.
 [0039]                 These connectors 14, 48 to 68 can be formed of tube-shaped metal having a
circular cross-section, such that when the legs 10 are so mounted on the connector 14, 48
to 68, they effectively bear on an edge of the tube-shaped sides of the connector 14, 48
to 68.Each pin 18, 80 of the connectors 14, 48 to 68 extends transverse to a respective facet or
edge 24, 82, the facets or edges 24, 82 forming a polygon having a number of sides
corresponding to the number of legs in the frame assembly. Figures 4A to 5F show the
connectors 14, 48 to 68 having facets or edges 24, 82 such that they form regular polygons and
where the legs 10 in the frame assembly 2 have the same length and are inclined at the same
angle. However, the facets or edges 26 and legs 12 can be of unequal length, as exemplified in
Figures 2A and 2B, where the facets or edges 26 form the shape of a rectangle and where the
frame assembly has four legs 12; one set of two parallel legs 12 being of one length and
another set of two parallel legs 12 being of another length, the two sets of legs being inclined
at different angles to each other.
[0040]                  Each pin 18, 20, 80 can be mounted anywhere along the respective facets or
edges 24, 26, 82 as long as the pin 14, 16, 80 extends transversely and generally horizontally
from the facet or edge 24, 26 82 so as to allow the mounted associated leg 10, 12 to form the
interlocking inclined leg 10, 12 and connector 14, 16 structure of the frame assembly 2, 4. For

Ripx\Interwoven\NRPrtbl\DCC\PX i23728 5_i .d.x-20 122016
                                                         -7
example, the pins 18, 20, 80 extend transversely from an end of each respective facet or
edge 24, 26, 82 in the connectors 14, 16, 48 to 56 of Figures 4A to 4F while the pins 80 extend
transversely intermediate the ends of the respective facets or edges 82 in the connectors 58
to 68 of Figures 5A to 5F.
[0041]                  The connectors 14, 16, 48 to 68 are provided with a central void 72 to 76 through
which an electrical cord can be fed to power a bulb 56 located for example in the upper
portion of the frame assembly 2, 4 to form a lamp stand as exemplified in Figures 1B and IC.
A clear or translucent or coloured glass or Perspex sheet material 22 positioned on the upper
ends of the legs 10, 12 or a table top which is formed by the upper ends of the legs 10, 12, can
then act as a lamp shade or table top. The lamp shade or table top can be removable so as to
form a tray. The presence of the void 72 to 76 also reduces the weight of the frame
assembly 2, 4.
[0042]                  In further preferred embodiments of alternative connectors 86 to 96, the
connectors are fonned of a single block of material such as metal, are shown in Figures 6A
to 8B having three, four, five, six, eight or ten threaded holes 84 distributed about a central
axis of the connector 86 to 96 which can receive respective pins 98, as shown particularly in
Figures 8A and 8B. The pins 98 have heads 100 such that the pins 98 can extend through the
through-holes 28 of the legs 12 to be received in the threaded holes 84 thereby securing the
legs 12 to the connector 86 to 96. The pins 98 may be in the form of bolts. When the pins are
so connected, the pins 98 extend transverse from an associated facet 102 of the connector 86
to 96. Each connector 86 to 96 is therefore capable of mounting a leg 10 on each of the pins 98
provided to form frame assemblies in a similar manner to that described above and which
function in a similar way.
[0043]                  While the embodiments relate to the frame assemblies where the pin is
substantially perpendicular to its associated facet or edge, in principle, the pin could be at
other angles.
[0044]                  Further, while the embodiments relate to frame assemblies where each facet or
edge has an associated pin, the frame assemblies may have facets or edges which do not have

Ripx\Interwoven\NRPrtbl\DCC\PX i23728 5_i .d.x-20 122016
a leg mounted on a pin. For example, a connector having six facets or edges with associated
pins may also form a frame assembly comprising three legs coupled together.
[0045]                  Further embodiments may relate to frame assemblies where each facet or edge has
an associated pin, the frame assemblies may have facets or edges which do not have an
associated pin. For example a connector having six facets or edges may have three facets with
associated pins such that any two facets having an associated pin have a facet without a pin
therebetween so as to provide mountings for only three legs to form a frame assembly having
three legs coupled together.
[0046]                  The frame assembly 2, 4 may also be provided with one or more drawers or
shelves so as to form a cabinet (not shown). Further, the frame assembly 2, 4 can be provided
with a number of hooks (not shown) so as to form a clothing rack such as coat or hat stand.
[0047]                  Embodiments of the invention also relate to frame assemblies having connectors
being of plate-like form whereby the facets are restricted in their depth such that they define
edges of the connector.
[0048]                  While the examples shown in Figures IA to 2B couple the legs 10, 12 together
about mid-way intermediate their ends, the frame assemblies 2, 4 can be modified such that
the legs 10, 12 are coupled closer to or further away from the upper ends and where the
legs 10, 12 have longer, shorter or varying lengths so as to be able to form different articles of
furniture, such as coffee tables, dining tables, seats, hat or coat stands and the like.
[0049]                  While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it
should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not by way
of limitation. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art that various changes in
form and detail can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the
invention. Thus, the present invention should not be limited by any of the above described
exemplary embodiments.
