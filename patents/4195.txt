There is one page of description only

      Electronic LED Yellow L Plates for Learner Drivers
     Electronic LED Green P Plates for Provisional Drivers
Learner Drivers forget to put their ( L Plates, P Plates ) on or
take them off the vehicles they are Driving, particularly when
they are sharing the vehicle with family or friends.
The Electronic LED L or P Plates would be transferable from
vehicle to vehicle if needed and would have a display inside the
vehicle telling the Driver whether the L or P Plates where
illuminated or not ( on or off ). Thus allowing the Driver to see
very clearly and quickly if his or her L or P Plates were on or
off.
Hopefully eliminating Parents and fully Licensed Drivers
accidentally Driving around with L or P Plates on when
sharing their vehicle with L or P Plate Drivers.
Hopefully also eliminating L and P Plate Drivers forgetting to
put their L or P Plates on the vehicle they are Driving.
These will be manufactured to Australian Standards and laws.
