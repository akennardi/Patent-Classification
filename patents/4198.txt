                                               Abstract
A method of administering non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs, in particular propionic acid
derivatives such as ibuprofen, is provided. The inventive dosage forms provide an initial release of the
NSAID and a second sustained release of NSAID, preferably in a single dosing step.

                  IMMEDIATE RELEASE AND SUSTAINED RELEASE
                             IBUPROFEN DOSING REGIMEN
         The present invention relates to a novel dosing regimen for non-steroidal anti
inflammatory drugs, particularly propionic acids. This dosing regimen provides sustained
therapeutic effect over extended time periods.
Background of the Invention
         Therapeutic agents for treating pain, inflammation, and fever include analgesics,
anti-inflammatories, and antipyretics. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's)
are one type of such therapeutic agents. They include propionic acid derivatives, acetic
acid derivatives, fenamic acid derivatives, biphenylcarbodylic acid derivatives, oxicams,
and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective NSAID's.
         Propionic acids include for example ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen.
Ibuprofen in particular is a widely used, well known NSAID possessing analgesic and
antipyretic properties. Ibuprofen is chemically known as 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-propionic
acid. It has been commercially available as an over-the-counter drug in many forms for
several years.
         NSAID's are typically administered on a once to four times daily basis, with the
daily dose ranging from about 50 to about 2000 milligrams, preferably from about 100 to
1600 and most preferably from about 200 to about 1200 milligrams.
         It is known to administer NSAID's and other drugs in multiple doses over 12 or
24 hours. For example, it is known to administer multiple doses containing equal
amounts of ibuprofen over 12 to 24 hours. Sustained release dosage forms containing
ibuprofen are also known.
         Palmisano et al., Advances in Therapy, Vol. 5, No. 4, July/August 1988 reports on
a study of ketoprofen and ibuprofen for treating primary dysmenorrhea. This reference
discloses the use of multiple doses of ketoprofen (initial dose of 150 mg followed by
subsequent doses of 75 mg) and ibuprofen (initial dose of 800 mg followed by
subsequent doses of 400 mg).
                                              1

         A double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, single center, PK/PD
dental pain study was conducted over a 12 hour observation period to evaluate the
pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, efficacy and safety profiles of certain ibuprofen
dosing regimens. Specifically, a single dose of 600 mg ibuprofen extended release caplets
was compared with equivalent total doses of ibuprofen immediate release 200 mg caplets
administered in three different dosing regimens as well as placebo in the treatment of
moderate to severe post-operative dental pain. The ibuprofen was administered as
ibuprofen extended release 600 mg caplets or one or more ibuprofen immediate release
200 mg caplets. One sub-group of patients had both pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic evaluation (PK group). The other sub-group of patients had only the
analgesic efficacy evaluations (non-PK group). Patients from both subgroups were
assigned at random to one of the five following treatments:
         Ibuprofen Extended Release           600 mg single dose at 0 hour
         Ibuprofen Immediate Release          600 mg single dose at 0 hour
         Ibuprofen Immediate Release          400 mg at 0 hour; 200 mg at 4 hours
         Ibuprofen Immediate Release          200 mng at 0, 4, and 8 hours
         Placebo
         Patients' assessments of pain intensity and pain relief as well as blood samples for
plasma ibuprofen analysis were obtained at the study site at hours 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
2.5, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.5, 9, 10, 11 and 12. A stopwatch technique was used to measure
the onset of meaningful pain relief. The study found that the 400/200/0 administration of
ibuprofen provided excellent pain relief over the entire 12-hour study period. During the
first four hours, the 400/200/0 treatment, along with the 600/0/0 immediate release
treatment, provided superior pain relief over the other treatments. During the 4 to 12 hour
interval, the 400/200/0 treatment alone provided the highest pain relief scores, despite the
fact that no further ibuprofen was administered after the first four hours.
         Applicants have now discovered that ibuprofen can be provided to a mammal,
preferably a human, in a specific single dosing step to achieve improved therapeutic
effect, especially pain relief, compared with known dosing regimens and in a more
                                                 2

convenient/compliant dose form. In particular, ibuprofen is provided to the mammal, in
one dosage form to provide an initial immediate release dose followed by a delayed
second sustained release dose of ibuprofen. No further dosings are required to provide a
Cnin of 5-10 mcg/mL for a period of at least about 8 hours after administration of the
dosage form.
Summary of the Invention
        The invention provides a method of administering an NSAID, which consists of
providing to a mammal in a single dosing step an initial dose of said NSAID and a
delayed second sustained release dose of said NSAID, said NSAID from the immediate
release and the sustained release portions of the dosage form have a duration of 8 hours,
more preferably at 10 hours, most preferably 12 hours.
        The invention also provides a method of administering a propionic acid derivative
to a mammal, over a 12-hour time period, which comprises providing a first peak plasma
concentration of said propionic acid derivative of about 10 to about 30 mcg/mL in said
mammal about 30 to about 120 minutes after said initial dose, and a second plasma
concentration following the first peak plasma concentration of said propionic acid
derivative of at least about 10 mcg/mL for up to about 6 hours, preferably up to about 8
hours after administration of said initial dose.
        In one embodiment, the invention also provides a method of administering in a
single dosing step a propionic acid derivative, which comprises providing to a mammal,
over a 12 hour time period, an initial dose of said propionic acid derivative at the
beginning of said 12 hour time period, followed by a second sustained release dose of
said propionic acid derivative about 2 to about 10 hours after administration of said initial
dose, said initial dose load of propionic acid derivative being at least about twice the dose
load of propionic acid derivative in said second dose, wherein no further propionic acid
derivative is provided during said 12 hour time period.

Detailed Description of the Invention
        As used herein, "ATDAIRD" shall mean the "average therapeutic duration of
action of an effective immediate release dose" of a particular active ingredient. For
example, the typical duration of action of an immediate release dose of ibuprofen or
ketoprofen is about 4 to about 6 hours. Accordingly, the ATDAIRD for ibuprofen or
ketoprofen is 5 hours. The typical duration of action of an immediate release dose of
Naproxen is about 8 to about 12 hours. The ATDAIRD for naproxen, therefore is 10
hours. The therapeutic duration of action of a particular active ingredient can readily be
determined from the dosing instructions in the labeling for immediate release products
containing that particular active ingredient.
       NSAID's useful in the present invention are the propionic acid derivative
NSAIDs and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the foregoing.
        In a particularly preferred embodiment, the NSAID is selected from propionic
acid derivatives. Propionic acid derivatives are pharmaceutically acceptable
analgesics/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs having a free -CH(CH 3)COOH or
CH 2CH2COOH or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt group, such as -CH(CH 3)COO-Na+
or CH 2CH 2COO-Na+, which are typically attached directly or via a carbonyl
functionality to a ring system, preferably an aromatic ring system.
        Examples of useful propionic acid derivatives include ibuprofen, naproxen,
benoxaprofen, naproxen sodium, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, fenbuprofen, ketoprofen,
indoprofen, pirprofen, carpofen, oxaprofen, pranoprofen, microprofen, tioxaprofen,
suproprofen, alminoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, fluprofen and bucloxic acid.
                                              4

         In one embodiment of the invention, the propionic acid derivative is selected from
ibuprofen, ketoprofen, flubiprofen, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and
combinations thereof
         Preferably, the propionic acid derivative is ibuprofen, 2-(4
isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, such as the
arginine, lysine, or histidine salt of ibuprofen. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts of
ibuprofen are described in US Patent Nos. 4,279,926, 4,873,231, 5,424,075 and
5,510,385, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.
         According to the invention, the NSAID is provided to a mammal in need of
treatment, in particular pain relief treatment, in a specific dosing regimen over an
extended time period, preferably over a 12 hour period. At time zero, a single dosing step
containing an initial dose of the NSAID is provided, i.e. administered, to the mammal
that also provides a second sustained release dose of the NSAID. No further NSAID is
administered for the remainder of the time period.
         The second dose step provides a sustained release of pharmaceutical active. The
sustained release can be, for example, zero-order or first order. Zero-order release is one
variation of sustained or controlled release drug system, which produces steady-state drug
release over time such that the drug releases in a constant plasma profile. A first-order
drug release is where the rate of elimination of drug from plasma is proportional to the
plasma concentration. In certain embodiments the second dose has a lag time where drug
is released from the second dose at about 1 hour, 1.5 hours 2 hours, 2.5 hours 3 hours, 3.5
hours or 4 hours.
         The initial dose of NSAID may be, for example, in the range of about 0.10 to
about 15 mg/kg, and the second sustained release dose may be, for example, in the range
of about 0.05 to about 7.5 mg/kg, wherein the "kg" refers to the weight of the subject
receiving the dose. In one embodiment, the initial dose of NSAID is at least about twice
the second dose of NSAID. In certain embodiments of the invention wherein ibuprofen is
employed, the initial dose is from about 400 to about 800 mg, or from about 5.7 to about
 12 mg/kg, and the second sustained release dose is from about 200 to about 300 mg, or
from about 2.9 to about 4.3 mg/kg. In another embodiment the initial dose of ibuprofen is
from about 300 to 600 mg, or from about 4.3 to about 8.6 mg/kg, and the second
                                               5

sustained release dose is from about 300 to 600 mg, or from about 4.3 to about 8.6
mg/kg. In another embodiment, the initial dose and the second dose deliver
approximately the same amount of active ingredient.
         In one particular embodiment of the invention wherein ibuprofen is employed, the
initial dose is about 400 mg, or about 5.7 mg/kg, and the second sustained release dose is
about 200 mg, or about 2.9 mg/kg. Moreover, the initial dose in such embodiment is
within the therapeutic range for the particular active ingredient employed, and is about
twice the level of the second dose, which is also within the therapeutic range for the
particular active ingredient employed. In another particular embodiment of the invention
wherein ibuprofen is employed, the initial dose is about 300 mg, or about 4.3 mg/kg, and
the second sustained release dose is also about 300 mg, or about 4.3 mg/kg.
         In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a propionic acid derivative is
administered to a mammal over a 12 hour time period, by first providing in a single
dosing step to the mammal an initial dose of the propionic acid derivative at the
beginning of the 12 hour time period that also provides a second sustained release dose of
the propionic acid derivative, wherein the initial dose is at least about twice the second
dose. No further propionic acid derivative is provided during the 12 hour time period.
         In certain embodiments, the invention provides a first peak plasma concentration
within the therapeutic range for the particular active ingredient employed within about
0.5 times the ATDAIRD for the active ingredient after administration of the initial dose,
and a second plasma concentration within the therapeutic range for the particular active
ingredient employed between about 0.8 to about 1.2 times the ATDAIRD after
administration of the initial dose. In one embodiment, the plasma concentration of
NSAID at about 2 times the ATAIRD after administration of the initial dose is below the
known therapeutic range for the particular active ingredient employed.
         In certain particular embodiments, in which the active ingredient has an
ATDAIRD of about 5 hours, the invention provides a first peak plasma concentration
within the therapeutic range for the particular active ingredient employed about 10 to
about 30 minutes after administration of the initial dose, and a second plasma
concentration within the therapeutic range for the particular active ingredient employed
between about 2 to about 6 hours, alternatively between about 2 to about 8 hours after
                                             6

administration of the initial dose. In one embodiment, the plasma concentration of
NSAID at about 10 hours after administration of the initial dose is below the known
therapeutic range for the particular active ingredient employed.
         In certain particular embodiments wherein ibuprofen is employed, the invention
provides a first peak plasma concentration of ibuprofen of about 20 to about 30 mcg/mL
in the mammal about 30 to about 120 minutes after administration of the initial dose, and
a second plasma concentration of ibuprofen of about 10 to about 30 mcg/mL from about
3 to about 6 hours after administration of the initial dose. In another particular
embodiment wherein ibuprofen is employed, the invention provides a first peak plasma
concentration of ibuprofen of about 20 to about 30 mcg/mL in the mammal about 30 to
about 120 minutes after administration of the initial dose, and a second plasma
concentration of ibuprofen of about 10 to about 30 mcg/mL from about 3 to about 8 hours
after administration of the initial dose. In one embodiment, the plasma concentration of
ibuprofen at about 10 hours after administration of the initial dose is less than about 10
mcg/mL. In another embodiment, the plasma concentration of ibuprofen at about 6 hours
after the second dose is less than about 15 mcg/mL.
         The NSAID may be administered in a variety of dosage forms, for example, solid
dosage forms such as tablets, coated tablets, capsules, liquid dosage forms such as syrups,
and suspensions, preferably in tablet form having multiple cores of NSAID with varying
dissolution properties. The initial and second doses may be administered in a single
dosing step. In one embodiment the initial and second doses are administered in a single
dosing step, preferably a single solid dosage form. For example, such a dosage form may
comprise a single dosing step comprising an immediate release portion containing the
initial dose of NSAID and a sustained release portion containing the second dose of
NSAID or acetaminophen. Such a single solid dosage fonn may be a multilayer tablet
where the first immediate release dose is provided in one layer and the second sustained
release dose is provided in a second layer. A single solid dosage form may also be
provided in a multiparticulate tablet wherein the first immediate release dose is provided
in one portion of particulates and the second sustained release dose is provided in a
second portion of particulates, or the like.
                                               7

         The initial dose meets United States Pharmacopeia (USP) specifications for
immediate release tablets containing that active ingredient. For example, for ibuprofen
tablets, USP 24 specifies that in pH 7.2 phosphate buffer, using USP apparatus 2
(paddles) at 50 rpm, at least 80% of the ibuprofen contained in the dosage form is
released therefrom within 60 minutes after dosing. (See USP 24, 2000 Version, 19 -20
and 856 (1999)).
         The pk blood profiles for various dosing regimes of the present invention were
calculated using a simulation program. The PKPlusTM module portion of Gastroplus TM
simulator software available from Simulations Plus, Incorporated, was first used to
determine the best type of ACAT (Advanced Compartmental Absorption and Transit)
model for immediate release ibuprofen dosing. Intravenous plasma data for ibuprofen
was obtained from the following study, "Pharmacokinetics and absolute bioavailability
after oral administration of ibuprofen lysine in man", Biopharmaceutics & Drug
Disposition 11 (3):265-78, April, 1990. Martin W. , Koelowske G., Toberich H.,
Kerkman T.
         Ibuprofen was dosed as either 200mg or 400 mg of an intravenous solution over a
5-minute infusion time. Plasma concentration for the following time points was inputted
into the PK Plus module in hours; 0.0, 0.017, 0.033, 0.05, 0.067, 0.1, 0.167, 0.333, 0.5,
0.667, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0. Plasma concentration vs. time data were extracted
using sunmary graphs from UN-SCAN-ITTM graph digitizing software available from
Silk Scientific Inc. The PK Plus module portion estimated pharmacokinetic parameters
and performed calculations for the goodness of fit and Akaike Information Criterion for
Noncompartment, One-Compartment, Two-Compartment and Three-Compartment
Models. Based on the lowest Akaike information criterion value, the two and three
compartment model were selected as having the best fit.
         Once the pharmacokinetic models were obtained based on the above information,
the absorption model based on oral dosing was selected. Based on these models,
simulated plasma concentration (Cp) vs. time curves were derived for three immediate
release treatments; three doses of 200 mg of Ibuprofen each at 4 hours apart; a single
dose of 600 mg Ibuprofen and a 400 mg dose followed by a 200 mg dose 4 hours later.
Upon inspection of the curves, it was determined that the three-compartment model
                                               8

conferred only a very slight advantage of fit, and two compartment linear
pharmacokinetic models were considered.
        Several different screens within the Gastroplus"  software were modified to
generate the optimum dosing curves. The Compound screen has the following parameters
which can be varied:

The Pka Table screen in Gastroplus TM calculates a pH solubility of the compound of
reference depending on the added pKa value.
        Based on these simulations, the optimized clearance and micro-constants were
derived using a human-fasted GI model. The fraction of ibuprofen unbound in plasma
was set at 1.5% and the optimum clearance value was 0.04789 liters/hour/kg based on
human body weight.
        The following examples further illustrate the invention, but are not meant to limit
the invention in any way.

The figures shown above were derived from simulated dissolution curves. A typical
dissolution for ibuprofen tablets uses a USP #2 apparatus (paddles), rotating at 50 RPM,
in 900 mL of pH 7.2 phosphate buffer at 37 0C. The phosphate buffer is prepared by
dissolving 6.067 g of anhydrous potassium phosphate dibasic and 2.067 g of anhydrous
potassium phosphate monobasic in 800 mL of deionized water. It is then diluted to
1000mL with demonized water and mixed thoroughly. Approximately 10 milliliter
samples are pulled from the dissolution vessel at various timepoints (indicated in the
graphs) and analyzed on a high pressure liquid chromatograph fitted with a Waters p
Bondapak® C-18 column, and UV detector set at 254 nm. The flow rate is 2.0 mL/min.
The injection volume is 100 micro-liters. The mobile phase is acetonitrile and 0.1 M
acetic acid prepared in a ratio of 55:45 respectively.
Each of the following examples represents a dose of 2 tablets per dose.

                                             15

A laboratory scale thermal cycle molding unit having a round shape of dimension of 3/8",
is used to apply the shell portion to the Bi-Layer Tablet core. The molding unit comprises
a single mold assembly made from an upper mold assembly portion comprising an upper
mold cavity, and a lower mold assembly portion comprising a lower mold cavity. Two
sets of coated tablets are prepared as described in EXAMPLE 3 and EXAMPLE 4. The
Bi-Layer Tablet core prepared as described in EXAMPLE 1 or EXAMPLE 2 is inserted
into the cavity. The lower mold assembly portion is first cycled to a hot stage at 90*C for
2 minutes. The coating solution of polymeric coating (TABLE 6), which is prepared as
described in Step B, is injected into the lower mold cavity to coat the SR layer portion
(TABLE 2 or TABLE 4) of said tablet.
        A blank upper mold assembly portion is mated with the lower mold assembly
portion. The mold assembly is then cycled to a cold stage at 2*C for 60 seconds to harden
the first coating portion. The blank mold assembly portion is removed from the lower
mold assembly portion. The upper mold assembly portion is cycled to a hot stage at 90*C
for 2 minutes.
        The lower mold assembly portion, which has been maintained at 24C, is mated
with the upper mold assembly portion in such a way that the core of EXAMPLE I or
EXAMPLE 2 is mated with the first core station of the upper mold assembly.
        The gelatin coating solution (TABLE 5), which is prepared and described in Step
A is injected into the upper mold portion and covers the IR layer portion (TABLE 1 or
TABLE 3) of the tablet cores. The upper mold assembly portion is then cycled to a cold
stage at 2*C for 90 seconds to harden the second coating portion. The lower mold
assembly portion is then removed and the finished dosage form, a molded tablet coated
with two halves of the 2 coating materials, is ejected from the upper mold cavity. The
weight gain from the coating material (i.e. the difference in weight between the finished
dosage form and the core) is recorded. The coated tablets are then dried at 50*C in an
oven for 24 hours.
