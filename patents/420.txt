                   AN IMPROVED CONTAINER, CONTAINER CONSTRUCTION,
                                 HANDLING METHOD AND APPARATUS
     Field of the invention
     [001]           The present invention relates in general to containers and container
     constructions having ISO fittings for lifting and handling, more particularly to containers for bulk
     materials, especially containers that have reinforced side walls, wherein the contents are
    discharged by tipping or rotating the container.
    [002]            Further, the present invention also relates to containers of the open top kind for
    the handling and transport of bulk materials. These containers may be full height or half height,
    and in particular to lids, lid systems and lifting systems for engagement of those lids, which lid
    lifting systems can be mounted on to tippler or container rotators, or mounted on lifting devices
    adapted to lift said containers and or lids.
   Background of the invention
   [003]            Containers for materials such as liquids, ores, minerals, sand, powders, waste, or
   grains such as wheat are available. These can be handled by machines called tipplers, whereby
   the containers can be pivoted or tipped to discharge their contents. An issue with containers for
   bulk ore or liquid materials is that the container content creates a load on the container side
  walls, and can cause deflections in the side walls. To reduce deflections or buckling during
  rotation caused by the load, the walls of the container have been reinforced by cross braces as
  in PCT/GB2010/000122 or by top braces as in W09513233.
  [004]             Open containers have manually closed by lids which have fork tyne receptors on
  the lid, to enable a fork lift to place a lid onto or move a lid from a container. The lids are used
  during the transport phase to protect the bulk material from the weather and to prevent the
  action of wind from forming dust from the bulk material during transport.
 [005]              Once the container gets to its destination such as a transfer location, by means
 of the tyne receptors a fork lift will move the lid off the container and then the container will be
 delivered to a tipping or tippler device which will engage the container and lift and rotate the
 container to discharge the contents of the container into a desired location. This tipping process
 can require the container to be rotated 180 degrees to discharge the bulk product by the tippler.
 [006]             Such tipplers are generally attached to ships cranes or ship to shore cranes or
shore cranes or mobile habour cranes and the container can rotated and discharged directly in
the hull of the bulk container of ocean going vessels.

[007]            Current practice is that these lids are manually locked in place by ground
personnel and removed using a fork lift. The container is then lifted and emptied into the ship.
[008]           Any reference herein to known prior art does not, unless the contrary indication
appears, constitute an admission that such prior art is commonly known by those skilled in the
art to which the invention relates, at the priority date of this application.
Summary of the invention
[009]           The present invention also provides a container for transporting material said
container having ISO corner fittings, characterised in that said corner assembly or fittings are
formed from a generally box like structure as a main body, and at least one gusset formation
extending there from. There can be included a plurality of gusset formations.
[010]           The present invention also provides a corner reinforcing arrangement formed
from a body such as an ISO corner fitting and a post, and at least one gusset formation
extending therefrom, or a multiple number of gusset formations extending therefrom.
[011]           The gusset formation can includes one or both of the following: a face angled to
the horizontal plane; a face angled to the vertical plane.
[012]           The corner reinforcing arrangement can be such that the at least one gusset
formation has a three-dimensional shape.
[013]           The corner reinforcing arrangement can be such that the gusset formation of a
generally triangular configuration.
[014]           The corner reinforcing arrangement can be such that a part of the periphery of
the gusset formation is welded to the corner or post, with another part being welded to a lateral
or longitudinal beam of said container.
[015]           The corner reinforcing arrangement can be such that the gusset formation
extends inwardly from the corner or post and laterally of a longitudinal axis of the container or
parallel thereto.
[016]           The gusset formation can be formed from an outboard triangular plate and an
inboard plate having a triangular or trapezoidal shape, said outboard and inboard plates being
connected by a rectangular plate.
[017]           The present invention also provides a container having corner reinforcing
arrangement as described in the preceding paragraphs.
[018]           The container can have four upper corners being formed by such a corner
reinforcing arrangement.

 [019]           The lower corners of the container can include generally triangular shaped
 gusset formations between lower corners and beams or rails of said container.
 [020]           The forward and rearward ends of said container can include an upper beam
which extends between respective corner posts and or corners, said upper beam having an
 inboard edge or side which is internally offset from the posts and or corners.
 [021]           The forward and rearward ends of said container can include a lower beam
which extends between respective corner posts and or corners, said lower beam having an
 inboard edge or side which is internally offset from the posts and or corners.
 [022]           The inboard edge or side lower beam can be internally offset by a greater
distance than the inboard edge or side of said upper beam.
 [023]           The present invention provides a lid having a cover portion which is sized and
shaped to be received onto said open container so as to cover, at least substantially, an
opening at the top of the container, the cover portion including at, at least one location thereon,
at least one aperture formation into which can be received a lifting member, which is located on
the end of a lifting cable or lifting frame, for releasably locking said cable or said frame to the lid.
 [024]           A plurality of aperture formations can be located on the lid, the aperture
formations can be one of the following: formed separate and attached to the lid; formed
integrally in the lid; or are apertures formed in the lid.
[025]            The aperture formations can be ISO-fittings or fittings which comply with ISO
standards.
[026]            The lid can be manufactured from sheet metal, steel, plastic or composite
material.
[027]            The aperture formation(s) can cooperate with a locking mechanism, the locking
mechanism locking the lid to the container. The aperture may also be only for lifting, and locking
and unlocking is maintained as a manual process.
[028]            The aperture formation(s) can receive the lift member or rotating or twist locking
member which causes the lid to be unlocked from the container.
[029]            The aperture formation can be associated with a lever means which will, when
rotated, cause a lock which engages said container to be released.
[030]            The lid can include centrally or peripherally located apertured receiving
formations.
[031]            There can be one or more locking bars which extend from said receiving
formations to lock said lid relative to said container.

[032]            The action of the lift member entering said aperture formation(s) can cause a
lever of said locking mechanism to move said locking mechanism from a locked to an unlocked
condition.
[033]            The action of the lift member entering said aperture formation(s) enables a
portion of said lock mechanism to be rotated from a locked to an unlocked condition.
[034]            The lever means can rotate about a generally vertical axis.
[035]            The lever means can rotate about a generally horizontal axis
[036]            The lever means can be biased to a lock condition by means of one or a
combination of two or more of the following: gravity, a spring bias, a portion spring, tension
spring, a compression spring.
[037]            The action of lifting members on a lid lifting device engaging said receiving
formation on said lid causes said locks to move to unlocked conditions.
[038]            The lifting member on a lid lifting device, in moving to disengage from said
receiving formations on said lid, can cause said locks to move to a locked condition so that once
the lift members are able to separate from the receiving formations the lid is locked to a
container or said locks are in a locked condition.
[039]            The apertured or receiving formations receive a respective lift member in a
vertical direction.
[040]            The engagement of a respective lid lift member to said apertured formation(s) will
operate by one of the following: (a) simultaneously lock the lid lift member to the respective
apertured formation and unlock the lid from the container; (b) sequentially unlock the lid from
the container and then lock the lid lift member to the respective apertured formation; (c)
sequentially lock the lid lift member to the respective apertured formation then unlock the lid
from the container.
[041]            The present invention also provides a lifting device for lifting a container, the
device including means to engage fittings at the corners of a container to be lifted, the device,
including a second lifting means which operates to releasably engage a lid associated with the
container.
[042]            The lifting device can be associated with or is formed as part of a lifting vehicle
such as a crane or can be connected to a crane or material handling equipment.
[043]            The device can also be adapted to rotate the container to discharge its contents.
[044]            The second lifting means can lift the lid out of the path of the container rotation.

 [045]           The second lifting means can be operable independently of the lifting of the
 container, so that the lid can be lifted from the container, while the container is being moved, or
 before the container is being moved, or to allow the container to be deposited after being
transported with the lid remaining on the device.
 [046]           The second lifting device can include a lifting member which has a rotating or
twisting locking member to engage an aperture formation on the lid, so a to lock the second
 lifting means to the lid.
[047]            The lifting member or rotating or twisting locking member also releases a lock
which locks the lid to the container
[048]            The second lifting means can have a multiple of the lift members or rotating or
twist locking members to engage a like multiple of the aperture formations on the lid.
[049]            The present invention further provides a method of handling an open container
which has a lid to covers an opening of the container, the method including the steps of
providing a lifting device as described above, wherein the lifting device is controlled so as to lift
the container and the lid or lift the container and lift the lid from the container; or to lift just the lid
from the container.
[050]            Lifting the container and the lid, or lifting the container and lifting the lid from the
container can be performed sequentially or simultaneously.
[051]            The method can include the step of rotating the container to discharge the
contents of the container.
[052]            Prior to rotating the container, the lid is lifted off the container and transported to
a location relative to the container without a rotation envelope of the container.
[053]            There can be is included a step of unlocking the lid relative to the container, by
the engagement of the lifting device to at least one aperture formation on the lid.
[054]            The lid can include centrally located twist lock receiving formations.
[055]            One or more locking bars radiate from said receiving formations to lock said lid
relative to said container.
[056]            The action of twist locks on a lid lifting device engaging receiving formation as on
said lid can cause said locks to move to an unlocked conditions.
[057]            The action of twist locks on a lid lifting device, in moving to disengage from said
receiving formations on said lid, will cause said locks to move to a locked conditions so that
once the twist locks are able to separate form said receiving formations said lid is locked to a
container or said locks are in a locked condition.

the support structure, there being a clearance or space between a top edge of the container and
at least a portion of the top edge of the support structure.
[065]            The clearance or space is provided along a central portion of the top edge of the
support structure.
[066]            The support structure can include a plate having said first, second, and third
corners or apexes.
[067]            The plate can have at least one hollowed out section.
[068]            The three corners or apexes can be formed by three members of the support
structure, with a first member extending at least between said first and second corners or
apexes, a second member extending at least between the second and third corners or apexes,
and a third member extending at least between the first and third corners or apexes.

Detailed description of the embodiment or embodiments
[0137]           Figures 1 and 1A depict a container 100 with internal bracing. In this view, two
opposing walls 102, 104, and bottom 106 are visible. The support structure or internal brace
110 made up of integrally formed members 110.1, 110.2, and 110.3 reinforces the side walls
102 and 104, to assist them in resisting deformation when a bulk material is weighing down on a
single side wall during a tipping operation. The brace 110 forms a triangular shape, having a
first apex or corner 112 which is connected to side wall 102 via an apertured mounting plate
102.1 which is welded to the side wall 102 at the square hollow section top rail thereof, which is
illustrated in cross section in figure 1; a second apex or corner 116 which is connected to the
container floor 106 via an apertured mounting plate 106.1 which is welded to the floor 106; and
a third apex or corner 114 which is connected to the opposing wall 104 via an apertured
mounting plate 104.1 which is welded to the side wall 104 at the square hollows section top rail
thereof, which is illustrated in cross section in figure 1.

 [0138]         ISO fittings 100.1 are provided at the container's four top corners 100.2, allowing
for the manoeuvring and handling, such as lifting, of the container 100 by e.g. a crane. The
 container 100 is therefore compliant with ISO specifications.
 [0139]         Figure 1A shows a container with see-through sides to illustrate the location and
 arrangement of the brace 110 which is provided to support the longitudinal walls 102 and 104.
When the container 100 is rotated to dispense the contents, the load created by the weight of
the content bears on the longitudinal walls 102 or 104 (depending upon the direction of rotation,
and the brace 110 reinforces the respective longitudinal wall against this load during rotation.
 [0140]         The internal brace 110 can be attached by bolts or pins to the mounting plates
 102.1, 106.1 and 104.1, or can alternatively be welded thereto or welded directly to the
sidewalls 102, 104 and the floor 106. Alternatively the brace 110 can be attached to gusset
plates which are themselves attached by pins or bolts to the container 100.
[0141]          The brace 110 can be one piece as illustrated in figure 1, or can be made up of a
multiple of members joined together via methods such as welding or bolting. This is able to be
done as the braces members 110.1, 110.2, and 110.3 act predominantly in tension, particularly
during tippler rotation processes.
[0142]          As depicted in Figure 2, the internal brace can be a triangular plate 210 bound
approximately by the three apexes 212, 214, and 216.
[0143]          Referring to Figure 3, the internal brace 310 can have a hollowed out section
320, to reduce the weight. The rim area 322 around the hollowed out section 320 provides for
the transmission and bearing of forces.
[0144]          Referring to Figure 4, the top portion of the internal brace 410 can be recessed,
for example it can be scalloped out, so that the brace 410 has a recessed top 425. The
recessed top 425 is partially recessed with respect to the top of the container 400. However it
can alternatively be wholly recessed with respect to the top of the container (e.g. see Figure 8).
The corners 412 and 414 of brace 410 in this embodiment are located at approximately the
same level as the top of the container 400.
[0145]          Referring to Figure 5, the internal brace 510 can comprise three separate
members 505, 515, and 525. Side member 505 connects between one side wall 502 to the floor
506, opposing side member 515 connects the opposite side wall 504 to the floor 506, and the
top member 525 connects the opposing side members 505 and 515. Each of the individual
members 505, 515, and 525 can substantially extend between two of the brace's three corners
512, 514, and 516. For instance apertured mounting plates can be provided at each of the three
apexes 512, 514, and 516, and each member can have end openings which align with the
apertures. Screws, bolts, pins, or rivets can be used to secure them together. The members

505, 515, and 525 can alternatively be welded together at each of the three apex locations 512,
514, and 516.
[0146]           In this embodiment the internal brace 510 forms a triangle, and provides more
stability to the container 500 than a V-shaped brace having only the opposing side members
505 and 515. The top member 525 helps stabilise the side members 505 and 515 by limiting
their movement with respect to each other. In the orientation shown in Figure 5, the horizontal
movement of the side members 505, 515 is limited.
[0147]          Referring to Figure 6, an internal brace 610 with three members 605, 615, 625 as
described above can also be recessed at its upper location. For example the top member 625
can extend from an intermediate portion 630 along the side member 605 to a corresponding
intermediate portion 635 along the opposing side member 615. The side members can have
mounting plates 625.1 and 625.2 at these intermediate portions 630 and 635, and the top
member 625 can be attached between these mounting plates. The lower height of the top
member 625 provides extra clearance between the top of the container 600 and the top of the
internal brace 610 to assist in providing greater clearance for front end loaders.
[0148]          Alternatively, as shown in Figure 7, the top member 725 can be welded or bolted
directly to the side members 705 and 715 at an intermediate height along the side members
705 and 715. The side members 705 and 715 therefore each extend from the floor mounting
plate 716 to beyond the top corners 712 and 714, to connect with the sidewalls 702 and 704.
There can further be gussets 730, 735, and 740 provided between the brace members 705,
715, and 725 to provide extra stability and strength.
[0149]          The jointing between the internal brace and the container, or the jointing between
individual brace members in embodiments where the internal brace is not one piece, can be
permanent or temporary. The temporary jointing can be achieved using removable screws,
bolts, or pins. Gussets or attachment plates can be provided at the connection points and
mounting plates for the purpose of attaching the internal brace to the side walls or the container
floor. These gussets can be joined to the container by temporary or permanent jointing
techniques of bolting, welding, and the like.
[0150]           Referring to Figure 8, the horizontal top member 825 passes horizontally through
the top corners 812 and 814, and provides connection between the side walls 802 and 804.
Side members 805 and 815 of the internal brace 810 each extend from the container floor
mounting plate 816 to spaced intermediate portions of the top member 825. The internal brace
810 is has a substantially triangular configuration.

 [0151]         In a similar embodiment shown in Figure 9, the side members 905 and 915 of the
 internal brace 910 each connect between the container floor attachment 916 to one end of the
horizontal top member 925 of the internal brace 910.
[0152]          In each of the embodiments described with reference to Figures 5 to 9, the
internal brace can be formed of a single piece such as a solid plate or a plate with one or more
hollowed out sections. The plate or the individual members which form the internal brace can
further be made of separate elements which improve the structural rigidity of the internal brace.
The internal brace can also be made of individual tensile sections such as cables or chains,
which can include a means for adjustment such as a turnbuckle, or the struts of the brace can
be large turnbuckles, which will allow for ready and easy replacement if damaged. Each section
can be replaced or adjusted as appropriate.
[0153]          In each of the examples depicted in Figures 10 to 12, the internal brace includes
more than one triangular structure. In Figure 10, the internal brace 1010 includes a first
structure 1020 and a second structure 1030. The first part 1020 has a side edge 1022 located
against or adjacent sidewall 1002. The side edge 1022 extends between two corners 1024 and
1026 of the first structure 1020. The first part 1020 is jointed to mounting plates at the corners
1024 and 1026, and the mounting plates are in turn attached to the sidewall 1002.
[0154]           The second part 1030 has a side edge 1032 located against or adjacent sidewall
1004, and extending between two corners 1034 and 1036 of the first structure 1030. The
second part 1030 is joined to mounting plates at these corners, and the mounting plates in turn
are attached to the sidewall 1004. The mounting plates can be welded to the sidewalls 1002,
1004. The first and second parts 1020 and 1030 respectively have a bottom edge 1028 and
1038 which are generally close to and/or parallel to the container floor 1006. The bottom edges
1028 and 1038 can overlap each other, so that their inner ends overlap and are joined to a
single floor mounting plate 1016. The floor mounting plate 1016 can be welded to the floor
1006. The first and second parts 1020 and 1030 each have a hollowed out section to reduce
weight.
[0155]          As seen in Figure 11, the first and second parts 1120 and 1130 do not overlap.
Instead their bottom edges 1128 and 1138 extend from the corresponding outer corners 1126
and 1136 to inner corners 1129 and 1139. The end points 1129 and 1139 are located on either
side of the centre line 1150 through the container floor 1106. The first and second parts 1120
and 1130 can be solid plates with or without hollowed out sections. Alternatively, instead of
being solid or hollowed out plates the parts in the internal brace 1010 or 1110 can be individual
or welded together members.
[0156]          Figure 12 depicts another bracing method. The internal brace 1210 has two
triangular parts 1220 and 1230 which are fully welded to the container 1200. The side edge

1222 of triangular part 1220 is welded to sidewall 1202, and the side edge 1232 of triangular
part 1230 is welded to the opposite sidewall 1204. The bottom edges 1228 and 1238 of the
parts are both welded to the container floor 1206. The bottom edges can terminate without
overlapping, similar to the embodiment depicted in Figure 11. If desired, the bracing 1210, in
particular parts 1220 and 1230, can additionally or alternatively, be positioned at locations other
than the middle of the container and internal of the container. That is, they can be located
externally adjacent the end walls or internally adjacent the end walls.
[0157]          As illustrated in Figures 14 and 15, the container can be such that the required
side wall mounting plates such as plate 102.1 and 104.1 of figure 1 (or those connecting to
corners 1036 and 1026 in figures 10 and 11) are located on sidewall reinforcing posts 133
welded to the sidewalls 102 and 104. These provide extra reinforcement. Further reinforcement
can be provided by welding additional posts such as 133.1 to side walls 102 and 104 on either
side of the post 133, as also illustrate din figures 14 and 15. The posts 133 and 133.1 are
preferably rectangular hollow section members (RHS) welded into place. However, other forms
of reinforcing members such as profile plates (e.g. triangular plates welded to the outside of the
container) or I-beam, C-beam or H-beam could be used.
[0158]           The braces 110 as described above assist to also reinforce and strengthen the
floor of the container, because of the location of a brace connection with the floor in an
intermediate region or near there. If desired, under the floor in the region of the mounting plate
for the brace, there can be provided a reinforcement, similar to the RHS post of figure 14 and
15, so as to provide event greater resistance to deflection.
[0159]           In the some of the figures above apertured mounting plates are indicated by the
numerals X02.1, X06.1 and X04.1 where the X represents the figure number. In some figures
such as in figures 3, 5, 6 and 8 to 12, mounting plates, whether apertured or otherwise, are
indicated at one or more apex of the support structure.
[0160]          As illustrated in Figures 16, 17 and 21 are various views of a container 1100
which has tapered long side walls 104 and 102 as well as tapered end walls 104.1 and 102.1.
The tapering of these walls is best viewed in figure 16 where a taper of approximately I to 5
degrees to the vertical, and most preferably 2 degrees, is visible with respect to the vertical on
these four walls. This taper will assist this container, when being rotated through 180 degrees
as illustrated in figure 31, to disgorge all its contents more readily than if such walls were not
tapered. These tapers also serve another function as will be described in more detail below.
[0161]           To reinforce the ISO corner fittings 100.2 of a container, as illustrated in figures
13 to 15, the corners 100.2 are each reinforced by angled corner gussets 100.31. The angled
corner gusset formations 100.31 of figure 13 is shown in rear view in figure 24, where there is
illustrated the rear face of the gusset formation, being that face which will engage the post or

 corner of the container. It can be seen that the gusset formation 100.31 has three sides, being
 two generally triangular sides comprising a large outboard triangular side 100.315 and a smaller
 inboard triangular side 100.316, and a joining side 100.317 which is angled to both the
 horizontal and vertical planes. This gusset formation can be formed by fabrication and welding
 of three appropriately shaped sides or by cutting at appropriate angles, a square or rectangular
 hollow section and bending the sides to the appropriate shape or alternatively they can be
 formed from a flat sheet metal piece, and bent into the shape required.
 [0162]          The outside of the corner construction can have reinforcing in the form of welded
 flat plates 100.32 and 100.33 which are welded onto the outside of the container on the top rail
 of the side 102 as illustrated in figure 13, and also along the top rail of the shorter side of the
 container. The plate 100.33 is a generally square plate and is welded to the corner post below
the ISO corner fitting 100.2, while the plate 100.32 is a generally rectangular plate which is
welded to the top rail of the sides.
 [0163]          These ISO corner fitting reinforcements can assist in the fittings bearing the
 rotational loads which may be applied to them during tippler and discharge operations. While
the ISO corner fitting reinforcements described above are welded structures, it is also possible
to cast the ISO corner fittings together with these reinforcements so that an integrally formed
corner and reinforcement is provided.
[0164]          As is best illustrated in Figures 16, 17 and 25 the upper corners 100.2 of the
container have ISO fittings. Extending from the corner 100.2 at the end of the container in a
downwardly and laterally extending direction (relative to the longitudinal axis of the container)
towards the corner post on the opposite end, is a gusset formation 100.31. The gusset
formation 100.31, can be formed by one of several methods and can be like that illustrated in
greater detail in figures 26 and 27, or figures 22 to 25 and 30. In these figures it can be seen
that the gusset formation 100.31 can have a generally triangular shape, with a long sloping
edge 100.311 on an outboard triangular side 100.313 and a short sloping edge 100.312 on an
inboard side 100.314. In the case of figures 16, 17, 22 to 25 and 30, the short sloping edge
100.312 is on a trapezoid shaped component, whereas in the case of figures 26 and 27, short
sloping edge 100.312 is on a triangular shaped component. The edge 100.312, and the surface
of the gusset formation associated therewith, terminates at the upper surface of end beam
104.3. Meanwhile, the long edge 100.311, and the surfaces of the gusset formation associated
with it, terminate along the front face 104.31 of beam 104.3 and extends down to the base of
the face 104.31. The generally triangular shape of the gusset formation 100.31 is welded where
the shape of this gusset formation intersects with the beam 104.3 and the corner 100.2 and the
post 200.

[0165]          As can be seen from figure 27, the gusset formation 100.31 has at its rear side a
generally U-shaped configuration, where the leg of the U-shape which corresponds to the
triangular side 100.313 is greater in length than the triangular side 100.314.
[0166]          The inwardly extending gusset formations 100.31 of figures 16 to 31 are located
at each of the four upper corners 100.2 and it will be noted that these extend inwardly along the
line of the upper rim of the sides 104.1 and 102.1. The gusset formation 100.31 could be
generally described as having a generally triangular shape with a portion having been truncated
therefrom so as to form the shorter edge 100.312 to accommodate the beam 104.3. The gusset
formation 100.31 is preferably formed from sections of shaped or bent steel which have been
appropriately cut so as to be able to provide a weld location.
[0167]          As will be noted in Figure 16, 17 and 32, the lower corners 100.21 and 100.22
each have two regular triangular or prism like gusset formation 100.40, 100.41. The gusset
formation 100.40 extends laterally (relative to the longitudinal axis of the container) along the
face of the end and is welded to the lower beam 104.32. Whereas the gusset formations
100.41 extend longitudinally from the lower corners 100.21 towards the opposite end of the
container along the longitudinal side. The gusset formations 100.40 and 100.41 are illustrated in
a rear perspective view in figure 28 and they have a generally U-shaped configuration from the
rear, where the legs of the U are of approximately equal length. Like the gusset formation
100.31 of other figures, the gusset formations 100.40, 100.41 are formed of two triangular sides
and a rectangular joining piece. These can be formed by fabrication or by cutting at appropriate
angles, a square or rectangular hollow section or alternatively they can be formed from a flat
sheet metal piece, and bent into the shape required.
[0168]          Illustrated in Figures 22 to 25 and 30, is an example of a gusset formation as
used on the corners of the container 1100 of figures 16 and 17. The gusset formation 100.31 is
formed from a triangular outboard side 100.313, which is cut from steel plate having a thickness
of approximately 20 mm, and is welded to the inboard side of corner 100.2 and post 200, also to
the front surface of beam 104.3, and to the cross piece 100.111. The inboard side plate
100.314 is also made from steel plate of approximately 20 mm in thickness and has a generally
trapezoid shape and is welded to the top of beam 104.3, cross pieces 100.111 and the sides of
corner 100.2 and post 200.
[0169]          As is best viewed in figures 22, 25 and 16, it can be seen that the location of
beams 104.3 and 104.4 is that they do not sit within the dimensions or width of the post 200 and
the corners 100.2. This makes the inboard edge or side of the beam 104.3 provide an upper rim
and the front and rear ends of the container 1100, which is inset from the posts 200 and corners
100.2. This inset provides the container 1100 with the ability to be engaged by a tippler
apparatus 31.330 as illustrated in figure 31, so that when the container 1100 is inverted, i.e.

 rotated through 180 degrees, the structure 31.333 of the tippler which engages the corners
 100.2 to the container 1100, as illustrated in figure 31, will not be contacted by the contents of
the container as these contents fall out of the container. Further, as the gussets extend along
the end rails laterally of the longitudinal axis, the contents which pour over the longitudinal rails,
will not fall onto the corner castings, gussets or fitting, thus ensuring all contents get delivered
 and not inadvertently caught up or lodged onto the container or the tippler structure. The tippler
 apparatus is described in more detail herein.
 [0170]           The inboard edge or surface of the lower beam 104.4 is located a further
distance from the corner 100.2 or post 200 by a greater distance than is the inboard edge or
surface of the upper beam 104.3. This difference in distance of extension into the confines of
the container, provides the 2 degrees of taper on the end walls 104.1 and 102.1, as is
evidenced by the tapered structure of the vertical ribs on the front end 102.1 in figure 16.
 [0171]           Illustrated in figures 18 to 21, are various views of a lid 400 for use with the
container 1100 of figures 16 and 17. The lid 400 includes two centre located lock formations
401, into which can be received lift members, such as lifting hooks or the twist lock
mechanisms, associated with the lid lifting means on a tippler, as described below. The
formations 401 include a housing 401.1 in which is rotatably located a plate 407 which will
receive in an obround aperture 408 the twist lock members of a lid lifter. As is illustrated in
figure 33, three locations on the rotatable plate 407 have a pin connection 409 to respective
pivoting links 409.1 which in turn are pivotally connected to locking rods 402 by pins 409.2. The
rods 402 radiate out from the formations 401 to engage apertured locking plates 403 on the end
and side rims of the container at respective ends of the container as is illustrated in figures 16
and 21. By the action of twist locks locking onto the formations 401 and engaging apertures
408, the lid lifting device will rotate the twist lock in a first direction thereby moving the locking
rods 402 to an unlocked condition, and because the twist locks have engaged formation 401,
the lid is unlocked and can be lifted off the container. Whereas rotation in a direction to
disengage the twist locks from the formations 401, will cause the lock rods to move to a locked
condition on the container, whereby the lid is locked onto the container and the lid lifting device
can move to the next container.
[0172]           As is visible in figures 18 and 21, the lid 400 includes lateral beams 405 through
which the longitudinally oriented lock rods 402 pass in the forward and rearward directions. The
lateral beams 405 help support the sheet metal (removed for purpose of illustration in figure 21)
of the lid 400. Additional lockdown locks 406 can also be provided so that after the container is
filled, the lid 400 can be secured by padlocks or the like, to prevent unauthorised access to the
container or unlocking of the lid 400 from the container. Further, such lockdown locks 406 also
provide a manually operated lid securing system if needed. Also as the lockdown locks 406 are

operated from the side of the container which does not require operators to climb on top of the
lid.
[0173]           As illustrated in Figure 16 and 17 the upper corners 100.2 can have directly
below them, on the containers long sides, an L-shaped flat reinforcing plate (similar to plate
100.32 of Figure 13) with the L-shaped reinforcing plate 100.321 helping to brace, by means of
a relatively low profile the upper beam to the post and corner of the container.
[0174]           Illustrated in figures 34 to 36 is an open container 13.12 having four ISO fittings
at its upper corners allowing the container to be lifted by a crane which will have similarly
located twist locks so as to lock onto the container 13.10.
[0175]           Covering the opening of the container 13.10 is a lid 13.20 which has two lifting
systems thereon. The first are two lateral channels 13.24 into which tynes of a fork lift can be
received so as to lift or position the lid 13.20, if required.
[0176]           The second system is four spaced aperture formations 13.26 attached to the lid
13.20. The aperture formations are located close to the tyne channels 13.24. The aperture
formations 13.26 are generally box shaped like an ISO fitting and have an obround aperture
13.27 in them as is illustrated in Figure 35. The lid 13.20 substantially covers the opening of the
container 13.10, as can be seen at the corners a small opening is apparent and this opening
allows for ventilation as well as an observation hole through which handlers can check the
contents of the closed container 13.10.
[0177]           The side sectional views of figures 37 and 38, and plan view of figures 39 and
39A illustrate in more detail the locking arrangement. The lock arrangement has a rotating
striker plate 13.36 which is attached to or integrally formed with a casting 13.30 located in the
aperture formation 13.24. A twist lock 13.40, mounted on a lifting means, can enter through the
obround aperture 13.27. With the casting 13.30, which has a longitudinal axis like the twist lock
13.40 and the obround hole 13.27, all longitudinal axes being oriented in the same orientation,
that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the container, then the twist lock 13.40 can be inserted
through the hole 13.27 and into casting 13.30. At this point in time, the striker plate 13.36 would
be in the locked conditions of figure 39 and figure 38. By the twist lock 13.40 being rotated 90
degrees, in a clock wise direction relative to figure 39, as seen in figure 39A, the striker plate
13.36 will rotate through 90 degrees as well as the casting 13.30. The twist lock can be rotated
through 90 degrees by hydraulic or other means, or could be rotated by semi-automatic twist
lock mechanisms which rotate by themselves when forced to engage obround apertures in ISO
fittings.
[0178]           In figures 38, 39 and 39A it can be seen that the container has a biased latch
13.42, which pivots around pivoting mounting 13.44. The end of the striker plate 13.36 is caught

under an overhang of the latch 13.42. If desired to be manually released, the operator can
simply rotate the lower section of the lever of the latch 13.42 towards the container 13.10, and
this will allow the end of the striker plate 13.36 to be cleared for upward movement past the
overhang of latch 13.42.
[0179]          The rotation of the twist lock 13.40 to the direction it is shown in between figures
39 and 39A, would mean the striker plate 13.36 is disengaged from the latch 13.42, and at the
same time the twist lock 13.40 will be locked into the aperture formation 13.26, allowing
retraction of the twist lock 13.40 thus lifting the lid from the container.
[0180]           Due to the vibrations encountered during transport, the casting 13.30 can be
provided, as illustrated in figures 38, 39 and 39A, with biased pin 13.32 which is mounted for
movement with the casting 13.30. The biased pin 13.32 engages a side offset pin 13.34, which
is able to pass through a hole in a stationary lock member 13.37 which is attached to the inside
of the aperture formation 13.26. Thus, with the casting 13.30 and the striker plate 13.36 in the
locked condition of figures 38 and 39, and no twist lock 13.40 located in the casting 13.30, the
upper portion of pin 13.32 will protrude into the cavity of the casting 13.30. In this condition the
side pin 13.34 is also located in the hole in the stationary lock member 13.37, which will prevent
accidental rotation of the striker plate 13.36 during transport or due to vibration. By the insertion
of the twist lock 13.40 into the casting 13.30, the pin 13.32 is moved against its bias, in this case
a spring, and the side pin 13.34 is simultaneously moved out of engagement with the hole in the
lock member 13.37. At this point the pin 13.32, the casting 13.30 and striker plate 13.36 are all
free to rotate when the twist lock 13.40 is rotated to its locked condition. Thus by connecting up
the twist locks 13.40, the lid 13.20 is also simultaneously unlocked from the container 13.10.
[0181]          By biasing the rotation of the casting 13.30, and if a member extended from the
casting 13.30 into the tyne or fork lift channel 13.24, the action of inserting a fork lift tyne into the
channel 13.24 can be made to unlock the lid from the container. However, a member which
works in one direction and a second member which works in another direction might be required
to achieve this.
[0182]          Illustrated in Figure 40 is an alternative lock mechanism to that of figures 37, 38,
39, and 39A. In the lock mechanism of figure 40, an aperture formation 13.26 is provided on the
lid 13.20, with an aperture 13.27 in the top of the formation 13.26, and an aperture 13.27A in the
under surface of the formation 13.26. Further on the container rim, is positioned or welded a
semi-auto twist lock 13.41, so that with the twist lock 13.41 and obround hole 13.27A have their
longitudinal axes aligned, the downward motion of the lid 13.20, relative to the container 13.10,
will mean that the lid 13.20 will be automatically locked to the container 13.10 because the twist
lock 13.41 will have rotated to the locked condition. Inside the formation 13.26 is dual sided
casting 13.31, with the upper twist lock receiver being at approx 90 degrees to the lower twist
                                                    10

lock receiver. When the lid is positioned onto the container, the upper casting will be forced to
rotate to release the twist lock 13.40, due to the force provided by the twist lock 13.41 rotating
the lower portion of the casting 13.31. Thus simultaneously as the lid is locked into position, the
twist lock 13.40 is rotated to the release position. And as soon as the twist lock 13.40
reengages the upper portion of casting 13.31, and is rotated to the locked condition the lower
portion of casting 13.31 will rotate twist lock 13.41 to the unlocked condition allowing the lid
13.20 to be lifted from the container 13.10.
[0183]            Illustrated in figures 48 to 51 and 53 is the container 13.10 and lid 13.20
described above with the twist locks 13.40 being mounted on a lid lifting mechanism which is in
turn mounted to or constructed to be a part of a container lifting means 13.200. The outer ends
of the container lifter 13.200 has twist locks 13.90 located in a downwardly extending condition
so as to engage the obround holes in ISO fittings 13.12 on the upper corners of the container
13.10, as described above.
[0184]            The twist locks 13.40 are located on a single lifting platen 13.101, which is
translated relative to the frame of the container lifter 13.200 by means of hydraulic cylinders
13.102. Before, after or during the engagement of the twist locks 13.90 to the ISO Fittings
13.12, the cylinders 13.102 can be made to independently move the platen 13.101 towards or
away from the lid 13.20 and the aperture formations 13.26.
[0185]            As illustrated in figures 48 to 51, in figure 48 the container lifter 13.200 is moved
into position with the container 13.10, such that the lid lifting platen 13.101 can be moved
independently.
[0186]            As in figure 49, the container can begin to be lifted, while at the same time the lid
lift platen 13.101 is moved towards the lid 13.20, so that twist locks 13.40 can engage the
aperture formations 13.26, as is illustrated in figure 50. As in Figure 51 the lid 13.20 can be
lifted by the retracting of the cylinders 13.102.
[0187]            Figures 48 to 51 and 53 illustrate a rig which can be mounted to a crane, for
moving containers and simultaneously lidding or unlidding them while the container is in motion.
[0188]            Illustrated in figures 41 to 43 and 44 to 47, is an example of the mounting of the
lid lifter 13.100 to a tippler or container rotating lifter 13.300. The difference between the lifter
13.300 and 13.200 of the previously described figures is that the lifter 13.300 is able to invert a
container 13.10 so as to discharge its contents at a desired location.
[0189]            In the lifter 13.300 of figures 41 to 47, the lid lifter 13.100 is similar to that
described previously, except that as the container 13.10 is now to be rotated, the lid lifter 13.100
needs to lift the lid 13.20 so that it is clear of the rotation envelope of the container 13.10, as
illustrated in figure 46 and 52.
                                                    20

  [0190]          By the lifting systems 13.100, 13.200 and 13.300 it will be readily seen that a
  more time effective method of handling an open container can be achieved wherein the lifting
 device is controlled so as to lift the container and the lid, or lift the container and lift the lid from
 said container; or to lift just the lid from the container.
 [0191]           It will also be understood that the lifting of the container and the lid, or lifting the
 container and lifting the lid from the container, can be performed sequentially or in a more time
 effective manner this can be done simultaneously.
 [0192]           Prior to rotating the container as discussed above, the lid is lifted off the
 container and transported'to a location, relative to the container, outside of a rotation envelope
 of the container.
 [0193]          While the above has twist locks 13.40 and 13.90 on relatively rigid frames and
 systems for mounting to complex installations, it will be understood that the twist locks could be
 cable mounted and made to be part of lifting frames and the like.
 [0194]          While the above described embodiment have 4 twist locks 13.40 and 4 aperture
 formations 13.26, it will be understood that the invention can be exercised with 1, 2, 3 or 4 sets
 of twist locks and aperture formations.
 [0195]          Illustrated in figures 54 to 56 is an alternative lid locking and lifting arrangement
 to the ones described above.
 [0196]          The lid locking and lifting arrangement illustrated in figures 54 to 56 has an
 apertured lifting housing 401 which is attached to an upper surface of a lid 400, and has side
walls 401.1 and an upper side 408.1 in which an aperture 408 is located in the generally
 horizontal upper side 408.1. Like the previous embodiments illustrated in Figures 18 to 21, 33,
 37 to 39, or 40 the aperture 408 is accessed by a downward motion of a descending twist lock
 13.40 or similar device, which is mounted on a lid lifting assembly. The downward motion is
generally parallel to the lifting direction of the lid and or container which is in the opposite
direction.
[0197]           The housing 401 is attached to the upper surface of the lid 400 by appropriate
means such as welding and is located adjacent a pair of flanges 456 mounted to the lid 400, or
to a plate on which the housing 401 and flanges 456 can be mounted. The flanges 456 provide
a yoke for an axle or pivot 456.1 associated with latch 458 which is pivotally attached to the lid
400.
[0198]           The lid 400 in this embodiment includes a peripheral channel 450, which
provides two downwardly extending spaced apart flanges to allow the lid 400 to seal relative to
the upper cuneiform cross sectioned rim 454 which is welded to the upper rail 452 of the
container.
                                                     21

 [0199]           The latch 458 includes a lever portion 460 which is angled at approximately 30
 degrees to the direction of extension of the horizontal portion of latch 458 and a downwardly
 extending section 462 on the end of which is a hook or lock portion 464 which has an upper
 edge 464.2 which will engage the underneath edge or surface of the rail 452 when in the
 condition is illustrated in figure 54 the lid 400 is locked to the container rail 452 and cannot be
 removed therefrom. The hook portion 464 also has a tapered or inclined portion 464.1 and a
 rounded end 464.2, which if the lock were in the closed condition when a lid 400 were placed
 onto a container, the engagement of the end 464.3 and surface 464.1 with the upper cuneiform
 cross sectioned rim 454, will cause the latch 458 to move to the open condition and track
 around the outer surface of the upper rail 452, until the hook portion 464 clears the under
surface 466 of the rail 452, where by gravity will urge the hook portion 464 to move under the
 rail 452, and thereby lock to prevent upward movement of the lid 400 relative to the rail 452.
 [0200]           As the mass of the latch 458 on the outboard side of the pivot is much greater
than the mass of the lever portion 460 the latch 458 will remain in a generally locked condition.
This mass is further supplemented by the mass of a generally horizontal handle 458.1 which
also allows the locking system of figures 54 to 56 to be manually opened where required. If
required additional biasing by means of torsion springs, compression springs, tension springs
etc could be utilised with the embodiment of figures 54 to 56.
[0201]            When a twist lock or lock member 13.40 mounted on a lifting means is passed
downwardly into and through the aperture 408 by the head 13.401 being aligned with the
direction of the elongated aperture 408, the head 13.401 will pass through the aperture 408 and
the underneath thereof will engage the lever portion 460. Continued movement of the head
 13.401 in a downward direction will rotate the portion 460 in a downward direction, or direction
towards the lid 400, thus causing the lock portion 464 of the latch to be rotated out of
engagement with the underneath of the rail 452, as is illustrated in the figure 55. When the
head 13.401 is rotated through 90 degrees and thus cannot escape from the housing for 401,
which maintains while it rotates the lever in its depressed condition (keeping the lock open)
retraction of the head 13.401 in a vertical direction will cause the lid 400 to move with housing
401 as the upper faces of the head 13.401 will engage the underside surfaces of the upper
plate 408.1. It will be noted that as the head 13.401 is rotated through 90 degrees the lever
portion 460 is maintained in a depressed condition thereby maintaining the lock portion 464 in a
location which is clear of the bottom of the rail 452.
[0202]            It is envisaged that a lid 400 may have a multiple number of the locking system of
figures 54 to 56 with the lid lifting device also having an equal number of such twist lock heads
13.401.
                                                   22

  [0203]          To replace the lid after the lid has been lifted by the lid lifting device, the lid is
  lowered back on to the container until the channel 450 engages the upper edge 454 of the rail
 452. Once in position, the twist lock head 13.401 is rotated so as to align the longitudinal axis of
 the head 13.401 with the longitudinal axis of the aperture 408 and in this condition to then
 withdraw the head 13.401 through the aperture 408 in an upward direction. This causes the
 latch 458 to move from the position of figures 55 and 56 back to the condition illustrated in
 figure 54 whereby the lock portion 464 is relocated underneath the underneath edge of the rail
 452.
 [0204]           The lever portion 460 is illustrated in a relatively simple form in figures 54 to 56. It
 may be additionally useful that it be constructed with a plate on its end which is of closer width
 to that of the housing 401, or made of greater thickness, so that as the lock member 13.401 is
 rotated, there will be little or no risk that the member 13.401 might become disengaged from the
 lever 460.
 [0205]           The lid lifting systems described above enable the lid lift member to engage
 apertured formations 401 to:
 [0206]           1.       simultaneously lock the lid lift member to the apertured formation and to
 unlock the lid from the container (the embodiments of figures 37 to 40);
 [0207]           2.       sequentially unlock the lid from the container and then lock the lid lift
 member to the apertured formation (the embodiment of figures 54 to 56); or
 [0208]           3.       sequentially lock the lid lift member to the apertured formation then unlock
the lid from the container (embodiment of figures 18 and 33).
 [0209]           Illustrated in figures 57 to 62 is another gusset formation which is similar to that
of figures 30, and 22 to 25, and like parts have been like numbered. The arrangement of figures
57 to 62, differs from the earlier described arrangement, in that the lower edge of the gusset
member 100.313, does not extend down the front face 104.31 of end top rail 104.3. Further by
the member 100.111 being of lesser width in the embodiment of figures 57 to 62, the lower end
of the member 100.313 does not extend past the forward end of the end top rail 104.3.
However, like the embodiment of figures 30, and 22 to 25, the trapezium shaped gusset
member 100.314 is welded to the face of the corner post 100.2 which faces the other end of the
container down the longitudinal side, that is, it is welded to the face of the corner post 100.2
which is directly above the longitudinal side rail 102.1. With all the edges of the gusset formation
being welded to the corner post 100.2, the end top rail 104.3 and the longitudinal top rail 102.1
in the case of part of the lower edge of the member 100.314, and with the resulting gusset
formations on the ends 104 of the container extending towards each other, the container's
gusseting does not interfere with the tipping of the container contents over the longitudinal edge
                                                      23

of the container, that is the gusset formations do not stop product from tipping out, and further,
due to the inclined nature of the gusset member 100.111, this inclined surface assists product
to pass over the gusset formation.
[0210]           Where ever it is used, the word "comprising" is to be understood in its "open"
sense, that is, in the sense of "including", and thus not limited to its "closed" sense, that is the
sense of "consisting only of'. A corresponding meaning is to be attributed to the corresponding
words "comprise", "comprised" and "comprises" where they appear.
[0211]           It will be understood that the invention disclosed and defined herein extends to all
alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features mentioned or evident from the
text. All of these different combinations constitute various alternative aspects of the invention.
[0212]           While particular embodiments of this invention have been described, it will be
evident to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be embodied in other specific
forms without departing from the essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiments
and examples are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive,
and all modifications which would be obvious to those skilled in the art are therefore intended to
be embraced therein.
