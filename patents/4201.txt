Description
A mattress that can be transformed into a variety of different shapes and
sizes. This has been achieved by dividing the mattress into parts and then
placing those parts (in various sizes and shapes) into a single mattress
cover that can accommodate for the varying sizes and shapes and enclose
those parts to produce a single mattress effect.

Design
    -  The customer will purchase a mattress which is divided into parts and
       a variety of different mattress covers which are produced in different
       sizes and shapes.
    -  As the customer transforms the shape and use of their furniture, they
       will also then use whatever the necessary parts of the mattress are
       and the matching mattress cover to accommodate for that shape and
       use.
    -  This will then provide the customer with a single mattress as the parts
       will be enclosed in a single mattress cover and not be moveable or
       visible as a divided mattress.
    -  The 3 in 1 Smart Mattress comes in 3 parts but you will only ever see
       and feel a complete mattress for your baby
    -  The bassinet and crib both have a non toxic, breathable & generously
       padded mattress cover to insert your mattress parts into to create a
       fully enclosed single mattress.
    -  Breathable, smart and safe - you can have it all with the Cocoon Nest
