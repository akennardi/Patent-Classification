                                 SMOOTH AND BULKY TISSUE
                                          BACKGROUND
            For rolled tissue products, such as bathroom tissue and paper towels, consumers
   generally prefer firm rolls having a large diameter. A firm roll conveys superior product
 5 quality and a large diameter conveys sufficient material to provide value for the consumer.
   From the standpoint of the tissue manufacturer, however, providing a firm roll having a
   large diameter is a challenge. In order to provide a large diameter roll, while maintaining
   an acceptable cost of manufacture, the tissue manufacturer must produce a finished tissue
   roll having higher roll bulk. One means of increasing roll bulk is to wind the tissue roll
10 loosely. Loosely wound rolls however, have low firmness and are easily deformed, which
   makes them unappealing to consumers. As such, there is a need for tissue rolls having high
   bulk as well as good firmness.
            Furthermore, it is desirable to provide a rolled tissue product having a high-basis
   weight tissue sheet that is also soft. To provide a tissue product that is perceived as being
15 soft, the tissue manufacturer is faced with a myriad of choices, including altering the
   surface topography of the tissue product so that its user perceives it as being smooth.
            Although it is desirable to provide a sheet having high-basis-weight, bulk, good roll
   firmness, and a smooth surface, improvement of one of these properties typically comes at
   the expense of another. For example, as the basis weight of the tissue sheets is increased,
20 achieving high roll bulk becomes more challenging, particularly when manufacturing
   uncreped through-air dried webs since much of the bulk of the tissue structure is achieved
   by molding of the embryonic tissue web into the paper-making fabric and this bulk is
   decreased by increasing the basis weight of the sheet. Hence the tissue manufacturer must
   strive to economically produce a tissue roll that meets these often-contradictory parameters
25 of large diameter, good firmness, high quality sheets and acceptable cost.
                                             SUMMARY

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           Bulk is an important property for the absorption capacity and hand-feel of tissue
   webs and products. Increasing the bulk of tissue webs and products, however, often comes
30 at the expense of other properties such as surface smoothness. Traditionally the tissue
                                                 5

   maker has needed to resort to high topography papermaking fabrics to achieve high bulk.
   While increasing the caliper of the tissue web at a given basis weight, and therefore the
   sheet bulk, the use of high topography fabrics often impart the web with a three
   dimensional surface that is not particularly smooth.
 5          The present inventors have now surprisingly discovered that certain papermaking
   fabrics and in particular through-air drying fabrics having patterns topically disposed
   thereon may be used to produce tissue webs and products that are both smooth and have
   high bulk. Accordingly, in certain embodiments the present disclosure provides a tissue
   web having a sheet bulk greater than about 12 cubic centimeters per gram (cc/g), such as
10 from about 12 to about 20 cc/g, and a Surface Smoothness S90 value less than about 105
   gin. In other embodiments the disclosure provides rolled tissue products formed by spirally
   winding tissue webs where the rolled tissue products have improved roll bulk, such as
   greater than about 14 cc/g, and improved Roll Firmness, such as from about 8 to about
   10 mm.
15          In accordance with certain embodiments, high bulk tissue webs are manufactured
   using an endless papermaking belt, such as a through-air drying (TAD) fabric, having a
   three dimensional pattern disposed thereon. Preferably the three dimensional pattern is
   disposed on the web contacting surface for cooperating with, and structuring of, the wet
   fibrous web during manufacturing. In a particularly preferred embodiment the web
20 contacting three-dimensional structure comprises a plurality of elevations distributed across
   the web-contacting surface of the belt and together constituting from about 15 to about 35
   percent, in a particularly preferred embodiment from about 18 to about 30 percent, and in a
   particularly preferred embodiment about 20 to about 25 percent of the web-contacting
   surface.
25          In addition to elevations, the web-contacting surface preferably comprises a
   plurality of continuous landing areas between the elevations. The landing areas are
   bounded by the elevations and coextensive with the top surface plane of the belt.
            Each elevation has a first dimension in a first direction (x) in the plane of the top
   surface area, a second dimension in a second direction (y) in the plane of the top surface
30 area, the first and second directions (x, y) being at right angles to each other, a mean height
   (h) and an area (a) as measured in the plane of the top surface area, these dimensions being
   defined when the belt is in an uncompressed state.
                                                   6

            One belt for manufacturing a high bulk tissue according to the present disclosure is
   illustrated in FIG. 1, in one embodiment the endless belt 10 has two principal elements: a
   carrier structure 30 and three dimensional design elements 40 (also referred to herein as
   "elevations"). The carrier structure 30 has two opposed surfaces - a tissue contacting
 5 surface 50 and a machine contacting surface. Generally the design elements 40 are
   disposed on the tissue contacting surface 50. When the belt 10 comprises a through-air
   drying fabric the tissue contacting surface 50 supports the embryonic tissue web, while the
   opposite surface, the machine contacting surface, contacts the throughdryer.
            The carrier structure 30 has two principle dimensions - a machine direction
10 ("MD"), which is the direction within the plane of the belt 10 parallel to the principal
   direction of travel of the tissue web during manufacture and a cross-machine direction
   ("CD"), which is generally orthogonal to the machine direction.
            The carrier structure is preferably a woven fabric, and in a particularly preferred
   embodiment a substantially planar woven fabric such as a multi-layered plain-woven fabric
15 30 having base warp yarns 32 interwoven with shute yarns 34 in a 1xi plain weave pattern.
   An exemplary multi-layered fabric is disclosed in US Patent No. 8,141,595, the contents of
   which are incorporated herein in a manner consistent with the present disclosure. In the
   fabric 30, the plain-weave load-bearing layer is constructed so that the highest points of
   both the load-bearing shutes 34 and the load-bearing warps 32 are coplanar and coincident
20 with the plane 70.
            As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, the design elements 40 are joined to the carrier
   structure 30 and extend outwardly from the paper contacting side 50 thereof in the
   Z-direction. Generally the design elements 40 are topically applied to the carrier structure
   30. Particularly suitable methods of topical application are printing or extruding polymeric
25 material onto the surface. Alternative methods include applying cast or cured films,
   weaving, embroidering or stitching polymeric fibers into the surface to a design element.
   Particularly suitable polymeric materials include materials that can be strongly adhered to
   carrier structure and are resistant to thermal degradation at typical tissue machine dryer
   operating    conditions   and are reasonably flexible,      such as silicones, polyesters,
30 polyurethanes, epoxies, polyphenylsulfides and polyetherketones.
            The design element 40 extends in the Z-direction (generally orthogonal both the
   machine direction and cross-machine direction) above the plane 70 of the carrier structure
                                                  7

   30. The design elements 40 may have straight sidewalls or tapered sidewalls, and be made
   of any material suitable to withstand the temperatures, pressures, and deformations which
   occur during the papermaking process. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the design elements 40 are
   similarly sized and have generally straight, parallel sidewalls 42, providing the elements 40
 5 with a width (w), and a height (h). For the embodiments described herein, the design
   elements 40 preferably have a height between 0.6 and 3.0 mm, preferably between 0.7 and
   1.4 mm, and in a particularly preferred embodiment between 0.8 and 1.0 mm. The height
   (h) is generally measured as the distance between the plane of the carrier structure and the
   top plane of the elevations.
10         In addition to having a height (h), the elevations 40 have a width (w). The width is
   measured generally normal to the principal dimension of the elevation 40 within the plane
   of the belt 10 at a given location. Where the element 40 has a generally square or
   rectangular cross section, the width (w) is generally measured as the distance between the
   two planar sidewalls 42, 44 that form the element 40. In those cases where the element
15 does not have planar sidewalls, the width is measured at the point where the element 40
   contacts the carrier 30.
           Generally, for the embodiments described herein, the design elements 40 have a
   width from about 0.6 to 3.1 mm, in a particularly preferred embodiment from about 0.7 to
   about 1.5 mm, and still more preferably from about 0.8 to about 1.1 mm.
20         In a particularly preferred embodiment the design elements 40 preferably have
   planar sidewalls 42, 44 such that the cross section of the design element has an overall
   square or rectangular shape. However, it is to be understood that the design element may
   have other cross sectional shapes, such as triangular, convex or concave, which may also
   be useful in producing high bulk tissue products according to the present disclosure.
25 Accordingly, in a particularly preferred embodiment the design elements 40 preferably
   have planar sidewalls 42, 44 and a square cross section where the width (w) and height (h)
   are equal and vary from about 0.6 to about 3.0 mm, in a particularly preferred embodiment
   from about 0.7 to about 1.4 mm and still more preferably from about 0.8 to about 1.0 mm.
           With further reference to FIG. 2, a preferred embodiment illustrating the spacing
30 and arrangement of elevations 40 is illustrated. Generally, none of the elevations 40
   intersect one another and preferably are arranged parallel to one another. As such, in the
                                                  8

   illustrated embodiment, the adjacent sidewalls of individual design elements are equally
   spaced apart from one another.
            For the embodiments described herein, the center-to-center spacing of design
   elements (also referred to herein as pitch or simply as p) is from about 1.7 to about 20 mm
 5 apart, such as from about 2.0 to about 10 mm apart, and in a particularly preferred
   embodiment from about 3.8 to about 4.4 mm apart, in a direction generally orthogonal to
   such surfaces. This spacing will result in a tissue web which generates maximum caliper
   when made of conventional cellulosic fibers. Further, this arrangement provides a tissue
   web having three dimensional surface topography, yet relatively uniform density.
10          As further illustrated in FIG. 2, the design elements 40 may occur as wave-like
   patterns that are arranged in-phase with one another such that p is approximately constant.
   In other embodiments design elements may form a wave pattern where adjacent design
   elements are offset from one another. Regardless of the particular design element pattern,
   or whether adjacent patterns are in or out of phase with one another, the design elements
15 are separated from one another by some minimal distance. Preferably the distance between
   design elements 40 is greater than 0.7 mm and in a particularly preferred embodiment
   greater than about 1.0 mm and still more preferably greater than about 2.0 mm such as
   from about 2.0 to about 6.0 mm and still more preferably from about 3.0 to about 4.5 mm.
            Where the design elements 40 are wave-like, such as those illustrated in FIG. 1, the
20 design elements have an amplitude (A) and a wavelength (L). The amplitude may range
   from about 2.0 to about 200 mm, in a particularly preferred embodiment from about 10 to
   about 40 mm and still more preferably from about 18 to about 22 mm. Similarly, the
   wavelength may range from about 20 to about 500 mm, in a particularly preferred
   embodiment from about 50 to about 200 mm and still more preferably from about 80 to
25 about 120 mm.
            Preferably a plurality of design elements are disposed on the carrier structure and
   extend substantially throughout one dimension thereof, and each element in the plurality is
   spaced apart from adjacent elements. In this manner the elements may span the entire
   cross-machine direction of the belt and may endlessly encircle the belt in the machine
30 direction. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the elements 40 are oriented substantially
   parallel to the machine direction of the belt 10.
                                                  9

            The polymeric material, or other material used to form the design elements 40, may
   be applied and joined to the carrier structure in any suitable manner. One manner of
   attachment and joining the design element onto the carrier structure is described in
   US Application No. 10/535,537, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference
 5 in a manner consistent with the present disclosure. Thus, in a particularly preferred
   embodiment, the design element is formed by extruding or printing a polymeric material
   onto the carrier structure. In other embodiments the design element may be produced, at
   least in some regions, by extruding two or more polymeric materials. Suitable polymer
   materials include silicones, polyesters, polyurethanes, epoxies, polyphenylsulfides and
10 polyetherketones.
            In addition to the design elements 40 the belt 10 further comprises landing areas 60,
   which are bounded by the design elements 40. The landing areas 60 allow water to be
   removed from the web by the application of differential fluid pressure, by evaporative
   mechanisms, or both when drying air passes through the web while on the belt 10 or a
15 vacuum is applied through the belt 10.
            The arrangement of design elements 40 and landing areas 60 yield a papermaking
   fabric having a three dimensional surface topography, which when used to form a tissue
   web, produces a web having relatively uniform density, yet three dimensional surface
   topography. The resulting web further has improved bulk, better softness, and improved
20 surface smoothness compared to webs and products made according to the prior art.
   Similarly, rolled products prepared according to the present disclosure may have improved
   roll firmness and bulk, while still maintaining Surface Smoothness and strength properties.
            For example, the present disclosure provides single-ply tissue products having
   improved caliper and bulk compared to commercially available single-ply tissue products,
25 while also having decreased stiffness. These improvements translate into improved rolled
   products, as summarized in Table 1, below.

           Accordingly, in certain embodiments, rolled tissue products may comprise a
   spirally wound single-ply or multi-ply (such as two, three or four plies) tissue web having a
   basis weight greater than about 35 gsm, such as from about 35 to about 60 gsm and in a
 5 particularly preferred embodiment from about 38 to about 50 gsm.
           Rolled tissue products comprising a spirally wound single-ply tissue web generally
   have a Roll Firmness less than about 10 mm, such as from about 7 to about 10 mm and in a
   particularly preferred embodiment from about 8 to about 9 mm. In one particular
   embodiment, for instance, the disclosure provides a rolled tissue product comprising a
10 spirally wound single-ply tissue web having a basis weight from about 35 to about 50 gsm,
   wherein the roll has a Roll Firmness from about 8 to about 10 mm. Within the above-roll
   firmness ranges, rolls made according to the present disclosure do not appear to be overly
   soft and "mushy" as may be undesirable by some consumers during some applications.
           In the past, at the above-roll firmness levels, spirally wound tissue products had a
15 tendency to have low roll bulks and/or poor sheet softness properties. However, it has now
   been discovered that rolled tissue products having a firmness from about 7 to about 10 mm
   and comprising single-ply webs having basis weights greater than about 35 gsm can be
   produced such that the product has a roll bulk of greater than 10 cc/g, such as from about
   10 to about 20 cc/g, and in a particularly preferred embodiment from about 14 to about 18
20 cc/g, even when spirally wound under tension. For instance, spirally wound products
   comprising a single-ply web having a basis weight from about 35 to about 50 gsm may
                                                   11

   have a roll bulk of greater than 12 cc/g while still maintaining a firmness of less than about
   10 mm, such as from about 8 to about 10 mm.
           To produce rolled products having satisfactory roll bulk and firmness, the tissue
   web itself preferably has improved sheet bulk. For example, single-ply base sheets
 5 prepared as described herein may be converted to rolled tissue product while still
   maintaining much of their sheet bulk, which is preferably greater than about 12 cc/g, such
   as from about 12 to about 20 cc/g and in a particularly preferred embodiment from about
   14 to about 18 cc/g. In this manner base sheets may be subjected to calendering or the like
   to soften the web while still maintaining a sufficient amount of sheet bulk.
10         While having improved properties, the tissue webs prepared according to the
   present disclosure continue to be strong enough to withstand use by a consumer. For
   example, tissue webs prepared according to the present disclosure may have a geometric
   mean tensile (GMT) greater than about 700 g/3", such as from about 800 to about
   1500 g/3", and in a particularly preferred embodiment from about 900 to about 1200 g/3".
15 When the tissue webs of the present disclosure are converted into rolled tissue products,
   they maintain a significant amount of their tensile strength, such that the decrease in
   geometric mean tensile during conversion of the web to finished product is less than about
   30 percent and in a particularly preferred embodiment less than about 25 percent, such as
   from about 10 to about 30 percent. As such the finished products preferably have a
20 geometric mean tensile strength of greater than 700 g/3", such as from about 800 to about
   1200 g/3", and in a particularly preferred embodiment from about 900 to about 1100 g/3".
           In still other embodiments, the present disclosure provides tissue webs having
   enhanced bulk, softness and durability. Improved durability, such as increased machine and
   cross-machine direction stretch (MDS and CDS), and improved softness may be measured
25 as a reduction in the slope of the tensile-strain curve or the Stiffness Index. For example,
   tissue webs prepared as described herein generally have a geometric mean slope less than
   about 6,000 g/3", such as from about 4,000 to about 6,000 g/3", and in a particularly
   preferred embodiment from about 4,200 to about 5,000 g/3". Single-ply webs spirally
   wound into rolled products generally have a geometric mean slope less than about 10,000
30 g/3", such as from about 3,000 to about 9,000 g/3" and in a particularly preferred
   embodiment from about 4,000 to about 8,000 g/3". Two-ply webs spirally wound into
                                                 12

   rolled products generally have a geometric mean slope less than about 9,000 g/3", such as
   from about 4,000 to about 8,000 g/3".
           While the tissue webs of the present disclosure generally have lower geometric
   mean slopes compared to webs of the prior art, the webs maintain a sufficient amount of
 5 tensile strength to remain useful to the consumer. In this manner the disclosure provides
   base sheet and tissue products having a low Stiffness Index. For example, tissue webs
   preferably have a Stiffness Index less than about 8.0, such as from about 5.0 to about 7.0
   and in a particularly preferred embodiment from about 4.0 to about 6.5. When converted
   into rolled products the tissue web is often stiffened slightly. However, the amount of
10 stiffness introduced to the inventive webs during conversion is minimal such that single-ply
   tissue products have a Stiffness Index less than about 8.0, such as from about 4.0 to about
   7.0 and in a particularly preferred embodiment from about 5.0 to about 6.5. In a
   particularly preferred embodiment the present disclosure provides a single-ply tissue web
   having a bone dry basis weight greater than about 35 gsm, a Stiffness Index from about 4 to
15 about 8 and a GMT from about 700 to about 1000 g/3".
            Similarly, tissue webs that are converted to finished product, for example by
   calendering or the like, generally have decreased machine and cross-direction stretch (MDS
   and CDS respectively) relative to the base sheet. However, the reduction in CDS and MDS
   is relatively minimal for products prepared according to the present disclosure. For
20 example, in certain embodiments base sheets may have a geometric mean stretch (GMS)
   greater than about 12, such as from about 12 to about 30 and in a particularly preferred
   embodiment from about 16 to about 25 percent. The corresponding finished single-ply
   product preferably has a GMS greater than about 10, such as from about 10 to about 20 and
   in a particularly preferred embodiment from about 14 to about 18 percent.
25         As noted previously, webs prepared as described herein may be converted into
   either single or multi-ply rolled tissue products that have improved properties over the
   prior art. In one embodiment the present disclosure provides a rolled tissue product
   comprising a spirally wound two-ply tissue web, wherein the tissue web has a bone dry
   basis weight greater than about 35 gsm, a sheet bulk greater than about 15 cc/g and a
30 Stiffness Index less than about 7. In a particularly preferred embodiment the rolled product
   has a roll bulk of greater than about 15 cc/g and a Roll Firmness less than about 10 mm,
                                                  13

   such as from about 8 to about 10 mm. For comparative purposes the improved properties of
   multi-ply tissue products are set forth in Table 2, below.

    Sample
            In addition to having improved bulk, stiffness, firmness and the like, tissue webs
 5 and products produced according to the methods set forth herein also have improved tactile
   properties such as improved Surface Smoothness. It is known in the art that the Pacinian
   system of receptors in the human fingertip is most sensitive at a frequency of about 250 Hz
   where vibrations at, or near, 250 Hz are experienced as being rough. Thus, the perception
   of whether the surface of a tissue product is rough or smooth is dependent on the rate at
10 which a user passes their finger over the surface and the wavelength of any surface
   topography on the tissue. For example, if a user passes their fingers over the surface of a
   tissue product at a rate of 4 cm/sec, a surface topography with a wavelength of about 0.16
   mm will be experienced as rough by the Pacinian system.
            Because of the relationship between surface topography and perceived smoothness
15 or roughness, the relative feel of a tissue may be predicted based upon its surface
   topography. Surface topography may be measured using profilometry, for example by the
   Smoothness Test Method set forth below. Profilometry is used to generate a digital image
   of the tissue product surface. The digital image is then filtered using a band pass filter with
   cut off spatial frequencies of 0.095 mm and 0.5 mm to emphasize spatial frequencies
20 experienced as being most rough by the human fingertip. The filtered surface image is then
                                                   14

   analyzed to yield Surface Smoothness values Sa, Sq and S90, where surfaces having lower
   values are generally perceived as being smoother.
           Accordingly, in certain embodiments, tissue products of the current disclosure have
   improved smoothness, such as low Sa, Sq and/or S90 values, while also having improved
 5 sheet caliper and bulk. For example, in one embodiment the disclosure provides a tissue
   product having a Surface Smoothness Sa value less than about 25 gm, an Sq value of less
   than about 35 gm, an S90 value less than about 105 gm and a sheet bulk of greater than 15
   cc/g. In other embodiments the disclosure provides a tissue product having a Surface
   Smoothness Sa value from about 15 to about 25 gm. In other embodiment the disclosure
10 provides a tissue product having a Surface Smoothness Sq value from about 25 to about 40
   gm. In still other embodiments the disclosure provides a tissue product having a Surface
   Smoothness S90 value from about 70 to about 120 gm. A comparison of Surface
   Smoothness properties, as well as other product properties, is set forth in the Table 3,

   tissue product having a caliper greater than about 600 gm, such as from about 600 gm to
   about 1000 gm and a Surface Smoothness S90 value less than about 95 gm, such as from

   15 to about 20 cc/g and a smooth surface, such that Sa is less than about 22 gm, Sq is less

           In other embodiments the disclosure provides a single-ply tissue product having a
   sheet bulk greater than about 15 cc/g, such as from about 15 to about 20 cc/g, and a Surface
   Smoothness S90 value less than about 105 gm, such as from about 70 to about 105 gm.
           In addition to providing the foregoing benefits, it is also believed that by forming a
 5 tissue web using a belt having a carrier structure and a suitably chosen design element that
   nesting may be reduced when the webs are converted into rolled product forms. Reduced
   nesting in-turn improves certain properties, such as bulk and firmness, of the rolled
   product. Typically, nesting arises as a result of using textured through-air drying fabrics,
   which impart the tissue web with valleys and ridges. While these ridges and valleys can
10 provide many benefits to the resulting web, problems sometimes arise when the web is
   converted into final product forms. For example, when webs are converted to rolled
   products, the ridges and valleys of one winding are placed on top of corresponding ridges
   and valleys of the next winding, which causes the roll to become more tightly packed,
   thereby reducing roll bulk (increasing density) and making the winding of the product less
15 consistent and controllable. Thus, in certain embodiments the present disclosure provides
   tissue products comprising a tissue web having a three dimensional design element,
   wherein the design elements reduce nesting of the web when it is converted into a rolled
   product.
           Rolls formed according to the present disclosure generally have higher roll bulk at a
20 given roll firmness. Further, the rolls generally have a surprising degree of interlocking
   between successive wraps of the spirally wound web, improving roll structure at a given
   roll firmness, more specifically allowing less firm rolls to be made without slippage
   between wraps. For example, compared to tissue products produced using a through-air
   drying fabric with an offset seam, rolled tissue products of the present disclosure have
25 reduced nesting and improved roll structure. One measurement reduced nesting and
   improved roll structure, referred to herein as Roll Structure, is the product of Roll Bulk
   (expressed in cc/g) and caliper (express in cm) divided by Firmness (expressed in cm).
   Generally rolled tissue products of the present invention have a Roll Structure greater than
   about 1.0 and in a particularly preferred embodiment greater than about 1.25 and in a
30 particularly preferred embodiment less than about 1.5, such as from about 1.0 to about 2.0
   and in particularly preferred embodiments from about 1.2 to about 1.8. A comparison of

 5         Webs useful in preparing spirally wound tissue products according to the present
   disclosure can vary depending upon the particular application. In general, the webs can be
   made from any suitable type of fiber. For instance, the base web can be made from pulp
   fibers, other natural fibers, synthetic fibers, and the like. Suitable cellulosic fibers for use in
   connection with this invention include secondary (recycled) papermaking fibers and virgin
10 papermaking fibers in all proportions. Such fibers include, without limitation, hardwood
   and softwood fibers as well as nonwoody fibers. Noncellulosic synthetic fibers can also be
   included as a portion of the furnish.
           Tissue webs made in accordance with the present disclosure can be made with a
   homogeneous fiber furnish or can be formed from a stratified fiber furnish producing layers
15 within the single- or multi-ply product. Stratified base webs can be formed using
   equipment known in the art, such as a multi-layered headbox. Both strength and softness of
   the base web can be adjusted as desired through layered tissues, such as those produced
   from stratified headboxes.
           For instance, different fiber furnishes can be used in each layer in order to create a
20 layer with the desired characteristics. For example, layers containing softwood fibers have
   higher tensile strengths than layers containing hardwood fibers. Hardwood fibers, on the
   other hand, can increase the softness of the web. In one embodiment, the single-ply base
   web of the present disclosure includes a first outer layer and a second outer layer
   containing primarily hardwood fibers. The hardwood fibers can be mixed, if desired, with
                                                    17

   paper broke in an amount up to about 10 percent by weight and/or softwood fibers in an
   amount up to about 10 percent by weight. The base web further includes a middle layer
   positioned in between the first outer layer and the second outer layer. The middle layer can
   contain primarily softwood fibers. If desired, other fibers, such as high-yield fibers or
 5 synthetic fibers may be mixed with the softwood fibers in an amount up to about 10 percent
   by weight.
           When constructing a web from a stratified fiber furnish, the relative weight of each
   layer can vary depending upon the particular application. For example, in one embodiment,
   when constructing a web containing three layers, each layer can be from about 15 to about
10 40 percent of the total weight of the web, such as from about 25 to about 35 percent of the
   weight of the web.
           Wet strength resins may be added to the furnish as desired to increase the wet
   strength of the final product. Useful wet strength resins include diethylenetriamine
   (DETA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), epichlorhydrin
15 resin(s), polyamide-epichlorohydrin (PAE), or any combinations thereof, or any resins to
   be considered in these families of resins. Particularly preferred wet strength resins are
   polyamide-epichiorohydrin (PAE) resins. Commonly PAE resins are formed by first
   reacting a polyalkylene polyamine and an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid or dicarboxylic acid
   derivative. A polyaminoamide made from diethylenetriamine and adipic acid or esters of
20 dicarboxylic acid derivatives is most common. The resulting polyaminoamide is then
   reacted with epichlorohydrin. Useful PAE resins are sold under the trade name Kymene@
   (commercially available from Ashland, Inc., Covington, KY).
            Similarly, dry strength resins can be added to the furnish as desired to increase the
   dry strength of the final product. Such dry strength resins include, but are not limited to
25 carboxymethyl      celluloses  (CMC),    any type of starch,      starch  derivatives,  gums,
   polyacrylamide resins, and others as are well known. Commercial suppliers of such resins
   are the same as those that supply the wet strength resins discussed above.
           As described above, the tissue products of the present disclosure can generally be
   formed by any of a variety of papermaking processes known in the art. Preferably the tissue
30 web is formed by through-air drying and can be either creped or uncreped. For example, a
   papermaking process of the present disclosure can utilize adhesive creping, wet creping,
   double creping, embossing, wet-pressing, air pressing, through-air drying, creped through
                                                  18

   air drying, uncreped through-air drying, as well as other steps in forming the paper web.
   Some examples of such techniques are disclosed in US Patent Nos. 5,048,589, 5,399,412,
   5,129,988 and 5,494,554 all of which are incorporated herein in a manner consistent with
   the present disclosure. When forming multi-ply tissue products, the separate plies can be
 5 made from the same process or from different processes as desired.
           Preferably the base web is formed by an uncreped through-air drying process, such
   as the processes described, for example, in US Patent Nos. 5,656,132 and 6,017,417, both
   of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in a manner consistent with the
   present disclosure.
10         In one embodiment the web is formed using a twin wire former having a
   papermaking headbox that injects or deposits a furnish of an aqueous suspension of
   papermaking fibers onto a plurality of forming fabrics, such as the outer forming fabric and
   the inner forming fabric, thereby forming a wet tissue web. The forming process of the
   present disclosure may be any conventional forming process known in the papermaking
15 industry. Such formation processes include, but are not limited to, Fourdriniers, roof
   formers such as suction breast roll formers, and gap formers such as twin wire formers and
   crescent formers.
           The wet tissue web forms on the inner forming fabric as the inner forming fabric
   revolves about a forming roll. The inner forming fabric serves to support and carry the
20 newly-formed wet tissue web downstream in the process as the wet tissue web is partially
   dewatered to a consistency of about 10 percent based on the dry weight of the fibers.
   Additional dewatering of the wet tissue web may be carried out by known paper making
   techniques, such as vacuum suction boxes, while the inner forming fabric supports the wet
   tissue web. The wet tissue web may be additionally dewatered to a consistency of greater
25 than 20 percent, more specifically between about 20 to about 40 percent, and more
   specifically about 20 to about 30 percent.
           The forming fabric can generally be made from any suitable porous material, such
   as metal wires or polymeric filaments. For instance, some suitable fabrics can include, but
   are not limited to, Albany 84M and 94M available from Albany International (Albany, NY)
30 Asten 856, 866, 867, 892, 934, 939, 959, or 937; Asten Synweve Design 274, all of which
   are available from Asten Forming Fabrics, Inc. (Appleton, WI); and Voith 2164 available
   from Voith Fabrics (Appleton, WI).
                                                 19

            The wet web is then transferred from the forming fabric to a transfer fabric while at
   a solids consistency of between about 10 to about 35 percent, and particularly, between
   about 20 to about 30 percent. As used herein, a "transfer fabric" is a fabric that is
   positioned between the forming section and the drying section of the web manufacturing
 5 process.
            Transfer to the transfer fabric may be carried out with the assistance of positive
   and/or negative pressure. For example, in one embodiment, a vacuum shoe can apply
   negative pressure such that the forming fabric and the transfer fabric simultaneously
   converge and diverge at the leading edge of the vacuum slot. Typically, the vacuum shoe
10 supplies pressure at levels between about 10 to about 25 inches of mercury. As stated
   above, the vacuum transfer shoe (negative pressure) can be supplemented or replaced by
   the use of positive pressure from the opposite side of the web to blow the web onto the next
   fabric. In some embodiments, other vacuum shoes can also be used to assist in drawing the
   fibrous web onto the surface of the transfer fabric.
15          Typically, the transfer fabric travels at a slower speed than the forming fabric to
   enhance the MD and CD stretch of the web, which generally refers to the stretch of a web
   in its cross (CD) or machine direction (MD) (expressed as percent elongation at sample
   failure). For example, the relative speed difference between the two fabrics can be from
   about 1 to about 45 percent, in some embodiments from about 5 to about 30 percent, and in
20 some embodiments, from about 15 to about 28 percent. This is commonly referred to as
   "rush transfer". During "rush transfer", many of the bonds of the web are believed to be
   broken, thereby forcing the sheet to bend and fold into the depressions on the surface of the
   transfer fabric. Such molding to the contours of the surface of the transfer fabric may
   increase the MD and CD stretch of the web. Rush transfer from one fabric to another can
25 follow the principles taught in any one of the following patents, US Patent Nos. 5,667,636,
   5,830,321, 4,440,597, 4,551,199, 4,849,054, all of which are hereby incorporated by
   reference herein in a manner consistent with the present disclosure.
            The wet tissue web is then transferred from the transfer fabric to a through-air
   drying fabric. Typically, the transfer fabric travels at approximately the same speed as the
30 through-air drying fabric. However, a second rush transfer may be performed as the web is
   transferred from the transfer fabric to the through-air drying fabric. This rush transfer is
                                                  20

   referred to as occurring at the second position and is achieved by operating the through-air
   drying fabric at a slower speed than the transfer fabric.
           In addition to rush transferring the wet tissue web from the transfer fabric to the
   through-air drying fabric, the wet tissue web may be macroscopically rearranged to
 5 conform to the surface of the through-air drying fabric with the aid of a vacuum transfer
   roll or a vacuum transfer shoe. If desired, the through-air drying fabric can be run at a
   speed slower than the speed of the transfer fabric to further enhance MD stretch of the
   resulting absorbent tissue product. The transfer may be carried out with vacuum assistance
   to ensure conformation of the wet tissue web to the topography of the through-air drying
10 fabric.
           While supported by a through-air drying fabric, the wet tissue web is dried to a final
   consistency of about 94 percent or greater by a through-air dryer. The web then passes
   through the winding nip between the reel drum and the reel and is wound into a roll of
   tissue for subsequent converting.
15         The following examples are intended to illustrate particular embodiments of the
   present disclosure without limiting the scope of the appended claims.
                                        TEST METHODS
           Surface Smoothness
           Surface Smoothness was measured by first generating a digital image of the fabric
20 contacting surface of a sample using an FRT MicroSpy@ Profile profilometer (FRT of
   America, LLC, San Jose, CA) and then analyzing the image using Nanovea@ Ultra
   software version 6.2 (Nanovea Inc., Irvine, CA). Samples (either base sheet or finished
   product) were cut into squares measuring 145 x 145 mm. The samples were then secured to
   the x-y stage of the profilometer using tape, with the fabric contacting surface of the
25 sample facing upwards, being sure that the samples were laid flat on the stage and not
   distorted within the profilometer field of view.
           Once the sample was secured to the stage the profilometer was used to generate a
   three dimension height map of the sample surface. A 1602 x 1602 array of height values
   were obtained with a 30 gm spacing resulting in a 48 mm MD x 48 mm CD field of view
                                                 21

   having a vertical resolution 100 nm and a lateral resolution 6 tm. The resulting height map
   was exported to .sdf (surface data file) format.
          Individual sample .sdf files were analyzed using Nanovea@ Ultra version 6.2 by
   performing the following functions:
 5        (1) Using the "Thresholding" function of the Nanovea@ Ultra software the raw
               image (also referred to as the field) is subjected to thresholding by setting the
               material ratio values at 0.5 to 99.5 percent such that thresholding truncates the
               measured heights to between the 0.5 percentile height and the 99.5 percentile
               height;
10        (2) Using the "Fill In Non-Measured Points" function of the Nanovea@ Ultra
               software the non-measured points are filled by a smooth shape calculated from
               neighboring points;
          (3)  Using "Filtering > Wavyness + Roughness" function of the Nanovea@ Ultra
               software the field is spatially low pass filtered (waviness) by applying a Robust
15             Gaussian Filter with a cutoff wavelength of 0.095 mm and selecting "manage
               end effects";
          (4) Using the "Filtering - Wavyness + Roughness" function of the Nanovea@
               Ultra software the field is spatially high pass filtered (roughness) using a
               Robust Gaussian Filter with a cutoff wavelength of 0.5 mm and selecting
20             "manage end effects";
          (5)  Using the "Parameter Tables" study function of the Nanovea@ Ultra software
               ISO 25178 Values Sq (root mean square height, expressed in units of mm) and
               Sa (arithmetic mean height, expressed in units of mm) are calculated and
               reported;
25        (6) Using the "Abbott-Firestone Curve" study function of the Nanovea@ Ultra
               software an Abbott-Firestone Curve is generated from which "interactive
               mode" is selected and a histogram of the measured heights is generated, from
               the histogram an S90 value (95 percentile height (c2) minus the 5 percentile
               height (cI), expressed in units of mm) is calculated.
                                                  22

   Based upon the foregoing, three values, indicative of surface smoothness are reported - Sq,
   Sa and S90, which all have units of mm. The units have been converted to microns for use
   herein.
   Tensile
 5         Samples for tensile strength testing are prepared by cutting a 3" (76.2 mm) x 5"
   (127 mm) long strip in either the machine direction (MD) or cross-machine direction (CD)
   orientation using a JDC Precision Sample Cutter (Thwing-Albert Instrument Company,
   Philadelphia, PA, Model No. JDC 3-10, Ser. No. 37333). The instrument used for
   measuring tensile strengths is an MTS Systems Sintech 11S, Serial No. 6233. The data
10 acquisition software is MTS TestWorksT M for Windows Ver. 4 (MTS Systems Corp.,
   Research Triangle Park, NC). The load cell is selected from either a 50 or 100 Newton
   maximum, depending on the strength of the sample being tested, such that the majority of
   peak load values fall between 10 and 90 percent of the load cell's full scale value. The
   gauge length between jaws is 2  0.04 inches (50.8  1 mm). The jaws are operated using
15 pneumatic-action and are rubber coated. The minimum grip face width is 3" (76.2 mm),
   and the approximate height of a jaw is 0.5 inches (12.7 mm). The crosshead speed is 10 
   0.4 inches/min (254  1 mm/min), and the break sensitivity is set at 65 percent. The sample
   is placed in the jaws of the instrument, centered both vertically and horizontally. The test is
   then started and ends when the specimen breaks. The peak load is recorded as either the
20 "MD tensile strength" or the "CD tensile strength" of the specimen depending on the
   sample being tested. At least six (6) representative specimens are tested for each product,
   taken "as is," and the arithmetic average of all individual specimen tests is either the MD or
   CD tensile strength for the product.
   Roll Firmness
25         Roll Firmness was measured using the Kershaw Test as described in detail in
   US Patent No. 6,077,590, which is incorporated herein by reference in a manner consistent
   with the present disclosure. The apparatus is available from Kershaw Instrumentation, Inc.
   (Swedesboro, NJ) and is known as a Model RDT-2002 Roll Density Tester.

                                            EXAMPLES
   Example 1
           Base sheets were made using a through-air dried papermaking process commonly
   referred to as "uncreped through-air dried" ("UCTAD") and generally described in
 5 US Patent No. 5,607,551, the contents of which are incorporated herein in a manner
   consistent with the present disclosure. Base sheets with a target bone dry basis weight of
   about 44 grams per square meter (gsm) were produced. The base sheets were then
   converted and spirally wound into rolled tissue products.
           In all cases the base sheets were produced from a furnish comprising northern
10 softwood kraft and eucalyptus kraft using a layered headbox fed by three stock chests such
   that the webs having three layers (two outer layers and a middle layer) were formed. The
   two outer layers comprised eucalyptus (each layer comprising 30 percent weight by total
   weight of the web) and the middle layer comprised softwood and eucalyptus. The amount
   of softwood and eucalyptus kraft in the middle layer was maintained for all inventive
15 samples - the middle layered comprised 29 percent (by total weight of the web) softwood
   and 11 percent (by total weight of the web) eucalyptus. Strength was controlled via the
   addition of starch and/or by refining the furnish as set forth in Table 6, below.
           The tissue web was formed on a Voith Fabrics TissueForm V forming fabric,
   vacuum dewatered to approximately 25 percent consistency and then subjected to rush
20 transfer when transferred to the transfer fabric. The transfer fabric was the fabric described
   as "Fred" in US Patent No. 7,611,607 (commercially available from Voith Fabrics,
   Appleton, WI).
           The web was then transferred to a through-air drying fabric comprising a printed
   silicone pattern disposed on the sheet contacting side (hereinafter referred to as "Fozzie").
25 The silicone formed a wave-like pattern on the sheet contacting side of the fabric. The
   silicone pattern is illustrated in FIG. 8. The pattern properties are summarized in Table 5,
   below.

   Example 2:
            Additional inventive tissue base sheet was prepared substantially as described in
   Example 1 with the objective of increasing the basis weight of the single-ply tissue product
10 and also producing a two-ply tissue product. Specifically, base sheet was prepared as
   described above using the process conditions set forth in Table 10, below. Base sheet was
   converted to one or two-ply rolled products by calendering using one or two conventional
   polyurethane/steel calenders comprising either a 4 or a 40 P&J polyurethane roll on the air
   side of the sheet and a standard steel roll on the fabric side. Process conditions for each
15 sample are provided in Table 11, below. The calendered base sheet was converted into
                                                 26

   either one- or two-ply rolled tissue products. Two-ply rolled tissue products were formed
   by bringing two tissue webs into facing arrangement with one another and spray laminating
   to join the webs. The webs were not embossed or subject to other treatments. The rolled
   products were formed such that Roll 5 comprised two plies of Sample web 5, and so on.
 5         Table 11 shows the process conditions for each of the samples prepared in
   accordance with the present example. Table 12 summarizes the physical properties of the
   resulting tissue product.
