   A UNIQUELY COMPACT ROTORCRAFT SUITABLE FOR PERSONAL
   AERIAL VEHICLE APPLICATIONS
   FIELD OF INVENTION
 5 The present invention relates to an aircraft with rotary-wings (rotorcraft). More
   particularly, the present invention relates to a rotorcraft having no main gearbox.
   BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
            A personal aerial vehicle (PAV) is an emergent aviation market that would
10 provide on-demand aviation services. It is to provide "door-to-door" transportation
   solutions and among its defining characteristics are quiet, comfortable, reliable, low
   maintenance, ability to carry 1 to 4 passengers, maximum cruising speeds of 240 to
   320 km-h-1, and it can be flown by anyone with a driver's license [1].
            Helicopters are wonderful flying machines with the ability to fly forwards,
15 backwards and sideways. This unique ability comes from the capabilities of the main
   rotor system, thus rendering helicopters suitable for PAVs applications especially
   those involving short-haul intercity travels. However, as recent accidents have shown,
   the main gearbox has consistently been the Achilles' heel of helicopters, despite the
   efforts to refine main gearbox architectures for decades [2]. Despite industry efforts,
20 a fundamental problem remains - a gearbox cannot be made redundant [2].
            The Saunders Helicogyre was a 1920s experimental helicopter built by S.E.
   Saunders Limited for the British Air Ministry [3] having a rather unique main rotor
   system. At the end of each rotary-wing are mounted a small engine with impeller to
   cause rotation of the rotary-wings [3]. The gasoline tanks for the small engines are
25 fitted inside the wings, each engine having its own tanks and feed [3]. From here on,
   such rotary-wing configuration will be conveniently referred to as "self-contained"
   main rotor system. The Helicogyre serial number KI 171 was completed in 1929 but
   ground tests were not completed and the program was cancelled on 30 December
    1931 without the Helicogyre having flown [4]. Furthermore, effective yaw control
30 during hovering was not apparent.

                                               2
            Thus, there remains a need to develop a helicopter, or a rotorcraft in general,
   having a more reliable drivetrain with lower part count. Such a rotorcraft will
   inevitably spur the proliferation of PAVs. Furthermore, it would be a distinct
   advantage if the proposed concept has good scalability so that it can be applied to
 5 rotorcraft of various sizes ranging from small PAVs to large passenger helicopters for
   offshore applications.
   SUMMARY OF INVENTION
            An object of the invention is to eliminate the complex gearbox to enhance
10 flight safety by proposing a rotorcraft having a self-contained main rotor system, and
   having an effective yaw control.
            The rotorcraft in accordance with the present invention comprises a fuselage
   and a self-contained main rotor system. The main rotor system further comprises a
   hub and a plurality of rotor blades attached to the hub at the root of each blade. The
15 hub is rotatably mounted on a substantially upright mast which is rigidly attached to
   the fuselage so that both the mast and the fuselage are in a stationary frame of
   reference while the main rotor system is in a rotating frame of reference with respect
   to the fuselage. The rotor blades can have cyclic and collective pitch controls
   implemented using traditional swashplate or modem swashplateless methods such as
20 trailing-edge flaps. The main rotor system is equipped with at least a propulsion
   device which drives it into rotation to generate aerodynamic lift. Energy storage
   needed to power the propulsion device is also located on the main rotor system itself.
   The architecture of the rotorcraft can be greatly simplified because there is a complete
   absence of physical wires, fuel lines or air pressure ducts that route from the fuselage
25 of the rotorcraft to the rotor blades. A pair of co-axial counter-rotating impellers
   located vertically above the main rotor system is used for effective yaw control of the
   rotorcraft and to provide variable contributive lift. The variable contributive lift gives
   a much more agile altitude control especially if fixed-pitch main rotor system is used.
            Various wireless communication means such as light waves or radio waves
30 can be used to control the propulsion device and any other active control on the main
   rotor system such as the trailing-edge flaps on the rotor blades. US Pat. No. 8384605
   discloses a wireless communication system which includes a first communication

                                               3
   module within a rotating frame of reference and a second communication module
   within a fixed frame of reference, however, such system involves a hollow shaft
   which is the rotor mast of a rotorcraft. The preferred wireless communication means
   in accordance with the present invention is based on quantum entanglement to ensure
 5 a fundamentally secured and hack-proof communication system for flight-critical
   controls on the self-contained main rotor system.
            The rotorcraft in accordance with the present invention thus provides the full
   functionality and benefits of a conventional helicopter but without the need for
   complex gearbox and the associated intensive maintenance, thereby providing an
10 effective solution to the long-standing challenge facing rotorcraft relating to the
   reliability issue of main gearbox. In addition, the present invention greatly enhances
   flight safety by having plurality of independent propulsion devices on the self
   contained main rotor system and that safe controlled descent during emergency can
   be initiated without the height-velocity constraints of conventional helicopters.

   like elements throughout. Though discussed herein primarily in reference to personal
   aerial vehicles (PAVs) or manned rotorcraft in general, it will be expressly understood

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
            The present invention relates to a rotorcraft having a self-contained main rotor
   system involving no main gearbox.
            FIG. 1 shows the perspective view of the present invention of a rotorcraft
 5 comprises a fuselage (10), a self-contained main rotor system (12), and a pair of co
   axial counter-rotating impellers (14) located vertically above the main rotor system
   (12). The fuselage (10) is spherical-like or ovoid-like in shape to minimize the effect
   of external winds on its yaw ability and for a cute-looking appearance to garner public
   interest. In accordance with the present invention, the pair of co-axial counter-rotating
10 impellers (14) plays two vital functions - 1) to actuate yaw of the rotorcraft and 2) to
   control the vertical climb/descend rate of the rotorcraft.
            The designations of the elements belonging to the self-contained main rotor
   system (12) are preceded by the numeral 12, and the same numbering methodology
   is used for the pair of co-axial counter-rotating impellers (14) and other assemblies
15 having sub-elements. The self-contained main rotor system (12) further comprises a
   hub (122) and a plurality of rotor blades (124) attached to the hub (122) at the root of
   each rotor blade (124). The hub (122) is rotatably mounted on a substantially upright
   mast (16) which is rigidly attached to the fuselage (10). The main rotor system (12)
   is equipped with at least a propulsion device (126). The exemplary embodiment
20 illustrated in FIG. 1 has two propulsion devices (126) shown enclosed in dotted box.
   The propulsion devices (126) drive the main rotor system (12) into rotation about the
   long axis V of the mast (16) to generate aerodynamic lift to cause the rotorcraft to be
   airborne. Examples of propulsion device (126) are turboprop, gas turbine and impeller
   directly driven by an electric motor / internal combustion engine. The rotor blades
25 (124) can have cyclic and collective pitch controls implemented using traditional
   swashplate or modern swashplateless methods such as trailing-edge flaps (128).
            FIG. 2 shows the sideview of the present invention so as to give a better clarity
   to the arrangement of the elements. The most relevant sub-elements of the self
   contained main rotor system (12) are enclosed in a dotted line region. As mentioned,
30 the hub (122) is rotatable about the stationary mast (16) attached to the fuselage (10).
   In a preferred embodiment, the propulsion device (126) is electric powered and uses
   a fixed-pitch impeller / propeller (1262) to propel the respective rotor blade (124)

                                                5
   forwards. Fixed-pitch impellers are used for the purpose of design simplicity and
   reliability compared with variable pitch system. Similar design approach is applied
   to the pair of co-axial counter-rotating impellers (14) wherein two fixed-pitch
   counter-rotating impellers (141), (142) are attached to their respective drive shafts
 5 (143), (144) and are driven by respective electric motors (145), (146). The electric
   motors (145), (146) are mounted onto a base-plate (147) which is rigidly connected
   to the mast (16). In other words, the base-plate (147) is in stationary frame of
   reference with respect to the fuselage (10) and this enables the pair of co-axial
   counter-rotating impellers (14) to effectively control the yaw of the rotorcraft in
10 accordance with the present invention using differential torque between the two
   impellers (141), (142) by varying the rotational speeds of the electric motors (145),
   (146). The rotating axes of the pair of co-axial counter-rotating impellers (14)
   substantially coincide with the long axis V of the mast (16).
            To perform a hover, the self-contained main rotor system (12) is spun to about
15 300 RPM which should provide approximately 70% of the total lift required to keep
   the rotorcraft airborne and the general downwash direction is as indicated by an arrow
   (18) in accordance with the present invention. The remaining lift required for hover
   comes from the pair of co-axial counter-rotating impellers (14) and the general
   downwash direction is as indicated by an arrow (20). To cause the rotorcraft to ascend
20 from the hovering position, both electric motors (145), (146) will increase their
   rotational speeds. Likewise, to cause the rotorcraft to descend from the hovering
   position, both electric motors (145), (146) will decrease their rotational speeds. A
   higher percentage of contributive lift from the pair of co-axial counter-rotating
   impellers (14) will enable altitude of the rotorcraft to be controlled more precisely
25 especially in windy conditions. Conversely, a lower percentage of the contributive
   lift from the pair of co-axial counter-rotating impellers (14) will lead to a more energy
   efficient hover but the rotorcraft may be more "floaty" in windy conditions.
            In accordance with the present invention, energy storage (not shown), such as
   battery packs or ethanol liquid fuel, needed to power the propulsion device (126) is
30 also located on the self-contained main rotor system (12) itself. The complete absence
   of physical wires, fuel lines or air pressure ducts that route from the fuselage (10) of
   the rotorcraft to the rotor blades (124) consequently permits simple and lightweight
   design of the rotorcraft. In short, the rotorcraft in the present invention provides the

                                              6
   full-functionality and benefits of a conventional helicopter while simultaneously
   eliminates the need for complex gearbox that requires intensive maintenance, thereby
   providing an effective solution to the long-standing problem of unreliable main
   gearbox.
 5          Unlike conventional main gearbox that cannot be made redundant, the present
   invention offers flight safety enhancement by having plurality of independent
   propulsion devices (126) on the self-contained main rotor system (12). In case of
   powertrain failure, a gearbox driven helicopter is generally said to be able to enter
   into autorotation mode and make a controlled descent to safety. However, in reality,
10 autorotation can only be successfully performed if the helicopter is operated within
   certain height-velocity regimes when the incident occurs. On the contrary, the present
   invention offers significant flight safety advantages over conventional gearbox
   driven main rotor systems by having at least one propulsion device resides on each
   rotor blade. For example, consider a scenario in which the main rotor system (12)
15 consists of five rotor blades (124), and each rotor blade (124)          having three
   independent propulsion devices (126). In total, the main rotor system contains 15
   independent propulsion devices (126). Computer simulation results suggested that
   only about 9 of the propulsion devices (126) have to be working in order for the
   rotorcraft to make a safe controlled descent, and it is very much independent of the
20 height or velocity of the rotorcraft. In other words, the main rotor system (12) in
   accordance with the present invention offers high degree of flight safety, in addition
   to having a drivetrain that is lighter, simpler, easier to maintain and with greater
   overall reliability.
            FIG. 3 shows the topview of the rotorcraft in the present invention. The
25 impellers (1262) of the respective propulsion devices (126) generate thrusts in the
   direction indicated by an arrow (22), thus pulling the respective rotor blades (124)
   forwards causing them to rotate about the axis V (as indicated in FIGS. 1 and 2). As
   mentioned, trailing-edge flaps (128) is one of the swashplateless methods used to
   provide cyclic controls to the rotor blades (124). Another possible swashplateless
30 method is the limited angle direct-drive motor (LADDM) which does not require
   trailing-edge flaps (128). In an exemplary embodiment in which the propulsion
   devices (126) are electric powered, the respective electric motors, battery packs and
   motor controllers can be compactly housed within the respective nacelles (1264). The

                                                7
   advantages of placing the battery packs in the nacelles (1264) are simpler design as
   well as ease of maintenance and inspection as the components are strategically
   located, but the main disadvantage is that the centrifugal forces experienced by the
   battery packs are higher depending on the distance to the axis V. On the other hand,
 5 placing the battery packs closer to the axis V, e.g. within the hub (122) results in a
   low centrifugal force (hence mechanical stress), but would entail additional wiring
   and possibly an increase in ohmic loss. A way to maximize the battery capacity on
   the main rotor system (12) would be to place the battery packs in the hub (10) as well
   as to distribute them throughout the interior spaces of the rotor blades (124) and the
10 nacelles (1264).
           FIG. 4 shows the perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of the present
   invention in which each rotor blade (124) has two propulsion devices (126) and it
   uses the LADDM method for blade pitch control and so no trailing-edge flaps are
   needed.
15         The communications between the fuselage and the main rotor system is
   preferably via wireless communication means. FIG. 5 shows the perspective view of
   the rotorcraft wherein the wireless communication means is implemented by having
   at least a communication module (24) within the fuselage (10) and at least a
   communication module (26) within the main rotor system (12), for example, in the
20 hub (122), in the interior spaces of the rotor blade(s) (124) or in the nacelle(s) (1264).
   While a variety of wireless technologies such as magnetic, light waves or radio waves
   can be used in the present invention, a preferred wireless technology is based on
   quantum entanglement to ensure a fundamentally secured and hack-proof
   communications system for flight-critical controls on the main rotor system (12). The
25 China's quantum satellite has recently demonstrated the highly anticipated "spooky
   action" at a record distance of 1200 km, indicating that ultra-secure communications
   is now physically possible.
