10 Background of the Invention
   Disorders of the bone, ranging from osteoporosis to fractures, represent a set of
   pathological states for which there are few effective pharmaceutical agents. Treatment
   instead focuses on physical and behavioral interventions, including immobilization,
   exercise and changes in diet. It would be beneficial to have therapeutic agents that
15 promote bone growth and increase bone density for the purpose of treating a variety of
   bone disorders.
   Bone growth and mineralization are dependent on the activities of two cell types,
   osteoclasts and osteoblasts, although chondrocytes and cells of the vasculature also
   participate in critical aspects of these processes. Developmentally, bone formation
20 occurs through two mechanisms, endochondral ossification and intramembranous
   ossification, with the former responsible for longitudinal bone formation and the later
   responsible for the formation of topologically flat bones, such as the bones of the skull.
   Endochondral ossification requires the sequential formation and degradation of
   cartilaginous structures in the growth plates that serve as templates for the formation of
25 osteoblasts, osteoclasts, the vasculature and subsequent mineralization. During
   intramembranous ossification, bone is formed directly in the connective tissues. Both
   processes require the infiltration of osteoblasts and subsequent matrix deposition.
   Fractures and other structural disruptions of bone are healed through a process that, at
   least superficially, resembles the sequence of developmental events of osteogenesis,
30 including the formation of cartilaginous tissue and subsequent mineralization. The
   process of fracture healing can occur in two ways. Direct or primary bone healing
   occurs without callus formation. Indirect or secondary bone healing occurs with a callus

 precursor stage. Primary healing of fractures involves the reformation of mechanical
continuity across a closely-set disruption. Under suitable conditions, bone-resorbing
cells surrounding the disruption show

   a tunnelling resorptive response and establish pathways for the penetration of blood vessels
   and subsequent healing. Secondary healing of bones follows a process of inflammation, soft
   callus formation, callus mineralisation and callus remodelling. In the inflammation stage,
   haematoma and haemorrhage formation results from the disruption of periosteal and
 5 endosteal blood vessels at the site of injury. Inflammatory cells invade the area. In soft
   callus formation stage, the cells produce new vessels, fibroblasts, intracellular material and
   supporting cells, forming granulation tissue in the space between the fracture fragments.
   Clinical union across the disruption is established by fibrous or cartilaginous tissue (soft
   callus). Osteoblasts are formed and mediate the mineralization of soft callus, which is then
10 replaced by lamellar bone and subjected to the normal remodeling processes.
            In addition to fractures and other physical disruptions of bone structure, loss of bone
   mineral content and bone mass can be caused by a wide variety of conditions and may result
   in significant medical problems. Changes to bone mass occur in a relatively predictable way
   over the life of an individual. Up to about age 30, bones of both men and women grow to
15 maximal mass through linear growth of the endochondral growth plates and radial growth.
   After about age 30 (for trabecular bone, e.g., flat bones such as the vertebrae and pelvis) and
   age 40 (for cortical bone, e.g., long bones found in the limbs), slow bone loss occurs in both
   men and women. In women, a final phase of substantial bone loss also occurs, probably due
   to postmenopausal estrogen deficiencies. During this phase, women may lose an additional
20  10% of bone mass from the cortical bone and 25% from the trabecular compartment.
   Whether progressive bone loss results in a pathological condition such as osteoporosis
   depends largely on the initial bone mass of the individual and whether there are exacerbating
   conditions.
            Bone loss is sometimes characterized as an imbalance in the normal bone remodeling
25 process. Healthy bone is constantly subject to remodeling. Remodeling begins with
   resorption of bone by osteoclasts. The resorbed bone is then replaced by new bone tissue,
   which is characterized by collagen formation by osteoblasts, and subsequent calcification. In
   healthy individuals the rates of resorption and formation are balanced. Osteoporosis is a
   chronic, progressive condition, marked by a shift towards resorption, resulting in an overall
30 decrease in bone mass and bone mineralization. Osteoporosis in humans is preceded by
   clinical osteopenia (bone mineral density that is greater than one standard deviation but less
   than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean value for young adult bone). Worldwide,
   approximately 75 million people are at risk for osteoporosis.
                                                   -2-

            Thus, methods for controlling the balance between osteoclast and osteoblast activity
   can be useful for promoting the healing of fractures and other damage to bone as well as the
   treatment of disorders, such as osteoporosis, associated with loss of bone mass and bone
   mineralization.
 5          With respect to osteoporosis, estrogen, calcitonin, osteocalcin with vitamin K, or high
   doses of dietary calcium are all used as therapeutic interventions. Other therapeutic
   approaches to osteoporosis include bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone, calcimimetics,
   statins, anabolic steroids, lanthanum and strontium salts, and sodium fluoride. Such
   therapeutics, however, are often associated with undesirable side effects.
10          Bone loss is also a significant complication of many cancers, and may be caused by
   tumor metastases to bone, the activation of osteoclasts or the effects of chemotherapeutic
   treatment. In particular, anti-estrogen therapies that are used widely in the treatment of breast
   cancer can cause significant bone loss.
            Other bone disorders, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, may result from genetic,
15 developmental, nutritional of other pathologies and deficiencies.
            Thus, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide compositions and methods for
   promoting bone growth and mineralization.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
20          In part, the disclosure demonstrates that molecules having ALK3 or BMP antagonist
   activity ("ALK3 antagonists" and "BMP antagonists") can be used to increase bone density,
   promote bone growth, and/or increase bone strength. This observation is particularly
   surprising, given the large body of literature and clinical experience indicating that many
   BMPs, and particularly BMP2, BMP4 and BMP7, are potent stimulators of bone formation.
25 The disclosure demonstrates that a soluble form of ALK3 acts as an inhibitor of BMP-ALK3
   signaling and promotes increased bone density, bone growth, and bone strength in vivo.
   While not wishing to be bound to any particular mechanism, it appears that the soluble form
   of ALK3 achieves this effect by inhibiting BMP2 and/or BMP4, and perhaps other ligands
   which signal through ALK3. Thus, the disclosure establishes that antagonists of the BMP
30 ALK3 signaling pathway may be used to increase bone density and promote bone growth.
   While soluble ALK3 may affect bone through a mechanism other than, or in addition to,
                                                     -3-

   BMP antagonism, the disclosure nonetheless demonstrates that desirable therapeutic agents
   may be selected on the basis of BMP-ALK3 antagonist activity. Therefore, in certain
   embodiments, the disclosure provides methods for using BMP-ALK3 antagonists, including,
   for example, BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptides, anti-BMP antibodies, anti-ALK3 antibodies,
 5 BMP- or ALK3-targeted small molecules and aptamers, and nucleic acids that decrease
   expression of BMP and ALK3, to treat disorders associated with low bone density or low
   bone strength, such as osteoporosis, or to promote bone growth in patients in need thereof,
   such as in patients having a bone fracture. In additional embodiments, the disclosure
   identifies truncated forms of ALK3 polypeptides (e.g., ALK3-Fc polypeptides) that have
10 advantageous properties and retain appropriate BMP2 or BMP4 binding.
           In certain aspects, the disclosure provides polypeptides comprising a soluble ALK3
   polypeptide that binds to BMP2 and/or BMP4. The soluble ALK3 polypeptide may bind to
   additional ligands also. ALK3 polypeptides may be formulated as a pharmaceutical
   preparation comprising the BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide and a pharmaceutically
15 acceptable carrier. Preferably, the BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide binds to BMP2 and/or
   BMP4 with a KD less than I micromolar or less than 100, 10 or I nanomolar. Preferably the
   composition is at least 95% pure, with respect to other polypeptide components, as assessed
   by size exclusion chromatography, and more preferably, the composition is at least 98% pure.
   A BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide for use in such a preparation may be any of those
20 disclosed herein, such as a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID
   NOs: 3,7. 11, 14, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, or 41, or
   having an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98% or 99%
   identical to an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 3, 7, I1, 14, 20, 22, 23, 25,
   26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, or 41, including N- and/or C-terminal
25 truncations of no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
   21, 22, 23, 24 or 25 amino acids of SEQ ID NO:3, and optionally fused to an Fc fusion
   protein, with or without a linker. In particular, the disclosure provides ALK3 polypeptides
   with a truncation of 0 to 7 amino acids at the N-terminus of the ALK3 ECD portion and 0 to
    12 amino acids at the C-terminus of the ALK3 ECD portion, thus describing a function
30 portion corresponding to amino acids 8 to 117 of SEQ ID NO:3 and polypeptides comprising
   a protein that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the amino acid
   sequence of 8 to 117 of SEQ ID NO:3. Notably, human ALK3 and murine ALK3 have 97 to
   98% identity at the amino acid sequence level in the extracellular domain, and proteins
                                                    -4-

   comprising such domains from the human or mouse protein are shown herein to exhibit
   similar activity in vitro and in vivo. A BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide may include a
   functional fragment of a natural ALK3 polypeptide, such as one comprising at least 10, 20 or
   30 amino acids of a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: I or 3. Surprisingly, as
 5 demonstrated herein, ALK3 proteins that include a deletion of amino acids at the C-terminal
   region of the ALK3 extracellular domain retain activity against BMP2 and BMP4 while
   diminishing activity against other ligands (e.g., BMP6 and BMP7) thus providing an
   improvement in ligand selectivity, which is generally desirable to diminish unanticipated off
   target effects in clinical development or commercialization. Such variations may include a
10 deletion of no more than 6 or 7, no more than 12 or no more than 24 amino acids from the C
   terminus of SEQ ID NO:3. Optionally, a forn truncated at the C-terminus may also be
   truncated by no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 amino acids at the N-terminus. The
   aforementioned variations of ALK3 proteins may be included in an ALK3-Fc fusion protein,
   which may comprise any linker disclosed herein (or no linker at all), including a linker
15 having the sequence GGG or TGGG or SGGG, and an Fc portion derived from a human
   IgGI, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 or other mammalian immunoglobulin.
            A soluble, BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide may include one, two, five or more
   alterations in the amino acid sequence (e.g., in the ligand-binding domain) relative to a
   naturally occurring ALK3 polypeptide. The alteration in the amino acid sequence may, for
20 example, alter glycosylation of the polypeptide when produced in a mammalian, insect or
   other eukaryotic cell or alter proteolytic cleavage of the polypeptide relative to the naturally
   occurring ALK3 polypeptide.
            A BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide may be a fusion protein that has, as one domain,
   an ALK3 polypeptide (e.g., a ligand-binding portion of ALK3) and one or more additional
25 domains that provide a desirable property, such as improved pharmacokinetics, easier
   purification, targeting to particular tissues, etc. For example, a domain of a fusion protein
   may enhance one or more of in vivo stability, in vivo half life, uptake/administration, tissue
   localization or distribution, formation of protein complexes, multimerization of the fusion
   protein, and/or purification. An BMP-binding ALK3 fusion protein may include an
30 immunoglobulin Fc domain (wild-type or mutant) or a serum albumin or other polypeptide
   portion that provides desirable properties such as improved pharmacokinetics, improved
   solubility or improved stability. In a preferred embodiment, an ALK3-Fc fusion comprises a
   relatively unstructured linker positioned between the Fc domain and the extracellular ALK3
                                                     -5-

   domain. This unstructured linker may correspond to the C-terminal end of the extracellular
   domain of ALK3, or it may be an artificial sequence of 1,2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acids or a length
   of between 5 and 15, 20, 30, 50 or more amino acids that are relatively free of secondary
   structure, or a mixture of both. A linker may be rich in glycine and proline residues and may,
 5 for example, contain a single sequence of threonine/serine and glycines or repeating
   sequences of threonine/serine and/or glycines (e.g., GGG, GGGG, TG4, SG4, TG3 , or SG3
   singlets or repeats). A fusion protein may include a purification subsequence, such as an
   epitope tag, a FLAG tag, a polyhistidine sequence, and a GST fusion. Optionally, a soluble
   ALK3 polypeptide includes one or more modified amino acid residues selected from: a
10 glycosylated amino acid, a PEGylated amino acid, a farnesylated amino acid, an acetylated
   amino acid, a biotinylated amino acid, an amino acid conjugated to a lipid moiety, and an
   amino acid conjugated to an organic derivatizing agent. A pharmaceutical preparation may
   also include one or more additional compounds such as a compound that is used to treat a
   bone disorder. Preferably, a pharmaceutical preparation is substantially pyrogen free. In
15 general, it is preferable that an ALK3 protein be expressed in a mammalian cell line that
   mediates suitably natural glycosylation of the ALK3 protein so as to diminish the likelihood
   of an unfavorable immune response in a patient. Human and CHO cell lines have been used
   successfully, and it is expected that other common mammalian expression systems will be
   useful.
20          In certain aspects, the disclosure provides nucleic acids encoding a soluble BMP
   binding ALK3 polypeptide. An isolated polynucleotide may comprise a coding sequence for
   a soluble, BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide, such as described above. For example, an
   isolated nucleic acid may include a sequence coding for an extracellular domain (e.g., ligand
   binding domain) of ALK3 and a sequence that would code for part or all of the
25 transmembrane domain and/or the cytoplasmic domain of ALK3, but for a stop codon
   positioned within the transmembrane domain or the cytoplasmic domain, or positioned
   between the extracellular domain and the transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic domain.
   For example, an isolated polynucleotide may comprise a full-length ALK3 polynucleotide
   sequence such as SEQ ID NO: 2 or 4, or a partially truncated version, said isolated
30 polynucleotide further comprising a transcription termination codon at least six hundred
   nucleotides before the 3'-terminus or otherwise positioned such that translation of the
   polynucleotide gives rise to an extracellular domain optionally fused to a truncated portion of
   a full-length ALK3. Preferred nucleic acid sequences are SEQ ID NO: 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21,
                                                    -6-

   24, 27, 32 or 37 and nucleic acids that hybridize to such nucleic acids or the complements
   thereof under stringent hybridization conditions. Nucleic acids disclosed herein may be
   operably linked to a promoter for expression, and the disclosure provides cells transformed
   with such recombinant polynucleotides. Preferably the cell is a mammalian cell such as a
 5 CHO cell.
             In certain aspects, the disclosure provides methods for making a soluble, BMP
   binding ALK3 polypeptide. Such a method may include expressing any of the nucleic acids
   (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27, 32 or 37) disclosed herein in a suitable
   cell, such as a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell. Such a method may comprise: a)culturing
10 a cell under conditions suitable for expression of the soluble ALK3 polypeptide, wherein said
   cell is transformed with a soluble ALK3 expression construct; and b) recovering the soluble
   ALK3 polypeptide so expressed. Soluble ALK3 polypeptides may be recovered as crude,
   partially purified or highly purified fractions. Purification may be achieved by a series of
   purification steps, including, for example, one, two or three or more of the following, in any
15 order: protein A chromatography, anion exchange chromatography (e.g.,         Q sepharose),
   hydrophobic interaction chromatography (e.g., phenylsepharose), size exclusion
   chromatography, and cation exchange chromatography.
             In certain aspects, a BMP-ALK3 antagonist disclosed herein, such as a soluble, BMP
   binding ALK3 polypeptide, may be used in a method for promoting bone growth or
20 increasing bone density in a subject. In certain embodiments, the disclosure provides
   methods for treating a disorder associated with low bone density, or to promote bone growth,
   in patients in need thereof. A method may comprise administering to a subject in need
   thereof an effective amount of BMP-ALK3 antagonist. In certain aspects, the disclosure
   provides uses of BMP-ALK3 antagonist for making a medicament for the treatment of a
25 disorder or condition as described herein.
             In certain aspects, the disclosure provides a method for identifying an agent that
   stimulates growth of, or increased mineralization of, bone. The method comprises: a)
   identifying atest agent that binds to BMPs or a ligand-binding domain of an ALK3
   polypeptide; and b) evaluating the effect of the agent on growth of, or mineralization of,
30 bone.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   1.       Overview
            In part, the present disclosure demonstrates the surprising result that inhibitors of the
   BMP-ALK3 signaling pathway, such as an ALK3-Fc protein, promote bone formation in
 5 animals. ALK3 is a receptor for members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF
   beta)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) superfamily. The TGF-beta/BMP superfamily
   contains a variety of growth factors that share common sequence elements and structural
   motifs. These proteins are known to exert biological effects on a large variety of cell types in
   both vertebrates and invertebrates. Members of the superfamily perform important functions
10 during embryonic development in pattern formation and tissue specification and can
   influence a variety of differentiation processes, including adipogenesis, myogenesis,
   chondrogenesis, cardiogenesis, hematopoiesis, neurogenesis, and epithelial cell
   differentiation. By manipulating the activity of a member of the TGF-beta family, it is often
   possible to cause significant physiological changes in an organism. For example, the
15 Piedmontese and Belgian Blue cattle breeds carry a loss-of-function mutation in the GDF8
   (also called myostatin) gene that causes a marked increase in muscle mass. Grobet et al., Nat
   Genet. 1997, 17(1):71-4. Furthermore, in humans, inactive alleles of GDF8 are associated
   with increased muscle mass and, reportedly, exceptional strength. Schuelke et al., N Engl J
   Med 2004, 350:2682-8.
20          TGF-p signals are mediated by heteromeric complexes of type I and type Il serine/
   threonine kinase receptors, which phosphorylate and activate downstream Smad proteins
   upon ligand stimulation (Massagu6, 2000, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 1:169-178). These type I
   and type 11 receptors are transmembrane proteins, composed of a ligand-binding extracellular
   domain with cysteine-rich region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with
25 predicted serine/threonine specificity. Type I receptors are essential for signaling; and type II
   receptors are required for binding ligands and for expression of type I receptors. Type I and
   II activin receptors form a stable complex after ligand binding, resulting in phosphorylation
   of type I receptors by type II receptors.
            Activin receptor-like kinase-3 (ALK3) is a type I receptor mediating effects of
30 multiple ligands in the BMP family and is also known as bone morphogenetic protein
   receptor, type IA (BMPRIA), or activin A receptor, type II-like kinase (ACVRLK). Unlike
   several type I receptors with ubiquitous tissue expression, ALK3 displays a restricted pattern
                                                  -13-

   of expression consistent with more specialized functionality (ten Dijke, 1993, Oncogene
   8:2879-2887). ALK3 is generally recognized as a high affinity receptor for BMP2, BMP4,
   BMP7 and other members of the BMP family. BMP2 and BMP7 are potent stimulators of
   osteoblastic differentiation, and are now used clinically to induce bone formation in spine
 5 fusions and certain non-union fractures. ALK3 is regarded as a key receptor in mediating
   BMP2 and BMP4 signaling in osteoblasts (Lavery et al., 2008, J. Biol. Chem. 283:20948
   20958). A homozygous ALK3 knockout mouse dies early in embryogenesis (day 9.5),
   however, adult mice carrying a conditional disruption of ALK3 in osteoblasts have been
   recently reported to exhibit increased bone mass, although the newly formed bone showed
10 evidence of disorganization (Kamiya, 2008, J. Bone Miner. Res. 23:2007-2017; Kamiya,
   2008, Development 135:3801-3811). This finding is in startling contrast to the effectiveness
   of BMP2 and BMP7 (ligands for ALK3) as bone building agents in clinical use.
             As demonstrated herein, a soluble ALK3 polypeptide (ALK3-Fc), which shows
   substantial preference in binding to BMP2 and BMP4 is effective to promote bone growth
15 and increase bone density in vivo. While not wishing to be bound to any particular
   mechanism, it is expected that the effect of ALK3 is caused primarily by a BMP antagonist
   effect, given the very strong BMP2 and BMP4 binding (picomolar dissociation constant)
   exhibited by the particular soluble ALK3 construct used in these studies. Regardless of
   mechanism, it is apparent from the data presented herein that BMP-ALK3 antagonists do
20 increase bone density in normal mice. Surprisingly, the bone generated by treatment with
   ALK3-Fc shows no evidence of the type of disorganization observed in the ALK3
   conditional knockout mice. It should be noted that bone is a dynamic tissue, with growth or
   shrinkage and increased or decreased density depending on a balance of factors that produce
   bone and stimulate mineralization (primarily osteoblasts) and factors that destroy and
25 demineralize bone (primarily osteoclasts). Bone growth and mineralization may be increased
   by increasing the productive factors, by decreasing the destructive factors, or both. The terms
   "promote bone growth" and "increase bone mineralization" refer to the observable physical
   changes in bone and are intended to be neutral as to the mechanism by which changes in bone
   occur.
30         The mouse model for bone growth/density that was used in the studies described
   herein is considered to be highly predictive of efficacy in humans, and therefore, this
   disclosure provides methods for using ALK3 polypeptides and other BMP-ALK3 antagonists
   to promote bone growth and increase bone density in humans. BMP-ALK3 antagonists
                                                 -14-

   include, for example, BMP-binding soluble ALK3 polypeptides, antibodies that bind to BMP
   and disrupt ALK3 binding, antibodies that bind to ALK3 and disrupt BMP binding, non
   antibody proteins selected for BMP or ALK3 binding (see e.g., WO/2002/088171,
   WO/2006/055689, WO/2002/032925, WO/2005/037989, US 2003/0133939, and US
 5 2005/0238646 for examples of such proteins and methods for design and selection of same),
   randomized peptides selected for BMP or ALK3 binding, often affixed to an Fc domain.
   Two different proteins (or other moieties) with BMP or ALK3 binding activity, especially
   BMP binders that block the type I (e.g., a soluble type I activin receptor) and type 11 (e.g., a
   soluble type II activin receptor) binding sites, respectively, may be linked together to create a
10 bifunctional binding molecule. Nucleic acid aptamers, small molecules and other agents that
   inhibit the BMP-ALK3 signaling axis are also contemplated. Additionally, nucleic acids,
   such as antisense molecules, siRNAs or ribozymes that inhibit BMPs, or, particularly, ALK3
   expression, can be used as BMP-ALK3 antagonists.
              The terms used in this specification generally have their ordinary meanings in the
15 art, within the context of this invention and in the specific context where each term is used.
   Certain terms are discussed below or elsewhere in the specification, to provide additional
   guidance to the practitioner in describing the compositions and methods of the invention and
   how to make and use them. The scope or meaning of any use of a term will be apparent from
   the specific context in which the term is used.
20          "About" and "approximately" shall generally mean an acceptable degree of error for
   the quantity measured given the nature or precision of the measurements. Typically,
   exemplary degrees of error are within 20 percent (%), preferably within 10%, and more
   preferably within 5% of a given value or range of values.
            Alternatively, and particularly in biological systems, the terms "about" and
25 "approximately" may mean values that are within an order of magnitude, preferably within 5
   fold and more preferably within 2-fold of a given value. Numerical quantities given herein
   are approximate unless stated otherwise, meaning that the term "about" or "approximately"
   can be inferred when not expressly stated.
            The methods of the invention may include steps of comparing sequences to each
30 other, including wild-type sequence to one or more mutants (sequence variants). Such
   comparisons typically comprise alignments of polymer sequences, e.g., using sequence
   alignment programs and/or algorithms that are well known in the art (for example, BLAST,
                                                   -15-

   FASTA and MEGALIGN, to name a few). The skilled artisan can readily appreciate that, in
   such alignments, where a mutation contains a residue insertion or deletion, the sequence
   alignment will introduce a "gap" (typically represented by a dash, or "A") in the polymer
   sequence not containing the inserted or deleted residue.
 5         "Homologous," in all its grammatical forms and spelling variations, refers to the
   relationship between two proteins that possess a "common evolutionary origin," including
   proteins from superfamilies in the same species of organism, as well as homologous proteins
   from different species of organism. Such proteins (and their encoding nucleic acids) have
   sequence homology, as reflected by their sequence similarity, whether in terms of percent
10 identity or by the presence of specific residues or motifs and conserved positions.
           The term "sequence similarity," in all its grammatical forms, refers to the degree of
   identity or correspondence between nucleic acid or amino acid sequences that may or may
   not share a common evolutionary origin.
           However, in common usage and in the instant application, the term "homologous,"
15 when modified with an adverb such as "highly," may refer to sequence similarity and may or
   may not relate to a common evolutionary origin.
   2.      ALK3 Polypeptides
           In certain aspects, the present invention relates to ALK3 polypeptides. As used
20 herein, the term "ALK3" refers to a family of activin receptor-like kinase-3 (ALK3) [also
   referred to as bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type IA (BMPRIA), or activin A
   receptor, type 11-like kinase (ACVRLK)] proteins from any species and variants derived from
   such ALK3 proteins by mutagenesis or other modification. Reference to ALK3 herein is
   understood to be a reference to any one of the currently identified forms. Members of the
25 ALK3 family are generally transmembrane proteins, composed of a ligand-binding
   extracellular domain with a cysteine-rich region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic
   domain with predicted serine/threonine kinase activity.
           The term "ALK3 polypeptide" includes polypeptides comprising any naturally
   occurring polypeptide of an ALK3 family member as well as any variants thereof (including
30 mutants, fragments, fusions, and peptidomimetic forms) that retain a useful activity. For
   example, ALK3 polypeptides include polypeptides derived from the sequence of any known
                                                  -16-

   ALK3 having a sequence at least about 80% identical to the sequence of an ALK3
   polypeptide, and preferably at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 99% or greater identity. For
   example, an ALK3 polypeptide of the invention may bind to and inhibit the function of an
   ALK3 protein and/or BMPs. Preferably, an ALK3 polypeptide promotes bone growth and
 5 bone mineralization. Examples of ALK3 polypeptides include human ALK3 precursor
   polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 1)and soluble human ALK3 polypeptides (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 3, 7,
   11, 14, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, or 41).
           The human ALK3 precursor protein sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) is shown in Figure 1,
   and the nucleic acid sequence encoding human ALK3 precursor protein (SEQ ID NO: 2;
10 nucleotides 549-2144 of Genbank entry NM 004329) is shown in Figure 2. The human
   ALK3 soluble (extracellular), processed polypeptide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 3) is shown in
   Figure 3, and the nucleic acid sequence encoding the human ALK3 extracellular domain
   (SEQ ID NO: 4; nucleotides 618-1004 of Genbank entry NM_004329) is shown in Figure 4.
           In a specific embodiment, the invention relates to soluble ALK3 polypeptides. As
15 described herein, the term "soluble ALK3 polypeptide" generally refers to polypeptides
   comprising an extracellular domain of an ALK3 protein. The term "soluble ALK3
   polypeptide," as used herein, includes any naturally occurring extracellular domain of an
   ALK3 protein as well as any variants thereof (including mutants, fragments and
   peptidomimetic forms). A BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide is one that retains the ability to
20 bind to BMPs, particularly BMP2 and BMP4. Preferably, a BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide
   will bind to BMP with a dissociation constant of I nM or less. The amino acid sequence of
   human ALK3 precursor protein is provided in Figure 1. The extracellular domain of an
   ALK3 protein binds to BMP and is generally soluble, and thus can be termed a soluble,
   BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptide. Examples of soluble, BMP-binding ALK3 polypeptides
25 include the soluble polypeptide illustrated in SEQ ID NOs: 3, 7, 11, 14, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28,
   29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, or4l. SEQ IDNO:7 is referred to as ALK3(24-152)
   hFc, and is described further in the Examples. Other examples of soluble, BMP-binding
   ALK3 polypeptides comprise a signal sequence in addition to the extracellular domain of an
   ALK3 protein, for example, the native ALK3 leader sequence (SEQ ID NO: 8), the tissue
30 plaminogen activator (TPA) leader (SEQ ID NO: 9) or the honey bee melittin leader (SEQ ID
   NO: 10). The ALK3-hFc polypeptide illustrated in SEQ ID NO: 11 uses a TPA leader.
                                                   -17-

            Functionally active fragments of ALK3 polypeptides can be obtained by screening
   polypeptides recombinantly produced from the corresponding fragment of the nucleic acid
   encoding an ALK3 polypeptide. In addition, fragments can be chemically synthesized using
   techniques known in the art such as conventional Merrifield solid phase f-Moc or t-Boc
 5 chemistry. The fragments can be produced (recombinantly or by chemical synthesis) and
   tested to identify those peptidyl fragments that can function as antagonists (inhibitors) of
   ALK3 protein or signaling mediated by BMPs.
            Functionally active variants of ALK3 polypeptides can be obtained by screening
   libraries of modified polypeptides recombinantly produced from the corresponding
10 mutagenized nucleic acids encoding an ALK3 polypeptide. The variants can be produced
   and tested to identify those that can function as antagonists (inhibitors) of ALK3 protein or
   signaling mediated by BMPs. In certain embodiments, a functional variant of the ALK3
   polypeptides comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 75% identical to an amino acid
   sequence selected from SEQ ID NO: 3, 7, 11, 14, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34,
15 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, or 41. In certain cases, the functional variant has an amino acid sequence
   at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to an amino acid sequence
   selected from SEQ ID NO: 3, 7, 11, 14, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38,
   39, 40, or 41.
            Functional variants may be generated by modifying the structure of an ALK3
20 polypeptide for such purposes as enhancing therapeutic efficacy, or stability (e.g., ex vivo
   shelf life and resistance to proteolytic degradation in vivo). Such modified ALK3
   polypeptides, when selected to retain BMP binding, are considered functional equivalents of
   the naturally-occurring ALK3 polypeptides. Modified ALK3 polypeptides can also be
   produced, for instance, by amino acid substitution, deletion, or addition. For instance, it is
25 reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an
   aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino
   acid with a structurally related amino acid (e.g., conservative mutations) will not have a
   major effect on the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Conservative replacements
   are those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains.
30 Whether a change in the amino acid sequence of an ALK3 polypeptide results in a functional
   homolog can be readily determined by assessing the ability of the variant ALK3 polypeptide
   to produce a response in cells in a fashion similar to the wild-type ALK3 polypeptide.
                                                   -18-

             In certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates specific mutations of the
   ALK3 polypeptides so as to alter the glycosylation of the polypeptide. Such mutations may
   be selected so as to introduce or eliminate one or more glycosylation sites, such as 0-linked
   or N-linked glycosylation sites. Asparagine-linked glycosylation recognition sites generally
 5 comprise a tripeptide sequence, asparagine-X-threonine (or asparagines-X-serine) (where
   "X" is any amino acid) which is specifically recognized by appropriate cellular glycosylation
   enzymes. The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more
   serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the wild-type ALK3 polypeptide (for 0-linked
   glycosylation sites). A variety of amino acid substitutions or deletions at one or both of the
10 first or third amino acid positions of a glycosylation recognition site (and/or amino acid
   deletion at the second position) results in non-glycosylation at the modified tripeptide
   sequence. Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on an ALK3
   polypeptide is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the ALK3 polypeptide.
   Depending on the coupling mode used, the sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and
15 histidine; (b) free carboxyl groups; (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine; (d)
   free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline; (e) aromatic
   residues such as those of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan; or (f) the amide group of
   glutamine. These methods are described in WO 87/05330 published Sep. 11, 1987, and in
   Aplin and Wriston (1981) CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306, incorporated by reference
20 herein. Removal of one or more carbohydrate moieties present on an ALK3 polypeptide may
   be accomplished chemically and/or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation may involve,
   for example, exposure of the ALK3 polypeptide to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic
   acid, or an equivalent compound. This treatment results in the cleavage of most or all sugars
   except the linking sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), while leaving the
25 amino acid sequence intact. Chemical deglycosylation is further described by Hakimuddin et
   al. (1987) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 259:52 and by Edge et al. (1981) Anal. Biochem.
   118:131. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on ALK3 polypeptides can be
   achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et
   al. (1987) Meth. Enzymol. 138:350. The sequence of an ALK3 polypeptide may be adjusted,
30 as appropriate, depending on the type of expression system used, as mammalian, yeast, insect
   and plant cells may all introduce differing glycosylation patterns that can be affected by the
   amino acid sequence of the peptide. In general, ALK3 proteins for use in humans will be
   expressed in a mammalian cell line that provides proper glycosylation, such as HEK293 or
                                                  -19-

   CHO cell lines, although other mammalian expression cell lines, yeast cell lines with
   engineered glycosylation enzymes and insect cells are expected to be useful as well.
           This disclosure further contemplates a method of generating mutants, particularly sets
   of combinatorial mutants of an ALK3 polypeptide, as well as truncation mutants; pools of
 5 combinatorial mutants are especially useful for identifying functional variant sequences. The
   purpose of screening such combinatorial libraries may be to generate, for example, ALK3
   polypeptide variants which can act as either agonists or antagonist, or alternatively, which
   possess novel activities altogether. A variety of screening assays are provided below, and
   such assays may be used to evaluate variants. For example, an ALK3 polypeptide variant
10 may be screened for ability to bind to an ALK3 ligand, to prevent binding of an ALK3 ligand
   to an ALK3 polypeptide or to interfere with signaling caused by an ALK3 ligand.
           The activity of an ALK3 polypeptide or its variants may also be tested in a cell-based
   or in vivo assay. For example, the effect of an ALK3 polypeptide variant on the expression
   of genes involved in bone production or bone destruction may be assessed. This may, as
15 needed, be performed in the presence of one or more recombinant ALK3 ligand proteins
   (e.g., BMP2 or BMP4), and cells may be transfected so as to produce an ALK3 polypeptide
   and/or variants thereof, and optionally, an ALK3 ligand. Likewise, an ALK3 polypeptide
   may be administered to a mouse or other animal, and one or more bone properties, such as
   density or volume may be assessed. The healing rate for bone fractures may also be
20 evaluated. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is a well-established, non-invasive,
   quantitative technique for assessing bone density in an animal. In humans, central DEXA
   systems may be used to evaluate bone density in the spine and pelvis. These are the best
   predictors of overall bone density. Peripheral DEXA systems may be used to evaluate bone
   density in peripheral bones, including, for example, the bones of the hand, wrist, ankle and
25 foot. Traditional x-ray imaging systems, including CAT scans, may be used to evaluate bone
   growth and fracture healing. The mechanical strength of bone may also be evaluated.
           Combinatorially-derived variants can be generated which have a selective or generally
   increased potency relative to a naturally occurring ALK3 polypeptide. Likewise,
   mutagenesis can give rise to variants which have intracellular half-lives dramatically different
30 than the corresponding a wild-type ALK3 polypeptide. For example, the altered protein can
   be rendered either more stable or less stable to proteolytic degradation or other cellular
   processes which result in destruction of, or otherwise inactivation of a native ALK3
                                                  -20-

   polypeptide. Such variants, and the genes which encode them, can be utilized to alter ALK3
   polypeptide levels by modulating the half-life of the ALK3 polypeptides. For instance, a
   short half-life can give rise to more transient biological effects and can allow tighter control
   of recombinant ALK3 polypeptide levels within the patient. In an Fc fusion protein,
 5 mutations may be made in the linker (if any) and/or the Fc portion to alter the half-life of the
   protein.
            A combinatorial library may be produced by way of a degenerate library of genes
   encoding a library of polypeptides which each include at least a portion of potential ALK3
   polypeptide sequences. For instance, a mixture of synthetic oligonucleotides can be
10 enzymatically ligated into gene sequences such that the degenerate set of potential ALK3
   polypeptide nucleotide sequences are expressible as individual polypeptides, or alternatively,
   as a set of larger fusion proteins (e.g., for phage display).
            There are many ways by which the library of potential homologs can be generated
   from a degenerate oligonucleotide sequence. Chemical synthesis of a degenerate gene
15 sequence can be carried out in an automatic DNA synthesizer, and the synthetic genes then be
   ligated into an appropriate vector for expression. The synthesis of degenerate
   oligonucleotides is well known in the art (see for example, Narang, SA (1983) Tetrahedron
   39:3; Itakura et al., (1981) Recombinant DNA, Proc. 3rd Cleveland Sympos.
   Macromolecules, ed. AG Walton, Amsterdam: Elsevier pp273-289: Itakura et al., (1984)
20 Annu. Rev. Biochem. 53:323; Itakura et al., (1984) Science 198:1056; Ike et al., (1983)
   Nucleic Acid Res. 11:477). Such techniques have been employed in the directed evolution of
   other proteins (see, for example, Scott et al., (1990) Science 249:386-390; Roberts et al.,
   (1992) PNAS USA 89:2429-2433; Devlin et al., (1990) Science 249: 404-406; Cwirla et al.,
   (1990) PNAS USA 87: 6378-6382; as well as U.S. Patent Nos: 5,223,409, 5,198,346, and
25 5,096,815).
            Alternatively, other forms of mutagenesis can be utilized to generate a combinatorial
   library. For example, ALK3 polypeptide variants can be generated and isolated from a
   library by screening using, for example, alanine scanning mutagenesis and the like (Ruf et al.,
   (1994) Biochemistry 33:1565-1572; Wang et al., (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:3095-3099;
30 Balint et al., (1993) Gene 137:109-118; Grodberg et al., (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 218:597
   601; Nagashima et al., (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268:2888-2892; Lowman et al., (1991)
   Biochemistry 30:10832-10838; and Cunningham et al., (1989) Science 244:1081-1085), by
                                                    -21-

   linker scanning mutagenesis (Gustin et al., (1993) Virology 193:653-660; Brown et al.,
   (1992) Mol. Cell Biol. 12:2644-2652; McKnight et al., (1982) Science 232:316); by
   saturation mutagenesis (Meyers et al., (1986) Science 232:613); by PCR mutagenesis (Leung
   et al., (1989) Method Cell Mol Biol 1:11-19); or by random mutagenesis, including chemical
 5 mutagenesis, etc. (Miller et al., (1992) A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics, CSHL Press,
   Cold Spring Harbor, NY; and Greener et al., (1994) Strategies in Mol Biol 7:32-34). Linker
   scanning mutagenesis, particularly in a combinatorial setting, is an attractive method for
   identifying truncated (bioactive) forms of ALK3 polypeptides.
             A wide range of techniques are known in the art for screening gene products of
10 combinatorial libraries made by point mutations and truncations, and, for that matter, for
   screening cDNA libraries for gene products having a certain property. Such techniques will
   be generally adaptable for rapid screening of the gene libraries generated by the
   combinatorial mutagenesis of ALK3 polypeptides. The most widely used techniques for
   screening large gene libraries typically comprises cloning the gene library into replicable
15 expression vectors, transforming appropriate cells with the resulting library of vectors, and
   expressing the combinatorial genes under conditions in which detection of a desired activity
   facilitates relatively easy isolation of the vector encoding the gene whose product was
   detected. Preferred assays include BMP binding assays and BMP-mediated cell signaling
   assays.
20           In certain embodiments, the ALK3 polypeptides of the invention may further
   comprise post-translational modifications in addition to any that are naturally present in the
   ALK3 polypeptides. Such modifications include, but are not limited to, acetylation,
   carboxylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation, and acylation. As a result, the
   modified ALK3 polypeptides may contain non-amino acid elements, such as polyethylene
25 glycols, lipids, poly- or mono-saccharide, and phosphates. Effects of such non-amino acid
   elements on the functionality of an ALK3 polypeptide may be tested as described herein for
   other ALK3 polypeptide variants. When an ALK3 polypeptide is produced in cells by
   cleaving a nascent form of the ALK3 polypeptide, post-translational processing may also be
   important for correct folding and/or function of the protein. Different cells (such as CHO,
30 HeLa, MDCK, 293, W138, NIH-3T3 or HEK293) have specific cellular machinery and
   characteristic mechanisms for such post-translational activities and may be chosen to ensure
   the correct modification and processing of the ALK3 polypeptides.
                                                    -22-

            In certain aspects, functional variants or modified forms of the ALK3 polypeptides
   include fusion proteins having at least a portion of the ALK3 polypeptides and one or more
   fusion domains. Well known examples of such fusion domains include, but are not limited
   to, polyhistidine, Glu-Glu, glutathione S transferase (GST), thioredoxin, protein A, protein G,
 5 an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (Fc), maltose binding protein (MBP), or
   human serum albumin. A fusion domain may be selected so as to confer a desired property.
   For example, some fusion domains are particularly useful for isolation of the fusion proteins
   by affinity chromatography. For the purpose of affinity purification, relevant matrices for
   affinity chromatography, such as glutathione-, amylase-, and nickel- or cobalt- conjugated
10 resins are used. Many of such matrices are available in "kit" form, such as the Pharmacia
   GST purification system and the QlAexpressiM system (Qiagen) useful with (HIS 6 ) fusion
   partners. As another example, a fusion domain may be selected so as to facilitate detection of
   the ALK3 polypeptides. Examples of such detection domains include the various fluorescent
   proteins (e.g., GFP) as well as "epitope tags," which are usually short peptide sequences for
15 which a specific antibody is available. Well known epitope tags for which specific
   monoclonal antibodies are readily available include FLAG, influenza virus haemagglutinin
   (HA), and c-myc tags. In some cases, the fusion domains have a protease cleavage site, such
   as for Factor Xa or Thrombin, which allows the relevant protease to partially digest the fusion
   proteins and thereby liberate the recombinant proteins therefrom. The liberated proteins can
20 then be isolated from the fusion domain by subsequent chromatographic separation. In
   certain preferred embodiments, an ALK3 polypeptide is fused with a domain that stabilizes
   the ALK3 polypeptide in vivo (a "stabilizer" domain). By "stabilizing" is meant anything
   that increases serum half life, regardless of whether this is because of decreased destruction,
   decreased clearance by the kidney, or other pharmacokinetic effect. Fusions with the Fc
25 portion of an immunoglobulin are known to confer desirable pharmacokinetic properties on a
   wide range of proteins. Likewise, fusions to human serum albumin can confer desirable
   properties. Other types of fusion domains that may be selected include multimerizing (e.g.,
   dimerizing, tetramerizing) domains and functional domains (that confer an additional
   biological function, such as further stimulation of bone growth or muscle growth, as desired).
30         As a specific example, the present invention provides a fusion protein comprising a
   soluble extracellular domain of ALK3 fused to an Fe domain (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 5 in Figure
   5). Examples of Fc domains are shown below:
                                                    -23-

   PFFLYSKLTVDKSRWQQGNVFSCSVMHEALHN (A)HYTQKSLSLSPGK*
 5          Optionally, the Fc domain has one or more mutations at residues such as Asp-265,
   lysine 322, and Asn-434. In certain cases, the mutant Fc domain having one or more of these
   mutations (e.g., Asp-265 mutation) has reduced ability of binding to the Fey receptor relative
   to awildtype Fc domain. In other cases, the mutant Fc domain having one or more of these
   mutations (e.g., Asn-434 mutation) has increased ability of binding to the MHC class I
10 related Fc-receptor (FcRN) relative to a wildtype Fc domain.
            It is understood that different elements of the fusion proteins may be arranged in any
   manner that is consistent with the desired functionality. For example, an ALK3 polypeptide
   may be placed C-terminal to a heterologous domain, or, alternatively, a heterologous domain
   may be placed C-terminal to an ALK3 polypeptide. The ALK3 polypeptide domain and the
15 heterologous domain need not be adjacent in a fusion protein, and additional domains or
   amino acid sequences may be included C- or N-terminal to either domain or between the
   domains.
            In certain embodiments, the ALK3 polypeptides of the present invention contain one
   or more modifications that are capable of stabilizing the ALK3 polypeptides. For example,
20 such modifications enhance the in vitro half life of the ALK3 polypeptides, enhance
   circulatory half life of the ALK3 polypeptides or reduce proteolytic degradation of the ALK3
   polypeptides. Such stabilizing modifications include, but are not limited to, fusion proteins
   (including, for example, fusion proteins comprising an ALK3 polypeptide and astabilizer
   domain), modifications of a glycosylation site (including, for example, addition of a
25 glycosylation site to an ALK3 polypeptide), and modifications of carbohydrate moiety
   (including, for example, removal of carbohydrate moieties from an ALK3 polypeptide). In
   the case of fusion proteins, an ALK3 polypeptide is fused to a stabilizer domain such as an
   IgG molecule (e.g., an Fe domain). As used herein, the term "stabilizer domain" not only
   refers to a fusion domain (e.g., Fc) as in the case of fusion proteins, but also includes
30 nonproteinaceous modifications such as a carbohydrate moiety, or nonproteinaceous
   polymer, such as polyethylene glycol.
                                                   -24-

           In certain embodiments, the present invention makes available isolated and/or purified
   forms of the ALK3 polypeptides, which are isolated from, or otherwise substantially free of,
   other proteins. ALK3 polypeptides will generally be produced by expression from
   recombinant nucleic acids.
 5
   3.      Nucleic Acids Encoding ALK3 Polypeptides
           In certain aspects, the invention provides isolated and/or recombinant nucleic acids
   encoding any of the ALK3 polypeptides (e.g., soluble ALK3 polypeptides), including
   fragments, functional variants and fusion proteins disclosed herein. For example, SEQ ID
10 NO: 2 encodes the naturally occurring human ALK3 precursor polypeptide, while SEQ ID
   NO: 4 encodes the processed extracellular domain of ALK3. The subject nucleic acids may
   be single-stranded or double stranded. Such nucleic acids may be DNA or RNA molecules.
   These nucleic acids may be used, for example, in methods for making ALK3 polypeptides or
   as direct therapeutic agents (e.g., in a gene therapy approach).
15         In certain aspects, the subject nucleic acids encoding ALK3 polypeptides are further
   understood to include nucleic acids that are variants of SEQ ID NO: 2 or 4. Variant
   nucleotide sequences include sequences that differ by one or more nucleotide substitutions,
   additions or deletions, such as allelic variants.
           In certain embodiments, the invention provides isolated or recombinant nucleic acid
20 sequences that are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to SEQ
   ID NO: 2, 4, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27, 32 or 37. One of ordinary skill in the art will
   appreciate that nucleic acid sequences complementary to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 12, 13, 15, 16,
   19, 21, 24, 27, 32 or 37 and variants of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27, 32 or
   37 are also within the scope of this invention. In further embodiments, the nucleic acid
25 sequences of the invention can be isolated, recombinant, and/or fused with a heterologous
   nucleotide sequence, or in a DNA library.
           In other embodiments, nucleic acids of the invention also include nucleotide
   sequences that hybridize under highly stringent conditions to the nucleotide sequence
   designated in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27, 32 or 37, complement
30 sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27, 32 or 37, or fragments thereof.
   As discussed above, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand readily that appropriate
   stringency conditions which promote DNA hybridization can be varied. One of ordinary skill
                                                   -25-

   in the art will understand readily that appropriate stringency conditions which promote DNA
   hybridization can be varied. For example, one could perform the hybridization at 6.0 x
   sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45 *C,followed by a wash of 2.0 x SSC at 50
   'C. For example, the salt concentration in the wash step can be selected from a low
 5 stringency of about 2.0 x SSC at 50 *Cto a high stringency of about 0.2 x SSC at 50 'C. In
   addition, the temperature in the wash step can be increased from low stringency conditions at
   room temperature, about 22 *C, to high stringency conditions at about 65 *C. Both
   temperature and salt may be varied, or temperature or salt concentration may be held constant
   while the other variable is changed. In one embodiment, the invention provides nucleic acids
10 which hybridize under low stringency conditions of 6 x SSC at room temperature followed by
   a wash at 2 x SSC at room temperature.
            Isolated nucleic acids which differ from the nucleic acids as set forth in SEQ ID NOs:
   2, 4, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27, 32 or 37 due to degeneracy in the genetic code are also
   within the scope of the invention. For example, a number of amino acids are designated by
15 more than one triplet. Codons that specify the same amino acid, or synonyms (for example,
   CAU and CAC are synonyms for histidine) may result in "silent" mutations which do not
   affect the amino acid sequence of the protein. However, it is expected that DNA sequence
   polymorphisms that do lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the subject proteins
   will exist among mammalian cells. One skilled in the art will appreciate that these variations
20 in one or more nucleotides (up to about 3-5% of the nucleotides) of the nucleic acids
   encoding a particular protein may exist among individuals of a given species due to natural
   allelic variation. Any and all such nucleotide variations and resulting amino acid
   polymorphisms are within the scope of this invention.
            In certain embodiments, the recombinant nucleic acids of the invention may be
25 operably linked to one or more regulatory nucleotide sequences in an expression construct.
   Regulatory nucleotide sequences will generally be appropriate to the host cell used for
   expression. Numerous types of appropriate expression vectors and suitable regulatory
   sequences are known in the art for a variety of host cells. Typically, said one or more
   regulatory nucleotide sequences may include, but are not limited to, promoter sequences,
30 leader or signal sequences, ribosomal binding sites, transcriptional start and termination
   sequences, translational start and termination sequences, and enhancer or activator sequences.
   Constitutive or inducible promoters as known in the art are contemplated by the invention.
                                                   -26-

   The promoters may be either naturally occurring promoters, or hybrid promoters that
   combine elements of more than one promoter. An expression construct may be present in a
   cell on an episome, such as a plasmid, or the expression construct may be inserted in a
   chromosome. In a preferred embodiment, the expression vector contains a selectable marker
 5 gene to allow the selection of transformed host cells. Selectable marker genes are well
   known in the art and will vary with the host cell used.
           In certain aspects of the invention, the subject nucleic acid is provided in an
   expression vector comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an ALK3 polypeptide and
   operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence. Regulatory sequences are art-recognized
10 and are selected to direct expression of the ALK3 polypeptide. Accordingly, the term
   regulatory sequence includes promoters, enhancers, and other expression control elements.
   Exemplary regulatory sequences are described in Goeddel; Gene Expression Technology:
   Methods in Enzymology, Academic Press, San Diego, CA (1990). For instance, any of a wide
   variety of expression control sequences that control the expression of a DNA sequence when
15 operatively linked to it may be used in these vectors to express DNA sequences encoding an
   ALK3 polypeptide. Such useful expression control sequences, include, for example, the early
   and late promoters of SV40, tet promoter, adenovirus or cytomegalovirus immediate early
   promoter, RSV promoters, the lac system, the trp system, the TAC or TRC system, T7
   promoter whose expression is directed by T7 RNA polymerase, the major operator and
20 promoter regions of phage lambda , the control regions for fd coat protein, the promoter for
   3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, the promoters of acid phosphatase,
   e.g., Pho5, the promoters of the yeast a-mating factors, the polyhedron promoter of the
   baculovirus system and other sequences known to control the expression of genes of
   prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells or their viruses, and various combinations thereof. It should
25 be understood that the design of the expression vector may depend on such factors as the
   choice of the host cell to be transformed and/or the type of protein desired to be expressed.
   Moreover, the vector's copy number, the ability to control that copy number and the
   expression of any other protein encoded by the vector, such as antibiotic markers, should also
   be considered.
30         A recombinant nucleic acid of the invention can be produced by ligating the cloned
   gene, or a portion thereof, into a vector suitable for expression in either prokaryotic cells,
   eukaryotic cells (yeast, avian, insect or mammalian), or both. Expression vehicles for
   production of a recombinant ALK3 polypeptide include plasmids and other vectors. For
                                                   -27-

   instance, suitable vectors include plasmids of the types: pBR322-derived plasmids, pEMBL
   derived plasmids, pEX-derived plasmids, pBTac-derived plasmids and pUC-derived plasmids
   for expression in prokaryotic cells, such as E. coli.
            Some mammalian expression vectors contain both prokaryotic sequences to facilitate
 5 the propagation of the vector in bacteria, and one or more eukaryotic transcription units that
   are expressed in eukaryotic cells. The pcDNAI/amp, pcDNAI/neo, pRc/CMV, pSV2gpt,
   pSV2neo, pSV2-dhfr, pTk2, pRSVneo, pMSG, pSVT7, pko-neo and pHyg derived vectors
   are examples of mammalian expression vectors suitable for transfection of eukaryotic cells.
   Some of these vectors are modified with sequences from bacterial plasmids, such as pBR322,
10 to facilitate replication and drug resistance selection in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
   Alternatively, derivatives of viruses such as the bovine papilloma virus (BPV-1), or Epstein
   Barr virus (pHEBo, pREP-derived and p205) can be used for transient expression of proteins
   in eukaryotic cells. Examples of other viral (including retroviral) expression systems can be
   found below in the description of gene therapy delivery systems. The various methods
15 employed in the preparation of the plasmids and in transformation of host organisms are well
   known in the art. For other suitable expression systems for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
   cells, as well as general recombinant procedures, see Molecular CloningA
   LaboratoryManual, 3rd Ed., ed. by Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis (Cold Spring Harbor
   Laboratory Press, 2001). In some instances, it may be desirable to express the recombinant
20 polypeptides by the use of a baculovirus expression system. Examples of such baculovirus
   expression systems include pVL-derived vectors (such as pVL1392, pVL1393 and pVL941),
   pAcUW-derived vectors (such as pAcUW1), and pBlueBac-derived vectors (such as the B-gal
   containing pBlueBac IlI).
            In a preferred embodiment, a vector will be designed for production of the subject
25 ALK3 polypeptides in CHO cells, such as a Pcmv-Script vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.),
   pcDNA4 vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and pCl-neo vectors (Promega, Madison,
   Wisc.). As will be apparent, the subject gene constructs can be used to cause expression of
   the subject ALK3 polypeptides in cells propagated in culture, e.g., to produce proteins,
   including fusion proteins or variant proteins, for purification.
30          This disclosure also pertains to a host cell transfected with a recombinant gene
   including a coding sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27, 32 or 37)
   for one or more of the subject ALK3 polypeptides. The host cell may be any prokaryotic or
                                                   -28-

   eukaryotic cell. For example, an ALK3 polypeptide of the invention may be expressed in
   bacterial cells such as E. coli, insect cells (e.g., using a baculovirus expression system), yeast,
   or mammalian cells. Other suitable host cells are known to those skilled in the art.
            Accordingly, the present invention further pertains to methods of producing the
 5 subject ALK3 polypeptides. For example, a host cell transfected with an expression vector
   encoding an ALK3 polypeptide can be cultured under appropriate conditions to allow
   expression of the ALK3 polypeptide to occur. The ALK3 polypeptide may be secreted and
   isolated from a mixture of cells and medium containing the ALK3 polypeptide.
   Alternatively, the ALK3 polypeptide may be retained cytoplasmically or in a membrane
10 fraction and the cells harvested, lysed and the protein isolated. A cell culture includes host
   cells, media and other byproducts. Suitable media for cell culture are well known in the art.
   The subject ALK3 polypeptides can be isolated from cell culture medium, host cells, or both,
   using techniques known in the art for purifying proteins, including ion-exchange
   chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, ultrafiltration, electrophoresis,
15 immunoaffinity purification with antibodies specific for particular epitopes of the ALK3
   polypeptides and affinity purification with an agent that binds to a domain fused to the ALK3
   polypeptide (e.g., a protein A column may be used to purify an ALK3-Fc fusion). In a
   preferred embodiment, the ALK3 polypeptide is a fusion protein containing a domain which
   facilitates its purification. In a preferred embodiment, purification is achieved by a series of
20 column chromatography steps, including, for example, three or more of the following, in any
   order: protein A chromatography,      Q sepharose    chromatography, phenylsepharose
   chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, and cation exchange chromatography. The
   purification could be completed with viral filtration and buffer exchange. As demonstrated
   herein, ALK3-hFc protein was purified to a purity of >98% as determined by size exclusion
25 chromatography and >95% as determined by SDS PAGE. This level of purity was sufficient
   to achieve desirable effects on bone in mice and an acceptable safety profile in mice, rats and
   non-human primates.
            In another embodiment, a fusion gene coding for a purification leader sequence, such
   as a poly-(His)/enterokinase cleavage site sequence at the N-terminus of the desired portion
30 of the recombinant ALK3 polypeptide, can allow purification of the expressed fusion protein
   by affinity chromatography using a N i metal resin. The purification leader sequence can
   then be subsequently removed by treatment with enterokinase to provide the purified ALK3
                                                    -29-

   polypeptide (e.g., see Hochuli et al., (1987) J. Chromatography 411:177; and Janknecht et
   al., PNAS USA 88:8972).
            Techniques for making fusion genes are well known. Essentially, the joining of
   various DNA fragments coding for different polypeptide sequences is performed in
 5 accordance with conventional techniques, employing blunt-ended or stagger-ended termini
   for ligation, restriction enzyme digestion to provide for appropriate termini, filling-in of
   cohesive ends as appropriate, alkaline phosphatase treatment to avoid undesirable joining,
   and enzymatic ligation. In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by
   conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR
10 amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to
   complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently
   be annealed to generate a chimeric gene sequence (see, for example, Current Protocolsin
   MolecularBiology, eds. Ausubel et al., John Wiley & Sons: 1992).
15 4.       Alternative BMP and ALK3 Antagonists
            The data presented herein demonstrates that antagonists of BMP-ALK3 signaling can
   be used to promote bone growth and bone mineralization. Although soluble ALK3
   polypeptides, and particularly ALK3-Fc, are preferred antagonists, and although such
   antagonists may affect bone through a mechanism other than BMP antagonism (e.g., BMP
20 inhibition may be an indicator of the tendency of an agent to inhibit the activities of a
   spectrum of molecules, including, perhaps, other members of the TGF-beta superfamily, and
   such collective inhibition may lead to the desired effect on bone), other types of BMP-ALK3
   antagonists are expected to be useful, including anti-BMP (e.g., BMP2 or BMP4) antibodies,
   anti-ALK3 antibodies, antisense, RNAi or ribozyme nucleic acids that inhibit the production
25 of ALK3, BMP2 or BMP4 and other inhibitors of BMP or ALK3, particularly those that
   disrupt BMP-ALK3 binding.
           An antibody that is specifically reactive with an ALK3 polypeptide (e.g., a soluble
   ALK3 polypeptide) and which either binds competitively to ligand with the ALK3
   polypeptide or otherwise inhibits ALK3-mediated signaling may be used as an antagonist of
30 ALK3 polypeptide activities. Likewise, an antibody that is specifically reactive with an BMP
   polypeptide and which disrupts ALK3 binding may be used as an antagonist.
                                                  -30-

            By using immunogens derived from an ALK3 polypeptide or a BMP polypeptide,
   anti-protein/anti-peptide antisera or monoclonal antibodies can be made by standard protocols
   (see, for example, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual ed. by Harlow and Lane (Cold Spring
   Harbor Press: 1988)). A mammal, such as a mouse, a hamster or rabbit can be immunized
 5 with an immunogenic form of the ALK3 polypeptide, an antigenic fragment which is capable
   of eliciting an antibody response, or a fusion protein. Techniques for conferring
    immunogenicity on a protein or peptide include conjugation to carriers or other techniques
   well known in the art. An immunogenic portion of an ALK3 or BMP polypeptide can be
   administered in the presence of adjuvant. The progress of immunization can be monitored by
10 detection of antibody titers in plasma or serum. Standard ELISA or other immunoassays can
   be used with the immunogen as antigen to assess the levels of antibodies.
            Following immunization of an animal with an antigenic preparation of an ALK3
   polypeptide, antisera can be obtained and, if desired, polyclonal antibodies can be isolated
   from the serum. To produce monoclonal antibodies, antibody-producing cells (lymphocytes)
15 can be harvested from an immunized animal and fused by standard somatic cell fusion
   procedures with immortalizing cells such as myeloma cells to yield hybridoma cells. Such
   techniques are well known in the art, and include, for example, the hybridoma technique
   (originally developed by Kohler and Milstein, (1975) Nature, 256: 495-497), the human B
   cell hybridoma technique (Kozbar et aL., (1983) Immunology Today, 4: 72), and the EBV
20 hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., (1985)
   Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc. pp. 77-96). Hybridoma cells
   can be screened immunochemically for production of antibodies specifically reactive with an
   ALK3 polypeptide and monoclonal antibodies isolated from a culture comprising such
   hybridoma cells.
25          The term "antibody" as used herein is intended to include fragments thereof which are
   also specifically reactive with a subject polypeptide. Antibodies can be fragmented using
   conventional techniques and the fragments screened for utility in the same manner as
   described above for whole antibodies. For example, F(ab) 2 fragments can be generated by
   treating antibody with pepsin. The resulting F(ab) 2 fragment can be treated to reduce
30 disulfide bridges to produce Fab fragments. The antibody of the present invention is further
   intended to include bispecific, single-chain, chimeric, humanized and fully human molecules
   having affinity for an ALK3 or BMP polypeptide conferred by at least one CDR region of the
                                                  -31-

   antibody. An antibody may further comprise a label attached thereto and able to be detected
   (e.g., the label can be a radioisotope, fluorescent compound, enzyme or enzyme co-factor).
            In certain embodiments, the antibody is a recombinant antibody, which term
   encompasses any antibody generated in part by techniques of molecular biology, including
 5 CDR-grafted or chimeric antibodies, human or other antibodies assembled from library
   selected antibody domains, single chain antibodies and single domain antibodies (e.g., human
   VH proteins or camelid Vil proteins). In certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention
   is a monoclonal antibody, and in certain embodiments, the invention makes available
   methods for generating novel antibodies. For example, a method for generating a
10 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to an ALK3 polypeptide or BMP polypeptide
   may comprise administering to a mouse an amount of an immunogenic composition
   comprising the antigen polypeptide effective to stimulate a detectable immune response,
   obtaining antibody-producing cells (e.g., cells from the spleen) from the mouse and fusing the
   antibody-producing cells with myeloma cells to obtain antibody-producing hybridomas, and
15 testing the antibody-producing hybridomas to identify a hybridoma that produces a
   monocolonal antibody that binds specifically to the antigen. Once obtained, a hybridoma can
   be propagated in a cell culture, optionally in culture conditions where the hybridoma-derived
   cells produce the monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the antigen. The monoclonal
   antibody may be purified from the cell culture.
20          The adjective "specifically reactive with" as used in reference to an antibody is
   intended to mean, as is generally understood in the art, that the antibody is sufficiently
   selective between the antigen of interest (e.g., an ALK3 polypeptide) and other antigens that
   are not of interest that the antibody is useful for, at minimum, detecting the presence of the
   antigen of interest in a particular type of biological sample. In certain methods employing the
25 antibody, such as therapeutic applications, a higher degree of specificity in binding may be
   desirable. Monoclonal antibodies generally have a greater tendency (as compared to
   polyclonal antibodies) to discriminate effectively between the desired antigens and cross
   reacting polypeptides. One characteristic that influences the specificity of an
   antibody:antigen interaction is the affinity of the antibody for the antigen. Although the
30 desired specificity may be reached with a range of different affinities, generally preferred
   antibodies will have an affinity (a dissociation constant) of about 10-6, 107, 10o-, 10 or less.
   Given the extraordinarily tight binding between BMPs and ALK3, it is expected that a
                                                   -32-

    neutralizing anti-BMP or anti-ALK3 antibody would generally have a dissociation constant
    of 10-9 or less.
             In addition, the techniques used to screen antibodies in order to identify a desirable
    antibody may influence the properties of the antibody obtained. For example, if an antibody
 5  is to be used for binding an antigen in solution, it may be desirable to test solution binding. A
    variety of different techniques are available for testing interaction between antibodies and
   antigens to identify particularly desirable antibodies. Such techniques include ELISAs,
   surface plasmon resonance binding assays (e.g., the Biacore"m binding assay, Biacore AB,
    Uppsala, Sweden), sandwich assays (e.g., the paramagnetic bead system of IGEN
10  International, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland), western blots, immunoprecipitation assays, and
    immunohistochemistry.
             Examples of categories of nucleic acid compounds that are BMP or ALK3 antagonists
    include antisense nucleic acids, RNAi constructs and catalytic nucleic acid constructs. A
   nucleic acid compound may be single or double stranded. A double stranded compound may
15 also include regions of overhang or non-complementarity, where one or the other of the
   strands is single stranded. A single stranded compound may include regions of self
   complementarity, meaning that the compound forms a so-called "hairpin" or "stem-loop"
   structure, with a region of double helical structure. A nucleic acid compound may comprise a
   nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a region consisting of no more than 1000, no
20 more than 500, no more than 250, no more than 100 or no more than 50, 35, 30, 25, 22, 20 or
    18 nucleotides of the full-length ALK3 nucleic acid sequence or BMP nucleic acid sequence.
   The region of complementarity will preferably be at least 8 nucleotides, and optionally at
   least 10 or at least 15 nucleotides, and optionally between 15 and 25 nucleotides. A region of
   complementarity may fall within an intron, a coding sequence or a noncoding sequence of the
25 target transcript, such as the coding sequence portion. Generally, a nucleic acid compound
   will have a length of about 8 to about 500 nucleotides or base pairs in length, and optionally
   the length will be about 14 to about 50 nucleotides. A nucleic acid may be a DNA
   (particularly for use as an antisense), RNA or RNA:DNA hybrid. Any one strand may
   include a mixture of DNA and RNA, as well as modified forms that cannot readily be
30 classified as either DNA or RNA. Likewise, a double stranded compound may be
   DNA:DNA, DNA:RNA or RNA:RNA, and any one strand may also include a mixture of
   DNA and RNA, as well as modified forms that cannot readily be classified as either DNA or
   RNA. A nucleic acid compound may include any of a variety of modifications, including one
                                                   -33-

    or modifications to the backbone (the sugar-phosphate portion in a natural nucleic acid,
    including internucleotide linkages) or the base portion (the purine or pyrimidine portion of a
    natural nucleic acid). An antisense nucleic acid compound will preferably have a length of
    about 15 to about 30 nucleotides and will often contain one or more modifications to improve
 5  characteristics such as stability in the serum, in a cell or in a place where the compound is
    likely to be delivered, such as the stomach in the case of orally delivered compounds and the
    lung for inhaled compounds. In the case of an RNAi construct, the strand complementary to
   the target transcript will generally be RNA or modifications thereof. The other strand may be
    RNA, DNA or any other variation. The duplex portion of double stranded or single stranded
10 "hairpin" RNAi construct will preferably have a length of 18 to 40 nucleotides in length and
   optionally about 21 to 23 nucleotides in length, so long as it serves as a Dicer substrate.
   Catalytic or enzymatic nucleic acids may be ribozymes or DNA enzymes and may also
   contain modified forms. Nucleic acid compounds may inhibit expression of the target by
   about 50%, 75%, 90% or more when contacted with cells under physiological conditions and
15 at a concentration where a nonsense or sense control has little or no effect. Preferred
   concentrations for testing the effect of nucleic acid compounds are 1, 5 and 10 micromolar.
   Nucleic acid compounds may also be tested for effects on, for example, bone growth and
   mineralization.
20 5.       Screening Assays
            In certain aspects, the present invention relates to the use of ALK3 polypeptides (e.g.,
   soluble ALK3 polypeptides) and BMP polypeptides to identify compounds (agents) which
   are agonist or antagonists of the BMP-ALK3 signaling pathway. Compounds identified
   through this screening can be tested to assess their ability to modulate bone growth or
25 mineralization in vitro. Optionally, these compounds can further be tested in animal models
   to assess their ability to modulate tissue growth in vivo.
            There are numerous approaches to screening for therapeutic agents for modulating
   tissue growth by targeting BMPs and ALK3 polypeptides. In certain embodiments, high
   throughput screening of compounds can be carried out to identify agents that perturb BMPs
30 or ALK3-mediated effects on bone. In certain embodiments, the assay is carried out to
   screen and identify compounds that specifically inhibit or reduce binding of an ALK3
   polypeptide to BMPs. Alternatively, the assay can be used to identify compounds that
                                                   -34-

   enhance binding of an ALK3 polypeptide to BMPs. In a further embodiment, the compounds
   can be identified by their ability to interact with a BMP or ALK3 polypeptide.
            A variety of assay formats will suffice and, in light of the present disclosure, those not
   expressly described herein will nevertheless be comprehended by one of ordinary skill in the
 5 art. As described herein, the test compounds (agents) of the invention may be created by any
   combinatorial chemical method. Alternatively, the subject compounds may be naturally
   occurring biomolecules synthesized in vivo or in vitro. Compounds (agents) to be tested for
   their ability to act as modulators of tissue growth can be produced, for example, by bacteria,
   yeast, plants or other organisms (e.g., natural products), produced chemically (e.g., small
10 molecules, including peptidomimetics), or produced recombinantly. Test compounds
   contemplated by the present invention include non-peptidyl organic molecules, peptides,
   polypeptides, peptidomimetics, sugars, hormones, and nucleic acid molecules. In a specific
   embodiment, the test agent is a small organic molecule having a molecular weight of less
   than about 2,000 daltons.
15          The test compounds of the invention can be provided as single, discrete entities, or
   provided in libraries of greater complexity, such as made by combinatorial chemistry. These
   libraries can comprise, for example, alcohols, alkyl halides, amines, aides, esters,
   aldehydes, ethers and other classes of organic compounds. Presentation of test compounds to
   the test system can be in either an isolated form or as mixtures of compounds, especially in
20 initial screening steps. Optionally, the compounds may be optionally derivatized with other
   compounds and have derivatizing groups that facilitate isolation of the compounds. Non
   limiting examples of derivatizing groups include biotin, fluorescein, digoxygenin, green
   fluorescent protein, isotopes, polyhistidine, magnetic beads, glutathione S transferase (GST),
   photoactivatible crosslinkers or any combinations thereof.
25          In many drug screening programs which test libraries of compounds and natural
   extracts, high throughput assays are desirable in order to maximize the number of compounds
   surveyed in a given period of time. Assays which are performed in cell-free systems, such as
   may be derived with purified or semi-purified proteins, are often preferred as "primary"
   screens in that they can be generated to permit rapid development and relatively easy
30 detection of an alteration in a molecular target which is mediated by a test compound.
   Moreover, the effects of cellular toxicity or bioavailability of the test compound can be
   generally ignored in the in vitro system, the assay instead being focused primarily on the
                                                   -35-

   effect of the drug on the molecular target as may be manifest in an alteration of binding
   affinity between an ALK3 polypeptide and BMPs.
            Merely to illustrate, in an exemplary screening assay of the present invention, the
   compound of interest is contacted with an isolated and purified ALK3 polypeptide which is
 5 ordinarily capable of binding to BMPs. To the mixture of the compound and ALK3
   polypeptide is then added a composition containing an ALK3 ligand. Detection and
   quantification of ALK3/BMP complexes provides a means for determining the compound's
   efficacy at inhibiting (or potentiating) complex formation between the ALK3 polypeptide and
   BMPs. The efficacy of the compound can be assessed by generating dose response curves
10 from data obtained using various concentrations of the test compound. Moreover, a control
   assay can also be performed to provide a baseline for comparison. For example, in a control
   assay, isolated and a purified BMP is added to a composition containing the ALK3
   polypeptide, and the formation of ALK3/BMP complex is quantitated in the absence of the
   test compound. It will be understood that, in general, the order in which the reactants may be
15 admixed can be varied, and can be admixed simultaneously. Moreover, in place of purified
   proteins, cellular extracts and lysates may be used to render a suitable cell-free assay system.
           Complex formation between the ALK3 polypeptide and BMPs may be detected by a
   variety of techniques. For instance, modulation of the formation of complexes can be
   quantitated using, for example, detectably labeled proteins such as radiolabeled (e.g.,  32
                                                                                               P, 35s,
20  4
     C or 3H), fluorescently labeled (e.g., FITC), or enzymatically labeled ALK3 polypeptide or
   BMPs, by immunoassay, or by chromatographic detection.
           In certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates the use of fluorescence
   polarization assays and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays in measuring,
   either directly or indirectly, the degree of interaction between an ALK3 polypeptide and its
25 binding protein. Further, other modes of detection, such as those based on optical
   waveguides (PCT Publication WO 96/26432 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,196), surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR), surface charge sensors, and surface force sensors, are compatible with
   many embodiments of the invention.
           Moreover, the present invention contemplates the use of an interaction trap assay, also
30 known as the "two hybrid assay," for identifying agents that disrupt or potentiate interaction
   between an ALK3 polypeptide and its binding protein. See for example, U.S. Pat. No.
   5,283,317; Zervos et al. (1993) Cell 72:223-232; Madura et al. (1993) J Biol Chem
                                                   -36-

   268:12046-12054; Bartel et al. (1993) Biotechniques 14:920-924; and Iwabuchi et al. (1993)
   Oncogene 8:1693-1696). In a specific embodiment, the present invention contemplates the
   use of reverse two hybrid systems to identify compounds (e.g., small molecules or peptides)
   that dissociate interactions between an ALK3 polypeptide and its binding protein. See for
 5 example, Vidal and Legrain, (1999) Nucleic Acids Res 27:919-29; Vidal and Legrain, (1999)
   Trends Biotechnol 17:374-81; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,525,490; 5,955,280; and 5,965,368.
            In certain embodiments, the subject compounds are identified by their ability to
   interact with an ALK3 or BMP polypeptide of the invention. The interaction between the
   compound and the ALK3 or BMP polypeptide may be covalent or non-covalent. For
10 example, such interaction can be identified at the protein level using in vitro biochemical
   methods, including photo-crosslinking, radiolabeled ligand binding, and affinity
   chromatography (Jakoby WB et al., 1974, Methods in Enzymology 46: 1). In certain cases,
   the compounds may be screened in a mechanism based assay, such as an assay to detect
   compounds which bind to a BMP or ALK3 polypeptide. This may include a solid phase or
15 fluid phase binding event. Alternatively, the gene encoding a BMP or ALK3 polypeptide can
   be transfected with a reporter system (e.g., p-galactosidase, luciferase, or green fluorescent
   protein) into a cell and screened against the library preferably by a high throughput screening
   or with individual members of the library. Other mechanism based binding assays may be
   used, for example, binding assays which detect changes in free energy. Binding assays can
20 be performed with the target fixed to a well, bead or chip or captured by an immobilized
   antibody or resolved by capillary electrophoresis. The bound compounds may be detected
   usually using colorimetric or fluorescence or surface plasmon resonance.
            In certain aspects, the present invention provides methods and agents for modulating
   (stimulating or inhibiting) bone formation and increasing bone mass. Therefore, any
25 compound identified can be tested in whole cells or tissues, in vitro or in vivo, to confirm
   their ability to modulate bone growth or mineralization. Various methods known in the art
   can be utilized for this purpose.
            For example, the effect of the ALK3 or BMP polypeptides or test compounds on bone
   or cartilage growth can be determined by measuring induction of Msx2 or differentiation of
30 osteoprogenitor cells into osteoblasts in cell based assays (see, e.g., Daluiski et al., Nat Genet.
   2001, 27(1):84-8; Hino et al., Front Biosci. 2004, 9:1520-9). Another example of cell-based
   assays includes analyzing the osteogenic activity of the subject ALK3 or BMP polypeptides
                                                   -37-

   and test compounds in mesenchymal progenitor and osteoblastic cells. To illustrate,
   recombinant adenoviruses expressing a BMP or ALK3 polypeptide can be constructed to
   infect pluripotent mesenchymal progenitor C3HIOTI/2 cells, preosteoblastic C2C12 cells,
   and osteoblastic TE-85 cells. Osteogenic activity is then determined by measuring the
 5 induction of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin. and matrix mineralization (see, e.g., Cheng et
   al., J bone Joint Surg Am. 2003, 85-A(8):1544-52).
            The present invention also contemplates in vivo assays to measure bone or cartilage
   growth. For example, Namkung-Matthai et al., Bone, 28:80-86 (200 1) discloses a rat
   osteoporotic model in which bone repair during the early period after fracture is studied.
10 Kubo et al., Steroid Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, 68:197-202 (1999) also discloses a
   rat osteoporotic model in which bone repair during the late period after fracture is studied.
   Andersson et al., J. Endocrinol. 170:529-537 describe a mouse osteoporosis model in which
   mice are ovariectomized, which causes the mice to lose substantial bone mineral content and
   bone mineral density, with the trabecular bone losing roughly 50% of bone mineral density.
15 Bone density could be increased in the ovariectomized mice by administration of factors such
   as parathyroid hormone. In certain aspects, the present invention makes use of fracture
   healing assays that are known in the art. These assays include fracture technique, histological
   analysis, and biomechanical analysis, which are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No.
   6,521,750, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for its disclosure of experimental
20 protocols for causing as well as measuring the extent of fractures, and the repair process.
   6.       Exemplary Therapeutic Uses
            In certain embodiments, BMP-ALK3 antagonists (e.g., ALK3 polypeptides) of the
   present invention can be used for treating or preventing a disease or condition that is
25 associated with bone damage, whether, e.g., through breakage, loss or demineralization. In
   certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods of treating or preventing bone
   damage in an individual in need thereof through administering to the individual a
   therapeutically effective amount of an BMP-ALK3 antagonist, particularly an ALK3
   polypeptide. Given the potential for a dual effect on bone resorption and formation, such
30 compounds may be useful in a wide range of diseases that are currently treated with anabolic
   (e.g., parathyroid hormone and derivatives thereof) or anti-resorptive agents (e.g.,
   bisphosphonates). In certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods of
                                                 -38-

   promoting bone growth or mineralization in an individual in need thereof through
   administering to the individual a therapeutically effective amount of a BMP-ALK3
   antagonist, particularly an ALK3 polypeptide. These methods are optionally aimed at
   therapeutic and prophylactic treatments of animals, and more preferably, humans. In certain
 5 embodiments, the disclosure provides for the use of BMP-ALK3 antagonists (particularly
   soluble ALK3 polypeptides and neutralizing antibodies targeted to BMPs or ALK3) for the
   treatment of disorders associated with low bone density or decreased bone strength.
            As used herein, a therapeutic that "prevents" a disorder or condition refers to a
   compound that, in a statistical sample, reduces the occurrence of the disorder or condition in
10 the treated sample relative to an untreated control sample, or delays the onset or reduces the
   severity of one or more symptoms of the disorder or condition relative to the untreated
   control sample. The term "treating" as used herein includes prophylaxis of the named
   condition or amelioration or elimination of the condition once it has been established. In
   either case, prevention or treatment may be discerned in the diagnosis provided by a
15 physician and the intended result of administration of the therapeutic agent.
           The disclosure provides methods of inducing bone and/or cartilage formation,
   preventing bone loss, increasing bone mineralization or preventing the demineralization of
   bone. For example, the subject BMP-ALK3 antagonists have application in treating bone
   loss disorders, such as osteoporosis and the healing of bone fractures and cartilage defects or
20 other bone defects, injuries and disorders in humans and other animals. ALK3 or BMP
   polypeptides may be useful in patients that are diagnosed with subclinical low bone density,
   as a protective measure against the development of osteoporosis.
            In one specific embodiment, methods and compositions of the present invention may
   find medical utility in the healing of bone fractures and cartilage defects in humans and other
25 animals. The subject methods and compositions may also have prophylactic use in closed as
   well as open fracture reduction and also in the improved fixation of artificial joints. De novo
   bone formation induced by an osteogenic agent contributes to the repair of congenital,
   trauma-induced, or oncologic resection induced craniofacial defects, and also is useful in
   cosmetic plastic surgery. In certain cases, the subject BMP-ALK3 antagonists may provide
30 an environment to attract bone-forming cells, stimulate growth of bone-forming cells or
   induce differentiation of progenitors of bone-forming cells. BMP-ALK3 antagonists of the
   invention may also be useful in the treatment of osteoporosis.
                                                  -39-

            Rosen et al. (ed) Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral
   Metabolism,   7tl ed. American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, Washington D.C.
   (incorporated herein by reference) provides an extensive discussion of bone disorders that
   may be subject to treatment with ALK3-BMP antagonists. A partial listing is provided
 5 herein. Methods and compositions of the invention can be applied to conditions
   characterized by or causing bone loss, such as osteoporosis (including secondary
   osteoporosis), hyperparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease mineral bone disorder, sex
   hormone deprivation or ablation (e.g. androgen and/or estrogen), glucocorticoid treatment,
   rheumatoid arthritis, severe burns, hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia,
10 hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia (including tumor-induced osteomalacia),
   hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, hyperparathyroidism (including familial
   hyperparathyroidism) and pseudohypoparathyroidism, tumor metastases to bone, bone loss as
   a consequence of a tumor or chemotherapy, tumors of the bone and bone marrow (e.g.,
   multiple myeloma), ischemic bone disorders, periodontal disease and oral bone loss,
15 Cushing's disease, Paget's disease, thyrotoxicosis, chronic diarrheal state or malabsorption,
   renal tubular acidosis, or anorexia nervosa. Methods and compositions of the invention may
   also be applied to conditions characterized by a failure of bone formation or healing,
   including non-union fractures, fractures that are otherwise slow to heal, fetal and neonatal
   bone dysplasias (e.g., hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia, calcium receptor defects and vitamin D
20 deficiency), osteonecrosis (including osteonecrosis of the jaw) and osteogenesis imperfecta.
   Additionally, the anabolic effects will cause such antagonists to diminish bone pain
   associated with bone damage or erosion. As a consequence of the anti-resorptive effects,
   such antagonists may be useful to treat disorders of abnormal bone formation, such as
   osteoblastic tumor metastases (e.g., associated with primary prostate or breast cancer),
25 osteogenic osteosarcoma., osteopetrosis, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, endosteal
   hyperostosis. osteopoikilosis, and melorheostosis. Other disorders that may be treated
   include fibrous dysplasia and chondrodysplasias.
           In addition to the foregoing discussion, persons having any of the following profiles
   may be candidates for treatment with an ALK3 antagonist: a post-menopausal woman and
30 not taking estrogen or other hormone replacement therapy; a person with a personal or
   maternal history of hip fracture or smoking; a post-menopausal woman who is tall (over 5
   feet 7 inches) or thin (less than 125 pounds); a man with clinical conditions associated with
   bone loss; a person using medications that are known to cause bone loss, including
                                                  -40-

   corticosteroids such as Prednisone TM, various anti-seizure medications such as DilantinTM and
   certain barbiturates, or high-dose thyroid replacement drugs; a person having type I diabetes,
   liver disease, kidney disease, a family history of osteoporosis; a person having high bone
   turnover (e.g., excessive collagen in urine samples); a person with a thyroid condition, such
 5 as hyperthyroidism; a person who has experienced a fracture after only mild trauma; a person
   who has had x-ray evidence of vertebral fracture or other signs of osteoporosis.
            Osteoporosis (meaning, generally speaking, a state of low bone density or strength)
   may be caused by, or associated with, various factors. Being female, particularly a post
   menopausal female, having a low body weight, and leading a sedentary lifestyle are all risk
10 factors for osteoporosis (loss of bone mineral density, leading to fracture risk).
            Osteoporosis can also result as a condition associated with another disorder or from
   the use of certain medications. Osteoporosis resulting from drugs or another medical
   condition is known as secondary osteoporosis. In a condition known as Cushing's disease,
   the excess amount of cortisol produced by the body results in osteoporosis and fractures. The
15 most common medications associated with secondary osteoporosis are the corticosteroids, a
   class of drugs that act like cortisol, a hormone produced naturally by the adrenal glands.
   Although adequate levels of thyroid hormones (which are produced by the thyroid gland) are
   needed for the development of the skeleton, excess thyroid hormone can decrease bone mass
   over time. Antacids that contain aluminum can lead to bone loss when taken in high doses by
20 people with kidney problems, particularly those undergoing dialysis. Other medications that
   can cause secondary osteoporosis include phenytoin (Dilantin) and barbiturates that are used
   to prevent seizures; methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Immunex, Folex PFS), a drug for some forms
   of arthritis, cancer, and immune disorders; cyclosporine (Sandimmune, Neoral), a drug used
   to treat some autoimmune diseases and to suppress the immune system in organ transplant
25 patients; luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (Lupron, Zoladex), used to treat
   prostate cancer and endometriosis; heparin (Calciparine, Liquaemin), an anticlotting
   medication; and cholestyramine (Questran) and colestipol (Colestid), used to treat high
   cholesterol. Bone loss resulting from cancer therapy is widely recognized and termed cancer
   therapy induced bone loss (CTIBL). Bone metastases can create cavities in the bone that may
30 be corrected by treatment with BMP-ALK3 antagonists.
            Optionally, BMP-ALK3 antagonists, particularly a soluble ALK3, disclosed herein
   may be used in cancer patients. Patients having certain tumors (e.g. prostate, breast, multiple
                                                  -41-

   myeloma or any tumor causing hyperparathyroidism) are at high risk for bone loss due to
   tumor-induced bone loss as well as bone metastases and therapeutic agents. Such patients
   may be treated with BMP-ALK3 antagonists even in the absence of evidence of bone loss or
   bone metastases. Patients may also be monitored for evidence of bone loss or bone
 5 metastases, and may be treated with BMP-ALK3 antagonists in the event that indicators
   suggest an increased risk. Generally, DEXA scans are employed to assess changes in bone
   density, while indicators of bone remodeling may be used to assess the likelihood of bone
   metastases. Serum markers may be monitored. Bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP)
   is an enzyme that is present in osteoblasts. Blood levels of BSAP are increased in patients
10 with bone metastasis and other conditions that result in increased bone remodeling.
   Osteocalcin and procollagen peptides are also associated with bone formation and bone
   metastases. Increases in BSAP have been detected in patients with bone metastasis caused by
   prostate cancer, and to a lesser degree, in bone metastases from breast cancer. Bone
   Morphogenetic Protein-7 (BMP-7) levels are high in prostate cancer that has metastasized to
15 bone, but not in bone metastases due to bladder, skin, liver, or lung cancer. Type I Carboxy
   terminal telopeptide (ICTP) is a crosslink found in collagen that is formed during the
   resorption of bone. Since bone is constantly being broken down and reformed, ICTP will be
   found throughout the body. However, at the site of bone metastasis, the level will be
   significantly higher than in an area of normal bone. ICTP has been found in high levels in
20 bone metastasis due to prostate, lung, and breast cancer. Another collagen crosslink, Type I
   N-terminal telopeptide (NTx), is produced along with ICTP during bone turnover. The
   amount of NTx is increased in bone metastasis caused by many different types of cancer
   including lung, prostate, and breast cancer. Also, the levels of NTx increase with the
   progression of the bone metastasis. Therefore, this marker can be used to both detect
25 metastasis as well as measure the extent of the disease. Other markers of resorption include
   pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline. Any increase in resorption markers or markers of bone
   metastases indicate the need for BMP-ALK3 antagonist therapy in a patient.
           In another embodiment, BMP-ALK3 antagonists may be used in patients with chronic
   kidney disease mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD), a broad syndrome of interrelated
30 skeletal, cardiovascular, and mineral-metabolic disorders arising from kidney disease. CKD
   MBD encompasses various skeletal pathologies often referred to as renal osteodystrophy
   (ROD), which is a preferred embodiment for treatment with BMP-ALK3 antagonists.
   Depending on the relative contribution of diffent pathogenic factors, ROD is manifested as
                                                  -42-

   diverse pathologic patterns of bone remodeling (Hruska et al., 2008, Chronic kidney disease
   mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD); in Rosen et al. (ed) Primer on the Metabolic Bone
   Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism,      7th ed. American Society for Bone and
   Mineral Research, Washington D.C., pp 343-349). At one end of the spectrum is ROD with
 5 uremic osteodystrophy and low bone turnover, characterized by a low number of active
   remodeling sites, profoundly suppressed bone formation, and low bone resorption. At the
   other extreme is ROD with hyperparathyroidism, high bone turnover, and osteitis fibrosa.
   Given that BMP-ALK3 antagonists exert both anabolic and antiresorptive effects, these
   agents may be useful in patients across the ROD pathology spectrum.
10         BMP-ALK3 antagonists may be conjointly administered with other pharmaceutical
   agents. Conjoint administration may be accomplished by administration of a single co
   formulation, by simultaneous administration or by administration at separate times. BMP
   ALK3 antagonists may be particularly advantageous if administered with other bone-active
   agents. A patient may benefit from conjointly receiving BMP-ALK3 antagonist and taking
15 calcium supplements, vitamin D, appropriate exercise and/or, in some cases, other
   medication. Examples of other medications incude, bisphosphonates (alendronate,
   ibandronate and risedronate), calcitonin, estrogens, parathyroid hormone and raloxifene. The
   bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate and risedronate), calcitonin, estrogens and
   raloxifene affect the bone remodeling cycle and are classified as anti-resorptive medications.
20 Bone remodeling consists of two distinct stages: bone resorption and bone formation. Anti
   resorptive medications slow or stop the bone-resorbing portion of the bone-remodeling cycle
   but do not slow the bone-forming portion of the cycle. As a result, new formation continues
   at a greater rate than bone resorption, and bone density may increase over time. Teriparatide,
   a form of parathyroid hormone, increases the rate of bone formation in the bone remodeling
25 cycle. Alendronate is approved for both the prevention (5 mg per day or 35 mg once a week)
   and treatment (10 mg per day or 70 mg once a week) of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
   Alendronate reduces bone loss, increases bone density and reduces the risk of spine, wrist and
   hip fractures. Alendronate also is approved for treatment of glucocorticoid-induced
   osteoporosis in men and women as a result of long-term use of these medications (i.e.,
30 prednisone and cortisone) and for the treatment of osteoporosis in men. Alendronate plus
   vitamin D is approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (70 mg
   once a week plus vitamin D), and for treatment to improve bone mass in men with
   osteoporosis. Ibandronate is approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal
                                                 -43-

   osteoporosis. Taken as a once-a-month pill (150 mg), ibandronate should be taken on the
   same day each month. Ibandronate reduces bone loss, increases bone density and reduces the
   risk of spine fractures. Risedronate is approved for the prevention and treatment of
   postmenopausal osteoporosis. Taken daily (5 mg dose) or weekly (35 mg dose or 35 mg dose
 5 with calcium), risedronate slows bone loss, increases bone density and reduces the risk of
   spine and non-spine fractures. Risedronate also is approved for use by men and women to
   prevent and/or treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis that results from long-term use of
   these medications (i.e., prednisone or cortisone). Calcitonin is a naturally occurring hormone
   involved in calcium regulation and bone metabolism. In women who are more than 5 years
10 beyond menopause, calcitonin slows bone loss, increases spinal bone density, and may
   relieve the pain associated with bone fractures. Calcitonin reduces the risk of spinal fractures.
   Calcitonin is available as an injection (50-100 IU daily) or nasal spray (200 IU daily).
   Estrogen therapy (ET)/Hormone therapy (HT) is approved for the prevention of osteoporosis.
   ET has been shown to reduce bone loss, increase bone density in both the spine and hip, and
15 reduce the risk of hip and spinal fractures in postmenopausal women. ET is administered
   most commonly in the form of a pill or skin patch that delivers a low dose of approximately
   0.3 mg daily or a standard dose of approximately 0.625 mg daily and is effective even when
   started after age 70. When estrogen is taken alone, it can increase a woman's risk of
   developing cancer of the uterine lining (endometrial cancer). To eliminate this risk,
20 healthcare providers prescribe the hormone progestin in combination with estrogen (hormone
   replacement therapy or HT) for those women who have an intact uterus. ET/HT relieves
   menopause symptoms and has been shown to have a beneficial effect on bone health. Side
   effects may include vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, mood disturbances and gallbladder
   disease. Raloxifene, 60 mg a day, is approved for the prevention and treatment of
25 postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is from a class of drugs called Selective Estrogen Receptor
   Modulators (SERMs) that have been developed to provide the beneficial effects of estrogens
   without their potential disadvantages. Raloxifene increases bone mass and reduces the risk of
   spine fractures. Data are not yet available to demonstrate that raloxifene can reduce the risk
   of hip and other non-spine fractures. Teriparatide, a form of parathyroid hormone, is
30 approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men who are at
   high risk for a fracture. This medication stimulates new bone formation and significantly
   increases bone mineral density. In postmenopausal women, fracture reduction was noted in
   the spine, hip, foot, ribs and wrist. In men, fracture reduction was noted in the spine, but there
                                                   -44-

   were insufficient data to evaluate fracture reduction at other sites. Teriparatide is self
   administered as a daily injection for up to 24 months.
   7.       Pharmaceutical Compositions
 5          In certain embodiments, BMP-ALK3 antagonists (e.g., ALK3 polypeptides) of the
   present invention are formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. For example, an
   ALK3 polypeptide can be administered alone or as a component of a pharmaceutical
   formulation (therapeutic composition). The subject compounds may be formulated for
   administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine.
10          In certain embodiments, the therapeutic method of the invention includes
   administering the composition systemically, or locally as an implant or device. When
   administered, the therapeutic composition for use in this invention is, of course, in a pyrogen
   free, physiologically acceptable form. Therapeutically useful agents other than the ALK3
   antagonists which may also optionally be included in the composition as described above,
15 may be administered simultaneously or sequentially with the subject compounds (e.g., ALK3
   polypeptides) in the methods of the invention.
            Typically, ALK3 antagonists will be administered parentally. Pharmaceutical
   compositions suitable for parenteral administration may comprise one or more ALK3
   polypeptides in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic
20 aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders
   which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use,
   which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation
   isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.
   Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the
25 pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as
   glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof,
   vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper
   fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by
   the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of
30 surfactants.
            Further, the composition may be encapsulated or injected in a form for delivery to a
   target tissue site (e.g., bone). In certain embodiments, compositions of the present invention
                                                   -45-

   may include a matrix capable of delivering one or more therapeutic compounds (e.g., ALK3
   polypeptides) to a target tissue site (e.g., bone), providing a structure for the developing tissue
   and optimally capable of being resorbed into the body. For example, the matrix may provide
   slow release of the ALK3 polypeptides. Such matrices may be formed of materials presently
 5 in use for other implanted medical applications.
            The choice of matrix material is based on biocompatibility, biodegradability,
   mechanical properties, cosmetic appearance and interface properties. The particular
   application of the subject compositions will define the appropriate formulation. Potential
   matrices for the compositions may be biodegradable and chemically defined calcium sulfate,
10 tricalciumphosphate, hydroxyapatite, polylactic acid and polyanhydrides. Other potential
   materials are biodegradable and biologically well defined, such as bone or dermal collagen.
   Further matrices are comprised of pure proteins or extracellular matrix components. Other
   potential matrices are non-biodegradable and chemically defined, such as sintered
   hydroxyapatite, bioglass, aluminates, or other ceramics. Matrices may be comprised of
15 combinations of any of the above mentioned types of material, such as polylactic acid and
   hydroxyapatite or collagen and tricalciumphosphate. The bioceramics may be altered in
   composition, such as in calcium-aluminate-phosphate and processing to alter pore size,
   particle size, particle shape, and biodegradability.
            In certain embodiments, methods of the invention can be administered for orally, e.g.,
20 in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually
   sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an
   aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an
   elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and
   acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of an
25 agent as an active ingredient. An agent may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or
   paste.
            In solid dosage forms for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees,
   powders, granules, and the like), one or more therapeutic compounds of the present invention
   may be mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate
30 or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches,
   lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example,
   carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose, and/or acacia; (3)
                                                    -46-

   humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate,
   potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution
   retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium
   compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol
 5 monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such a talc,
   calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and
   mixtures thereof; and (10) coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the
   pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a
   similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using
10 such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene
   glycols and the like.
           Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable
   emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the
   active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the
15 art, such as water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol,
   isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene
   glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive,
   castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid
   esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also
20 include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening,
   flavoring, coloring, perfuming, and preservative agents.
           Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents
   such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol, and sorbitan esters,
   microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth,
25 and mixtures thereof.
           The compositions of the invention may also contain adjuvants, such as preservatives,
   wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of
   microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal
   agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be
30 desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the
   compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may
                                                   -47-

   be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption, such as aluminum
   monostearate and gelatin.
            It is understood that the dosage regimen will be determined by the attending physician
   considering various factors which modify the action of the subject compounds of the
 5 invention (e.g., ALK3 polypeptides). The various factors include, but are not limited to,
   amount of bone weight desired to be formed, the degree of bone density loss, the site of bone
   damage, the condition of the damaged bone, the patient's age, sex, and diet, the severity of
   any disease that may be contributing to bone loss, time of administration, and other clinical
   factors. Optionally, the dosage may vary with the type of matrix used in the reconstitution
10 and the types of compounds in the composition. The addition of other known growth factors
   to the final composition, may also affect the dosage. Progress can be monitored by periodic
   assessment of bone growth and/or repair, for example, X-rays (including DEXA),
   histomorphometric determinations, and tetracycline labeling.
            In certain embodiments, the present invention also provides gene therapy for the in
15 vivo production of ALK3 polypeptides. Such therapy would achieve its therapeutic effect by
   introduction of the ALK3 polynucleotide sequences into cells or tissues having the disorders
   as listed above. Delivery of ALK3 polynucleotide sequences can be achieved using a
   recombinant expression vector such as a chimeric virus or a colloidal dispersion system.
   Preferred for therapeutic delivery of ALK3 polynucleotide sequences is the use of targeted
20 liposomes.
            Various viral vectors which can be utilized for gene therapy as taught herein include
   adenovirus, herpes virus, vaccinia, or, preferably, an RNA virus such as a retrovirus.
   Preferably, the retroviral vector is a derivative of a murine or avian retrovirus. Examples of
   retroviral vectors in which asingle foreign gene can be inserted include, but are not limited
25 to: Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), Harvey urine sarcoma virus (HaMuSV),
   urine mammary tumor virus (MuMTV), and Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV). A number of
   additional retroviral vectors can incorporate multiple genes. All of these vectors can transfer
   or incorporate a gene for a selectable marker so that transduced cells can be identified and
   generated. Retroviral vectors can be made target-specific by attaching, for example, a sugar,
30 a glycolipid, or a protein. Preferred targeting is accomplished by using an antibody. Those
   of skill in the art will recognize that specific polynucleotide sequences can be inserted into
   the retroviral genome or attached to a viral envelope to allow target specific delivery of the
                                                    -48-

   retroviral vector containing the ALK3 polynucleotide. In a preferred embodiment, the vector
   is targeted to bone or cartilage.
            Alternatively, tissue culture cells can be directly transfected with plasmids encoding
   the retroviral structural genes gag, pol and env, by conventional calcium phosphate
 5 transfection. These cells are then transfected with the vector plasmid containing the genes of
   interest. The resulting cells release the retroviral vector into the culture medium.
           Another targeted delivery system for ALK3 polynucleotides is a colloidal dispersion
   system. Colloidal dispersion systems include macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules,
   microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles,
10 mixed micelles, and liposomes. The preferred colloidal system of this invention is a
   liposome. Liposomes are artificial membrane vesicles which are useful as delivery vehicles
   in vitro and in vivo. RNA, DNA and intact virions can be encapsulated within the aqueous
   interior and be delivered to cells in a biologically active form (see e.g., Fraley, et al.. Trends
   Biochem. Sci., 6:77, 1981). Methods for efficient gene transfer using a liposome vehicle, are
15 known in the art, see e.g., Mannino, et al., Biotechniques, 6:682, 1988. The composition of
   the liposome is usually a combination of phospholipids, usually in combination with steroids,
   especially cholesterol. Other phospholipids or other lipids may also be used. The physical
   characteristics of liposomes depend on pH, ionic strength, and the presence of divalent
   cations.
20          Examples of lipids useful in liposome production include phosphatidyl compounds,
   such as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine,
   phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingolipids, cerebrosides, and gangliosides. Illustrative
   phospholipids include egg phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and
   distearoylphosphatidylcholine. The targeting of liposomes is also possible based on, for
25 example, organ-specificity, cell-specificity, and organelle-specificity and is known in the art.

   Example 1. Generation of ALK3-Fc Fusion Proteins
            The amino acid sequence and corresponding nucleotide sequence for native human
   ALK3 are shown in Figures 1, 2. Applicants designed an ALK3-hFc fusion protein in which
   the extracellular domain (native residues 24-152) of human ALK3 (Figures 3, 4) is fused C
 5 terminally with a human Fe domain (Figures 5, 6) via a minimal linker (comprised of amino
   acid residues TGGG) to yield the protein shown in Figure 7. The following three leader
   sequences were considered:
            (i) Native: MPQLYIYIRLLGAYLFIISRVQG (SEQ ID NO: 8)
            (ii) Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA): MDAMKRGLCCVLLLCGAVFVSP

            (iii) Honey bee melittin (HBML): MKFLVNVALVFMVVYISYIYA (SEQ ID NO:
    10)
   The selected form of hALK3(24-152)-hFc (SEQ ID NO: 11) employs the TPA leader and has
   the unprocessed amino-acid sequence shown in Figure 8. A sense nucleotide sequence
15 encoding this fusion protein and the corresponding antisense sequence are indicated in
   Figure 9. Shown below is an alternative sense nucleotide sequence encoding hALK3(24
    152)-hFc, which incorporates a C-T substitution at position 1137 (underlined) that does not
   alter the amino acid sequence.

           A variant of hALK3(24-152)-Fc with the TPA leader and with murine Fe substituted
   for human Fe is shown in Figure 10. A sense nucleotide sequence encoding this variant and
20 its corresponding antisense sequence are indicated in Figure 11. Applicants constructed a
   form of hALK3(24-152)-mFc having an asparagine at position 71 (position 70 in the native
   ALK3 ECD sequence). The protein was expressed in CHO cell lines, and N-terminal
   sequencing revealed a primary species with an N-terminal block, indicating a start at the
   native glutamine (Q) residue, consistent with the protein of SEQ ID NO:7, and a single minor
25 sequence of GAQNLDSMLHGTGMK (SEQ ID NO: 17). Applicants additionally
   constructed a hALK3(24-152)-hFc protein having the native ALK3 sequence. Another
   ALK3-Fc variant comprising the murine ALK3 extracellular domain (native residues 24-152
   in the murine precursor) and murine Fe domain was generated by similar methods. The
   amino acid sequence of this variant, mALK3(24-152)-mFc, is shown below with the ALK3

   Example 2. Ligand Binding to ALK3-Fc
            BiacoreTM methodology was used to determine the binding affinity of ALK3-Fc
10 fusion proteins for more than 15 members of the BMP/GDF family. mALK3-mFc derived
   from HEK 293 cells displayed high-affinity binding to hBMP2 and hBMP4 (KD = 2.43 x 10
   and 9.47 x 10.10, respectively), as well as moderate-affinity binding to several other ligands,
   including hBMP6 and hBMP7. hALK3(24-152)-hFc displayed asimilar binding profile.
   Specifically, hALK3(24-152)-hFe derived from HEK 293 cells bound to hBMP2 and hBMP4
15 with KDS of 6.53 x 10-10 and 1.02 x 10-9, respectively, while hALK3(24-152)-hFc derived
   from CHO cells bound to hBMP2 and hBMP4 with KDs of 4.53 x 1010 and 7.03 x 10.0,
   respectively. Like mALK3(24-152)-mFc, hALK3(24-152)-hFc derived from both cell types
   exhibited moderate affinity binding to hBMP6 and hBMP7, among other ligands.
            The overall selectivity of ALK3-Fc for BMP2 and BMP4 is notable. While not
20 wishing to be bound to any particular mechanism, Applicants hypothesize, based on these
   results, that ALK3-Fc exerts its effects in vivo primarily by binding BMP2 and BMP4 and
   thereby inhibiting signaling by these ligands. Accordingly, it is predicted that antibodies
   against BMP2 and/or BMP4 would also stimulate bone formation. Alternatively, an antibody
   against the ALK3 ligand-binding domain would be expected to inhibit ALK3-mediated
25 signaling more broadly. Figure 18 shows diagrammatically examples of three approaches
   proposed here to interfere with signaling by BMP2, BMP4, and potentially additional ligands
   for the purpose of promoting bone formation.
            A series of ALK3-Fc proteins incorporating truncated variants of the human ALK3
   extracellular domain (ECD) were generated and compared with hALK3(24-152)-hFc for their
30 ligand binding affinities. ALK3 ECD variants with N-terminal deletions of 6, 12, 27, or 31
   amino acids, C-terminal deletions of 6 or 12 amino acids, and a double-truncation were
   expressed in HEK 293 cells and purified by Mab chromatography (Protein A column).

           As shown above, the C-terminal truncations that were evaluated display similar or
   increased binding affinity for BMP2/BMP4 compared to full-length ALK3 ECD, with
   generally reduced binding to BMP6/BMP7, although ALK3CA12 retains binding to BMP7 at
   an affinity similar to the full-length ALK3 ECD. In contrast, N-terminal truncations tend to
10 reduce binding to BMP2, abolish binding to BMP4, and display varying effects on binding to
   BMP6/BMP7. Interestingly, the double-truncated variant ALK3NA6CA6 displays increased
   affinity for BMP2/BMP4 compared to full-length ALK3 ECD, in combination with
   undetectable binding to BMP6/BMP7.          Molecules with greater selectivity for the desired
   targets, BMP2 and BMP4 are useful because they will have fewer "off target" effects in
15 patients. N-terminal sequencing demonstrated that the nucleic acid encoding a six amino acid
   truncation at the N-terminus, when expressed in cell culture, gave rise to a population of
   polypeptides having the six amino acid truncation and a population of polypeptides having a
   seven amino acid truncation. Taken together, these demonstrate that hALK3-hFc
   polypeptides containing up to a seven amino acid truncation at the N-terminus and up to a
                                                    -53-

   twelve amino acid truncation at the C-terminus retain useful activity and demonstrate the
   desirable and surprising reduction in binding to off-target ligands. Thus, an ALK3
   polypeptide comprising at least amino acids 8 to 117 of SEQ ID NO:3 may be used for the
   purposes described herein.
 5          Ligand binding properties were used to compare the quality of hALK3(24-152)-hFc
   protein derived from CHO cells with that derived from HEK 293 cells. As determined by
   BiacoreTM methodology, the affinity (Kd) of BMP2 for hALK3(24-152)-hFc did not differ
   depending on the source of fusion protein; however, the percentage of active protein
   generated by CHO cells was higher than that of HEK 293 cells based on their respective
10 Rmax values. Rmax is a measure of protein quality equal to (MWA/MWL) x RL x SM, where
   MWA     is the molecular weight of analyte, MWL is the molecular weight of ligand, RL in the
   immobilization level in response units, and SM is the molar stoichiometry. Corresponding
   analysis of BMP4 binding revealed that protein derived from CHO cells exhibited higher
   affinity for BMP4 than did that from HEK 293 cells (Kos of 314 pM vs. 1020 pM,
15 respectively), and the Rmax value for protein generated by CHO cells was three times that for
   protein from HEK 293 cells, again indicating a higher percentage of active protein.
   Therefore, unexpected benefits of CHO cells as the source of hALK3(24-152)-hFc protein
   include higher binding affinity of protein to BMP4 and greater bioavailability predicted to
   result from higher protein quality (Rmax value).

   Example 3. hALK3-mFc Improves Bone Status in Mice
            Applicants investigated the ability of a version of ALK3-mFc to improve bone status
   in mice. Twelve-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (n = 8 per group) were treated with
   hALK3(24-152)-mFc, 10 mg/kg, or vehicle (Tris-buffered saline) by intraperitoneal injection
25 twice per week for a total of six weeks. Compared to vehicle, hALK3(24-152)-mFc
   significantly increased whole-body bone density, as determined by dual energy x-ray
   absorptiometry (DEXA), by Day 31 and maintained this effect through study completion on
   Day 42 (Figure 12). A similar effect of hALK3(24-l 52)-mFc treatment on bone density was
   observed for localized analysis of lumbar vertebrae by DEXA at these same time points
30 (Figure 13). In addition, high-resolution measurements of the tibial shaft and proximal tibia
   were conducted by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to determine the effect of
   hALK3(24-152)-mFe on cortical bone and trabecular bone, respectively. As compared to
                                                   -54-

   vehicle, hALK3(24-1 52)-mFc treatment significantly increased: i) thickness of cortical bone
   by Week 6 (Figure 14), ii) volume of trabecular bone by Week 4 (Figure 15), and iii) mean
   trabecular thickness by Week 4 (Figure 16). Representative three-dimensional
   reconstructions of micro-CT-generated sections through the proximal tibia (Figure 17)
 5 underscore the robust stimulatory effect of hALK(24-152)-mFc treatment (4 weeks) on
   trabecular bone microarchitecture. Importantly, hALK(24-152)-mFc treatment did not cause
   significant changes in lean tissue mass, fat mass, or red blood cell mass over the course of the
   study.
           Taken together, the foregoing data demonstrate that hALK3(24-152)-mFc can be used
10 in vivo to selectively improve bone status through increased bone mineral density and
   increased net formation of both cortical and trabecular bone.
   Example 4. hALK3-mFe Increases Bone Strength in Mice
           In the experiment described in Example 3, Applicants also investigated the ability of
15 hALK3(24-152)-mFc to increase bone strength. After 6 weeks of dosing, femurs were
   collected and stored frozen at -20"C. Bones were later thawed to ambient temperature, and
   destructive four-point bend tests were performed on the left femur midshaft with an Instron
   mechanical testing instrument (Instron 4465 retrofitted to 5500). Separation between the
   fixed supports was 7 mm, and separation between the two points of load application was 2.5
20 mm. Load was applied at a constant displacement rate of 3 mm/min until bone breakage, and
   maximum load, stiffness, and energy absorption data were calculated with Bluehill v 2.5
   software. Compared to vehicle, hALK3(24-152)-mFc significantly increased maximum bone
   load by 30% (Figure 19), bone stiffness by 14% (Figure 20), and energy to bone failure by
   32% (Figure 21). These findings demonstrate that increased bone strength accompanies the
25 improvement in bone composition observed with hALK3(24-152)-mFc treatment (Example
   3).
   Example 5. Effects of mALK3-mFc on Bone in an OVX Mouse Model of Osteopenia
           Estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women promotes bone loss, particularly loss
30 of trabecular bone. Therefore, Applicants investigated the ability of mALK3(24-152)-mFc to
   improve bone status in an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model of osteopenia with
                                                 -55-

   established bone loss. Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice underwent bilateral OVX or
   sham surgery, then remained untreated for an eight-week interval. At the end of eight weeks,
   baseline measurements by micro-CT and DEXA confirmed significant bone loss in the OVX
   mice compared to sham treatment. Most notable was a 43% reduction in trabecular bone
 5 volume (Figure 22, Day 0 time point), as determined in the proximal tibia by micro-CT.
   Mice were then treated with mALK3(24-152)-nFc, 10 mg/kg, or vehicle (Tris-buffered
   saline), by ip injection twice per week for 8 weeks.
           Treatment with mALK3(24-I52)-mFc led to improvement in both trabecular and
   cortical bone despite continuing estrogen deficiency. By study completion on Day 56,
10 trabecular bone volume in the proximal tibia of OVX mice treated with mALK3(24-152)
   mFc was increased by nearly 250% compared to OVX controls and by more than 80%
   compared to sham controls (Figure 22). mALK3(24-152)-mFc treatment also caused growth
   of cortical bone, as indicated by increased cortical thickness (Figure 23) and reduced
   endosteal circumference (Figure 24) in the tibial shaft compared to OVX controls. These
15 improvements were accompanied by increased bone mineral density. Compared to OVX
   controls, mALK3(24-I52)-mFc treatment significantly increased whole-body bone mineral
   density (as determined by DEXA) by Day 14 and maintained this improvement through study
   completion (Figure 25). Similar effects of mALK3(24-152)-mFc treatment were observed
   on mineral density in the lumbar spine (Figure 26) and femur-tibia (Figure 27). Three
20 dimensional images of vertebral trabecular bone derived from micro-CT analysis (Figure 28)
   underscore the robust improvement in bone status associated with mALK3(24-152)-mFc
   treatment despite ongoing estrogen deficiency. These findings demonstrate that mALK3(24
   152)-mFc can reverse the deterioration of bone, including trabecular bone, associated with
   estrogen withdrawal in a mouse model of osteopenia. The ability of mALK3(24-152)-mFc to
25 transform bone from an osteopenic condition to one which surpasses the quantity (Figures
   22-24, 28) and matches the quality (Figures 25-27) of bone in gonad-intact controls is
   evidence that this agent exerts effects which are not only antiresorptive but anabolic.
   Example 6. Effects of mALK3-mFc on Bone Histomorphometry and Serum
30 Biomarkers in Mice
            In a separate study, Applicants investigated the ability of mALK3-mFc to improve
   bone status in mice as assessed by histomorphometry and serum biomarkers. Twelve-week
                                                   -56-

   old female C57BL/6 mice were treated with mALK3(24-152)-mFc, 10 mg/kg, or vehicle
   (Tris-buffered saline) by intraperitoneal injection twice per week. Cohorts of mice were
   necropsied after 14, 28, and 42 days of treatment to permit collection of bone and serum. The
   fluorescent compounds calcein (20 mg/kg) and demeclocycline (20 mg/kg) were
 5 administered intraperitoneally to mice 9 days and 2 days before necropsy, respectively, for
   dynamic histomorphometric analysis.
            Bone was prepared for histomorphometry as follows. At necropsy, the right femur
   was detached, and the distal quarter of the femur underwent histological preparation
   consisting of dehydration, infiltration by methylmethacrylate, and embedding in
10 methylmethacrylate. A rotary microtome was used to obtain sets of frontal sections at
   thicknesses of 4 and 8 pmi.   The thinner sections were stained with Goldner's trichrome and
   used for analysis of static parameters, whereas the thicker sections were mounted unstained
   and used for analysis of dynamic parameters. Histomorphometry was performed in a
   treatment-blind manner with a Nikon Eclipse E4000 light/epifluorescent microscope
15 connected to a video subsystem running OsteoMeasure image analysis software.
            Histomorphometric analysis of the distal femur revealed both anabolic and
   antiresorptive effects of ALK3-Fc. Compared to vehicle, mALK3(24-152)-mFc significantly
   increased bone volume at all three time points by up to 90% (Figure 29). Importantly,
   mALK3(24-152)-mFc increased bone formation rate by as much as 120% (Figure 30) and
20 bone mineralizing surface by as much as 115% (Figure 31). These latter parameters are
   considered to be indicative of anabolic bone growth, although additional markers of anabolic
   effects - osteoblast surface and osteoid surface - showed more modest or negligible
   increases. Histomorphometric analysis also provided evidence of temporal antiresorptive
   effects, as mALK3(24-152)-mFc reduced osteoclast surface significantly at Day 28 only
25 (Figure 32), and a similar effect on eroded surface was observed.
            Effects of mALK3(24-152)-mFc treatment on serum biomarkers of bone status were
   also investigated. RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-KB ligand) is produced by
   osteoblasts and is a key activator of osteoclast differentiation, whereas osteoprotegerin (OPG)
   is an endogenous inhibitor of RANKL signaling. Thus, the RANKL/OPG ratio is an
30 important determinant of osteoclastic activity, bone mass, and bone quality (Boyce et al.,
   2008, Arch Biochem Biophys 473:139-146). In the present experiment, serum levels of
   RANKL and OPG were measured with Millipore products (MBN2A-41K and MBN-41K
                                                  -57-

    IOPG) incorporating Luminex xMAP@ technology. mALK3(24-152)-mFc treatment
   significantly reduced serum RANKL levels at all three time points (Figure 33) and
   significantly increased serum OPG levels at 28 and 42 days (Figure 34) compared to vehicle.
   These results indicate that mALK3(24-152)-mFc treatment stimulates bone formation in part
 5 through an antiresorptive action.
   Example 7. Effects of mALK3-mFe on Sclerostin Gene Expression in Mice
           Sclerostin protein is a key negative regulator of bone formation, and interference with
   sclerostin signaling has been reported to exert anabolic effects on bone in vivo (Li et al.,
10 2009, J Bone Miner Res 24:578-588). Applicants therefore investigated whether
   mALK3(24-1 52)-mFc treatment in vivo alters sclerostin gene expression in bone and thus
   whether a reduction in sclerostin levels could potentially mediate some of the bone-rebuilding
   effects of ALK3-Fc. Twelve-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were treated with mALK3(24
   152)-mFc or vehicle (PBS) by intraperitoneal injection twice per week. Cohorts of mice
15 were necropsied after 2, 7, 14, and 28 days of treatment to permit bilateral collection of
   femurs and tibias, which were separated and cleaned of any residual muscle or connective
   tissue.
           Sclerostin gene expression was analyzed as follows. Bones were trimmed to expose
   the interior marrow shaft, and marrow cells were flushed out with sterile saline using a 21
20 gauge needle attached to a 3-mL syringe. The femurs and tibias from each mouse were
   pulverized together, and RNA was extracted from the resulting powder with a Ribopure kit
   (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA integrity in bone samples was
   confirmed with RNA Nano Chips (Agilent Technologies) run on an Agilent Technologies
   2100 Bioanalyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed
25 using TaqMan RT reagents (Applied Biosystems), and real-time polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) was performed with sclerostin probe/primers and Eukaryotic I8S rRNA Endogenous
   Control (both from Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were performed with an Applied
   Biosystems 7300 System, and results were analyzed using the 2 -AACt method.
           Compared to vehicle, treatment with mALK3(24-152)-mFc reduced bone levels of
30 sclerostin mRNA significantly at three of the four time points investigated (Figure 35). This
   finding indicates that reduced expression of sclerostin may contribute to the anabolic and/or
   antiresorptive effects of mALK3(24-152)-mFc on bone.
                                                  -58-

   Example 8. Effect of hALK3-hFc on Bone Status in Mice
            Applicants investigated effects of the human construct hALK3(24-152)-hFc on bone
   status in mice. Twelve-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (n = 6 per group) were treated with
 5 hALK3(24-1 52)-hFec. 10 mg/kg, or vehicle (Tris-buffered saline) by intraperitoneal injection
   twice per week for a total of 6 weeks. Over the course of the experiment, trabecular bone
   volume decreased nearly 20% in vehicle-treated controls but increased more than 80% with
   hALK3(24-152)-hFc treatment, as determined by micro-CT analysis of the proximal tibia
   (Figure 36). Significant increases from baseline in trabecular number (34%) and trabecular
10 thickness (20%) were also observed with hALK3(24-152)-hFc, but not vehicle, by study
   conclusion. Compared to vehicle, hALK3(24-152)-hFc significantly increased whole-body
   bone mineral density, as determined by DEXA, at study conclusion. Localized analysis of
   lumbar vertebrae (LI-L6) by DEXA also revealed a significant stimulatory effect (21%
   increase) of hALK3(24-152)-hFc on bone mineral density at study conclusion compared to
15 vehicle.
           These results demonstrate that the human construct hALK3(24-152)-hFc can improve
   bone status in mice, although it is expected that the magnitude of its effects in rodents would
   be blunted by an immune response. Collectively, the foregoing findings demonstrate that
   ALK3-Fc constructs I) promote bone formation in both the axial skeleton and appendicular
20 skeleton through both antiresorptive and anabolic actions, 2) improve bone mechanical
   strength, and 3) reverse bone loss induced by estrogen deficiency in a mouse model of
   established osteopenia.
