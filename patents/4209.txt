 [00011 This application claims priority to U.S.          Provisional Patent Application No.
 61/771,616 entitled "TRAILER SIGNAL CONVERTER," filed on March 1, 2013, which is
 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [0002] The present invention relates generally to a signal converter and, more particularly, to
 an improved trailer signal converter for interfacing with a towing vehicle
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 [0003] Towed vehicles, such as trailers, have brake signals that operate based on the braking
 signals of the towing vehicle. As is well known in the art, the braking signals of the towing
vehicle are electrically connected to the braking system of the towed vehicle, such as via an
electrical adapter, or the like. Typically, the signaling system of the towing vehicle has a
signal lamp and a brake lamp that are operated by at least two separate filaments. However,
most trailer signal systems usually combine the turn and brake signals into a single lamp with
a single filament. Accordingly, an adapter or circuitry is often required in order to interface
the signal system of the towing vehicle with the signal system of the towed vehicle or trailer.
                                                   I eL.

  WO 2014/134609                                                                 PCT/US2014/019948
  [0004] Older model towing vehicles, such as pickup trucks, typically use a switch on the
  brake pedal to activate the brake lights. The switch is configured to send a signal, such as a
  12 volt signal, to the vehicle's braking system or light controls. A towed vehicle may
  interface with the light signals of the towing vehicle, either directly or through a converter, to
 provide signals to the lights of the towed vehicle.
  [0005] Trailer brake controllers are sometimes after-market devices that are designed to
 interface with the braking system of a towing vehicle and provide braking signals and light
 signals to a towed vehicle. Such trailer brake controllers commonly include a manual control
 to apply the brakes of the towed vehicle. When such action is taken, the lights of the towed
 vehicle must be activated. To activate the lights, trailer brake controllers are often configured
 to apply a voltage to the signal wire of the brake pedal switch. As described above, this signal
 activates the towing vehicle brake lights which in turn activates the towed vehicle brake
 lights. The towed vehicle brake lights are commonly the turn-signal lights activated together.
 [0006] Newer model towing vehicles have replaced the brake pedal switch with a pedal
position sensor. The pedal position sensor does not use the same 12 volt signal that was
previously used with the pedal switch, but instead uses a signal that lacks the low impedance
and voltage to drive the stop lamp input of the trailer brake controller. The sensor signal is
then used as an input into a controller on the towing vehicle. This new design poses a
problem for brake controllers, in that they are no longer able to receive the stop lamp signal
when the towing vehicle brakes are applied.
[0007J In addition, on older model vehicles, the 12 volt signal from the pedal was able to be
used to drive the brake lights on the towing vehicle directly, and therefore was able to also
drive the trailer lights through a relay output. However, on newer model vehicles the pedal
position sensor does not provide an adequate output to drive the lights and is not readily
                                                  2

   WO 2014/134609                                                               PCTUS2014/019948
  accessible. This new design poses a problem for brake controllers, in that they are no longer
  able to communicate the appropriate signal when the manual brake controls are applied.
  [0008] Some towing vehicle manufacturers have provided an alternate access point to the
  stop lamp input signal. However, this output may not have the low impedance required to
  drive the stop lamp input of the brake controller. In addition, the alternate access point does
  not provide any means for the brake controller to drive the towing or towed vehicle brake
  lights.
  [0009] In certain jurisdictions, alternative wiring and lighting systems are used to signal
 trailer braking. For example, in some countries, the trailer vehicle brake lights include both
 an amber light to indicate a turn signal and a red light to indicate a stop signal. Therefore, it is
 further required that a converter must be capable of outputting signals to drive both the turn
 signal light and the stop signal light on each side of the trailer.
 100101 Therefore, an improved solution is needed.
                                            SUMMARY
 [00111 A trailer signal converter is generally provided. The signal converter includes a
 plurality of inputs, including a first towing vehicle turn light signal, a second towing vehicle
turn light signal, and a trailer brake signal. The trailer signal converter further includes one or
more output signals to the trailer vehicle.
 [00121 In an embodiment, the trailer signal converter is configured to interface with a two
wire system on the trailer. The output signals may include a first trailer vehicle turn light
signal output and a second trailer vehicle turn light signal output. The trailer signal converter
may be configured to turn on both the first and second trailer vehicle turn lights when both
the first and second towing vehicle turn light signals are on and the trailer brake signal is off,

  or when the trailer brake signal is on and both the first and second towing vehicle turn light
  signals are off. Further, the trailer signal converter may be configured to flash the first trailer
  vehicle turn light and turn on the second trailer vehicle turn light when the trailer brake signal
  is on and the first towing vehicle turn light signal is flashing and the second towing vehicle
  turn light signal is off.
  [0013] In an embodiment, the trailer signal converter is configured to interface with a three
  wire system on the trailer. The output signals may include a first stop light output and a
  second stop light output. The first and second stop light outputs may turn on anytime the
 brake control signal from the brake controller is on.

  WO 2014/134609                                                            PCT/US2014/019948
                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
  [00191 While the invention is described herein with reference to several embodiments, it
  should be clear that the invention should not be limited only to the embodiments disclosed or
  discussed. The description of the embodiments herein is illustrative of the invention and
 should not limit the scope of the invention as described or claimed.
  [0020] As shown in FIGS. I and 2, a system for controlling the brake and stop lights of a
 trailer vehicle is generally presented. The system may include various components, as
 described below. The components may be standard components on a towing vehicle, such as
 a truck or automobile, or after-market components configured to be integrated with the
 components of a towing vehicle.
 100211 The system includes a brake controller 10 configured to operate the brakes of a towed
 vehicle or trailer. The brake controller 10 may be an after-market brake controller 10 installed
 on the towing vehicle, or may be integrated with the braking system of a towing vehicle.
 Whether integrated or aftermarket, the brake controller 10 may provide a brake output signal
to the brakes of the towed vehicle or trailer.
 [00221 In an embodiment, the brake output signal may be a pulse-width modulated (PWM)
signal sent to the trailer brakes. The trailer brakes may be electric brakes configured to be
receive a PWM signal. The PWM signal may vary in duty cycle depending on the braking
power to be applied by the trailer brakes. For example, a signal with an increased duty cycle
may provide increased braking power over a signal with a lesser duty cycle.
[00231 The brake controller 10 may be configured to receive a signal from a brake pedal 12
of the towing vehicle. Specifically, the brake controller 10 may receive a signal from a pedal
position switch 14 located near the brake pedal. The pedal position switch 14 may output a
                                                 5

  WO 2014/134609                                                             PCT/US2014/019948
  signal when the pedal 12 is depressed to a preset distance. The signal may be a low voltage,
  low power signal.
  100241 The brake controller 10 may receive the input signal from the pedal position switch 14
  and output the PWM brake output signal to the trailer brakes. The duty cycle of the PWM
  brake output signal may be based on any appropriate factors, such as acceleration,
  deceleration, speed, brake pedal position, or any other parameters.
  [00251 The brake controller 10 may be connected to a brake control plug 16 on the towing
 vehicle. The brake control plug 16 may interface with the towing vehicle and include both
 inputs from the towing vehicle and outputs from the brake controller 10. As shown, the brake
 control plug 16 may provide a power input signal 18, such as a 12 volt signal, from the
 towing vehicle battery 20. The brake control plug 16 may also include a ground signal 22 and
 a brake output signal 24. The brake output signal 24 may be a discreet signal, such as a 12
 volt signal, or a PWM signal.
 100261 The brake controller 10 may include a manual trailer brake activation, such as a
 button or lever. Engaging the button or lever may activate the trailer brakes without
 activating the towing vehicle brakes. When the manual brake button is pushed, the brake
controller 10 may activate the brake output signal 24. The signal 24 may then be sent to the
trailer to engage the trailer brakes, independent of any braking signal applied to the towing
vehicle brakes.
(0027 The towing vehicle may include a braking signal connector, such as a 7-pin connector
26. The 7-pin connector 26 may include a plurality of wires to carry signals from the towing
vehicle, including a right turn/stop output 28 and a left turn/stop output 30 from the vehicle.
The towing vehicle may drive the right and left tum/stop output signals 28, 30 and therefore,
these signals cannot be driven by the brake controller 10. Because the brake controller 10 no
                                                  6

  WO 2014/134609                                                                 PCTUS2014/019948
  longer has access to directly drive the brake lamps on the towing or towed vehicle, an
 additional component may be required in order to initiate the trailer brake light in response to
 the manual brake activation.
  100281 In an embodiment, the towing vehicle may provide a right turn/stop light output 28
 and a left turn/stop light output 30 to provide signals to a trailer with a 2-wire system with
 combined stop and turn lights. In an embodiment, the towing vehicle may provide a right turn
 light, left turn light, and stop light outputs to provide signals to a trailer with a 3-wire system
 having a separate stop and turn light on each tail light. For each configuration, the tail lights
 may require an additional component to initiate the appropriate lighting when the manual
 brake activation is applied.
 [00291 In an embodiment, the system may include a signal converter 32. The signal converter
 32 may be configured to receive inputs from both the vehicle and the brake controller 10 and
 drive the signal light outputs to the trailer. The signal converter 32 may be configured to
receive inputs from both the vehicle and the brake controller and drive the right and left
tum/stop output signals to trailers with a two-wire connection. Alternatively, the signal
converter 32 may be configured to drive the separate turn and stop lights on a three-wire
system. For example, the signal converter 32 may be configured to drive the stop lights while
the right-turn and left-turn signals are passed through in the three-wire configuration, as
further described below.
[00301 As shown in FIG. 1, the right and left turn/stop signals 28, 30 may be cut or spliced
before they reach the 7-pin connector. The signal wires 28, 30 may then be connected and
used as inputs to the signal converter 32. In an embodiment, the right and left turn/stop
signals 28, 30 may pass through the converter instead of being cut or spliced.
                                                    7

   WO 2014/134609                                                              PCT/US2014/019948
   [00311 In order to drive the trailer brake lights, the signal converter 32 must also receive a
   signal from the brake controller 10 indicating when the manual brake is activated. One
  solution is to run a wire from the brake controller 10, often located in the cab of the vehicle,
  to the signal converter 32, often located near the rear of the vehicle. Alternatively, the signal
  converter 32 may utilize the brake signal output 24 of the brake controller 10 as an input. For
  example, the signal converter may access the brake signal output 24 at the 7-pin connector
  26. In an embodiment, the brake output signal wire 24 may be spliced to provide both a
  signal to the trailer brakes and an input to the signal converter 32 in response to activation of
  the brake controller manual brake.
  [00321 The signal converter 32 may be configured to read and decode the PWM signal of the
 brake output signal 24, For example, the signal converter 32 may be programmed with preset
 duty cycle thresholds or ranges to determine when the PWM input signal is in a stop
 condition. In an embodiment, the signal converter 32 may be programmed to read a braking
 condition when the duty cycle of the brake output signal 24 is between 7% and 97%.
 However, it will be appreciated that the trailer signal converter 32 may apply any appropriate
 duty cycle threshold or range in determining a braking condition.
 100331 With reference to the circuit diagram in FIG. 1, the signal converter 32 may be
 configured to selectively output the right and left stop/turn output signals 34, 36, as required
 in a two-wire configuration. When only the right stop/turn signal 28 or only the left stop/turn
signal 30 is on (such as flashing), and the manual brake is not activated, the signal converter
32 may act as a pass-through for the left and right stop/turn signals 28, 30 to turn on or flash
the left and right stop/tum output signals 34, 36. When both of the left and right stop/turn
signals 28, 30 are on, and the manual brake is not activated, the signal converter 32 may also
act as a pass-through for the left and right stop/turn signals 28, 30.

  WO 2014/134609                                                                  PCT/US2014/019948
  [00341 When the manual brake is activated, the signal converter 32 receives a signal
  indicating that the manual brake is activated. The signal converter 32 will turn on the right
  and left stop/turn signals 28, 30 anytime the manual brake is activated unless one of the turn
  signals is engaged. If a turn signal is engaged, then the turn signal side will flash on both the
 vehicle and the trailer, while the opposite light will stay active only on the trailer.
  [0035] When the brake control signal 24 is activated and both the right and left towing
 vehicle turn signals 28, 30 are on, trailer signal converter 32 may flash the left and right
 trailer vehicle turn lights. Alternatively, when the brake control signal 24 is activated and
 both the right and left towing vehicle turn signals 28, 30 are on, trailer signal converter 32
 may hold the left and right trailer vehicle turn lights on.
 10036J In an embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, the signal converter 32 may be configured to
 interface with a three-wire system. For example, the signal converter 32 may be configured to
 drive a separate stop lights 38 in addition to the right and left turn signal lights 34, 36.
 100371 FIG. 3 illustrates a signal converter 32 having a plurality of inputs and a single output.
The inputs may be received from the towing vehicle and output to the 7-pin connector 26 on
the tow vehicle which connects to the trailer. The wires on the input side of the signal
converter 32 may include the right and left tow vehicle turn signals 28, 30, the brake signal
24 and stop light 25, as well as a tail light signal, reverse signal, and a ground signal. While
FIG. 3 illustrates only two wires connected as inputs to the signal converter 32, it will be
appreciated that the signal converter 32 may be configured to receive any number of signals
as inputs, or all the signals as inputs. The signal converter 32 may act as a pass through for
any signals other than the inputs described below and may pass the signals onto the trailer.
Further, the signal converter may act as a buffer for all the signals to provide over-current,
shorting, and over-temperature protection.

   WO 2014/134609                                                                PCT/US2014/019948
   100381 In the three-wire system, the signal converter 32 may act as a pass through for the
   right vehicle turn signal 28 and left vehicle turn signal 30. In other words, anytime the right
  tow vehicle turn signal 28 is on the right trailer turn signal 34 will be on, and anytime the left
  tow vehicle turn signal 30 is on the left trailer turn signal 36 will be on. The right and left
  stop light signals 38, 40 will turn on anytime the brake signal 24 is on. Alternatively, as
  shown in FIG. 3, the right and left tow vehicle turn signals 28, 30 may run directly through
  the 7-pin connector 26 instead of inputs to the signal converter 32, as illustrated in FIG. 3.
  100391 The signal converter 32 may include two input signals, namely the trailer brake signal
  24, and a stop light signal 25. As described above, the trailer brake signal may come from the
  trailer brake controller 10 and may be a PWM signal. The trailer signal converter 32 may
  apply a threshold or range to the PWM signal duty cycle to determine a braking condition, as
  explained above.
  [0040 The stop light signal 25 may be tied to the towing vehicle brake light signal. The stop
 light signal 25 may turn on anytime the towing vehicle brakes are applied.
 10041] The signal converter 32 may drive the stop light signal 38 based the trailer brake
 signal 24 and tail light signal 25. When either the trailer brake signal 24 or stop light signal
 25 are on, the signal converter may turn the stop light signal 38 on. Further, when both the
 trailer brake signal 24 and stop light signal 25 are on, the signal converter may turn the stop
 light signal 38 on.
