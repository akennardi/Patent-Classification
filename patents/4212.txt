                                             BACKGROUND
             As demand for petroleum increases, so too does interest in renewable feedstocks for
    manufacturing biofuels and biochemicals. The use of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock
    for such manufacturing processes has been studied since the 1970s. Lignocellulosic biomass
10  is attractive because it is abundant, renewable, domestically produced, and does not compete
    with food industry uses.
             Many potential lignocellulosic feedstocks are available today, including agricultural
    residues, woody biomass, municipal waste, oilseeds/cakes and sea weeds, to name a few. At
    present these materials are either used as animal feed, biocompost materials are burned in a
15  cogeneration facility or are landfilled.
             Lignocellulosic biomass comprises crystalline cellulose fibrils embedded in a
    hemicellulose matrix, surrounded by lignin. This produces a compact matrix that is difficult
    to access by enzymes and other chemical, biochemical and biological processes. Cellulosic
    biomass materials (i.e., biomass material from which the lignin has been removed) is more
20  accessible to enzymes and other conversion processes, but even so, naturally-occurring
    cellulosic materials often have low yields (relative to theoretical yields) when contacted with
    hydrolyzing enzymes. Lignocellulosic biomass is even more recalcitrant to enzyme attack.
    Furthermore, each type of lignocellulosic biomass has its own specific composition of
    cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.
25           While a number of methods have been tried to extract structural carbohydrates from
    lignocellulosic biomass, they are either are too expensive, produce too low a yield, leave
    undesirable chemicals in the resulting product, or simply degrade the sugars.
             Monosaccharides from renewable biomass sources could become the basis of
    chemical and fuels industries by replacing, supplementing or substituting petroleum and other
30  fossil feedstocks. However, techniques need to be developed that will make these
    monosaccharides available in large quantities and at acceptable purities and prices.

                                              SUMMARY
             Described herein are methods for treating a biomass material, where the method
    includes passing an electron beam through multiple window foils and into the biomass
    material. The multiple window foils can include a system of cooled window foils.
 5           In another implementation the invention pertains to methods and systems for cooling
    a primary and secondary foil window of a scanning type electron beam accelerator.
             In one embodiment, the invention pertains to methods and systems for cooling a
    primary and secondary foil window of a scanning type electron beam accelerator and
    irradiating a material (e.g., a biomass material).
10           A method is provided for producing a treated biomass material, where the method
    includes: providing a starting biomass material; and passing an electron beam through
    multiple window foils into starting biomass material; thereby producing a treated biomass
    material. The treated biomass material can have a lower level of recalcitrance relative to the
    starting biomass material. The multiple window foils can include a system of gas cooled
15  window foils.
             Also provided is a system for cooling multiple single-type window foils of an electron
    beam accelerator, where the system includes: a first flow path for providing a first cooling
    gas across a primary single-type window foil and second flow path for providing a second
    cooling gas across a secondary single-type window foil, where the primary and secondary
20  single-type window foils are positioned with a gap of less than about 9 cm between them.
    Alternately, if the energy of electron beam accelerator is high, than larger gaps can be used.
    Gaps as large as 75 cm can be used.
             Also provided is a method for cooling multiple single-type window foils of an
    electron beam accelerator, where the methods includes: passing a first cooling gas across a
25  primary single-type window foil and passing a second cooling gas across a secondary single
    type window foil, where the primary and secondary single-type window foils are positioned
    facing each other with a gap of less than about 9 cm between them.
             The system of gas cooled window foils can include: a primary single-type window
    foil attached to a scanning horn of an electron beam accelerator; a secondary single-type
30  window foil positioned on an atmospheric side of the scanning horn; a first flow path
    providing a first cooling gas across the primary single-type window foil; a second flow path
    providing a second cooling gas across the secondary single-type window foil; and a gap
    between the primary single-type window foil and the secondary single-type window foil. The
    system of gas cooled window foils can further include: a cooling chamber having an interior
                                                     2

   WO 2014/059140                                                              PCT/US2013/064332
    volume defined by one or more walls, the primary single-type window foil and the secondary
    single-type window foil, wherein the cooling chamber include: a first inlet, which allows a
    first cooling gas to enter the interior volume; an optional second inlet, which allows
    optionally a second cooling gas to enter the interior volume; and at least one outlet, which
 5  allows the first and the second cooling gasses to exit the interior volume. The cooling
    chamber can include four walls and the interior volume can be approximately rectangular
    prism in shape. The system of gas cooled window foils can further include a treatment
    enclosure with a cover surface, where the enclosure is positioned on a side of the secondary
    single-type window foil opposite the electron beam accelerator. The secondary single-type
10  window foil can be mounted on the cover surface. The cover surface can be perpendicular to
    the electron beam accelerator. The treatment enclosure can have a first opening.
            The methods and systems can also include the steps of: conveying the biomass
    material through the first opening; positioning the biomass material under the secondary
    single-type window foil; and irradiating the biomass material; thereby producing a treated
15  biomass material. The treatment enclosure can include a second opening. The method can
    include the step of conveying the treated biomass material out of the treatment enclosure
    through the second opening. Positioning the biomass can be instantaneous, that is, the
    positioning step can include conveying the material on a conveyer belt that is continuously
    moving.
20          The method can also include purging the treatment enclosure with an inert gas, or a
    reactive gas.
            The primary single-type window foil can be made from an element selected from the
    group consisting of: titanium, scandium, vanadium, chromium, nickel, zirconium, niobium,
    molybdenum, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, hafnium, tantalum, tungsten, rhenium,
25  platinum, iridium, and alloys or mixtures of any of these.
            Alternatively, the secondary single-type window foil can be made from an element
    selected from the group consisting of: titanium, scandium, vanadium, chromium, nickel,
    zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, hafnium, tantalum,
    tungsten, rhenium, platinum, iridium, beryllium, aluminum, silicon, and alloys or mixtures of
30  any of these.
            The primary single-type window foil and the secondary single-type window foil can
    be made of the same element, alloy, or mixture, or they can be made of different elements,
    alloys, or mixtures. The primary single-type window foil or the secondary single-type
    window foil or both can be made from a low Z element. The primary single-type window
                                                     3

    foil can be made from a high Z element and the secondary single-type window foil can be
    made from a low Z element.
             The primary single-type window foil can be from 10 to 50 microns thick, from 15 to
    40 microns thick, from 20 to 30 microns thick, from 5 to 30 microns thick, from 8 to 25
 5  microns thick, or from 10 to 20 microns thick. The single-type window foils can be the same
    thickness, or different thickness.
             The starting biomass material is selected from the group consisting of: cellulosic
    material, lignocellulosic material, and starchy material. The biomass can be paper, paper
    products, paper waste, wood, particle board, sawdust, agricultural waste, sewage, silage,

    corn cobs, corn stover, alfalfa, hay, coconut hair, seaweed, algae, and mixtures thereof.
             The biomass can be treated with between 10 and 200 Mrad of radiation, between 10
    and 75 Mrad of radiation, between 15 and 50 Mrad of radiation, or between 20 and 35 Mrad
    of radiation.
15           The electron beam can include electrons having an energy of about 0.5 - 10 MeV,
    about 0.8 - 5 MeV, about 0.8 - 3 MeV, about 1 - 3 MeV, or about 1MeV.
             The electron beam can have a beam current of at least about 50 mA, at least about 60
    mA, at least about 70 mA, at least about 80 mA, at least about 90 mA, at least about 100 mA,
    at least about 125 mA, at least about 150 mA.
20           The electron beam can include electrons having an energy of about 1 MeV, and the
    spacing between the primary single-type window foil and the secondary single-type window
    foil can be less than about 30 centimeters. The electron beam can include electrons having an
    energy of about 1 MeV, and the spacing between the primary single-type window foil and the
    secondary single-type window foil can be less than 20 centimeters. The electron beam can
25  include electrons having an energy of about 1 MeV, and the spacing between the primary
    single-type window foil and the secondary single-type window foil can be less than 10
    centimeters.
             Alternatively, the electron beam comprises electrons can have an energy of about 5
    MeV, and the spacing between the primary single-type window foil and the secondary single
30  type window foil can be less than 75 centimeters. The electron beam comprises electrons can
    have an energy of about 5 MeV, and the spacing between the primary single-type window
    foil and the secondary single-type window foil can be less than 60 centimeters. The electron
    beam comprises electrons can have an energy of about 5 MeV, and the spacing between the
    primary single-type window foil and the secondary single-type window foil can be less than
                                                     4

   WO 2014/059140                                                              PCT/US2013/064332
    50 centimeters. The electron beam comprises electrons can have an energy of about 5 MeV,
    and the spacing between the primary single-type window foil and the secondary single-type
    window foil can be less than 40 centimeters. The electron beam comprises electrons can
    have an energy of about 5 MeV, and the spacing between the primary single-type window

    beam comprises electrons can have an energy of about 5 MeV, and the spacing between the
    primary single-type window foil and the secondary single-type window foil can be less than
    20 centimeters.
             The methods and systems described herein can include a beam stop.
10           One advantage of the methods and systems discussed herein is that the processes are
    more robust and incur less down time from failure of foil windows. In particular, multiple
    window systems greatly reduce the likelihood of primary window failure/implosion, which
    can destroy expensive accelerator parts. Another advantage is that there can be a reduction in
    the production of toxic by-products, relative to some conventional processes. These
15  advantages provide safer and more robust processing, e.g., higher and safer throughput in
    producing useful products. Yet another advantage of some of the methods and systems
    described is that cooling of foil windows can done with a high flow rate of cooling gas
    without disturbing the material targeted for irradiation. Another advantage of some of the
    methods and systems is that the gap between window foils allows for a beam stop to be
20  removable placed between the windows.
             Implementations of the invention can optionally include one or more of the following
    summarized features. In some inipliemenations, the selected features can be applied or
    utilized in any order while in others implementations a specific selected sequence is applied
    or utilized. Individual features can be applied or utilized more than once in any sequence. In
25  addition, an entire sequence, or a portion of a sequence, of applied or utilized features can be
    applied or utilized once or repeatedly in any order. In some optional implementations, the
    features can be applied or utilized with different, or where applicable the same, set or varied,
    quantitative or qualitative parameters as determined by a person skilled in the art. For
    example, parameters of the features such as size, individual dimensions (e.g., length, width,
30  height), location of, degree (e.g., to what extent such as the degree of recalcitrance), duration,
    frequency of use, density, concentration, intensity and speed can be varied or set, where

    reactive gas or mixtures of these.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
             Described herein is a method for irradiating biomass material, which facilitates the
    conversion of the material into useful products and improves the yield of those products from
    the biomass material. The treatment methods described herein are therefore useful in
 5  producing a biomass feedstock for use in other processes.
             The methods disclosed herein can effectively lower the recalcitrance level of the
    biomass material, improving its utility as a feedstock in the production of useful
    intermediates and products. The claimed methods make the biomass material easier to
    process by methods such as bioprocessing (e.g., with any microorganism described herein,
10  such as a homoacetogen or a heteroacetogen, and/or any enzyme described herein), thermal
    processing (e.g., gasification or pyrolysis) or chemical processing (e.g., acid hydrolysis or
    oxidation). Biomass material intended for use as a feedstock can be treated or processed
    using one or more of any of the methods described herein, such as mechanical treatment,
    chemical treatment, radiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion. The
15  various treatment systems and methods can be used in combinations of two, three, or even
    four or more of these technologies or others described herein and elsewhere.
             Saccharified biomass can then be manufactured into various products. For example,
    FIG. 1, shows a process for manufacturing a sugar and other useful products (e.g., alcohol).
    The process can include, for example, optionally mechanically treating a feedstock (step
20  110), before and/or after this treatment, treating the feedstock with another physical
    treatment, for example irradiation by the methods described herein, to further reduce its
    recalcitrance (step 112), and saccharifying the feedstock, to form a sugar solution (step 114).
    Optionally, the method may also include transporting, e.g., by pipeline, railcar, truck or
    barge, the solution (or the feedstock, enzyme and water, if saccharification is performed en
25  route) to a manufacturing plant (step 116). In some cases the saccharified feedstock is further
    bioprocessed (e.g., fermented) to produce a desired product (step 118) and byproduct (111).
    The resulting product may in some implementations be processed further, e.g., by distillation
    (step 120). If desired, the steps of measuring lignin content (step 122) and setting or
    adjusting process parameters based on this measurement (step 124) can be performed at
30  various stages of the process, as described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0203495 A1, filed on
    February 11, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
             FIG. 2 shows an irradiation process. This process can be part of the process described
    in FIG. 1 or it can be part of a separate process. Initially, biomass can be delivered to a
    conveyor (150). Optionally, the conveyor can be enclosed. The biomass can be pre
                                                     8

    irradiation processed while enclosed in the enclosed conveyor or prior to enclosing the
    material in the enclosed conveyor. Advantageously, the biomass on the conveyor when in an
    treatment enclosure, is protected from rapid air currents that can cause the biomass (e.g., fines
    and dust) to be lofted in the air. This can present an explosion hazard or damage equipment.
 5  The biomass can be conveyed through an irradiation zone (e.g., radiation field) (154). After
    irradiation, the biomass can be post processed (156). The process can be repeated (e.g.,
    dashed arrow A). Finally the irradiated biomass is removed from the conveyor and either
    collected for later processing or sent directly to make useful products.
             FIG. 3 shows one embodiment, an enclosed conveying system for irradiating a
10  comminuted biomass. The enclosure has an enclosed distribution system (310), an enclosed
    conveyor (311), material removal system (318) where the irradiated material exits the
    conveyor and an irradiation vault and a scan horn (322). The electron window foil (not
    shown) and enclosure window foil (not shown) have window coolers (320) and (326)
    respectively for blowing air across the surface of the windows. The enclosed material
15  distribution system (310) distributes the biomass onto the conveyor and brings the biomass
    from outside of the irradiation vault into the enclosed stainless steel conveyor without
    generating dust outside of the enclosure (e.g., protecting the biomass from air from the
    window cooling system). The distribution system can be equipped with a spreading system
    (not shown) to evenly distribute the biomass on the conveyor to a depth of about 0.25 inches.
20  The enclosed removal system (318) allows the material to fall off of the conveyor belt
    without generating dust outside of the enclosure, where the material can be collected (e.g.,
    outside the irradiation vault) or directed elsewhere for further processing. The scan horn
    window and enclosure window can be brought together, or lined up so that the electron
    beams pass thought the scan horn window, through a small gap of cooling air and then
25  through the enclosure window. For example, the conveyor can be aligned by moving it on
    casters and then fixing it in place. For example the casters can be blocked with a permanent
    break, a block, and or a depression. The conveyor can also be aligned by other methods and
    equipment, for example rails, wheels, pulleys, shims e.g., in any combination. In this
    window arrangement the scan horn window and enclosure window do not touch, so that the
30  remaining gap allows for efficient cooling. The scan horn window is part of the electron
    beam apparatus and the enclosure window is part of the treatment enclosure system.
             A cross sectional detailed view of the scan horn and scan horn window of FIG. 3 are
    shown in FIG. 4A. The scan horn window cooler (426) and enclosure window cooler (420)
    blow air at high velocity across the windows as indicted by the small arrows. The electrons

   WO 2014/059140                                                             PCT/US2013/064332
    in the electron beam (430) pass through the vacuum of the scan horn (422) through the scan
    horn window (428), through the cooling air gap between the scan horn window and enclosure
    window, through the enclosure window (429) and impinge on and penetrate the biomass
    material (444) on the conveyor surface (415). The scan horn window is shown as curved
 5  towards the vacuum side of the scan horn, for example due to the vacuum. In the
    embodiment illustrated, the enclosure window is curved towards the conveyed material. The
    curvature of the windows can help the cooling air path flow past the window for efficient
    cooling. The enclosure window is mounted on the cover (412) of the enclosed conveyor.
    The enclosure window is aligned with the cover surface.
10          FIG. 4B shows a different configuration of the detailed cross section view of the
    enclosed conveyor including a beam stop. A beam stop (440) can be pivotally fixed to the
    scan horn and is shown in the open position, e.g., allowing the e-beam to impinge on the
    conveyed material. FIG. 4C shows the cross sectional blowup of the scan horn and scan horn
    window with a beam stop (440) where the beam stop is in position for blocking the electrons.
15  The cover surface is denoted by 414.
            Optionally, the conveying system shown in FIG. 3 can be maintained under an
    atmosphere of an inert or reactive gas by a gentle purge through an inlet connected to a
    nitrogen gas source. The inlet can be positioned at different locations, for example, close to
    the zone where the biomass is irradiated to be more effective in reducing ozone formation if
20  purging is with an inert gas; or further and downstream of the irradiation if a reactive gas is
    used that is designed to reacted with an irradiated material.
            FIG. 5 is a cross sectional view of another embodiment of two foils window
    extraction system for a scanning electron beam. The primary foil window (510) in a scanning
    horn (520) is shown. The region indicated is a high vacuum area (525). Generally, the
25  primary window is concave towards the high vacuum area (525). The secondary foil window
    (530) is flatter but is also concave in the same direction. This curvature helps provide
    structural support to the window and is mechanically stronger than a flat window.
    Alternatively the windows can be flat or curved in any direction. Sidewalls (540) and the
    primary and secondary windows can define an interior space (550). Since the primary and
30  secondary windows are connected by sidewalls in this configuration both windows are part of
    the electron beam apparatus. Electrons (560) travel through both windows to impinge on and
    penetrate the biomass disposed beneath. A first inlet on one sidewall (512) is arranged to
    allow a cooling fluid (e.g., a liquid or a gas) to impinge on the primary window foil. The
    cooling fluid runs along the window and then reverses direction on meeting the far (opposite)
                                                      10

   WO 2014/059140                                                              PCT/US2013/064332
    wall and flows back generally through the center of the interior space as shown and then out
    through an exhaust port and or outlet (514). A second inlet (516) on the sidewall is arranged
    to allow cooling fluid to impinge on the secondary window foil in a similar fashion.
    Optionally more inlets (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more) can bring cooling fluid to the primary and
 5  secondary window surfaces and more than one outlets (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more) can allow
    the cooling fluid to exit the interior space. In some embodiments one or more side walls can
    even be a mesh, screen or grate with many openings through which cooling gas can flow
    while providing structural support to the windows. The system can include a conveyor, with a
    conveying surface (570). A material, for example biomass (444), can be conveyed in the
10  direction indicated as a thin pile (574), e.g., about 0.25 inches. Electrons irradiated the
    material as it is conveyed under the two foil extraction system.
    The Windows
             The biomass is irradiated as it passes under a window, which is generally a metallic
15  foil (e.g., titanium, titanium alloy, aluminum and/or silicon). The window is impermeable to
    gases, yet electrons can pass with low resistance. The foil windows are preferably between
    about 10 and 100 microns thick (e.g., about 10 microns thick to about 30 microns thick, about
    15 - 40 microns, about 20 - 30 microns, about 5- 30 microns, about 8 - 25 microns, about 10
    - 20 microns, about 20 - 25 microns thick, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
20  24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,
    49, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 microns thick). Thin windows are preferable
    to thick windows since thin windows dissipate less energy as an electron beam passes
    through them (e.g., the resistive heating is less since Power is the product of the square of the
    current and the resistance, P= 12R). Thin windows are also less mechanically strong and
25  more likely to fail which causes increased expense and more downtime for the equipment.
    The distance between the front surface of the primary window foil and back surface of the
    secondary window foil is preferably less than 30 cm, more preferably less than 20 cm, and
    most preferably less than 10 cm.
             The foil window can be cooled by passing air or an inert gas over the window. When
30  using an enclosure, it is generally preferred to mount the window to the enclosure and to cool
    the window from the side outside of the enclosed conveying system to avoid lofting up any
    particulates of the material being irradiated.
             The system can include more than one window, e.g., a primary window and a
    secondary window. The two windows may form the enclosure to contain the purging gases
                                                      11

   WO 2014/059140                                                              PCT/US2013/064332
    and/or the cooling gases. The secondary window may serve a function as a "sacrificial"
    window, to protect the primary window. The electron beam apparatus includes a vacuum
    between the electron source and the primary window, and breakage of the primary window is
    likely to cause biomass material to be sucked up into the electron beam apparatus, resulting in
 5  damage, repair costs, and equipment downtime.
             The window can be polymer, ceramic, coated ceramic, composite or coated
    composite. The secondary window can be, for instance, a continuous sheet/roll of polymer or
    coated polymer, which can be advanced continuously or at intervals to provide a clean or new
    section to serve as the secondary window.
10           The primary window and the secondary window can be made from the same material,
    or different materials. For instance, the primary window foil can be made from titanium,
    scandium, vanadium, chromium, nickel, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium,
    rhodium, palladium, hafnium, tantalum, tungsten, rhenium, platinum, iridium, or alloys or
    mixtures of any of these. The secondary single-type window foil can be made from titanium,
15  scandium, vanadium, chromium, nickel, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium,
    rhodium, palladium, hafnium, tantalum, tungsten, rhenium, platinum, iridium, beryllium,
    aluminum, silicon, or alloys or mixtures of any of these. The primary and secondary
    windows can be of the same material, mixture of materials, or alloy, or different materials,
    mixtures of material or alloys. One or both of the windows can be laminates of the same of
20  different materials, mixtures of materials, or alloys.
             One of more of the windows can have a support structure across its face. The term
    "single-type window", as used herein, means a window with no support structure across its
    face. The term "double-type window", as used herein means a window with a support
    structure across its face, where the support structure effectively divides the surface of the
25  window into two parts. Such a double-type window is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,582 to
    Nishimura. Additional support structures can also be used.
             The primary window foil and the secondary window foil can both be made from low
    Z element. Alternatively, the primary window foil can be made from a high Z element, and
    the secondary window foil can be made from a low Z element.
30           The embodiments described herein do not preclude the inclusion of additional
    windows, which may have a protective function, or may be included to modify the radiation
    exposure.
             The windows can be concave, flat or convex. It is generally preferred that the
    window be slightly convex, in a direction away from the direction of the cooling fluid. This
                                                     12

   WO 2014/059140                                                              PCT/US2013/064332
    curvature improves the mechanical strength of the window and increases the permitted
    temperature levels as well as allowing a better flow path for the cooling fluid. On the side of
    the scanning horn the curvature tends to be towards the vacuum (e.g., away from the cooling
    fluid) due to the vacuum (e.g., about 10-1 to 10-0 torr, about 10-6 to 10-9 torr, about 10-7 to 10
 5  8 torr).
             The cooling of the window and/or concave shape of the window become especially
    important for high beam currents, for example at least about 100 mA electron gun currents
    (e.g., at least about 110 mA, at least about 120 mA, at least about 130 mA, at least about 140
    mA, at least about 150 mA at least about 200 mA, at least about 500 mA, at least about 1000
10  mA) because resistive heating is approximately related to the square of the current as
    discussed above. The windows can be any shape but typically are approximately rectangular
    with a high aspect ratio of the width to the length (where the width direction is the same as
    the width of the conveying system perpendicular to the conveying direction, and the length is
    the same as the direction of conveying). The distance of the window to the conveyed
15  material can be less than about 10 cm (e.g., less than about 5cm) and more than about 0.1cm
    (e.g., more than about 1cm, more than about 2 cm, more than about 3 cm, more than about 4
    cm). It is also possible to use multiple windows (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6 or more) with different and
    varied shapes and configured in different ways. For example, a primary or secondary foil
    window can include one, two or more windows in the same plane or layered and can include
20  one or more support structures. For example, support structures can be a bar or a grid in the
    same plane and contacting the windows.
             In some embodiments, the window that is mounted on the enclosed conveying system
    is a secondary foil window of a two foil window extraction system for a scanning electron
    beam. In other embodiments there is no enclosure for conveying the biomass material, e.g.,
25  the biomass is conveyed in air under the irradiation device.
    Window Spacing
             Although a large spacing between the windows can be advantageous, for example, for
    the reasons described above, the large spacing poses some disadvantages. One disadvantage
30  of a large spacing between windows is that the electron beams will pass through a larger
    volume of cooling gas which can cause energy losses. For example, a 1MeV beam loses
    about 0.2 MeV/m of energy, a 5 MeV beam loses about 0.23 MeV/m and a 10 MeV beam
    loses about 0.26 MeV/m. Therefore with a 1 MeV beam of electrons passing through 1 cm of
    air, the beam loses only 0.2% of its energy, at 10 cm of air, the beam loses 2% of its energy,
                                                    13

   WO 2014/059140                                                                PCT/US2013/064332
    at 20 cm this is 4% of its energy, while at 50 cm the energy loss is 10%. Since the electrons
    also have to travel from the secondary foil window to the biomass through additional air, the
    gap between the windows must be carefully controlled. Preferably, energy losses are less that
    about 20% (e.g., less than 10%, less than 5% or even less than 1%). It is therefore
 5  advantageous to minimize the spacing between the windows to decrease energy losses.
    Optimal spacing (e.g., average spacing) between the windows (e.g., between the surface side
    of the electron window foil and the facing surface of the secondary window foil) for the
    benefit of cooling as described above and for the benefit of reducing energy loss are less than
    30 cm (e.g., between about 2 and 20 cm, between about 3 and 20 cm, between about 4 and
10  20 cm, between about 5 and 20 cm, between about 6 and 20 cm, between about 7 and 20 cm,
    between about 8 and 20 cm, between about 3 and 15 cm, between about 4 and 15 cm,
    between about 5 and 15 cm, between about 6 and 15 cm, between about 7 and 15 cm,
    between about 8 and 15 cm between about 3 and 10 cm, between about 4 and 10 cm, between
    about 5 and 10 cm, between about 6 and 10 cm, between about 7 and 10 cm, between about 8
15  and 10 cm, preferably less than 20 cm, and most preferably less than 10 cm.
             Alternatively, at higher MeV equipment a greater gap can be tolerated. The higher
    gap can be as great as 75 cm. In some embodiments support structures for the windows can
    be used across the windows, although these types of structures are less preferred because of
    energy losses that can occur to the electron beam as it strikes these kinds of structures.
20           A large spacing between the windows can be advantageous because it defines a larger
    volume between the windows and allows for rapid flowing of a large volume cooling gasses
    for very efficient cooling. The inlets and outlets are between 1mm and 120 mm in diameter
    (e.g., about 2 mm, about 5 mm about 10 mm, about 20 mm, about 50 mm or even about 100
    mm). The cooling gas flow can be at between about 500-2500 CFM (e.g., about 600 to 2500
25  CFM, about 700-2500 CFM, about 800 to 2500 CFM, about 1000 to 2500 CFM, about 600 to
    2000 CFM, about 700-2000 CFM, about 800 to 2000 CFM, about 1000 to 2000 CFM, about
    600 to 1500 CFM, about 700-1500 CFM, about 800 to 1500 CFM, about 1000 to 1500 CFM).
    In some embodiments, about 50% of the gas is exchanged per about 60 seconds or less (e.g.,
    in about 50 see or less, in about 30 see or less, in about 10 see or less, in about 1 see or less).
30
    Cooling and Purging Gases
             The cooling gas in the two foil window extraction system can be a purge gas or a
    mixture, for example air, or a pure gas. In some embodiments the gas is an inert gas such as
    nitrogen, argon, helium and or carbon dioxide. It is preferred to use a gas rather than a liquid
                                                     14

   WO 2014/059140                                                              PCT/US2013/064332
    since energy losses to the electron beam are minimized. Mixtures of pure gas can also be
    used, either pre-mixed or mixed in line prior to impinging on the windows or in the space
    between the windows. The cooling gas can be cooled, for example, by using a heat exchange
    system (e.g., a chiller) and/or by using boil off from a condensed gas (e.g., liquid nitrogen,
 5  liquid helium).
             When using an enclosure, the enclosed conveyor can also be purged with an inert gas
    so as to maintain an atmosphere at a reduced oxygen level. Keeping oxygen levels low
    avoids the formation of ozone which in some instances is undesirable due to its reactive and
    toxic nature. For example, the oxygen can be less than about 20% (e.g., less than about 10%,
10  less than about 1%, less than about 0.1%, less than about 0.01%, or even less than about
    0.001% oxygen). Purging can be done with an inert gas including, but not limited to,
    nitrogen, argon, helium or carbon dioxide. This can be supplied, for example, from a boil off
    of a liquid source (e.g., liquid nitrogen or helium), generated or separated from air in situ, or
    supplied from tanks. The inert gas can be recirculated and any residual oxygen can be
15  removed using a catalyst, such as a copper catalyst bed. Alternatively, combinations of
    purging, recirculating and oxygen removal can be done to keep the oxygen levels low.
             The enclosure can also be purged with a reactive gas that can react with the biomass.
    This can be done before, during or after the irradiation process. The reactive gas can be, but
    is not limited to, nitrous oxide, ammonia, oxygen, ozone, hydrocarbons, aromatic
20  compounds, amides, peroxides, azides, halides, oxyhalides, phosphides, phosphines, arsines,
    sulfides, thiols, boranes and/or hydrides. The reactive gas can be activated in the enclosure,
    e.g., by irradiation (e.g., electron beam, UV irradiation, microwave irradiation, heating, IR
    radiation), so that it reacts with the biomass. The biomass itself can be activated, for example
    by irradiation. Preferably the biomass is activated by the electron beam, to produce radicals
25  which then react with the activated or unactivated reactive gas, e.g., by radical coupling or
    quenching.
             Purging gases supplied to an enclosed conveyor can also be cooled, for example
    below about 25 0 C, below about 00 C, below about -40 0 C, below about -80 0 C, below about
    120 0 C. For example, the gas can be boiled off from a compressed gas such as liquid nitrogen
30  or sublimed from solid carbon dioxide. As an alternative example, the gas can be cooled by a
    chiller or part of or the entire conveyor can be cooled.

   WO 2014/059140                                                               PCT/US2013/064332
    Beam Stops
             In some embodiments the systems and methods include a beam stop (e.g., a shutter).
    For example, the beam stop can be used to quickly stop or reduce the irradiation of material
    without powering down the electron beam device. Alternatively the beam stop can be used
 5  while powering up the electron beam, e.g., the beam stop can stop the electron beam until a
    beam current of a desired level is achieved. The beam stop can be placed between the
    primary foil window and secondary foil window. For example, the beam stop can be
    mounted so that it is movable, that is, so that it can be moved into and out of the beam path.
    Even partial coverage of the beam can be used, for example, to control the dose of irradiation.
10  The beam stop can be mounted to the floor, to a conveyor for the biomass, to a wall, to the
    radiation device (e.g., at the scan horn), or to any structural support. Preferably the beam
    stop is fixed in relation to the scan horn so that the beam can be effectively controlled by the
    beam stop. The beam stop can incorporate a hinge, a rail, wheels, slots, or other means
    allowing for its operation in moving into and out of the beam. The beam stop can be made of
15  any material that will stop at least 5% of the electrons, e.g., at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%,
    50%, 60%, 70%, at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%
    or even about 100% of the electrons. Useful levels of stopping electrons can be 10%, 20%,
    40 %,60 %,80% and 96%
             The beam stop can be made of a metal including, but not limited to, stainless steel,
20  lead, iron, molybdenum, silver, gold, titanium, aluminum, tin, or alloys of these, or laminates
    (layered materials) made with such metals (e.g., metal-coated ceramic, metal-coated polymer,
    metal-coated composite, multilayered metal materials).
             The beam stop can be cooled, for example, with a cooling fluid such as an aqueous
    solution or a gas. The beam stop can be partially or completely hollow, for example with
25  cavities. Interior spaces of the beam stop can be used for cooling fluids and gases. The beam
    stop can be of any shape, including flat, curved, round, oval, square, rectangular, beveled and
    wedged shapes.
             The beam stop can have perforations so as to allow some electrons through, thus
    controlling (e.g., reducing) the levels of radiation across the whole area of the window, or in
30  specific regions of the window. The beam stop can be a mesh formed, for example, from
    fibers or wires. Multiple beam stops can be used, together or independently, to control the
    irradiation. The beam stop can be remotely controlled, e.g., by radio signal or hard wired to a
    motor for moving the beam into or out of position.

    Radiation Sources
            The type of radiation determines the kinds of radiation sources used as well as the
    radiation devices and associated equipment. The methods, systems and equipment described
    herein, for example for treating materials with radiation, can utilized sources as described
 5  herein as well as any other useful source.
    Sources of gamma rays include radioactive nuclei, such as isotopes of cobalt, calcium,
    technicium, chromium, gallium, indium, iodine, iron, krypton, samarium, selenium, sodium,
    thalium, and xenon.
            Sources of X-rays include electron beam collision with metal targets, such as tungsten
10  or molybdenum or alloys, or compact light sources, such as those produced commercially by
    Lyncean.
    Alpha particles are identical to the nucleus of a helium atom and are produced by the alpha
    decay of various radioactive nuclei, such as isotopes of bismuth, polonium, astatine, radon,
    francium, radium, several actinides, such as actinium, thorium, uranium, neptunium, curium,
15  californium, americium, and plutonium.
            Sources for ultraviolet radiation include deuterium or cadmium lamps.
    Sources for infrared radiation include sapphire, zinc, or selenide window ceramic lamps.
    Sources for microwaves include klystrons, Slevin type RF sources, or atom beam sources that
    employ hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen gases.
20          Accelerators used to accelerate the particles (e.g., electrons or ions) can be
    electrostatic DC, e. g. electrodynamic DC, RF linear, magnetic induction linear or continuous
    wave. For example, various irradiating devices may be used in the methods disclosed herein,
    including field ionization sources, electrostatic ion separators, field ionization generators,
    thermionic emission sources, microwave discharge ion sources, recirculating or static
25  accelerators, dynamic linear accelerators, van de Graaff accelerators, Cockroft Walton
    accelerators (e.g., PELLETRON@ accelerators), LINACS, Dynamitrons (e.g,
    DYNAMITRON@ accelerators), cyclotrons, synchrotrons, betatrons, transformer-type
    accelerators, microtrons, plasma generators, cascade accelerators, and folded tandem
    accelerators. For example, cyclotron type accelerators are available from IBA, Belgium, such
30  as the RHODOTRONTM system, while DC type accelerators are available from RDI, now
    IBA Industrial, such as the DYNAMITRON@. Other suitable accelerator systems include,
    for example: DC insulated core transformer (ICT) type systems, available from Nissin High
    Voltage, Japan; S-band LINACs, available from L3-PSD (USA), Linac Systems (France),
    Mevex (Canada), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (Japan); L-band LINACs, available from

             Electrons may be produced by radioactive nuclei that undergo beta decay, such as
    isotopes of iodine, cesium, technetium, and iridium. Alternatively, an electron gun can be
    used as an electron source via thermionic emission and accelerated through an accelerating
    potential. An electron gun generates electrons, which are then accelerated through a large
15  potential (e.g., greater than about 500 thousand, greater than about Imillion, greater than
    about 2 million, greater than about 5 million, greater than about 6 million, greater than about
    7 million, greater than about 8 million, greater than about 9 million, or even greater than 10
    million volts) and then scanned magnetically in the x-y plane, where the electrons are
    initially accelerated in the z direction down the accelerator tube and extracted through a foil
20  window. Scanning the electron beams is useful for increasing the irradiation surface when
    irradiating materials, e.g., a biomass, that is conveyed through the scanned beam. Scanning
    the electron beam also distributes the thermal load homogenously on the window and helps
    reduce the foil window rupture due to local heating by the electron beam. Window foil
    rupture is a cause of significant down-time due to subsequent necessary repairs and re
25  starting the electron gun.
             A beam of electrons can be used as the radiation source. A beam of electrons has the
    advantages of high dose rates (e.g., 1, 5, or even 10 Mrad per second), high throughput, less
    containment, and less confinement equipment. Electron beams can also have high electrical
    efficiency (e.g., 80%), allowing for lower energy usage relative to other radiation methods,
30  which can translate into a lower cost of operation and lower greenhouse gas emissions
    corresponding to the smaller amount of energy used. Electron beams can be generated, e.g.,
    by electrostatic generators, cascade generators, transformer generators, low energy
    accelerators with a scanning system, low energy accelerators with a linear cathode, linear
    accelerators, and pulsed accelerators.

             Electrons can also be more efficient at causing changes in the molecular structure of
    carbohydrate-containing materials, for example, by the mechanism of chain scission. In
    addition, electrons having energies of 0.5-10 MeV can penetrate low density materials, such
    as the biomass materials described herein, e.g., materials having a bulk density of less than
 5  0.5 g/cm3, and a depth of 0.3-10 cm. Electrons as an ionizing radiation source can be useful,
    e.g., for relatively thin piles, layers or beds of materials, e.g., less than about 0.5 inch, e.g.,
    less than about 0.4 inch, 0.3 inch, 0.25 inch, or less than about 0.1 inch. In some
    embodiments, the energy of each electron of the electron beam is from about 0.3 MeV to
    about 2.0 MeV (million electron volts), e.g., from about 0.5 MeV to about 1.5 MeV, or from
10  about 0.7 MeV to about 1.25 MeV. Methods of irradiating materials are discussed in U.S.

             Electron beam irradiation devices may be procured commercially or built. For
    example elements or components such inductors, capacitors, casings, power sources, cables,
15  wiring, voltage control systems, current control elements, insulating material,
    microcontrollers and cooling equipment can be purchased and assembled into a device.
    Optionally, a commercial device can be modified and/or adapted. For example, devices and
    components can be purchased from any of the commercial sources described herein including
    Ion Beam Applications (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium), NHV Corporation (Japan), the Titan
20  Corporation (San Diego, CA), Vivirad High Voltage Corp (Billeric, MA) and/or Budker
    Laboratories (Russia). Typical electron energies can be 0.5 MeV, 1 MeV, 2 MeV, 4.5 MeV,
    7.5 MeV, or 10 MeV. Typical electron beam irradiation device power can be 1 kW, 5 kW,
    10 kW, 20 kW, 50 kW, 60 kW, 70 kW, 80 kW, 90 kW, 100 kW, 125 kW, 150 kW, 175 kW,
    200 kW, 250 kW, 300 kW, 350 kW, 400 kW, 450 kW, 500 kW, 600 kW, 700 kW, 800 kW,
25  900 kW or even 1000 kW. Accelerators that can be used include NHV irradiators medium
    energy series EPS-500 (e.g., 500 kV accelerator voltage and 65, 100 or 150 mA beam
    current), EPS-800 (e.g., 800 kV accelerator voltage and 65 or 100 mA beam current), or EPS
    1000 (e.g., 1000 kV accelerator voltage and 65 or 100 mA beam current). Also, accelerators
    from NHV's high energy series can be used such as EPS-1500 (e.g., 1500 kV accelerator
30  voltage and 65 mA beam current), EPS-2000 (e.g., 2000 kV accelerator voltage and 50 mA
    beam current), EPS-3000 (e.g., 3000 kV accelerator voltage and 50 mA beam current) and
    EPS-5000 (e.g., 5000 and 30 mA beam current).
             Tradeoffs in considering electron beam irradiation device power specifications
    include cost to operate, capital costs, depreciation, and device footprint. Tradeoffs in

    considering exposure dose levels of electron beam irradiation would be energy costs and
    environment, safety, and health (ESH) concerns. Typically, generators are housed in a vault,
    e.g., of lead or concrete, especially for production from X-rays that are generated in the
    process. Tradeoffs in considering electron energies include energy costs.
 5           The electron beam irradiation device can produce either a fixed beam or a scanning
    beam. A scanning beam may be advantageous with large scan sweep length and high scan
    speeds, as this would effectively replace a large, fixed beam width. Further, available sweep
    widths of 0.5 m, 1 m, 2 m or more are available. The scanning beam is preferred in most
    embodiments describe herein because of the larger scan width and reduced possibility of
10  local heating and failure of the windows.
    Subsequent Use of the Feedstocks
             Using the methods described herein, a starting biomass material (e.g., plant biomass,
    animal biomass, paper, and municipal waste biomass) can be used as feedstock to produce
15  useful intermediates and products such as organic acids, salts of organic acids, anhydrides,
    esters of organic acids and fuels, e.g., fuels for internal combustion engines or feedstocks for
    fuel cells. Systems and processes are described herein that can use as feedstock cellulosic
    and/or lignocellulosic materials that are readily available, but often can be difficult to
    process, e.g., municipal waste streams and waste paper streams, such as streams that include
20  newspaper, kraft paper, corrugated paper or mixtures of these.
             In order to convert the feedstock to a form that can be readily processed, the glucan
    or xylan-containing cellulose in the feedstock can be hydrolyzed to low molecular weight
    carbohydrates, such as sugars, by a saccharifying agent, e.g., an enzyme or acid, a process
    referred to as saccharification. The low molecular weight carbohydrates can then be used, for
25  example, in an existing manufacturing plant, such as a single cell protein plant, an enzyme
    manufacturing plant, or a fuel plant, e.g., an ethanol manufacturing facility.
             The feedstock can be hydrolyzed using an enzyme, e.g., by combining the materials
    and the enzyme in a solvent, e.g., in an aqueous solution.
             Alternatively, the enzymes can be supplied by organisms that break down biomass,
30  such as the cellulose and/or the lignin portions of the biomass, contain or manufacture
    various cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases), ligninases or various small molecule biomass
    degrading metabolites. These enzymes may be a complex of enzymes that act synergistically
    to degrade crystalline cellulose or the lignin portions of biomass. Examples of cellulolytic
    enzymes include: endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and cellobiases (P-glucosidases).
                                                      20

   WO 2014/059140                                                                  PCT/US2013/064332
            During saccharification a cellulosic substrate can be initially hydrolyzed by
    endoglucanases at random locations producing oligomeric intermediates. These
    intermediates are then substrates for exo-splitting glucanases such as cellobiohydrolase to
    produce cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water-soluble 1,4
 5  linked dimer of glucose. Finally, cellobiase cleaves cellobiose to yield glucose. The
    efficiency (e.g., time to hydrolyze and/or completeness of hydrolysis) of this process depends
    on the recalcitrance of the cellulosic material.
    Biomass Material Preparation -- Mechanical Treatments
10          The biomass can be in a dry form, for example with less than about 35% moisture
    content (e.g., less than about 20 %, less than about 15 %, less than about 10 % less than about
    5 %, less than about 4%, less than about 3 %, less than about 2 % or even less than about 1
    %). The biomass can also be delivered in a wet state, for example as a wet solid, a slurry or a
    suspension with at least about 10 wt% solids (e.g., at least about 20 wt.%, at least about 30
15  wt. %, at least about 40 wt.%, at least about 50 wt.%, at least about 60 wt.%, at least about
    70 wt.%).
            The processes disclosed herein can utilize low bulk density materials, for example
    cellulosic or lignocellulosic feedstocks that have been physically pretreated to have a bulk
    density of less than about 0.75 g/cm 3, e.g., less than about 0.7, 0.65, 0.60, 0.50, 0.35, 0.25,
20  0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05 or less, e.g., less than about 0.025 g/cm 3. Bulk density is determined
    using ASTM D1895B. Briefly, the method involves filling a measuring cylinder of known
    volume with a sample and obtaining a weight of the sample. The bulk density is calculated
    by dividing the weight of the sample in grams by the known volume of the cylinder in cubic
    centimeters. If desired, low bulk density materials can be densified, for example, by methods
25  described in US. Pat. No. 7,971,809 to Medoff, the full disclosure of which is hereby
    incorporated by reference.
            In some cases, the pre-irradiation processing includes screening of the biomass
    material. Screening can be through a mesh or perforated plate with a desired opening size,
    for example, less than about 6.35 mm (        inch, 0.25 inch), (e.g., less than about 3.18 mm (1/8
30  inch, 0.125 inch), less than about 1.59 mm (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), is less than about 0.79
    mm (1/32 inch, 0.03125 inch), e.g., less than about 0.51 mm (1/50 inch, 0.02000 inch), less
    than about 0.40 mm (1/64 inch, 0.015625 inch), less than about 0.23 mm (0.009 inch), less
    than about 0.20 mm (1/128 inch, 0.0078125 inch), less than about 0.18 mm (0.007 inch), less
    than about 0.13 mm (0.005 inch), or even less than about 0.10 mm (1/256 inch, 0.00390625
                                                      21

   WO 2014/059140                                                              PCT/US2013/064332
    inch)). In one configuration, the desired biomass falls through the perforations or screen and
    thus biomass larger than the perforations or screen are not irradiated. These larger materials
    can be re-processed, for example by comminuting, or they can simply be removed from
    processing. In another configuration, material that is larger than the perforations is irradiated
 5  and the smaller material is removed by the screening process or recycled. In this kind of a
    configuration, the conveyor itself (for example a part of the conveyor) can be perforated or
    made with a mesh. For example, in one particular embodiment the biomass material may be
    wet and the perforations or mesh allow water to drain away from the biomass before
    irradiation.
10           Screening of material can also be by a manual method, for example by an operator or
    mechanoid (e.g., a robot equipped with a color, reflectivity or other sensor) that removes
    unwanted material. Screening can also be by magnetic screening wherein a magnet is
    disposed near the conveyed material and the magnetic material is removed magnetically.
             Optional pre- processing can include heating the material. For example a portion of
15  the conveyor can be sent through a heated zone. The heated zone can be created, for
    example, by IR radiation, microwaves, combustion (e.g., gas, coal, oil, biomass), resistive
    heating and/or inductive coils. The heat can be applied from at least one side or more than
    one side, can be continuous or periodic and can be for only a portion of the material or all the
    material. For example, a portion of the conveying trough can be heated by use of a heating
20  jacket. Heating can be, for example, for the purpose of drying the material. In the case of
    drying the material, this can also be facilitated, with or without heating, by the movement of a
    gas (e.g., air, oxygen, nitrogen, He, C0 2 , Argon) over and/or through the biomass as it is
    being conveyed.
             Optionally, pre-irradiation processing can include cooling the material. Cooling
25  material is described in US Pat. No. 7,900,857 to Medoff, the disclosure of which in
    incorporated herein by reference. For example, cooling can be by supplying a cooling fluid,
    for example water (e.g., with glycerol), or nitrogen (e.g., liquid nitrogen) to the bottom of the
    conveying trough. Alternatively, a cooling gas, for example, chilled nitrogen can be blown
    over the biomass materials or under the conveying system.
30           Another optional pre-irradiation processing can include adding a material to the
    biomass. The additional material can be added by, for example, by showering, sprinkling and
    or pouring the material onto the biomass as it is conveyed. Materials that can be added
    include, for example, metals, ceramics and/or ions as described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub.

    Optional materials that can be added include acids and bases. Other materials that can be
    added are oxidants (e.g., peroxides, chlorates), polymers, polymerizable monomers (e.g.,
    containing unsaturated bonds), water, catalysts, enzymes and/or organisms. Materials can be
 5  added, for example, in pure form, as a solution in a solvent (e.g., water or an organic solvent)
    and/or as a solution. In some cases the solvent is volatile and can be made to evaporate e.g.,
    by heating and/or blowing gas as previously described. The added material may form a
    uniform coating on the biomass or be a homogeneous mixture of different components (e.g.,
    biomass and additional material). The added material can modulate the subsequent
10  irradiation step by increasing the efficiency of the irradiation, damping the irradiation or
    changing the effect of the irradiation (e.g., from electron beams to X-rays or heat). The
    method may have no impact on the irradiation but may be useful for further downstream
    processing. The added material may help in conveying the material, for example, by
    lowering dust levels.
15           Biomass can be treated as described herein, e.g. with electron beam radiation, while
    being conveyed. The biomass can be delivered to the conveyor by using, a belt conveyor, a
    pneumatic conveyor, a screw conveyor, a hopper, a pipe, manually or by combination of
    these. The biomass can, for example, be dropped, poured and/or placed onto the conveyor by
    any of these methods. In some embodiments the material is delivered to the conveyor using
20  an enclosed material distribution system to help maintain a low oxygen atmosphere and/or
    control dust and fines. Lofted or air suspended biomass fines and dust are undesirable
    because these can form an explosion hazard or damage the window foils.
             The material can be leveled to form a uniform thickness between about 0.0312 and 5
    inches (e.g., between about 0.0625 and 2.000 inches, between about 0.125 and 1 inches,
25  between about 0.125 and 0.5 inches, between about 0.3 and 0.9 inches, between about 0.2 and
    0.5 inches between about 0.25 and 1.0 inches, between about 0.25 and 0.5 inches, 0.100 +/
    0.025 inches, 0.150 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.200 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.250 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.300
    +/- 0.025 inches, 0.350 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.400 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.450 +/- 0.025 inches,
    0.500 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.550 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.600 +/- 0.025 inches, 0.700 +/- 0.025

    0.025 inches, 0.900 +/- 0.025 inches.
             Generally, it is preferred to convey the material as quickly as possible through the
    electron beam to maximize throughput. For example, the material can be conveyed at rates
    of at least 1 ft/min, e.g., at least 2 ft/min, at least 3 ft/min, at least 4 ft/min, at least 5 ft/min, at
                                                        23

   WO 2014/059140                                                                PCT/US2013/064332
    least 10 ft/min, at least 15 ft/min, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 ft/min. The rate of conveying is
    related to the beam current, for example, for a      inch thick biomass and 100 mA, the
    conveyor can move at about 20 ft/min to provide a useful irradiation dosage, at 50 mA the
    conveyor can move at about 10 ft/min to provide approximately the same irradiation dosage.
 5           After the biomass material has been conveyed through a treatment area, e.g., a
    radiation zone, optional post processing can be done. The optional post processing can, for
    example, be any process described herein. For example, the biomass can be screened, heated,
    cooled, and/or combined with additives. Uniquely to post-irradiation, quenching of the
    radicals can occur, for example, quenching of radicals by the addition of fluids or gases (e.g.,
10  oxygen, nitrous oxide, ammonia, liquids), using pressure, heat, and/or the addition of radical
    scavengers. For example, the biomass can be conveyed out of an enclosed conveyor and
    exposed to a gas (e.g., oxygen) where it is quenched, forming carboxylated groups. In one
    embodiment the biomass can be exposed during irradiation to a reactive gas or fluid.
    Quenching of biomass that has been irradiated is described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,083,906 to
15  Medoff, the entire disclosure of which is incorporate herein by reference.
             If desired, one or more mechanical treatments can be used in addition to irradiation to
    further reduce the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing material. These processes can
    be applied before, during and or after irradiation.
             In some cases, the mechanical treatment may include an initial preparation of the
20  feedstock as received, e.g., size reduction of materials, such as by comminution, e.g., cutting,
    grinding, shearing, pulverizing or chopping. For example, in some cases, loose feedstock
    (e.g., recycled paper, starchy materials, or switchgrass) is prepared by shearing or shredding.
    Mechanical treatment may reduce the bulk density of the carbohydrate-containing material,
    increase the surface area of the carbohydrate-containing material and/or decrease one or more
25  dimensions of the carbohydrate-containing material.
             Alternatively, or in addition, the feedstock material can first be physically treated by
    one or more of the other physical treatment methods, e.g., chemical treatment, radiation,
    sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion, and then mechanically treated. This
    sequence can be advantageous since materials treated by one or more of the other treatments,
30  e.g., irradiation or pyrolysis, tend to be more brittle and, therefore, it may be easier to further
    change the structure of the material by mechanical treatment. For example, a feedstock
    material can be conveyed through ionizing radiation using a conveyor as described herein and
    then mechanically treated. Chemical treatment can remove some or all of the lignin (for
    example chemical pulping) and can partially or completely hydrolyze the material. The
                                                      24

   WO 2014/059140                                                                PCT/US2013/064332
    methods also can be used with pre-hydrolyzed material. The methods also can be used with
    material that has not been pre hydrolyzed The methods can be used with mixtures of
    hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed materials, for example with about 50% or more non
    hydrolyzed material, with about 60% or more non- hydrolyzed material, with about 70% or
 5  more non-hydrolyzed material, with about 80% or more non-hydrolyzed material or even
    with 90% or more non-hydrolyzed material.
             In addition to size reduction, which can be performed initially and/or later in
    processing, mechanical treatment can also be advantageous for opening up, stressing,
    breaking or shattering the carbohydrate-containing materials, making the cellulose of the
10  materials more susceptible to chain scission and/or disruption of crystalline structure during
    the physical treatment.
             Methods of mechanically treating the carbohydrate-containing material include, for
    example, milling or grinding. Milling may be performed using, for example, a hammer mill,
    ball mill, colloid mill, conical or cone mill, disk mill, edge mill, Wiley mill, grist mill or other
15  mill. Grinding may be performed using, for example, a cutting/impact type grinder. Some
    exemplary grinders include stone grinders, pin grinders, coffee grinders, and burr grinders.
    Grinding or milling may be provided, for example, by a reciprocating pin or other element, as
    is the case in a pin mill. Other mechanical treatment methods include mechanical ripping or
    tearing, other methods that apply pressure to the fibers, and air attrition milling. Suitable
20  mechanical treatments further include any other technique that continues the disruption of the
    internal structure of the material that was initiated by the previous processing steps.
             Mechanical feed preparation systems can be configured to produce streams with
    specific characteristics such as, for example, specific maximum sizes, specific length-to
    width, or specific surface areas ratios. Physical preparation can increase the rate of reactions,
25  improve the movement of material on a conveyor, improve the irradiation profile of the
    material, improve the radiation uniformity of the material, or reduce the processing time
    required by opening up the materials and making them more accessible to processes and/or
    reagents, such as reagents in a solution.
             The bulk density of feedstocks can be controlled (e.g., increased). In some situations,
30  it can be desirable to prepare a low bulk density material, e.g., by densifying the material
    (e.g., densification can make it easier and less costly to transport to another site) and then
    reverting the material to a lower bulk density state (e.g., after transport). The material can be
    densified, for example from less than about 0.2 g/cc to more than about 0.9 g/cc (e.g., less
    than about 0.3 to more than about 0.5 g/cc, less than about 0.3 to more than about 0.9 g/cc,
                                                      25

   WO 2014/059140                                                                 PCT/US2013/064332
    less than about 0.5 to more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about 0.3 to more than about 0.8
    g/cc, less than about 0.2 to more than about 0.5 g/cc). For example, the material can be
    densified by the methods and equipment disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff and
    International Publication No. WO 2008/073186 (which was filed October 26, 2007, was
 5  published in English, and which designated the United States), the full disclosures of which
    are incorporated herein by reference. Densified materials can be processed by any of the
    methods described herein, or any material processed by any of the methods described herein
    can be subsequently densified.
             In some embodiments, the material to be processed is in the form of a fibrous material
10  that includes fibers provided by shearing a fiber source. For example, the shearing can be
    performed with a rotary knife cutter.
             For example, a fiber source, e.g., that is recalcitrant or that has had its recalcitrance
    level reduced, can be sheared, e.g., in a rotary knife cutter, to provide a first fibrous material.
    The first fibrous material is passed through a first screen, e.g., having an average opening size
15  of 1.59 mm or less (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), provide a second fibrous material. If desired, the
    fiber source can be cut prior to the shearing, e.g., with a shredder. For example, when a paper
    is used as the fiber source, the paper can be first cut into strips that are, e.g., 1/4- to 1/2-inch
    wide, using a shredder, e.g., a counter-rotating screw shredder, such as those manufactured by
    Munson (Utica, N.Y). As an alternative to shredding, the paper can be reduced in size by
20  cutting to a desired size using a guillotine cutter. For example, the guillotine cutter can be
    used to cut the paper into sheets that are, e.g., 10 inches wide by 12 inches long.
             In some embodiments, the shearing of the fiber source and the passing of the resulting
    first fibrous material through a first screen are performed concurrently. The shearing and the
    passing can also be performed in a batch-type process.
25           For example, a rotary knife cutter can be used to concurrently shear the fiber source
    and screen the first fibrous material. A rotary knife cutter includes a hopper that can be
    loaded with a shredded fiber source prepared by shredding a fiber source. The shredded fiber
    source. In some implementations, the feedstock is physically treated prior to saccharification
    and/or fermentation. Physical treatment processes can include one or more of any of those
30  described herein, such as mechanical treatment, chemical treatment, irradiation, sonication,
    oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion. Treatment methods can be used in combinations of
    two, three, four, or even all of these technologies (in any order). When more than one
    treatment method is used, the methods can be applied at the same time or at different times.

    incorporated herein by reference.
    Sonication, Pyrolysis, Oxidation, Steam Explosion
            If desired, one or more sonication, pyrolysis, oxidative, or steam explosion processes
10  can be used in addition to irradiation to further reduce the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate
    containing material. These processes can be applied before, during and or after irradiation.
    These processes are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff , the full
    disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
15  Biomass Processing after Irradiation
    After irradiation the biomass may be transferred to a vessel for saccharification. Alternately,
    the biomass can be heated after the biomass is irradiated prior to the saccharification step.
    The biomass can be, for example, by IR radiation, microwaves, combustion (e.g., gas, coal,
    oil, biomass), resistive heating and/or inductive coils. This heating can be in a liquid, for
20  example, in water or other water-based solvents. The heat can be applied from at least one
    side or more than one side, can be continuous or periodic and can be for only a portion of the
    material or all the material. The biomass may be heated to temperatures above 90'C in an
    aqueous liquid that may have an acid or a base present. For example, the aqueous biomass
    slurry may be heated to 90 to 150'C, alternatively, 105 to 145 0 C, optionally 110 to 140'C or
25  further optionally from 115 to 135 C. The time that the aqueous biomass mixture is held at
    the peak temperature is 1 to 12 hours, alternately, 1 to 6 hours, optionally 1 to 4 hours at the
    peak temperature.     In some instances, the aqueous biomass mixture is acidic, and the pH is
    between 1 and 5, optionally I to 4, or alternately, 2 to 3. In other instances, the aqueous
    biomass mixture is alkaline and the pH is between 6 and 13, alternately, 8 to 12, or
30  optionally, 8 to 11.
    Saccharification
            The treated biomass materials can be saccharified, generally by combining the
    material and a cellulase enzyme in a fluid medium, e.g., an aqueous solution. In some cases,
                                                    27

   WO 2014/059140                                                                PCT/US2013/064332
    the material is boiled, steeped, or cooked in hot water prior to saccharification, as described
    in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/01000577 A1, filed October 18, 2011.
             The saccharification process can be partially or completely performed in a tank (e.g.,
    a tank having a volume of at least 4000, 40,000, or 500,000 L) in a manufacturing plant,
 5  and/or can be partially or completely performed in transit, e.g., in a rail car, tanker truck, or in
    a supertanker or the hold of a ship. The time required for complete saccharification will
    depend on the process conditions and the carbohydrate-containing material and enzyme used.
    If saccharification is performed in a manufacturing plant under controlled conditions, the
    cellulose may be substantially entirely converted to sugar, e.g., glucose in about 12-96 hours.
10  If saccharification is performed partially or completely in transit, saccharification may take
    longer.
             It is generally preferred that the tank contents be mixed during saccharification, e.g.,
    using jet mixing as described in International App. No. PCT/US2010/035331, filed May 18,
    2010, which was published in English as WO 2010/135380 and designated the United States,
15  the full disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.
             The addition of surfactants can enhance the rate of saccharification. Examples of
    surfactants include non-ionic surfactants, such as a Tween@ 20 or Tween@ 80 polyethylene
    glycol surfactants, ionic surfactants, or amphoteric surfactants.
             It is generally preferred that the concentration of the sugar solution resulting from
20  saccharification be relatively high, e.g., greater than 40%, or greater than 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or
    even greater than 95% by weight. Water may be removed, e.g., by evaporation, to increase
    the concentration of the sugar solution. This reduces the volume to be shipped, and also
    inhibits microbial growth in the solution.
             Alternatively, sugar solutions of lower concentrations may be used, in which case it
25  may be desirable to add an antimicrobial additive, e.g., a broad spectrum antibiotic, in a low
    concentration, e.g., 50 to 150 ppm. Other suitable antibiotics include amphotericin B,
    ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, hygromycin B, kanamycin,
    neomycin, penicillin, puromycin, streptomycin. Antibiotics will inhibit growth of
    microorganisms during transport and storage, and can be used at appropriate concentrations,
30  e.g., between 15 and 1000 ppm by weight, e.g., between 25 and 500 ppm, or between 50 and
    150 ppm. If desired, an antibiotic can be included even if the sugar concentration is relatively
    high. Alternatively, other additives with anti-microbial of preservative properties may be
    used. Preferably the antimicrobial additive(s) are food-grade.
                                                      28

   WO 2014/059140                                                             PCT/US2013/064332
             A relatively high concentration solution can be obtained by limiting the amount of
    water added to the carbohydrate-containing material with the enzyme. The concentration can
    be controlled, e.g., by controlling how much saccharification takes place. For example,
    concentration can be increased by adding more carbohydrate-containing material to the
 5  solution. In order to keep the sugar that is being produced in solution, a surfactant can be
    added, e.g., one of those discussed above. Solubility can also be increased by increasing the
    temperature of the solution. For example, the solution can be maintained at a temperature of
    40-50-C, 60-80-C, or even higher.
10  Sugars
             In the processes described herein, for example after saccharification, sugars (e.g.,
    glucose and xylose) can be isolated. For example, sugars can be isolated by precipitation,
    crystallization, chromatography (e.g., simulated moving bed chromatography, high pressure
    chromatography), centrifugation, extraction, any other isolation method known in the art, and
15  combinations thereof.
    Hydrogenation and Other Chemical Transformations
             The processes described herein can include hydrogenation. For example, glucose and
    xylose can be hydrogenated to sorbitol and xylitol respectively. Hydrogenation can be
20  accomplished by use of a catalyst (e.g., Pt/gamma-A1203, Ru/C, Raney Nickel, or other
    catalysts know in the art) in combination with H 2 under high pressure (e.g., 10 to 12000 psi).
    Other types of chemical transformation of the products from the processes described herein
    can be used, for example production of organic sugar derived products such (e.g., furfural and
    furfural-derived products). Chemical transformations of sugar derived products are described
25  in US Prov. App. No. 61/667,481, filed July 3, 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated
    herein by reference in its entirety.
    Fermentation
             Yeast and Zymomonas bacteria, for example, can be used for fermentation or
30  conversion of sugar(s) to alcohol(s). Other microorganisms are discussed below. The
    optimum pH for fermentations is about pH 4 to 7. For example, the optimum pH for yeast is
    from about pH 4 to 5, while the optimum pH for Zymomonas is from about pH 5 to 6.
    Typical fermentation times are about 24 to 168 hours (e.g., 24 to 96 hrs) with temperatures in
                                                     29

   WO 2014/059140                                                               PCT/US2013/064332
    the range of 20'C to 40'C (e.g., 260 C to 40'C), however thermophilic microorganisms prefer
    higher temperatures.
             In some embodiments, e.g., when anaerobic organisms are used, at least a portion of
    the fermentation is conducted in the absence of oxygen, e.g., under a blanket of an inert gas
 5  such as N2, Ar, He, CO 2 or mixtures thereof. Additionally, the mixture may have a constant
    purge of an inert gas flowing through the tank during part of or all of the fermentation. In
    some cases, anaerobic condition, can be achieved or maintained by carbon dioxide production
    during the fermentation and no additional inert gas is needed.
    In some embodiments, all or a portion of the fermentation process can be interrupted before
10  the low molecular weight sugar is completely converted to a product (e.g., ethanol). The
    intermediate fermentation products include sugar and carbohydrates in high concentrations.
    The sugars and carbohydrates can be isolated via any means known in the art. These
    intermediate fermentation products can be used in preparation of food for human or animal
    consumption. Additionally or alternatively, the fermentation products can be ground to a
15  appropriate particle size by comminution.
             Jet mixing may be used during fermentation, and in some cases saccharification and
    fermentation are performed in the same tank.
             Nutrients for the microorganisms may be added during saccharification and/or
    fermentation, for example the food-based nutrient packages described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub.
20  2012/0052536, filed July 15, 2011, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein
    by reference.
             Fermentation includes the methods and products that are disclosed in U.S. Prov. App.
    No. 61/579,559, filed December 22, 2012, and U.S. Prov. App. No. 61/579,576, filed
    December 22, 2012, the contents of both of which are incorporated by reference herein in
25  their entirety.
             Mobile fermenters can be utilized, as described in International App. No.
    PCT/US2007/074028 (which was filed July 20, 2007, was published in English as WO
    2008/011598 and designated the United States), the contents of which is incorporated herein
    in its entirety. Similarly, the saccharification equipment can be mobile. Further,
30  saccharification and/or fermentation may be performed in part or entirely during transit.
    Distillation
             After fermentation, the resulting fluids can be distilled using, for example, a "beer
    column" to separate ethanol and other alcohols from the majority of water and residual solids.
                                                     30

   WO 2014/059140                                                                  PCT/US2013/064332
    The vapor exiting the beer column can be, e.g., 35% by weight ethanol and can be fed to a
    rectification column. A mixture of nearly azeotropic (92.5%) ethanol and water from the
    rectification column can be purified to pure (99.5%) ethanol using vapor-phase molecular
    sieves. The beer column bottoms can be sent to the first effect of a three-effect evaporator.
 5  The rectification column reflux condenser can provide heat for this first effect. After the first
    effect, solids can be separated using a centrifuge and dried in a rotary dryer. A portion (25%)
    of the centrifuge effluent can be recycled to fermentation and the rest sent to the second and
    third evaporator effects. Most of the evaporator condensate can be returned to the process as
    fairly clean condensate with a small portion split off to waste water treatment to prevent
10  build-up of low-boiling compounds.
    Intermediates and Products
             Using the processes described herein, the biomass material can be converted to one or
    more products, such as energy, fuels, foods and materials. Specific examples of products
15  include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, sugars (e.g., glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose,
    galactose, fructose, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides), alcohols (e.g.,
    monohydric alcohols or dihydric alcohols, such as ethanol, n-propanol, isobutanol, sec
    butanol, tert-butanol or n-butanol), hydrated or hydrous alcohols (e.g., containing greater than
    10%, 20%, 30% or even greater than 40% water), biodiesel, organic acids, hydrocarbons
20  (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, isobutene, pentane, n-hexane, biodiesel, bio-gasoline and
    mixtures thereof), co-products (e.g., proteins, such as cellulolytic proteins (enzymes) or
    single cell proteins), and mixtures of any of these in any combination or relative
    concentration, and optionally in combination with any additives (e.g., fuel additives). Other
    examples include carboxylic acids, salts of a carboxylic acid, a mixture of carboxylic acids
25  and salts of carboxylic acids and esters of carboxylic acids (e.g., methyl, ethyl and n-propyl
    esters), ketones (e.g., acetone), aldehydes (e.g., acetaldehyde), alpha and beta unsaturated
    acids (e.g., acrylic acid) and olefins (e.g., ethylene). Other alcohols and alcohol derivatives
    include propanol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-propanediol, sugar alcohols (e.g.,
    erythritol, glycol, glycerol, sorbitol threitol, arabitol, ribitol, mannitol, dulcitol, fucitol, iditol,
30  isomalt, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol and other polyols), and methyl or ethyl esters of any of these
    alcohols. Other products include methyl acrylate, methylmethacrylate, lactic acid, citric acid,

    salts of any of these acids, mixtures of any of the acids and their respective salts. Many of
    the products obtained, such as ethanol or n-butanol, can be utilized as a fuel for powering
    cars, trucks, tractors, ships or trains, e.g., as an internal combustion fuel or as a fuel cell
    feedstock. Many of the products obtained can also be utilized to power aircraft, such as

    be utilized for electrical power generation, e.g., in a conventional steam generating plant or in
    a fuel cell plant.
             Other intermediates and products, including food and pharmaceutical products, are

    Carbohydrate Containing Materials (Biomass Materials)
             As used herein, the term "biomass materials" is used interchangeably with the term
    "carbohydrate-containing materials", and includes lignocellulosic, cellulosic, starchy, and
15  microbial materials. Any of the methods described herein can be practiced with mixtures of
    any biomass materials described herein.
             Lignocellulosic materials include, but are not limited to, wood, particle board, forestry
    wastes (e.g., sawdust, aspen wood, wood chips), grasses, (e.g., switchgrass, miscanthus, cord
    grass, reed canary grass), grain residues, (e.g., rice hulls, oat hulls, wheat chaff, barley hulls),
20  agricultural waste (e.g., silage, canola straw, wheat straw, barley straw, oat straw, rice straw,
    jute, hemp, flax, bamboo, sisal, abaca, corn cobs, corn stover, soybean stover, corn fiber,
    alfalfa, hay, coconut hair), sugar processing residues (e.g., bagasse, beet pulp, agave
    bagasse), , algae, seaweed, manure, sewage, and mixtures of any of these.
             In some cases, the lignocellulosic material includes corncobs. Ground or
25  hammermilled corncobs can be spread in a layer of relatively uniform thickness for
    irradiation, and after irradiation are easy to disperse in the medium for further processing. To
    facilitate harvest and collection, in some cases the entire corn plant is used, including the corn
    stalk, corn kernels, and in some cases even the root system of the plant.
             Advantageously, no additional nutrients (other than a nitrogen source, e.g., urea or
30  ammonia) are required during fermentation of corncobs or cellulosic or lignocellulosic
    materials containing significant amounts of corncobs.
             Corncobs, before and after comminution, are also easier to convey and disperse, and
    have a lesser tendency to form explosive mixtures in air than other cellulosic or
    lignocellulosic materials such as hay and grasses.

   WO 2014/059140                                                                 PCT/US2013/064332
             Cellulosic materials include, for example, paper, paper products, paper waste, paper
    pulp, pigmented papers, loaded papers, coated papers, filled papers, magazines, printed
    matter (e.g., books, catalogs, manuals, labels, calendars, greeting cards, brochures,
    prospectuses, newsprint), printer paper, polycoated paper, card stock, cardboard, paperboard,
 5  materials having a high a-cellulose content such as cotton, and mixtures of any of these. For
    example paper products as described in U.S. App. No. 13/396,365 ("Magazine Feedstocks"
    by Medoff et al., filed February 14, 2012), the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein
    by reference.
             Cellulosic materials can also include lignocellulosic materials which have been de
10  lignified.
             Starchy materials include starch itself, e.g., corn starch, wheat starch, potato starch or
    rice starch, a derivative of starch, or a material that includes starch, such as an edible food
    product or a crop. For example, the starchy material can be arracacha, buckwheat, banana,
    barley, cassava, kudzu, oca, sago, sorghum, regular household potatoes, sweet potato, taro,
15  yams, or one or more beans, such as favas, lentils or peas. Blends of any two or more starchy
    materials are also starchy materials. Mixtures of starchy, cellulosic and or lignocellulosic
    materials can also be used. For example, a biomass can be an entire plant, a part of a plant or
    different parts of a plant, e.g., a wheat plant, cotton plant, a corn plant, rice plant or a tree.
    The starchy materials can be treated by any of the methods described herein.
20           Microbial materials include, but are not limited to, any naturally occurring or
    genetically modified microorganism or organism that contains or is capable of providing a
    source of carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose), for example, protists, e.g., animal protists (e.g.,
    protozoa such as flagellates, amoeboids, ciliates, and sporozoa) and plant protists (e.g., algae
    such alveolates, chlorarachniophytes, cryptomonads, euglenids, glaucophytes, haptophytes,
25  red algae, stramenopiles, and viridaeplantae). Other examples include seaweed, plankton
    (e.g., macroplankton, mesoplankton, microplankton, nanoplankton, picoplankton, and
    femtoplankton), phytoplankton, bacteria (e.g., gram positive bacteria, gram negative bacteria,
    and extremophiles), yeast and/or mixtures of these. In some instances, microbial biomass can
    be obtained from natural sources, e.g., the ocean, lakes, bodies of water, e.g., salt water or
30  fresh water, or on land. Alternatively or in addition, microbial biomass can be obtained from
    culture systems, e.g., large scale dry and wet culture and fermentation systems.
             In other embodiments, the biomass materials, such as cellulosic, starchy and
    lignocellulosic feedstock materials, can be obtained from transgenic microorganisms and
    plants that have been modified with respect to a wild type variety. Such modifications may
                                                      33

     be, for example, through the iterative steps of selection and breeding to obtain desired traits
     in a plant. Furthermore, the plants can have had genetic material removed, modified, silenced
     and/or added with respect to the wild type variety. For example, genetically modified plants
     can be produced by recombinant DNA methods, where genetic modifications include
 5   introducing or modifying specific genes from parental varieties, or, for example, by using
     transgenic breeding wherein a specific gene or genes are introduced to a plant from a
     different species of plant and/or bacteria. Another way to create genetic variation is through
     mutation breeding wherein new alleles are artificially created from endogenous genes. The
     artificial genes can be created by a variety of ways including treating the plant or seeds with,
10   for example, chemical mutagens (e.g., using alkylating agents, epoxides, alkaloids, peroxides,
     formaldehyde), irradiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, beta particles, alpha particles,
     protons, deuterons, UV radiation) and temperature shocking or other external stressing and
     subsequent selection techniques. Other methods of providing modified genes is through error
     prone PCR and DNA shuffling followed by insertion of the desired modified DNA into the
15   desired plant or seed. Methods of introducing the desired genetic variation in the seed or
     plant include, for example, the use of a bacterial carrier, biolistics, calcium phosphate
     precipitation, electroporation, gene splicing, gene silencing, lipofection, microinjection and
     viral carriers. Additional genetically modified materials have been described in U.S.
