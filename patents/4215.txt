   is used to dig piles various matter such as soil,                                        stone,
   sand,      compost,          manure,        feed,       excrement       etc.,      move    them
   to     a     specific           place,       or      load      them      into       transport
   vehicles in various fields                         such as construction, public
20 works,        agriculture,            and      forestry.           Further,         recently,
   with      the      mechanization              of     farming,         people       connect     a
   loader         to      the        front       of       a    tractor,          which      is     a
   representative               farming       machine,         and use       it    for    various
   purposes           in        farming         such         as     handling           livestock
25 excrement,             loading         common           compost,        dressing         soil,

   readjusting arable lands, and removing snow.
          A   loader            for     a   tractor            is     shown      in    FIG.     1   to
   explain      the       structure.            As      show       in    FIG.      1,  the    loader
   includes        a      bucket         1   that         is       a   deep       container       for
 5 drawing      up      loads,         booms       2     that        are    connected        to   the
   bucket    through             bucket      links         to      be   moved       up   and   down,
   brackets       3    that        are mounted             on    the     front       portion     of   a
   tractor       T      to        rotatably           support           the      booms,       bucket
   cylinders         4     that       are    formed           like      telescopic         arms     to
10 control reciprocation of the bucket,                                   and boom cylinders
   5    that     are        formed        like        telescopic             arms      to   control
   movement of the booms.
          Accordingly,                in    order         to      load      piles      of   various
   matter     using           a      loader,        a     tractor          is     moved     to    the
15 location       of       a    pile      of   matter           to    load,      the    booms     are
   moved down using hydraulic pressure of the tractor such
   that    the    bottom           of   the     bucket          reaches       the     ground,     and
   then    the     bucket            cylinders         and       the    boom       cylinders      are
   operated         by         respective              operation             levers,        thereby
20 drawing up the matter in the bucket.
          After        the       bucket      is      filled          with     the     matter,     the
   bucket     is      lifted          to   a    predetermined                 height      from    the
   ground    by      rotating           the     booms,          and     then      the   matter      in
   the bucket         is moved to a specific place                              or    loaded on        a
25 transport vehicle by moving the tractor.

            However,          if    the     absolute          horizontal             plane       of    the
   bucket         1   is     not    specifically             operated           to     be     parallel
   with the          ground,       as    shown       in    FIG.     2,     in    the process             of
   lifting           the       bucket          1    with        matter           therein           to      a
 5 predetermined              height        using        the    booms         2,     as     described
   above,         the     bucket       1    is     inclined         backward            due      to    the
   rotational            radius       related          to    the     upward          rotation          and
   the matter in the bucket is poured backwards.

   lever       while      checking         the     state       of   the      bucket         such      that
   the absolute horizontal plane of the bucket is parallel
   with       the      ground       to    prevent         the     matter          in     the      bucket
15 from pouring down, so considerable skill is required in
   order       to    operate        the     bucket        operation           lever.          Further,
   since       it     is    required        to     keep      checking          the      orientation

                        SUMMARY OF      THE   INVENTION
 5        According    to   this    technology      of   the   related      art,
   it  is   troublesome      to  calculate       and   store    the   initial
   orientation      angle    on  the    basis     of   the   sensing      value
   from the vehicle angle sensor.               Further, sensing values
   are exactly and uniformly provided by the vehicle angle
10 sensor when working on flat ground, but when working on
   a slope or on uneven ground,             the   sensing values        of the
   vehicle     angle  sensor    are    continuously       changed     and the
   microcomputer,      which performs         calculation     on the basis
   of the    sensing values,        repeatedly     generates      errors,      so
15 it   is   difficult     to   maintain       the   orientation       of     the
   bucket such that the matter in the bucket does not pour
   down upon actual use.
          The present     invention       has   been made     in   an   effort
   to solve the problems         in   the   related art and an aspect
20 of the present invention provides a bucket-orientation
   maintaining device for a tractor loader that includes a
   bucket that is a deep container configured to draw up a
   pile    of   matter,    booms      connected      to   the    bucket       and
   bucket    links,   brackets     installed at a front           portion of

   telescopic arms          for controlling rotation of the booms,
            in    which      reinforcing       plates       are     attached          to
 5 bending portions of the booms and both ends                        of the boom
   cylinders        are   hinge-coupled      between     first      sides      of   the
   reinforcing plates and the brackets,
            first     connecting portions of link plate                 600 having
   a     triangular        shape     are   rotatably        hinge-coupled             to
10 second sides of the reinforcing plates, and
            both     ends   of   the   bucket    cylinders        are    rotatably
   hinge-coupled between second connecting portions of the
   link plates         and the bucket       links   and both ends            of    link
   arms        are      rotatably       hinge-coupled            between        third
15 connecting portions of the link plates                      and the brackets
   so that the bucket            can be maintained in a predetermined
   orientation to correspond to movement of the booms.
            The    device     may    further    include        covers      disposed
   over     the   link    arms   to prevent     the  link       arms   from being
20 exposed to the outside.
            The    bucket-orientation-maintaining                 device       for      a
   tractor       loader     of   the   present    invention,         through        the
   configuration          described     above,   can maintain          the     bucket
   in     a  predetermined         orientation     to     correspond          to    the
25 movement       of    the   booms   when   moving     the      booms    with      the

             The          operation                  of          the       bucket-orientation
   maintaining              device         for       a    tractor         loader         that        employs
   the       present           invention             described            above         is       described
   hereafter.
 5           In     order         to     handle          a     pile     of     matter           using        the
   bucket-orientation-maintaining                                    device       for          a     tractor
   loader of the present invention, first,                                         a driver drives
   the     tractor          T    to    the      site       to     handle      a   pile        of     matter,
   rotates the booms 200 downwards by contracting the boom
10 cylinders            500      such      that        the      bucket      100     is      lowered          the
   ground        to      draw        the     matter           into     the      bucket          100     while
   appropriately                stretching             the      bucket      cylinders              400     such
   that       the     bottom          of    the       bucket         100    reaches           the      ground
   and      is     parallel            to     the       ground,         and      then         drives         the
15 tractor         T     forwards          and       contracts          the      bucket          cylinders
   400,       thereby         drawing          up      the      matter      on    the      ground          into
   the bucket            100.
             Next,        the      driver         stabilizes            the      bucket          100     at      a
   predetermined                angle        by      operating          the      bucket          cylinders
20 400      such      that        the     matter           in      the   bucket         100       does       not
   pour       down,        and      then      carries            the   matter         in      the      bucket
   100       to     a     specific            place          or      rotates        the        booms         200
   upwards         by      stretching             the       boom      cylinders            500      to     load
   the matter into a specific transport vehicle.
25           In     this        process,            the       link     plates          600       rotatably
                                                          14

   hinge-coupled              to    the       reinforcing             plates     201    of     the
   booms       200     are    rotated         on    the      hinge      pins   of   the    first
   connecting portions                  601 to correspond to the rotational
   angle of the booms                  200 by the link arms                  604 having the
 5 first       ends connected to the brackets 300 and the second
   ends      connected          to    the     link       plates        600.     Further,       the
   bucket         cylinders           400     having          the      first     ends    hinge
   coupled         to   the      bucket        links        101     and    the   second      ends
   hinge-coupled to the link plates                               600 are pushed forward
10  (rotated clockwise in the drawing) to correspond to the
   rotational angle of the booms 200 and the booms 200 are
   rotated         with    the      bucket        100     stabilized         and   maintained
   at    the     angle      (in    the     orientation).               Accordingly,       it     is
   possible         to   prevent         the     matter         in   the    bucket    100    from
15 pouring down due to a change in angle of the bucket 100
   while the booms 200 are rotated.
             That     is,   according to the present invention, while
   the     rotational          angle      of the        booms       200   is   adjusted,       the
   booms 200 are rotated with the bucket 100 maintained at
20 the angle          (at the orientation) before the booms 200 are
   rotated         even    though         the     bucket         cylinders       400   are     not
   specifically            controlled,              so      it     is   possible      to     very
   conveniently            operate          the      loader         for    maintaining         the
   orientation            of      the      bucket          100.         Therefore,       it      is
25 possible          to   considerably             reduce         fatigue     of   the   driver
                                                     15

   and improve working speed and efficiency using a loader.
        Although     exemplary     embodiments      of    the    present
   invention   are    illustrated       and   described     above,     the
   present   invention    is   not       limited   to   the    specific
 5 exemplary  embodiments    and     may    be  modified    in   various
   ways by those skilled in the art without departing from
   the  scope  of   the  present      invention    described      in   the
   claims,  and  the   modified    examples     should    not  be    taken
   independently   from the   spirit      and  scope   of  the   present
