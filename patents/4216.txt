10 Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller having components that enable the
   implementation of the dynamic formation of reel strips. At
15 least some of the reel strips are updated dynamically
   during each play of the game such that stacked symbols
   within the game vary from game to game. In an embodiment,
   this is implemented by a reel updater of the game
   controller randomly selecting a reel strip position from
20 among a subset of reel strip positions that have symbols
   fixedly associated with them. The symbol that is used to
   populate the stack of symbols is derived from the selected
   reel strip position as explained in further detail below.
25 General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a standalone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
30 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
35 and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
                                            10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
 5 executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
10 However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
15 the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
   mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
   on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
   Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
20
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
25 arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
30
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
35 mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions            (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
                                            10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

                               - 8
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
 5 with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
10 accordance with game play rules and may include:              a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
15 inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs   (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
20 a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
   A gaming system in the form of a standalone gaming machine
25 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
   includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
30 interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
35 reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
                                             10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

                               - 9
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.  A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
 5 example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
10 by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module that is accessed in response
   to insertion of the player tracking device.

   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
20 panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
25 liquid crystal display.  The display 14 may any other
   suitable video display unit, such as an OLED display.                      The
   top box 26 may also include a display, which may be of the
   same type as the display 14, or of a different type.
30 Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
35 having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
                                            10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

                               - 10
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
 5 memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
10 communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
15 devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
20 In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
25 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
30 screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
35 the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
                                             10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

                               - 11
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
 5 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
10 controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
15 communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                 The RAM
20 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                 The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
25 integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
30 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
35 alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
                                             10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
 5 simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
10 One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
15 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
20 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
25 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.       A loyalty
30 program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
35 provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,

   Further detail of gaming system
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
 5 a wager which will be evaluated for this play of the game
   and initiates a play of the game. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that a player's wager can be varied
   from game to game dependent on player selections. In most
   spinning reel games, it is typical for the player's wager
10 to be made up of a selection as to how the game outcome
   will be evaluated by specifying what parts of the game
   outcome will qualify for winning outcomes and a multiplier
   that will apply to each winning outcome. For example, a
   player's wager may be based on how many lines they play in
15 each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game  (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
   and an amount per line  - e.g. one, two or five credits.
   Winning outcomes on an activated win line may be evaluated
20 based on a pay table that specifies the amount awarded for
   a one credit per line wager multiplied by the amount
   wagered per line.
   Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
25 symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
   display positions being located relative to one another
   such that they form a line.
   In many games, the gaming machine may award winning
30 outcomes which are not strictly limited to the lines they
   have selected, for example, "scatter" pays are awarded
   independently of a players selection of pay lines.
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
35 embodiments, the player may selecting a number of reels to
   play and an amount to wager per reel. Games of this type
   are marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by
                                            10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

   Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd and are also known
   as "ways" to win games. The selection of the reel means
   that each displayed symbol of the reel can be substituted
   for a symbol at one or more designated display positions.
 5 In other words, all symbols displayed at symbol display
   positions corresponding to a selected reel can be used to
   form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at a
   designated, symbol display positions of the other reels.
   For example, if there are five reels and three symbol
10 display positions for each reel such that the symbol
   display positions comprise three rows of five symbol
   display positions, the symbols displayed in the centre row
   are used for non-selected reels. As a result, the total
   number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the
15 number of active display positions of each reels, the
   active display positions being all display positions of
   each selected reel and the designated display position of
   the non-selected reels. As a result for five reels and
   fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to win.
20
   In the embodiment described below, the display positions
   of the symbol display are arranged in a rectangular matrix
   comprising a plurality of columns and a plurality of rows.
   However, other arrangements are known in the gaming
25 industry and could be employed in embodiments of the
   invention. For example, in some arrangements there are
   more symbols in some columns than others, such as 3-4-3-4
   3 arrangement of seventeen display positions corresponding
   to respective ones of five reels. In such arrangements,
30 the columns of four symbols can be arranged so that they
   are off-set or staggered relative to the columns having
   three symbols so that the middle two symbols in the
   columns of four symbols share boundaries with two symbols
   of each neighbouring reel.

   art will appreciate that various of the modules could be
   implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
   circuit.
 5
   Referring to Figure 6, there is shown an embodiment where
   the components of the gaming machine are used to update
   the reel strips in a base game.   Memory 64 of gaming
   system 1 has reel strip data 641 which defines a number of
10 reel strips.   In an embodiment, the reel strips comprise a
   mixture of unmodified reel strips 641A and dynamic reel
   strips 641B.   In the embodiment, the unmodified reel
   strips are used in a defined form whereas the dynamic reel
   strips 641B are updated in each play of the base game.                        In
15 one example, there are five reel strips, three are
   unmodified reel strips and two are dynamic reel strips.
   In another example, there are five reel strips, four are
   unmodified reel strips and one is a dynamic reel strip.
   An advantage of the method of dynamically updating reels
20 strips is that it enables the provision of a gaming
   machine that will generate game outcomes having a greater
   variety.
   Each dynamic reel strip 641B has a number of fixed symbol
25 positions which have a symbol of the set of game symbols
   fixedly associated with their position.    That is, that
   symbol will always occupy the relevant position of the
   reel strip.   Each dynamic reel strip also has a number of
   dynamic symbol positions for which the symbol that will
30 occupy the dynamic reel strip positions is determined
   dynamically during each play of the base game.            These
   dynamic reel strip positions can be thought of as mystery
   symbol positions.   In the embodiments, the dynamic symbol
   positions are arranged in groups of at least two
35 consecutive symbols on the reel strips to provide a stack
   of symbols that will be the same once the symbol is
   selected.   Typically, the stack will be longer than two
                                            10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

                               - 17
   symbols, for example, three, four, five, six, seven or
   eight symbols long.   In the examples below, there is one
   group  (or stack of symbols) in the reel strip but in other
   embodiments, there could be multiple groups of dynamic
 5 reel strip positions.
   In order to implement the functionality, the game
   controller 60 has a component in the form of a reel
   updater 624 which updates the dynamic reel strip 641B to
lo form a update of reel strips 641C.    The reel updater 624
   has a position selector 624A which, in one embodiment,
   uses RNG 621 to randomly select a fixed symbol position
   from at least a subset of fixed symbol positions of the
   respective reel strip which is to be updated.            In one
15 example, each fixed symbol position has an equal
   probability of being selected. In another example, the
   positions may be weighted.    In another example, only a
   subset of the fixed symbol positions may be used as the
   basis of the selection.
20
   The reel updater 624 also has a symbol determiner 624B
   which determines the identity of the symbol to be used to
   update the group of dynamically determined symbol
   positions of dynamic reel strip 641B based on the identity
25 of the selected fixed symbol position.
   In one embodiment, the symbol determiner 624B directly
   determines the identity of the symbol from the identity of
   the symbol that is located at the selected fixed position.
30 and that symbol is then used to populate the dynamically
   determined symbol positions of the dynamic reel strips
   from the updated reel strip 641C.    In another embodiment,
   when the selected fixed symbol position is one of a first
   subset of fixed symbol positions, symbol determiner 624B
35 is configured such that the symbol that is determined by
   the symbol determiner 624B is the symbol associated with
   the selected fixed symbol position whereas if the selected
                                             10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

                               - 18
   fixed symbol position is one of a second subset of fixed
   symbol positions, the symbol that is determined is a
   default symbol.
 5 In one example, the default symbol is not associated with
   any of the fixed symbol positions and hence only occurs in
   the symbol set (and hence in game outcomes generated using
   the updated dynamic reel strip) when one of the second
   subset of fixed symbol positions is selected.           In another
10 embodiment, after a fixed symbol position is determined, a
   second random determination is carried out to determine
   whether the symbol at that fixed symbol position will be
   used or whether the default symbol will be used.                In one
   example, weightings are associated with at least a subset
15 of the fixed symbol positions.   The associated weighting
   sets the probability that the symbol determiner 624B will
   determine using random number generator 621 that that
   symbol will be selected and used to populate the
   dynamically determined symbol position.    For example, a
20 weighting of 0.2 will mean that there is a 20% chance that
   the symbol determiner 624 will populate the dynamically
   determined symbol position.
   After a symbol has been chosen, the dynamic reel strip or
25 reel strips are updated by the reel updater 624 with the
   selected symbols and stored as updated reel strips 641C to
   in memory 64.   In other embodiments, symbols may be
   selected separately for each reel strip.     In other
   embodiments, whether there are multiple groups of fixed
30 symbols, the process may be repeated separately for each
   group.
   After the dynamic reel strips have been updated, symbol
   selector 622A selects symbols from a set of symbols
35 specified by symbol data 641 using random number generator
   621. The selected symbols are advised to the display
   controller 624 which causes them to be displayed on
                                            10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

                              - 19
   display 54 at a set of symbol display positions.
   In the embodiment, the symbol selector 622A selects
   symbols for display at symbol display positions from the
 5 unmodified reel strips 641A and updated reel strips 641C
   corresponding to respective ones of a plurality of
   spinning reels. As will be appreciated from the
   discussion, the unmodified reel strips 641A and updated
   dynamic reel strips 641C specify a sequence of symbols for
10 each reel. In an embodiment, the symbol selector 622A
   selects the symbols for display by selecting a stopping
   position in the sequence. In one example, three symbols of
   each of five reels are displayed such that symbols are
   displayed at fifteen symbol display positions on display
15 54. It is known to use a probability table stored in
   memory 64 to vary the odds of a particular stop position
   being selected. Other techniques can be used to control
   the odds of particular outcomes occurring to thereby
   control the return to player of the game.
20
   Once the symbols are selected, they are evaluated by the
   outcome evaluator 623 by comparing the symbol selected at
   symbol display positions on display 54 with pay table 643.
   Both the selected symbols and any winning outcomes are
25 displayed on display 54 under control of display
   controller 625. Any wins are added to a win meter of
   meters 643 stored in memory 64.  Assuming this ends that
   game, e.g. a feature is not triggered or the player does
   not chose a gamble feature, the value on the win meter can
30 be transferred to the credit meter either by the player
   initiating a new play of the game or electing to cash out.
   In some embodiments, certain win types (e.g. jackpot prize
   wins) may be added directly to the credit meter.
35 In some embodiments, an eligibility criteria may be
   applied in order for the player to be eligible for the
   dynamic reel strips, for example that the player has made
                                            10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

                              - 20
   a certain sized wager, made an ante bet, selected all win
   lines, played sufficient games, or the player is a member
   of a loyalty program.
 5 The dynamic reel strips may be employed in a base game or
   a feature game. The base game is a part of the game which
   is carried out each time the player makes a wager,
   typically irrespective of the wager, whereas the feature
   game will usually only be carried out occasionally in a
10 play of the game for example if a condition is met such as
   a trigger occurring.
   The trigger event may be, a symbol combination in the
   game, occurrence of a specific symbol in the game,
15 purchased, be caused by another connected system, based on
   turnover, based on a random evaluation, etc.
   A play of a game may result in one or more wins.
   Typically, a win will result in some form of award being
20 made such as an award of credits added to the win meter.
   Such an award may never actually be physically received by
   a player. For example, many gaming systems provide a
   player with a double or nothing gamble feature, where the
   player can double or forfeit their credits before
25 commencing another play of the game or cashing out.
   Further, as credits are fungible, once credits have been
   added to the credit meter it is not possible to
   distinguish between credits which exist because the player
   has input cash or the like and credits resulting from an
30 award.
   Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a method 700 of an
   embodiment of the invention.   The method involves
   receiving 710a wager, selecting 720 a fixed symbol
35 position, using 730 the selected fixed symbol position to
   determine a symbol for a group of dynamically determined
   symbols, and updating the dynamic reel strips with the
                                            10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

                               - 21
   determined symbols 740.   The method 700 then involves
   selecting 750 symbols for display using the updated reel
   strips and evaluating 760 the selected symbols and making
   any awards based on the pay table 643.
 5
   Examples
   In a first example, the method of determining a symbol to
   occupy the group of dynamically determined symbol
10 positions  (i.e. the stack of symbols) without using a
   weighting table is to generate a random number of between
   1 and the length of the subset of symbol positions of the
   reel strip that have symbols fixedly associated with them.
   That is, the random number generated is the actual
15 position of a symbol on that reel strip. In the first
   example, it is the symbol at that position that the
   mystery symbols or stack becomes.
   Table 1 shows the original reel strip comprising fixed
20 symbol positions 1 to 20 and dynamic symbol positions 21
   to 30 as denoted by the "Mystery" symbols. Before a spin
   employing the dynamic reel strips, the game controller 60
   causes the RNG 621 to generate a number between 1 and 20.
   In this example, the number is 8. Position 8 corresponds
25 the symbol "A". Hence the reel strip is updated so that
   the mystery symbols from position 21 to 30 becomes "A" as
   shown in Table 2.
                                            10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

  In a second example, there is not a direct correlation
  between all of the selected positions and the symbol that
5 will be displayed. In an example, selection of some of the
  symbol positions will result in that symbol being
  displayed while selection of other symbol positions will
  result in a default symbol being displayed. For example,
                                           10102376_1 (GHMatters) P100133.AU.2 23/03/18

                               - 23
    if the RNG 621 choses position 1, 8 or 16, from Table 1,
    the MYSTERY symbol is "A", otherwise MYSTERY becomes a
    SPECIAL SYMBOL not currently on the reel strip.
  5 In a third example, a weighting can be assigned to some or
    all of the positions on the reel strip. In one example,
    shown in Table 3, weightings are associated with specific
    positions. If the reel position has a weighting, the
    mystery symbol will become that symbol based on the
10  weighting, otherwise it stays a mystery symbol. Note a
    weighting of zero means the mystery symbol remains a
    mystery symbol. That is, there is a multiple stage
    process, first select a position and second determine
    based on a random trial derived from the weighting whether
15  the mystery symbol will become a particular symbol.
    In another example, weightings could be associated with
    specific reel strip positions in order to vary the odds of
    particular reel strip positions being selected by the RNG.
