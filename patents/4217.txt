               THERAPY MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM
                                            Background
     [00011      This patent is directed to the development of therapy management
     systems and methods, and, in particular, to the development of therapy management
     systems and methods that involve modification of the structure and/or operation of a
     medical device or system used in conjunction with the therapy.
     100021      Therapy, or treatment, for a medical condition may be characterized in a
    number of different ways. For example, therapy may be discussed in terms of the
    agent used to affect a change in the patient's condition, such as a drug or radiation.
    As another example, therapy may be discussed in tens of the mode or route of
    administration.
    100031      Infusion therapy    the intravenous delivery (ie., delivery into a vein) of
   therapy - is well known in the art. In its simplest fonn, infusion therapy may be
   carried out using a container or bag connected to a patient via a drip chamber, an
   administration set and a catheter. In such a system and according to such a method,
   fluid passes from the bag to the patient under the influence of gravity. In a more
   complex system, a pump or a cuff may be used to control the flow of the fluid to the
  patient.
  [0004J       Improvements to pumping systems used with infusion therapy have
  included the introduction of pump controllers. Certain pump controllers may be used
  as a central point for programming one or more pumps. The pump controller may
  also be used as a central point for displaying information concerning the operation of
 the pumps and related sensors. Further, the pump controller may be used as a central
 point for communication between the pumps and sensors and remote computerized
 systems, such as record-keeping systems for patient information and databases of
 pharmaceutical information.
 [0005]        Despite the inclusion of the pump controller, infusion therapy
management has conventionally involved human intervention, in the forn of one or
more clinicians administering the process. For example, the clinician may examine
the historical data from pump or the patient's chart regarding the therapy (flow rate,
volume infused, etc.). The clinician may then combine this data with additional data

       regarding the patient's condition such as may be obtained from an instrument (e.g.,
      blood pressure cuff, heart monitor, etc.), the patient's chart or the patient directly.
      Finally, the clinician will exercise his or her medical judgment regarding changes to
      the therapy.
      [0006]       The development of new therapy management techniques thus typically
      rely upon a clinician's expertise, and must face the challenge of a rigorous regulation
     scheme as well. Taking drug delivery as an example, developments tend to occur as
     to a particular drug and a particular route of delivery.    Even in those instances where
     certain changes of therapy have been automated (e.g., where the pump automatically
     modifies its operation in accordance with a sensor reading), the development has been
     isolated to a particular drug and/or required continued intensive clinician involvement
    to manage the system. Certainly, the nature of the focus is influenced by the need to
    obtain regulatory approval prior to wide-spread release of the therapy, which approval
    is only obtained after extensive development and testing of such unique systems. One
    effect of the isolated nature of development is a proliferation of unique single-use or
    limited-use systems, methods and/or devices, with the attendant problems of
   supplying and supporting each of these devices.
   [00071         As set forth in greater detail below, the present disclosure sets forth an
   improved assembly dmbodying advantageous alternatives to the conventional devices
  and methods discussed above.
                                              Summary
  [0008]         According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a method of providing
  therapy management development is provided. The method includes providing a
 therapy management development platform having a plurality of levels of
 functionality, the platform including a medical device capable of providing therapy
 management, setting the platform to a first level of access to the functionality relative
 to the medical device, and modifying the operation of the medical device using the
 platform. The method also includes receiving an indication of approval to change the
 level of access to the functionality of the platform to a second level of access, and
setting the platform to the second level of access to the functionality of the platform in
response to receipt of the indication of approval.
100091          According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a therapy
management development platform includes a pump controller with a pump
                                                -.2-

     input/output interface coupled to the pump controller, and an interface module
     including an interface module controller and a module-sensor input/output interface,
     the module-sensor input/output interface having at least one standardized input port,
     at least one standardized output port and at least one standardized power connection.
     The interface module controller is customizably programmed to receive data from a
     sensor coupled to the module-sensor input/output interface and from the pump
    controller and to provide instructions to the pump controller to vary the operation of a
    pump coupled thereto.

  in any of the exemplary embodiments, except as may be explicitly delineated in the
  corresponding written description. None of the drawings are necessarily to scale.

                            Detailed Description of Various Embodiments
     [0022J        Although the following text sets forth a detailed description of different
     embodiments of the invention, it should be understood that the legal scope of the
     invention is defined by the words of the claims set forth at the end of this patent. The
    detailed description is to be construed as exemplary only and does not describe every
    possible embodiment of the invention since describing every possible embodiment
    would be impractical, if not impossible. Numerous alternative embodiments could be
    implemented, using either current technology or technology developed after the filing
   date of this patent, which would still fall within the scope of the claims defining the
   invention.
   100231         It should also be understood that, unless a termi is expressly defined in this
   patent using the sentence "As used herein, the tern      '_       ' is hereby defined to
   mean..." or a similar sentence, there is no intent to limit the meaning of that tenr,
   either expressly or by implication, beyond its plain or ordinary meaning, and such
  term should not be interpreted to be limited in scope based on any statement made in
  any section of this patent (other than the language of the claims). To the extent that
  any term recited in the claims at the end of this patent is referred to in this patent in a
  manner consistent with a single meaning, that is done for sake of clarity only so as to
  not confuse the reader, and it is not intended that such claim term be limited, by
  implication or otherwise, to that single meaning. Finally, unless a claim element is
 defined by reciting the word "means" and a function without the recital of any
 structure, it is not intended that the scope of any claim element be interpreted based
 on the application of 35 U.S.C. § 112, sixth paragraph.
 [00241         As noted above, development of new therapy management systems and
methods have generally focused on the clinician. This focus may be influenced by the
degree to which the experience of the clinician guides the implementation of many
therapy management systems and methods. Certainly, this focus has its limitations, in
                                               -4-

     that while the clinician may be experienced in the treatment of a particular medical
     conduction or the use of a particular delivery system or drug, for example, the
    clinician may not be experienced in the actual design and operation of the delivery
    system used. Given the rigorous testing that must be conducted and therefore the
    level of knowledge of the structure and operation of the system required, the barriers
    to variation of the delivery system. as part of a new therapy are high, especially upon
   the advent of sophisticated control devices, such as pump controllers.
    10025]       On the other hand, the advancement of medical science would be
   benefited from a shift from the skills and experience of the clinician, at least as to
   variations in equipment, to those of the medical device manufacturer. The medical
   device manufacturer, while lacking the degree of sophistication of the clinician in
   their understanding of the patient's response to particular therapies, has a deep and
  thorough knowledge of the structure and operation of medical devices and systems.
  As such, variation of the structure and the operation of the device may represent a less
  impressive barrier to the manufacturer than to the clinician.
  100261        While recognizing that the traditional model for clinician/manufacturer
  development has involved an intensive partnership between the two parties, it is
  believed that a more standardized approach to the issue of therapy management
  development may provide for advantages to both parties. In particular, it is believed
 that the organized and standardized set of tools, both hai-dware and software,
 presented herein will provide greater access to the clinician, while at the same time
 decreasing the need for intimate interaction with the manufacture on a daily basis.
 Further, safeguards may be included in the system to decrease the likelihood that
 development will subvert existing regulatory framework.
 [0027]        Fig. I illustrates schematically an embodiment of a therapy management
 development platform. In particular, this platform is useful for designing sensors to
 be used in conjunction with a pump for use in intravenous (IV) infusion therapy, and
in particular for closed-loop IV infusion therapies, such as IV drug control. However,
as it will be recognized and as explained herein, the therapy management
development platform may be used in conjunction with other therapies provided by
other medical devices as well.
[00281         As seen in Figs. I and 2, a therapy management development platform, or
system, 100 according to the present disclosure is illustrated. The system 100 may
                                             - 5-

     include a pump controller 102, an interface module 104, and a sensor 106. The pump
     controller 102 and the interface module 104 communicate with each other, as do the
     interface module 104 and the sensor 106. Each element of the system 100 will be
    explained in greater detail below.
     (0029]      As illustrated in Figs. I and 2, the pump controller 102 may be disposed
    or mounted in a housing 110. The housing I 10 may be con figured to be attached to a
    stand such as may be used to support therapy elements of the like. Alternatively, the
    housing I10 may be configured to sit on a surface, such as desk top or the like.
    [0030]       The pump controller 102 may include a processor and memory. The
   memory may be in form of read-only memory (ROM) and random access memory
   (RAM). The ROM may take many different forms, including erasable programmable
   ROM (EPROM) and electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM).
   100311       The pump controller 102 may be coupled to a pump input/output (I/O)
   interface 112. The pump 11O interface 112 is configured to permit the pump
   controller I10 to communicate with one or more pumps I14 associated with the pump
  controller 102. The communication between the pump or pumps 114 and the
  controller 102 may be carried out over a hardwired connection or wirelessly, through
  the use of radio-frequency (RF) or infra-red (IR) transmitters and receivers, for
  example. A wide variety of communication protocols may be used, such as wired
  Ethernet, wireless Ethernet (Wi-Fi), ZigBee, and .Bluetooth.
  [0032]        The pump controller 100 may also be coupled to a user I/O interface 116.
 The user 1/O interface 116 may include one or more output devices, such as a visual
 display (such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a light emitting diode (LED)
 display) and/or an audible display (such as a piezo-electric buzzer). Such output
 devices may be used to provide key interaction events to delineate how therapy
 control is affecting outcome parameters, e.g., multi-variable graphs with marked
 events. The user I/O interface 116 may also include one or more input devices, such
 as push buttons, touch-screen panels, keyboards, and the like; the input devices may
also include readers for use with barcode, RFID, magnetic stripe or holographic image
technologies. The user 1/0 interface 116 may be used to access information stored
within the pump controller 102 (such as flow history, volume delivered, delivery
interruptions, flow rates, and drug sensitivity information) and/or to program the
pump controller 102 to control the operation of the one or more pumps 114.
                                             -6-

      100331        The interface module 104 may also include a number of different
      subsystems, all of which may be disposed or mounted in a housing 120. As
      illustrated, the interface module 104 includes a module controller 122, a power supply
      124, a pump controller-module 1/0 interface 126, a module-sensor 1/0 interface 128,
     and a user 1/0 interface 130. The housing 120 may be configured to be connected to
     or mounted on a stand, similar to the housing 110, or may even be configured to be
     connected to or mounted on the housing I 10.
     [00341        Like the pump controller 102, the module controller 122 may include a
    processor and memory. The memory may be in form of read-only memory (ROM)
    and random access memory (RAM). The ROM may take many different forms,
    including erasable programmable ROM (EPROM) and electrically erasable
    programmable ROM (EEPROM).
    f00351         The pump controller-module 10 interface 126 is coupled to the module
   controller 122 and permits communication with the pump 1/0 interface 112, perhaps
   according to one or more standardized communication protocols, such as are being
   formulated by the International Standards Organization (ISO) and (IEEE) through the
   incorporation of the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) processes. As was
  the case with the pump(s) 114, the communication between the pump controller
  module 1/O interface 126 and the pump FO interface 112 may take the form of a
  hardwired or wireless connection. The pump controller-module /O interface 126
  may be configured to the particular proprietary hardware and software specifications
  of the pump controller manufacturer.
  100361         The module-sensor 110 interlace 128 has at least one standardized input
 port, at least one standardized output port and at least one standardized power
 connection. The module-sensor 1/O interface 128 is also coupled to the module
 controller 122 and the power supply 124, with the communication between the
 interface 128 and the controller 122 permitting the controller 122 to communicate
 with the sensor 106 and the connection between the interface 128 and the power
supply 124 to provide power to the sensor 106.
100371           The user 1/0 interface 130 is coupled to the module controller 122 and is
similar to the user UO interface 116. The user 1/0 interface 130 may include one or
more output devices, such as a visual display (such as a liquid crystal display (LCD)
or a light emitting diode (LED) display) and/or an audible display (such as a piezo
                                              -7-

     electric buzzer). Such output devices may be used to provide key interaction events
     to delineate how therapy control is affecting outcome parameters, e.g., multi-variable
     graphs with marked events. The user I/O interface 130 may also include one or more
     input devices, such as push buttons, touch-screen panels, keyboards, and the like.
     However, unlike the user 1/O interface 116, the user 1/O interface 130 may not have
     dedicated text-based interface or graphical user interface (GUI) associated with the
    output devices or dedicated icons or pictograms assigned to the input devices. The
    absence of such dedicated assignments is discussed in greater detail below.
    (0038]       In addition to being coupled to the interfaces 126, 128, 130, the module
    controller 122 may also be in communication with a computing device 140. The
    communication with the computing device 140 may be hardwired or wireless. The
    communication may also be continuous or discrete; that is, the controller 122 may be
   coupled to the computing device 140 through the use of a cable or transmitter/receiver
   connection, or one or more memory devices (e.g., memory sticks) may be used to
   transport programs prepared using the computing device 140 to the controller 122.
   While not shown, a further interface may be disposed between the controller 122 and
  the computing device 140 to permit communication between the devices.
  [0039]        In particular, the computing device 140 may include one or more
  applications (which may be collectively referred to as a development toolkit) that
  facilitate programming of the controller 122. These applications may permit a
  program to be written by a user through the manipulation of a GUI in combination
  with a library of standardized input commands, output commands, and procedure
 commands. The user would thus be able to select from the input commands, output
 commands and procedure commands to compose a program, which the application
 Would automatically convert into a language understood by the controller 122. This
 may be achieved with greater efficiency using the development toolkit than without.
 [0040]        For example, a user may select input and output commands to establish
 data channels to receive signals from the sensor 106, signals from the pump controller
 102 and signals from the user I/O interface 130. The user may also use standardized
commands to scale the inputs according to ranges of the signal outputs from the
sensor 106 and pump controller 102. Further, the user may select filtering algorithms
from the procedure commands to, for example, filter the data received from the sensor
106 and the pump controller 102. The user may also select control algorithms that
                                            - 8-

     implement one or more standardized control models. Furthermore, these control
     algorithms could be represented in the GUI through the use of intuitive
     representations and symbology, rather than complicated expressions of these complex
     algorithms. Unit correction could be handled automatically based on the input,
     output, and procedure commands selected.
     [00411       As a more particular example, the user may have a new glucose sensor to
    be used in a closed-loop drug delivery control system. The user may use the
    development toolkit to assign certain channels of the pump controller I/O interface
    126 to retrieve pump data, to assign certain channels of the sensor-module I/O
    interface 128 to retrieve sensor data, and to configure the user 1/0 interface 130 to
    display information on or controls for the parameters of interest (blood glucose,
   glycosolated hemoglobin, IV insulin infusion flow rate, and oral and IV nutritional
   inputs). The user may use the scaling tools to scale the glucose readings according to
   the minimum and maximum voltage outputs for the sensor 106, and the pump flow
   rate and inputs according to the nutritional scale selected. The user may also select
   filtering algorithms to eliminate noise from the sensor data (eg., a 3-pole, low pass
   filter), and to eliminate user data entry errors from the input data. The user may also
  select an available control model from a library, with the only input being selection of
  the loop gains and feedback sources for each component of the model. The
  application would then automatically perform integrity checks (such as for
  mathematical unit consistency and conversions) and generate a program, complete
  with the necessary system equations, that could be uploaded to the controller 122.
  100421        Of course, while it may be suggested from the discussion above that the
 computing device 140 may be disposed in the same general area as the controller 122
 to permit uploading via a local hardwired or wireless connection, or uploading of the
 program to a controller 122 from a portable memory device moved between devices
 occupying space in the same room, this need not be the case according to all
 implementations of the system 100. For example, a computing device 140 may be
disposed in a location remote to the system 100, and the program (once generated)
may be transmitted electronically over a computer network (such as a wide area
network, an intranet or the Internet). As a consequence, the action of uploading may
involve the movement of the program across great geographic distances between the
computing device 140 and the system 100.
                                             -9-

     [00431      Thus, Fig. 3 shows a simplified method 200 according to the present
     disclosure, wherein user uses a computing device 140 running the development toolkit
    application to select con.mands from a standardized library of commands for
    programming the module controller 122 at block 202. The computing device 140
    then performs certain checks on the commands selected at block 204, and converts the
    commands to generate a program in a language understood by the module controller
    122 at block 206. The program may then be uploaded to the module controller 122 at
    block 208.
    100441       Fig. 4 is a representation of the graphical user interface 220 displayed to
   the user by the development tool kit operating on the computing device 140. The
   graphic user interface 220 is merely an exemplary embodiment; it will be recognized
   that other interfaces are also possible.
   [00451        According to the illustrated embodiment, the interface 220 includes a
  plurality of user options. For convenience and ease of implementation, the user
  options are organized into three groups or categories: therapy control options 222,
  sensor configuration options 224 and filter configuration options 226. Within each
  group 222, 224, 226, there may be a plurality of user options, as illustrated. However,
  it is also possible to have a group defined by a single user option, and it is possible to
  have all of the user options organized into a single group.
  [0046I        Each of the user options within each group 222, 224, 226 may be
  associated with one or more objects, routines, programs, etc., the configuration of
 these objects, routines, programs, etc. being influenced by the user options selected or
 modified within the one or more groups 222, 224, 226. For example, within the
 therapy control option group 222, there are options for linear PID control 230, non
 linear control 232, model predictive control 234, adaptive control 236, and fuzzy logic
 control 238. Selecting any one of the options 230, 232, 234, 236, 238 may use a
 particular object, routine, program, etc. to the exclusion of objects, routines, programs
etc. for the other options. As such, a radio button may be used so that the user may
select only one of the options 230, 232, 234, 236, 238.
100471         Moreover, the user options may be organized using a tree structure, such
that a selection of a first user option may lead to further options being available to the
user, while other options are excluded. For example, if the linear PID control option
230 is selected, there are further options 240, 242, 244 for setting a proportional,
                                             - 10-

      integral or derivative factor. While the further options 240, 242, 244 are illustrated as
      being displayed at the same time as the options 230, 232, 234, 236, 238, the options
     240, 242, 244 may be displayed only if the linear PID control option 230 is selected.
     As another option, a pull-down list or other GUI control may be used to display the
     options possible within the linear PID control option 230 (or any of the other options
     for that matter).
     100481        It will also be recognized that the user options 230, 232, 234, 236, and
    238 are all options for closed loop control of the system of the therapy management
    including the pump 114. Within the control group 220, there are also options for
    clinician control as well. This illustrates that within each group 220, the user options
    may be further organized into subgroups as well. For the clinician control, user
    options may focus on the display of information for user by the clinician, as well as
   the setting of boundary conditions to prevent inadvertent user error.
    100491        For example, the user options under clinician control include display
   options 250 and alarm options 252. The display options 250 may include display of
   flow rates and volumes, as well as historic information on pump operation. The alarm
  options 252 may include options for when to set off audible and/or visual alarms,
  either in terms of changes in sensor output or some other condition, such as drug
  sensitivity. The options 250, 252 also highlight the fact that the user options do not
  necessarily require an input in the form of a numeric value or a pull-down list, but
 may simply be in the form of a check box.
  [00501         In regard to the sensor group 222, user options for sensor input 260,
 display 262, and gain 264 may be selected. As was the case with the user options
 within the control group 220, the user options for input 260, display 262, and gain 264
 are associated with objects, routines, programs, etc. that are influenced by the
 selections made. Further, some of the options are mutually exclusive - the
 amplified/unamplified option and filter/unfiltered option under the display subgroup
262 are examples. Other options require the user to provide a numerical value, such
as the gain subgroup 264.
100511          Finally, in regard to the filter group 224, user options are available to
select objects, routines, programs, etc. that will perform filtering of the data from the
sensor 106 before it is used in the control algorithm. Possible options may be
organized into low pass, high pass, and band pass subgroups 270, 272, 274. An
                                               - I l -

       subgroup 276 for user options regarding use of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) may
      also be provided. As illustrated, each one of the subgroups may have a plurality of
      options associated therewith.
      [00521       Having thus discussed the system 100, the method 200 of use of the
     development tool kit, and an exemplary embodiment of a GUI 250 associated with the
     development tool kit, it will be recognized that the system 100 may include one or
     more additional aspects, which aspects may provide additional advantages to the
     system 100.
     [00531        For example, the system 100 may be used with a standardized sensor
     platform for the sensor 106 permitting the sensor 106 to be connected to the sensor
     module 1/0 interface 130. The platform, which may be in the form of a catheter, may
    include standardized leads for data collection and power distribution. As a
    consequence, the user may focus on development of the sensor or transducer, rather
    than on the mechanism to position, power and/or communicate with the sensor
    relative to a patient.
    100541        Additionally, the system 100 may feature a lockout process that prevents
   a sensor or a program from being used with the pump controller 102 without use of
   the interface module. The lockout process may include a hardware component and/or
  a software component. More typically, the lockout process will be in the form of a
  software component, such as a password or encryption. The lockout may enable or
  prevent use of the system in specific locations prior to regulatory approval, as
  explained in greater detail below.
  [00551         In this regard, the lockout process may be configured so as to permit
  di fferent levels of access. For instance, at a first level, the system 100 may deny any
 operational privileges to the system 100. At a second level, the system 100 may
 permit the system 100 to be used for investigational use only. Finally, at a third level,
 the system 100 may permit use of the system 100 once regulatory approval has been
 obtained.
 [00561         It will also be recognized that while Figs. 1-4 represent an embodiment of
a therapy management development platform according to the present disclosure,
other alternative embodiments are possible. Exemplary additional embodiments are
illustrated in Figs. 5-7.
                                              - 12 -

     100571       Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate an exemplary alternative embodiment wherein the
    module does not reside outside the housing of the pump controller. As such, the
    module, which may still retain its own processing and memory, may utilize other
    aspects of the pump controller, such as the integral power supply of the pump
    controller so reduce equipment requirements and costs. The separation of the
    processing and memory of the module permits the embodiment of Figs. 5 and 6 to
    facilitate logical decomposition of the system, as well as safety and effectiveness by
   establishing boundaries between the subsystems of the system,
   [0058         Referring then to Figs. 5 and 6, it will be recognized that a therapy
   management development system 300 includes a pump controller 302, an interface
   module 304, and a sensor 306. The pump controller 302 and the interface module 304
  communicate with each other, as do the interface module 304 and the sensor 306.
   [00591        As mentioned above, the pump controller 302 and the interface module
  304 may be disposed or mounted in a single housing 310. The housing 310 may be
  configured to be attached to a stand such as may be used to support therapy elements
  of the like. Alternatively, the housing 310 maybe configured to sit on a surface, such
  as desk top or the like.
  [00601         Both the pump controller 302 and the module 304 may include a
  processor and memory. In the instance of the pump controller 302, the processor 312
 and the memory 314 are represented separately, while the processing and memory
 capabilities of the module 304 are represented in the form of a module controller 316.
 The memory may be in form of read-only memory (ROM) and random access
 memory (RAM). The ROM may take many different forms, including erasable
 programmable ROM (EPROM) and electrically erasable programmable ROM
 (EEPROM),
 100611         The pump controller 302 may be coupled to a pump input/output (/O)
interface 3 18. The pump I/O interface 318 is configured to penuit the pump
controller 302 to communicate with one or more pumps 320 associated with the pump
controller 302. The communication between the pump or pumps 320 and the
controller 302 may be carried out over a hardwired connection or wirelessly (through
the use of radio-frequency (RF) or infra-red (1R) transmitters and receivers, for
example).
                                              - 13 -

       [00621       The pump controller 302 may also be coupled to a user 1/0 interface 322.
       The user 1/0 interface 322 may include one or more output devices, such as a visual
      display (such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a light emitting diode (LED)
      display) and/or an audible display (such as a piezo-electric buzzer). Such output
      devices may be used to provide key interaction evens to delineate how therapy control
      is affecting outcome parameters, e.g., multi-variable graphs with marked events. The
      user I/O interface 322 may also include one or more input devices, such as push
     buttons, touch-screen panels, keyboards, and the like. The user 1/O interface 322 may
     be used to access information stored within the pump controller 302 (such as flow
     history, volume delivered, delivery interruptions, flow rates, and drug sensitivity
     infonnation) and/or to program the pump controller 302 to control the operation of the
     one or more pumps 320.
     [00631        The interface module 304 may also include a number of different
     subsystems, which may be disposed or mounted with the module controller 316 on a
    card that is received in a card slot on the pump controller 302. As illustrated, the
    interface module 304 includes a module-sensor 1/0 interface 324. As is also
    illustrated, the interface module 304 may be disposed substantially within the same
   housing 3 10 as the pump controller 302.
   [0064]         The module-sensor I/O interface 324 may have at least one standardized
   input port, at least one standardized output port and at least one standardized power
   connection. The module-sensor 1/0 interface 324 is also coupled to the module
  controller 316 and a power supply 326, which power supply 326 is also used by the
  pump controller 302. In this fashion, the interface module 304 is capable of utilizing
  elements typically associated with the pump controller 302 to reduce the overall
  equipment requirements and costs of the module 304.
  [00651         In addition, the module controller 316 may interface with the pump
 controller 302 so as to communicate with the user 1/0 interface 322 associated with
 the pump controller 302. As such, the embodiment of Fig. 5 and 6 is able to leverage
 the existing equipment of the pump controller 302, and reduce the costs of the module
304. Of course, the minimum requirements of the pump controller 302 are different
than those of the controller 102 in that the module 304 will need to access the user
interface 322 through the controller 302 as illustrated. It will be recognized that
according to a further alternative embodiment, the user I/O interface 322 may be
                                             - 14-

      configured such that the module controller 316 may communicate with the interface
      322 in parallel to the pump controller 302, rather than in series through the pump
      controller 302.
      [00661      As for the programming of the module controller 316, the module
     controller 316 may also be in communication with a computing device 340. The
     communication with the computing device 340 may be hardwired or wireless. The
     communication may also be continuous or discrete; that is, the controller 316 may be
     coupled to the computing device 340 through the use of a cable or transmitter/receiver
     connection, or one or more memory devices (e.g., memory sticks) may be used to
    transport programs prepared using the computing device 340 to the controller 316. In
    this fashion, the module controller 316 may be programmed without having to rely on
    the user [/0 interface 322 having the capabilities to manipulate the development tool
    kit operating on the computing device 340.
    100671       A still further embodiment of the therapy management development
   system 400 is illustrated in Fig. 7. According to this embodiment, a pump controller
   402 is configured to operate similar to the pump controllers 102, 302, but is also
   configured with sufficient 110 interfaces, processing capability and memory capacity
   so as to reduce the module 404 to software operating in the pump controller 402 and
  to permit the module 404 to be programmed without resort to a separate computing
  device. As such, the pump controller 402 is significantly more dedicated to use with
  the module 404 than the pump controllers 102, 302, which may be decoupled from the
  modules 104, 304 and used in their more traditional role.
  [00681         As illustrated, the system 400 includes the pump controller 402, the
 module 404 and a sensor 406. As noted above, the module 404 resides in memory
 408 associated with the pump controller 402, and it operable on the processor 410
 associated with the memory 408. The memory 408 may also include a development
 tool kit 412 for use with the module 404 to program the module to carry out the data
 acquisition with the sensor 406 and potentially a modified therapy management
routine with a pump 414.
100691         To permit the pump controller 402 to be used to program the module 404
through the use of the tool kit 412, it may also be required that the user YO interface
416 be configured differently than the user I/O interfaces of the embodiments of Figs.
I and 5, Similarly, if the 1/0 interface 418 is to be used to supply power to the sensor
                                             - 15 -

     406 from the associated power supply 420, then the interface 418 may have
     capabilities different from and in addition to the capabilities of the interfaces of the
     embodiments of Figs. I and 5.
     100701       Having thus discussed several different embodiments of a therapy
    management development platform and their use by the developer/clinician, Fig. 8
    illustrates the use of these platforms as part of a method 500 of controlled,
    standardized testing to obtain approval for the medical devices or methods developed
    using the platform. As will be recognized, many medical devices or systems require
    approval prior to marketing. In certain jurisdictions, this approval is provided by
    governmental bodies, while elsewhere it may be provided by independent commercial
    organizations that are accountable to governmental bodies. The approval process may
   require a series of stages of testing (bench, animal, human clinical, and fully approved
   use on humans ("human use")), and the stages may even have clearly defined phases
   (pilot, pivotal). The method 500 uses the platforms described above to assist in
   controlling therapy management development to ensure that proper testing has been
  performed.
  [00711         At block 502, the platform is provided to a therapy management
  developer by the platform manufacturer or a party associated with the manufacturer.
  The platform may be, for example, designed in accordance with one of the
  embodiments illustrated above in Figs. 1-7. As will be recognized, these platforms
  have the ability to be used in conjunction with or as a pump controller to vary the
 operation of an associated pump in an infusion therapy. As will be detailed below,
 other platforms may also be provided that are useful, for example, with renal therapy
 or inhalation therapy.
 [0072]         As will be recognized, these platforms may have a plurality of levels of
 functionality relative to the medical device (e.g., pump controller and pump) that
 permits the platforms to be used in bench testing, in animal testing or trials, and in
 clinical (or human) testing or trials. However, it will also be recognized that typically
bench testing and animal trials precede clinical trials, and that even within the scope
of clinical trials, different phases may be passed through sequentially in the process of
obtaining approval for the device or system. Moreover, it is believed that control of
the use of the platform to ensure that the testing or trials proceed in the required
fashion to obtain approval is important.
                                            - 16-

     100731       Consequently, at block 504, the platform will be provided to the user with
     the platform set to an initial level of access to the functionality relative to the medical
    device. The initial level of access may, in many cases, be suitable for conducting
    bench trials using the user-defined sensor or control algorithm. However, it will also
    be appreciated that while certain advantages may be obtained by using the platform
    for all of the required testing (bench. animal, clinical), other advantages may also be
    obtained by utilizing the platform once initial bench testing, for example, is
    completed. Consequently, the initial level of access may not correspond with use of
    the platform for bench testing utilizing the platform in all cases.
    [0074]        The access to a certain level of functionality of the device may be
   achieved through the use of the lockouts described above. That is, a particular
   password or encryption key may provide the developer with access to the
   functionality of the device useful for bench trials, but not for animal or clinical trials.
  A different password or encryption key may provide access to functionality for bench,
  animal and clinical trials, and so on.
  [00751         The developer is then able to modify the operation of the medical device
  using the platform, as described above. For example, the developer may use a
  prototype sensor with the medical device through the use of the platform.
  Alternatively, the developer may make changes to the operation of the control
  algorithm used by the medical device to control therapy management, in particularly
  by using the developer toolkit. As a further alternative, the developer may use a
 prototype sensor and change the operation of the control algorithm. In any event, the
 modification of the operation of the medical device using the platform, according to
 the present disclosure, does not mean changing the operation of the medical device so
 as to simply vary an amount or rate of therapy provided to the patient (i.e., the
 modifications are non-surgical and non-therapeutic in and of themselves). According
 to the present disclosure, the medical device is capable of providing a first
 functionality (capability of using certain sensors or control algorithms) prior to
modification using the platform, and a second functionality after modification using
the platform (capability of using additional or different sensors and/or control
algorithms). Whilst the medical device itself may, of course, be used to provide
beneficial therapy to a patient, the claimed methods are performed without providing
any therapeutic benefit to a human or animal; ie the claimed methods are non
                                              - 17-

     therapeutic. Also, the claimed methods do not involve any surgical step performed on
     the body of a human or animal; ie the claimed methods are non-surgical.
     [0076j       The method 500 then continues to block 506, wherein the party
    controlling access to the functionality of the platform makes a determination if it has
    received indication that the developer has received approval to proceed to a new level
    of access to the functionality of the platform, permitting further testing to occur. This
    indication may be provided by the developer, or by a party working in association
    with the developer (e.g., an institutional review board), or by the
    governmental/independent organizations mentioned above. For that matter, the
   approval may be determined by the party that controls access to the platform, and thus
   need not be a party separate and apart from the party that controls access to the
   platform.
   [00771        If no approval to advance to the next level of access has been received,
   the method 500 remains at block 506. If approval is received, then the method 500
   proceeds to block 508, wherein the party controlling access to the platform sets the
  platform to an increased level of access to the functionality of the platform in
  response to the receipt of the indication of approval. For example, a platfonn that had
  previously been useful only for bench testing may have the level of access modi fled
  so as to be useful for animal studies.    fn addition, the party controlling access to the
  platform may set a customer charge (e.g., a certain amount of currency or value per
  level of access) according to the level of access of the platform, which charge may be
  assessed before, at the same time, or after the the increased level of access is set. The
  customer charge may vary according to the level of access permitted, or may be a set
 amount for each increase in level of access.
 [0078]        Before returning to block 506, a determination may be made if the
 approval process is complete. For example, it may be determined at block 510 that
 the level of approval received was approval to market the medical device. Such
 approval would indicate that restricted use of the platform, as controlled by the party
 controlling access, is complete. In such a circumstance, the method 500 would
 continue to block 512, wherein the new sensor and/or control algorithm are marketed.
Alternatively, the method would return to block 506.
100791         As noted above, the method 500 may facilitate the standardization of
testing required for eventual approval of the sensor and/or therapy management
                                             - 18 -

     algorithm. The method 500 also may provide a more consistent development process,
     with a system having uniform quality. Further, the method 500 may permit the
     manufacturer to leverage the innovation of a large number of users of the above
    described system for new sensors and/or therapy management algorithms to be used
    with the manufacturer's commercial equipment. In return, the method 500 may
    permit innovators to leverage the expertise of the manufacturer in the form of a stable,
    standardized system for sensor and/or algorithm development, lowering the level of
    knowledge required by the innovators of the structure and operation of the
    manufacturer's equipment, such as the pump and pump controller in the embodiments
    described above. Further, the systems and method 500 described above may permit
   the innovators to more easily move their innovations to market, in that use of the
   system provided by the manufacturer should permit the manufacturer to more easily
   integrate the innovations into their existing product line and manufacturing processes.
   [0080j       A further illustration of the operation (and hence the programming) of the
   therapy management development platform may be found in Figs. 9-11. It will be
   appreciated, from the foregoing discussion as well as the disclosure relative to Figs, 9
   11, that the programming of the platform may involve the programming of a number
   of separate devices or processors (see the embodiments of Figs. 1-6). Moreover, the
  programming may include software, and it may include firnware as well. Further, the
  programming may be in different programming languages, each in accordance with
  the device that will execute the programming or operate according to the
  programming. At a higher level, the programming may be procedural, object
 oriented, event-driven, etc. However, it is possible (for example, in regard to the
 embodiment of Fig. 7) that the programming of the platform may involve the
 programming of a single device or processor using a single programming language.
 100811        Turning now to Figs. 9-11 in detail, Fig. 9 provides a overview of the
 operation of, for example, the system 100 from initiation of development to use of the
 system 100, for example, in a healthcare setting with a patient. Fig. 10 illustrates the
 operation of the system 100 during the testing and development phase, wherein
repeated iterations of testing and development may be performed using the system
 100. Fig II illustrates the operation of the system 100, and in particular the toolkit, to
configure the control programming that will be executed during either the testing and
development phase or the system 100 during normal commercial use.
                                            - 19-

     100821       Starting then with Fig. 9, a process of operation 600 (which, as mentioned
     above, may be reflected in the programming of the system 100) begins at block 602.
    At block 602, the system 100 receives a password, encryption key or the like that
    permits the system to provide a level of access to permit bench trials to occur. In
    certain instances, the system 100 may receive the password, encryption key or the like
    at the point of manufacture of the system 100. In other instances, the system 100 may
    receive the password, encryption key or the like after having been used in normal
    commercial use without the testing and development aspects of the system 100 having
   been used previously. In still other instances, the password, encryption key or the like
   may be used to change the level of access of a system 100 that had previously been
   used in a different level of access (e.g., animal trials).
   100831        In fact, it is important to note, as reflected in the discussion above, that the
   receipt by a particular system 100 (i.e., instance of the system 100) of a password or
   encryption key for animal trials, for example, does not require that the particular
  system to have first received a password or key corresponding to a level of access for
  bench trials. Similarly, a particular instance of the system 100 may receive a
  password permitting access to the functionality for human clinical trials or even
  human use (within a particular geographic location) without having received the
  passwords for bench or animal trials. Thus, it is not required that each instance of the
 system 100 necessarily be used for testing and development at each level of access, or
 that each instance be used for testing and development prior to human use.
 [00841         Further, the process 600 illustrated in Fig. 9 is representative of the
 programming of an instance of a system 100 with the greatest degree of flexibility,
 permitting it to be used in all manner of trials and in normal commercial human use.
 However, it will be recognized that one or more of the blocks of the process 600 may
 be omitted in certain instances of the system 100, while that instance of the system
 100 remains within the scope of this disclosure. For example, certain instances of the
system 100 may include the functionality for bench and animal trials (but not human
clinical trials or use), while other instances of the system 100 may be used for human
trials (but not bench trials and animal trials). However, in each of these examples, the
system 100 is still programmed to change between different levels of access to
functionality based on the password, key, etc. received by the system 100.
                                              - 20 -

      [00851       Continuing on to block 604, the system 100 may now be used for bench
     testing. In regard to the aspects of testing and development represented by block 604
     in process 600, reference is made to the process 700 of Fig. 10. Moreover, initial
     block 702 of the process 700 (programming configuration) is illustrated in greater
     detail in the process 800 of Fig. 11, which begins with the determination of the level
     of access at block 802. Consequently, the discussion continues with block 802 of the
    process 800.
    [0086]        As noted before, the level of access may be associated with certain
    lockouts. That is, the system 100 may include certain levels of functionality that may
    not be available during all phases of the development process. By administering the
    level of access (associated with the key or password), the manufacturer (or its
    development partner responsible for administration of the keys or passwords) can
   provide a system 100 with considerable functionality (in terms of programming
   and/or hardware) while preventing that functionality from being used where
   regulatory approval has not yet been obtained.
   100871        The precise operation of the system 100 at block 802 in determining the
   level of access will vary according to the nature of the key, password, etc. associated
  with the different levels of access. For example, the system 100 may have a series of
  passwords stored in an internal memory, one or more of the passwords associated
  with a particular level of access. The password received by the system 100 may then
  be compared with one of the internally stored passwords to determine whether or not
  access should be permitted, and if so, at what level. Alternatively, a public-private
  encryption key may be used to determine if access should be permitted, and if so, at
 what level.
 [0088]          Once this has been dcternmined, the process 800 continues to block 804,
 where the system 100 determines if certain safeguards need to be implemented
 according to the level of access permitted. If safeguards need to be implemented at a
 particular level of access, then the process 800 continues to block 806. If not, then the
 process 800 continues to block 808.
 100891         As noted above, these safeguards may be in the form of lockouts relative
to the functionality of the system 100 at lower levels of access. As an example of this
type of safeguard, the system 100 may permit only virtual (physiological and sensor)
data models to be used with the control programming during bench trials. As another
                                            -21 -

      limitation, the system 100 may only provide access to certain portions of the toolkit
      (e.g., certain libraries of functions, filters, etc.) according to the level of access
     permitted.
     [0090]         However, the safeguards may also come in the form of warnings or
     functional limitations that are implemented at higher levels of access, because human
     clinical trials or human use is involved. As an example of this type of safeguard, a
     warning message may be displayed prior to initiation of the pump, or certain ranges of
    pump operation, which were permitted during bench trials or animal trials, are
    prohibited by blocking control signals that exceed a predetermined operational range
    for the pump at that level of access.
    [00911         Consequently, the safeguards may represent not only the prevention of
   certain actions or the limitation of certain functionality, but the requirement that
   certain actions be taken. Further, the safeguards may not only limit functionality at
   the lower levels of access, with greater freedoms at the higher levels of access, but the
   system 100 may instead impose greater limitations on functionality on the higher
  levels of access as well.
  [00921          It will be recognized that the determination if safeguards are required and
  the incorporation of the safeguards at blocks 804, 806 is not limited to the particular
  position within the process 800 illustrated in Fig. 11. For example, the safeguards
  may be incorporated at a later stage in the process 800, as a check against the
  programming prepared in response to user selections (see blocks 808-814).
  Alternatively, the determination whether safeguards are to be incorporated and/or
 their incorporation into the programming may operate in parallel as a process in the
 background while the actions of blocks 808-814 operate in the foreground, rather than
 in series with the actions of blocks 808-814. As a further alternative, the actions of
 blocks 804, 806 may occur as each user selection is received by the system 100 at
 blocks 810, 814.
 100931          Once the safeguards, if any, have been incorporated at block 806, the
process 800 continues to blocks 808-814. While a particular arrangement of the
blocks 808-814 has been selected for illustration and discussion, it will be recognized
that the sequential order of actions represented by blocks 808-814 is merely for ease
of exposition, not by way of limitation on the disclosure herein, as was the case with
the determination and incorporation of safeguards as blocks 804, 806. The blocks
                                                - 22  -

       812, 814 may precede blocks 808, 810 in all instances, or blocks 808, 812 may occur
       in parallel (see, e.g., Fig. 4), with order of the blocks 810, 814 occurring in
      accordance with the receipt by the system 100 of inputs from the user.
      100941        At block 808, the system 100 provides the user with one or more
      (typically a plurality) of therapy options. As discussed above, with reference to Fig.
      4, the options may include a plurality of potential therapy control algorithms, and may
      be displayed graphically to the user on an output device. The user may express his or
     her selection of particular items from the therapy options by toggling a check box or
     other input representation using an input device (e.g., a mouse, stylus and pad, etc.),
     The system 100 will receive the user input at block 810, and the process 800 proceeds
     to block 812.
     100951         Similar to blocks 808, 810, the actions of blocks 812, 814 involve
    providing one of more (again, typically a plurality) of sensor options and receiving a
    user input relative to the desired options to be incorporated into the programming of
    the system 100. With reference to Fig. 4, the options may include a plurality of
    sensor parameter options as well as a plurality of sensor data filtering options. The
   user may again express his or her selection of particular items from the therapy
   options by toggling a check box or other input representation using an input device
   (e.g., a mouse, stylus and pad, etc.). The system 100 will receive the user input at
   block 814, and the process 800 proceeds to block 816.
   [0096]          At block 816, the system 100 determines if the user has completed his or
  her selection of the control and sensor options (or additional options, such as display
  options, if provided). The system 100 may determine if the selection process is
  complete by determining if a particular input has been received from the user via an
  input device. For example, the system 100 may display a button within a graphical
  user interface on an associated output device (e.g. monitor), which the user may
 manipulate via an input device (e.g., mouse) so as to send an input to the system 100
 that the user has completed his or her selections. Alternatively, the button may be in
 the form of a physical input (e.g., push button) that is connected to the system 100,
 and which is used to provide an input to the system 100 that the user has completed
 the process. As a still further alternative, the system 100 may determine that the user
has completed the process when the system 100 has received the user's input
representative of the selection of the therapy and/or sensor options.
                                                - 23 -

     100971       If the system 100 determines that the user has not completed the selection
     process at block 816, the process 800 returns to block 808. Alternatively, if the
     system 100 determines that the user has completed his or her selections, the process
     800 proceeds to block 818.
     100981      At block 818, the system 100 reviews the programming assembled
     according to the user inputs received at blocks 812, 814 to determine if the
    programming is to be checked prior to returning to the process 700. If the program is
    to be checked, then the process proceeds to block 820. On the other hand, if the
    program does not need to be check, the process returns to the process 700. For
    example, where the changes represent scaling a particular output display, the program
    may not need to be checked prior to returning to the process 700; alternatively, if a
    completely different control algorithm has been selected, checking may be required.
    J0099]       At block 820, the system 100 may check the programming assembled, for
   example, for any errors that will prevent a processor from operating according to or
   executing the programming during testing. As with the safeguards discussed above,
   the position of the determination as to whether the program is relatively error-free (or
   error-prone) does not necessary have to occur in the exact place in which it is located
   in the flowchart of Fig. 11. As will be recognized, the action of checking the
  program, for errors for example, may occur in parallel with the actions of blocks 808
  814. However, for ease of explanation, blocks 818, 820 have been placed at the end
  of the flowchart of Fig. I I.
  [001001       Returning now to Fig. 10, the process 700 may proceed to block 704,
 wherein the system 100 may configure the remainder of the system 100 after the
 completion of the programming configuration that occurred at block 702. For
 example, the system 100 may upload the programming prepared at block 702 to the
 memory of the processor as part of the configuration of the system 100. In addition,
 the system 100 may activate certain sensor inputs according to the programming
uploaded to the controller, or may search the sensor inputs to determine if the sensor,
etc. is present. The system 100 may also determine whether or not it is necessary to
provide power to the sensor from the power supply associated with the system 100.
Other actions may be taken by the system 100 at this point to prepare for
communication between the elements of the system 100 according to certain
proprietary or standardized protocols.
                                           - 24  -

      1001011     Once the system 100 has been configured at block 704, the testing may
      begin at block 706. If the system 100 determines at block 706 that the testing is on
      going, then the process 700 continues to blocks 708, 710 where the system controls
     the pump associated therewith according to the control options selected and collects
     data from the sensor according to the sensor options selected. If the system 100
     determines that the testing is completed, then the system 100 proceeds to block 712.
     [00102]      At block 712, the system 100 determines if the user only wishes to make a
     change or has only made a change to the sensor. For example, the system 100 may
    determine if only a sensor change has been made, if no new program has been
    uploaded to the controller, by detecting that the sensor has been decoupled and
    recoupled to the system 100. Alternatively, the user may manipulate an input device
    that provides an input indicative of the user's decision to alter only the sensor, and the
   system 100 may detennine that only the sensor is to be changed upon receipt of that
   input. If only a sensor change has been made, then the process 700 may return to the
   configuration block 704, and a new cycle of testing may occur at blocks 706, 708,
   710.
   [00103)       Similarly, at block 714, the system 100 may determine if the user desires
   to make changes or has made changes to the sensor and the programming of the
  system 100, or just the programming. As was the case at block 712, the system 100
  may monitor the programming of the controller and the connection of the system 100
  to the sensor to determine if the programming or if both the programming and the
  sensor have been changed. Alternatively, the user may manipulate an input device
 and the system 100 may detennine, according to the receipt of an input from the input
 device, that the user has modified the programming or the programming and the
 sensor. If so, the process 700 may return to block 702; if not, the process 700 may
 return to the process 600.
 [001041        Reluming then to the process 600, and in particular the block 606, the
 system 100 may determine if further regulatory approval has been received. The
system 100 may determine that regulatory approval has not been received if no new
access has been received. Alternatively, the system 100 may determine that approval
has been received if a new key or password associated with a new level of access
associated with further regulatory approval has been received. The system 100 may
receive the key or password associated with animal trial access at block 608.
                                             - 25 -

      [001051     The process 600 continues to further testing at block 610, with the process
     of the testing at block 610 again being reflected in the process 700 (and, potentially,
     the process 800). Where the system 100 was used previously for the development of
     the control programming and sensor for bench trials (as it was according to this
    embodiment, at blocks 602, 604), the system 100 may pass quickly through certain
    actions included within the process 700. For example, based on the results of the
    bench testing, the user may not wish to reconfigure the control programming or the
    sensor configuration. As such, the system 100 may perform the actions of blocks 702,
    704 of the process 700 relatively quickly, and the process may proceed almost directly
    to block 706.
    [001061       However, as mentioned above, different safeguards may be included as
   different levels of access are achieved. In such a case, even though the user may not
   have any desired changes required to the programming, the system 100 may be
   required to execute parts of process 800 so as to incorporate these safeguards into the
   programming. As a result, this may lead the system 100 to carry out the actions of
   blocks 808-814 because new options may be included or imposed because of the
  safeguards incorporated by the system at block 806, further requiring the system to
  carry out the actions of blocks 8 16-820 as well.
  1001071        Once the testing has been completed at block 610, the system 100 again
  awaits approval at block 612. Upon receipt of the human clinical trial access (at block
 614), the system 100 may determine that the process 600 may proceed to block 616.
  [001081        At block 616, the system 100 may determine if the access received at
 block 614 is appropriate for the geographic location where the system 100 is located.
 That is, certain types of regulatory approval, in particular that involving human
 clinical trials or human use, are usually granted for a limited geographic region
 (which may or may not correspond to the geographic region associated with a single
 national authority). As such, an instance of a system 100 operating with a particular
control programming and sensor in, for example, the United States may not be
approved for human clinical trials even though a system 100 with similar
programming and sensor is approved for use in Europe. Consequently, it may be
necessary for certain types of access to be associated with correct geographic
placement of the system 100 before the system 100 will permit the functionality with
a particular level of access.
                                            - 26 -

     1001091      The determination as to whether the system 100 is disposed in the proper
     geographic location may be performed in a number of different ways. For example,
     the system 100 may simply require receipt of an input from the user in response to a
     prompt for information regarding the geographic location where the testing is to occur
    (and hence where the system 100 will be located). The system 100 may then check
    the input with information regarding the permitted geographic location associated
    with the key or password corresponding to the approval obtained.
    100110]      Such a determination obviously operates on an "honor" system, which
    may be insufficient for certain regulatory authorities. Consequently, the system 100
    may include or may be equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) receiver,
    which may utilize a satellite-based navigation system to provide the positioning
   information regarding the associated system 100 with sufficient accuracy so as to
   permit the system 100 to determine the geographic location of the system 100. The
   system 100 may then check the information obtained from the GPS receiver against
   the permitted geographic location associated with the key or password corresponding
   to the approval obtained. It will be recognized that the use of a GPS receiver is
   simply one of a number of options that may be used to determine the location of the
   system 100 without involving (or relying on) the user input.
   1001111      It will also be recognized that, as explained above, the system 100 may
  include one or more elements that are not located physically in the same geographic
  location. To this end, the geographic location of certain elements of the system 100
  may be more important to the detennination of block 616 than others. For example,
  the tool kit which is part of the system 100 and may be used in carrying out the
  process 800 may be located on a computer 140 that is physically remote relative to the
  pump 114, pump controller 110, sensor 106 and interface 104. Further, the location
  of the pump 114, pump controller I 10, sensor 106 and interface 104 may be of greater
 (or exclusive) relevance to the approval granted than the position of the computer 140
 operating according to the tool kit of the present disclosure. Consequently, the system
 100 may be programmed to detennine the geographic location of parts or elements of
 the system 100 relative to the approval granted, rather than detennining the
geographic location of the entire system 100. To this end, in the embodiment where a
GPS receiver is associated with the system 100 to permit the system 100 to determine
the geographic location of the system 100, the GPS receiver may be associated (by
                                            - 27  -

    attachment or disposal in a common housing) with those elements of the system 100
    that are relevant to the determination as to whether the system 100 is located in a
    proper geographic location.
    [001121       Once the system 100 has completed the inquiry of block 616, the process
    may proceed to block 618, which is similar to blocks 604, 610. After the testing is
   completed, the process 600 continues to block 620, where the system 100 determines
   if approval has been obtained for human use outside of the clinical study setting. If
   such approval is obtained, the process 600 proceeds to block 622, where the system
   100 receives the human Use access.
   [001131       As noted above, the human use access received by the system 100 at
   block 622 will likely be restricted according to a particular geographic location.
   Consequently, the system 100 may carry out a determination, similar to that of block
  616, as to whether the system 100 (or the relevant portion of the system 100) is
  located in the proper geographic location relative to the approval obtained and the
  access granted. To this end, the same types of actions described above relative to
  block 616 may also occur at block 622.
  [001141        As noted above, while the therapy management development platform has
  been discussed relative to infusion therapy management, other forms of therapy
 management development may be facilitated through the use of a similar platform.
 For example, inhalation therapy management and renal therapy management
 development may benefit through the use of a similar therapy management

 1001151        In regard to inhalation therapy management, a system for inhalation
 therapy management may include a vaporizer that is connected to a source of an
 anesthetic agent. The vaporizer vaporizes the anesthetic agent, mixing it with a
 carrier gas, to create a gas which will be inhaled by a patient as part of an inhalation
therapy, such as may be administered to the patient in an intensive care unit, for
example. In particular, the gas may pass through an endotracheal tube disposed
through the patient's mouth; alternatively, the gas may pass through a mask disposed
over the patient's mouth and nose. The tube or mask may be associated with a sensor,
and may also be associated with an adsorbent media. The sensor is coupled to a
vaporizer controller that may vary the amount of gas administered to the patient via
                                             - 28 -

      the tube or mask by the vaporizer in accordance with the signal received from the
      sensor.
      1001161      In operation, the patient would inhale gas provided by the vaporizer
     through the tube or mask. Upon exhale, perhaps 70 to 80 percent of the inhaled gas is
     expelled by the patient. The adsorbent media associated with the tube or mask may
     capture a certain fraction of the anesthetic exhaled.  The next time the patient inhales,
     the anesthetic captured by the media is inhaled by the patient. The inhalation therapy
    management system may determine the amount of anesthetic contained in each exhalc
    or inhale through the use of the sensor associated with the tube or mask. Based on
    this detennination, the vaporizer controller may add further gas from the vaporizer.
    [001171       Such an inhalation therapy management system has certain similarities
    with the infusion therapy management systems described above. In particular, the
    inhalation therapy management system relies on one or more sensors that determine a
   characteristic of the therapy or the patient. For example, the system described above
   includes a sensor to determine anesthetic content/concentration in the inhale or the
   exhale. Potentially, other sensors may be used as well, for example blood oxygen
   sensors, blood pressure sensors, etc. Furthermore, the vaporizer controller uses a
   control algorithm to vary the gas provided to the patient from the vaporizer in
   response to the signals received from these sensors.
   1001181       As a consequence, the use of a therapy management development system
  according to any of the embodiments of Figs. 1-7 may be useful in developing an
  inhalation therapy management system as well. Rather than interacting with the
  pump controller, the therapy management development module would interface with
  the vaporizer controller. While the specifics of the sensors and control algorithms
  used may vary, the general framework and method of use of such an inhalation
 therapy management development system and method would operate along lines
 similar to those described above relative to the infusion therapy management
 development system. Consequently, the different embodiments and variations to
 those embodiments discussed above would apply with equal force to the design and
 use of a development system for inhalation therapy management.
 [001191        As for renal therapy and renal therapy management, similar comments
could be made regarding the operation of the renal therapy management system
relative to the infusion therapy management system described above, as well as
                                              - 29 -

   usefulness of the therapy management development system for use with such renal
  therapy management systems.
   1001201     For example, one conventional renal therapy is hemodialysis. In
  hemodialysis, a blood pump is used to draw blood from the patient, pass the blood
  through a dialyzer, and then return the blood to the patient along a first circuit. In a
  second, separate circuit, a separate pump is used to circulate dialysate through the
 dialyzer. In the dialyzer, waste products pass through a membrane/filter from the
 blood into the dialysate. A controller may be coupled to both pumps and to sensors
 disposed in both circuits. The sensors may monitor flow rates, and the conductivity,
 temperature and pH of the dialysate. The controller may vary the operation of one or
 both of the pumps in accordance with signals received from the sensors.
 [001211      As was the case with inhalation therapy, the inclusion of a controller that
 varies operation of a component (in the case of hemodialysis, the blood pump and the
dialysate pump) in accordance with sensor data is believed to make the above
mentioned development systems and tools described in the context of infusion therapy
useful with renal therapies as well. Moreover, given the similarities between
hemodialysis and aphaeresis, it is also believed that the therapy management
development systems and methods described above may be useful relating to
aphaeresis therapy management as well.
