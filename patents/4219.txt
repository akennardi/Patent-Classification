                   MULTI-FUNCTIONAL FECAL WASTE AND GARBAGE
                        PROCESSOR AND ASSOCIATED METHODS
[0000] This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2015346575, the entire
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The present technology is directed to multi-functional fecal waste and garbage
processing systems, equipment, and associated methods.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Many areas of the world utilize open sanitation systems for handling human waste and
other garbage, while other areas utilize unsatisfactory septic systems or other systems that
discharge raw sewage into open drains or surface waters. Such poor sanitation conditions
contribute to significate health problems in these areas. Many of these areas with inadequate
sanitation systems also struggle with maintaining clean drinking water, which further adds to
potential health issues. These areas often have limited resources available for generating
electricity, or the cost for generating electricity is prohibitively expensive. Accordingly, there
is a need for adequate sanitation systems that keep waste out of the environment, for providing
and maintaining access to clean potable water, and for generating inexpensive electricity.
SUMMARY
[0003] The present technology provides multi-functional systems for processing waste while
generating electricity and potable water in a manner that overcomes drawbacks experienced in
the prior art and provides additional benefits. At least one aspect of the technology provides a
self-contained processing facility configured to convert organic, high water-content waste,
such as fecal sludge and garbage, into electricity while also generating and collecting potable
water.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 [0039]       The present disclosure describes multi-functional waste processing
 systems configured for generating electricity and potable water in accordance with
 certain embodiments of the present technology.         Several specific details of the
 technology are set forth in the following description and in Figures 1-33 to provide a
 thorough understanding of certain embodiments of the present technology. One
 skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present technology may have
 additional embodiments and that other embodiments of the technology may be
 practiced without several of the specific features described below.
 [0040]       Figure 1 is a schematic flow-chart illustration of components a multi
 functional waste processing system 10, and Figure 2 is an isometric view of the
 waste processing system 10 in accordance with an embodiment of the present
 technology. As discussed in greater detail below, the system 10 is configured to
 receive and process a flow of wet waste sludge 12, and to generate dry, solid fuel
 material, electricity, and potable water. One or more embodiments of the system 10
 are discussed and illustrated herein in connection with processing waste comprising
 wet sludge containing water and fecal matter and/or other garbage, such as organic
 waste. The system 10, however, can be configured for processing a flow of other
 wet waste.     In one embodiment, the system is configured to process wet sludge
 containing a mixture of water-based liquids and up to approximately 50% total solids
 that can be separated from the water and dried to provide combustible solid fuel
 material. In some configurations, the system 10 can be used with wet sludge having
 up to approximately 15% total solids, and in other embodiments the system 10 is
 configured for use with sludge having approximately 20% - 50% total solids. The
 system 10 of other embodiments can be configured for use with other ranges of total
 solids within the sludge.
 [0041]       The sludge 12 flows through a sludge dryer assembly 14 that evaporates
 water from the sludge to generate steam, such that the solid materials are
 sufficiently dried to provide combustible solid fuel material.   For purposes of this
                                               -5-

WO 2016/077241                                                        PCT/US2015/059765
 description, the steam evaporated from the sludge is referred to as sludge vapor.
 The liberated sludge vapor is very hot for a sufficient duration, so that the sludge
 vapor is sterile (i.e., free of pathogens). The system 10 contains and condenses the
 sterile sludge vapor in a water treatment system 16 to provide clean potable water.
 The system 10 also burns the dried solid fuel material, in a combustor, such as a
 fluidized bed combustor 18. In some embodiments, other dried fuels, such as coal,
 wood pellets, garbage or other organic material can be added if necessary to
 provide additional fuel to the combustor 18.        The system 10 of the illustrated
 embodiment is configured to continually produce up to approximately 150 kW
 (approximately 200 hp) of electricity and to process approximately 8500 kg or 8.5 m3
 of fecal sludge and 1100 kg of garbage or more per day.
 [0042]       Heat from the fuel combustion in the combustor 18 is used to heat a
 boiler 20, which pressurizes water in a substantially closed primary water circuit 21
 to generate steam for use by a steam-driven power plant 22 that produces
 electricity. The water in the primary water circuit 21 is referred to as primary water,
 which may be primary steam or primary liquid water, depending upon the location
 within the primary water circuit. Primary steam exhausted from the power plant 22
 which includes a steam engine 26 and a generator 25 is used as a heat source by
 the fuel dryer assembly 14 before the primary steam flows through a condenser 24
 and is converted back to primary liquid water and pumped back to the boiler 20. A
 portion of the electricity from the power plant 22 powers electrical components of the
 system 10, and the remaining electricity can be provided to a power grid or
 otherwise used locally, such as to power external electrical items.
 [0043]       The processing system 10 of the illustrated embodiment is a self
 contained system that requires substantially no outside electricity, water or drainage
 to process the wet sludge and generate electricity and potable water.            In one
 embodiment, the illustrated system 10 can be configured to occupy a volume with a
 footprint of approximately 15 m x 3 m, which corresponds to a typical shipping
 container, such that the system 10 may be transportable. Accordingly, the system
 10 is well suited for use in a wide range of geographic locations, such as under
 developed urban locations that may have inadequate sewage systems, and that
 could benefit from additional sources of electricity and clean, fresh potable water.

WO 2016/077241                                                       PCT/US2015/059765
 The components of the system 10 of the illustrated embodiment are discussed in
 greater detail below.
 [0044]       Sludge Holding and Delivery System
 [0045]      The system 10 of the illustrated embodiment shown in Figure 3 includes
 a sludge holding and delivery system 30. The sludge holding and delivery system
 30 has a holding tank 32 that receives substantially raw, wet sludge. The holding
 tank 32 can be sized to hold a selected volume of wet sludge for continual operation
 of the system 10 for several days before the holding tank 32 needs to be
 replenished.     For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the holding tank 32 is
 designed to hold approximately 30 m3 of wet sludge, which provides approximately
 three days of operation, wherein the system 10 can process approximately 9-10 m3
 of sludge per day. The top of the holding tank 32 can be set close to the ground to
 allow sludge delivery vehicles to easily empty the sludge 12 into the tank. The
 bottom of holding the tank 32 can be sloped toward an outlet connected to a sludge
 in-feed assembly 34. In one embodiment, the in-feed assembly 34 can include a
 fully or partially enclosed conveyor 38, such as an auger or belt conveyor, that
 transports the wet sludge from the holding tank 32 to an inlet 40 of the sludge dryer
 assembly 14.
 [0046]       Figure 4 is an isometric view of a sludge in-feed assembly 34 of an
 embodiment, wherein the holding tank 32 includes a drag-chain spreader box having
 an outlet 36 that deposits the wet sludge on the conveyor 38. The conveyor 38
 extends upwardly at a selected angle relative to the ground and connects to the
 sludge dryer assembly 14 adjacent to the inlet 40. In the illustrated embodiment, the
 conveyor 38 is sloped upwardly at an angle of approximately 300 relative to the
 ground, although other angles can be used in other embodiments.
 [0047]       Sludge Dryer Assembly
 [0048]       Figure 5 is an isometric view of a sludge dryer assembly 14 shown
 removed from the assembly of Figure 2. The wet sludge transported from the sludge
 holding and delivery system 30 (Figure 3) is fed into a sludge inlet 40 of the sludge
                                               -7-

WO 2016/077241                                                       PCT/US2015/059765
 dryer assembly 14. As seen in Figure 6, a sludge transition auger 52 connected to
 the end of the conveyor 38 of the sludge in-feed assembly 34 feeds the wet sludge
 into the dryer, assembly's inlet 40 The flow of sludge into the sludge dryer assembly
 14 is substantially continuous. Figure 6 is an enlarged, partial isometric view of an
 end portion of the sludge dryer assembly 14 that includes the inlet 40. In addition to
 receiving the wet sludge, the sludge dryer assembly 14 also receives primary steam
 exhausted from the steam engine 26 of the power plant 22 (Figure 1). The exhaust
 primary steam, which exits the steam engine 26 at approximately 207 kPa
 (approximately 30 psia), flows into one or more tubular shells 42, each of which
 contains a tubular sludge carrier 44. Heat from the exhausted primary steam boils
 the sludge in the sludge carrier 44, thereby evaporating water from the sludge (to
 generate sludge vapor), which dries the sludge to provide the solid fuel material.
 [0049]       The sludge dryer assembly 14 of the illustrated embodiment includes
 two enclosed large diameter pipes that each form a shell 42 that houses a small
 diameter pipe forming a hollow sludge carrier 44. Each sludge carrier 44 contains a
 rotatable, hollow auger 46, and the sludge carrier 44 receives the sludge through the
 inlet 40 such that the sludge at least partially surrounds the hollow auger 46. In the
 illustrated embodiment, each shell 42 includes a steam inlet 48 that receives the
 exhausted primary steam from the steam engine 26 (Figure 1) such that the high
 temperature primary steam flows into the shell's interior area and around the sludge
 carrier 44, thereby heating the sludge in the sludge carrier 44. Accordingly, the
 primary steam is physically isolated from the sludge while still being able to transfer
 heat to the sludge, which boils the sludge and simultaneously cools the primary
 steam. In addition, a portion of the primary steam entering the sludge dryer
 assembly 14 flows into the interior area within the hollow auger 46 so as to also heat
 the sludge through the auger 46. In the illustrated embodiment, each hollow auger
 46 is connected to a drive motor 47 that rotates the auger 46 within the sludge
 carrier 44 and continuously moves the wet sludge axially through the sludge carrier
 44 as the sludge is drying. In one embodiment, each drive motor 47 is a dedicated,
 five-horsepower, inverter-duty, three-phase electrical motor controlled by an
 independent variable frequency drive.       Other embodiments can use other drive
 motors.
                                               -8-

WO 2016/077241                                                          PCT/US2015/059765
 [0050]       The two sludge carriers 44 are interconnected at their ends by transfer
 housings 50 that each have sludge passageways therethrough that allow the sludge
 to flow axially through one sludge carrier 44 in one direction, through the sludge
 passageway in the transfer housing 50, and axially through the other sludge carrier
 44 in the other direction.
 [0051]       Figure 7 is a schematic isometric view of the sludge flow in the sludge
 dryer assembly from the inlet 40. As the sludge cycles through the sludge carriers
 44, the water in the sludge is boiled off.       When the solid fuel material from the
 sludge is sufficiently dry, it exits the sludge dryer assembly 14 through one or more
 dried fuel outlets 54 formed in the side of the sludge carrier 44 and corresponding
 shell 42. The dry fuel outlet 54 is sealed between the sludge carrier 44 and the shell
 42 so as to maintain isolation of the sludge material from the primary steam. In the
 illustrated embodiment, the dry fuel outlets 54 are rectangular openings, although
 the dry fuel outlets can have other shapes (i.e., square, round, elliptical, etc.) and
 sizes.
 [0052]       In operation, the sludge level within the sludge dryer assembly 14
 increases as additional wet sludge is delivered into the sludge carrier 44 by the
 transition auger 52 (Figure 6). The solids within the sludge moving through the
 sludge carrier 44 typically are sufficiently dried by the time they reach the dry fuel
 outlets 54, and the sufficiently dried solid fuel material spills out of the dry fuel outlet
 54 and into a dry fuel hopper 56 (Figure 2), discussed below. To ensure that the
 sludge is moving through the sludge carrier 44 via the rotating hollow augers 46
 remains friable, an adequate amount of dried sludge will recirculate back into the
 beginning of the drying system adjacent to the inlet 40. Some of the sludge may be
 recirculated through the sludge assembly multiple times before moving into the dry
 fuel hopper 56 (Figure 2).
 [0053]       This recirculation of the drying sludge also prevents the sludge from
 reaching a condition referred to as the "sticky" phase, wherein the sludge moisture
 content is about 0.3523 kg H20 per kilogram of dry matter or 25% to 75% dry solid.
 Unlike in the "wet" or "paste" zones where the sludge displays fluid-like properties, in
 the "sticky phase" the contact between the sludge and heated wall of the sludge
 carrier 44 decreases dramatically, which negatively affects the evaporation rate.
                                                -9-

WO 2016/077241                                                       PCT/US2015/059765
 When the sludge is dried past the "sticky" phase to the "granular" phase, the drying
 sludge increasingly maintains homogeneous contact with the heated wall of the
 sludge carrier 44, which allows the evaporation rate to return back to its original
 value. In addition to decreased heat transfer effectiveness, material in the "sticky"
 zone exhibits considerable shear strength, such that the sludge material is more
 likely to adhere to the rotating auger 46 rather than being conveyed by it.
 Recirculation of some dry sludge material helps to ensure that the contents of the
 sludge dryer assembly always remain within or close to the "granular" zone, thereby
 avoiding the "sticky" zone.
 [0054]       In the illustrated embodiment shown in Figure 5, the concentric tubular
 design of the sludge dryer assembly 14 is very durable. The dry fuel outlets 54,
 however, penetrate the sidewalls of the pressurized tubular shell 42, which may
 weaken the tubular structure.       Accordingly, one or more stiffening ribs 64 are
 attached to the shells 42 around the dry fuel outlets 54 to help maintain structural
 integrity and to keep the tubular structures from plastically deforming under the heat
 and pressure of the primary steam within the dryer assembly.
 [0055]       In addition to removing the dried solid fuel material from the sludge
 carriers 44, the sludge vapor liberated from the sludge is removed from the sludge
 dryer assembly 14 through vapor outlet ports 66 in communication with the interior
 area of each sludge carrier 44. The sludge vapor flows from the vapor outlet ports
 66 through conduits to the water treatment system 16 (Figure 1), which is discussed
 in greater detail below. In the illustrated embodiment, at least one vapor outlet port
 66 is provided at each end of the sludge dryer assembly, although the outlet ports
 could be located at other positions.
 [0056]       As heat from the primary steam is transferred to the sludge, the primary
 steam cools, such that the sludge dryer assembly 14 acts as a condenser, wherein
 the primary steam condenses within the shells 42 to primary liquid water.          The
 condensate remains isolated from the sludge and is removed from the shells 42 by a
 condensate siphon tube assembly that extracts the primary liquid water and directs it
 into one or more primary water lines 62 that carry the primary liquid water away from
 the sludge dryer assembly 14 along the primary water circuit 21 (Figure 1). In the
 illustrated embodiment shown in Figure 2, the sludge dryer assembly 14 is mounted
                                              -10-

WO 2016/077241                                                       PCT/US2015/059765
 in the system 10 such that the shells 42 and sludge carriers 44 are tilted relative to
 horizontal, such as approximately a 1-degree tilt, to facilitate extraction of the
 primary water by the siphon tube assembly. The extracted primary liquid water is
 then cycled back along the primary water circuit 21 for use by the boiler 20 and the
 steam engine 26 before returning again as steam to the sludge drying assembly 14.
 [0057]       Figure 8 is a partial isometric view of another embodiment of a sludge
 dryer assembly 70 that includes a plurality of rotating and stationary pressure
 vessels heated by the exhausted primary steam up to approximately 100 psig and
 328 0 F to mix and dry the sludge. The illustrated dryer assembly 70 has a closed,
 sealed trough 72 containing a rotatable auger 74 that moves the sludge axially along
 the trough 72 toward an outlet at one end of the trough 72. The trough 72 receives
 the flow of wet sludge through an inlet at one end such that at least a portion of the
 auger 74 is within the sludge.       The trough 72 is illustrated in Figure 8 without
 showing the lid or ends for purposes of clarity to show the components within the
 trough 72. The lid and ends are sealed to the trough body 76 so as to fully contain
 the sludge and the liberated sludge vapor during the drying process.            In one
 embodiment, a hydraulically operated lid permits full and easy access to all of the
 internal components of the sludge dryer assembly 70, as well as sealing all of the
 vapors, fumes, and gases within the trough 72. Accordingly, the sludge vapor and
 volatiles from the headspace in the trough 72 are captured and re-processed for
 purification (i.e., the water vapor) and/or re-combustion (i.e., the gases and/or
 volatiles).

 shown with the auger 74 removed. The trough 72 contains a plurality of stationary,
 spaced apart curved steam pipes 78 interconnected by elongated manifold pipes 80
 that receive the high temperature exhausted primary steam from the steam engine
 26 (Figure 1) and evenly distribute the primary steam to the curved steam pipes 78.
 Accordingly, as the sludge enters the trough 72 near the inlet and moves along the
 trough 72 via the auger 74, the sludge moves over at least a portion of the curved
 steam pipes 78, thereby boiling and drying sludge. By the time the sludge reaches
 the outlet at the end of the trough body 76 the sludge is sufficiently dried.         In
 addition, the primary steam condenses within the curved steam pipes 78, and the

 condensate is collected in a return manifold pipe 82 connected to the primary water
 circuit 21.
 [0059]        Figure 10 is an enlarged isometric view of the steam-heated, pressurized
 auger 74 shown separated from the trough 72. The auger 74 has a hollow central
 shaft 84 that receives the exhausted primary steam.          The auger 74 also has a
 plurality of curved steam pipes 86 that communicate with the interior of the central
 shaft 84 and extend radially in a spiral manner away from the central shaft 84.
 Accordingly, the curved steam pipes 86 receive primary steam from the central shaft
 84.
 [0060]       The auger 74 is configured to rotate within the trough 72 so that the
 curved steam pipes 86 pass through the spaces between the steam pipes 78 in the
 trough 72. The auger's curved steam pipes 86 can be slightly angled relative to the
 central shaft 84 so as to act as propulsion members that engage and push the
 sludge axially through the trough over the curved steam pipes 78, thereby heating
 and boiling the sludge. The hot primary steam in the central shaft 84 and in the
 curved steam pipes 86 also heats the sludge, which results in the primary steam
 condensing within the auger 74. One end of the auger's central shaft 84 has a
 condensate outlet that directs the condensate out of the auger and along the primary
 water circuit 21 (Figure 8) as primary liquid water. In the illustrated embodiment, the
 rotating auger 74 provides a mixing action that provides a self-leveling effect that
 causes the sludge to move from one end of the trough 72 to the other. The auger
 74 also meters the dried solid fuel material out of the dried fuel outlet. In at least
 one embodiment, one or more dry fuel augers can be connected to the trough 72
 adjacent to the dried fuel outlet to carry the dried solid fuel material to the dried fuel
 hopper 56.
 [0061]        Figures 11 and 12 are isometric views of another embodiment of the
 sludge dryer assembly 70 that has the trough 72 with the trough body 76, the curved
 steam pipes 78, and the axially extending manifold pipes 80 substantially similar to
 the sludge dryer assembly 70 discussed above in connection with Figure 8.
 Accordingly, the trough 72 with the curved steam pipes 78 and manifold pipes 80
 define a stationary pressure vessel heated by the primary steam. In this alternate

 embodiment, an auger 90 is rotatably positioned within the trough 72 and driven by a
 drive motor 92.
 [0062]        The auger 90 has a substantially hollow central shaft 94 connected to a
 plurality of hollow, straight finger pipes 96 that project radially from the central shaft
 94. Each of the finger pipes 96 includes a support web 98 secured to the central
 shaft 94 to provide additional strength and rigidity to the respective finger pipe 96 as
 the auger 90 rotates and the steam-heated finger pipes 96 move through the sludge
 and slowly move the drying sludge axially toward the dry fuel outlet.              In one
 embodiment, the support webs 98 can also be angled relative to the central shaft's
 longitudinal axis, and the support webs 98 may engage a portion of the sludge to
 facilitate mixing and/or to incrementally move the drying sludge along the length of
 the trough 72.
 [0063]         For purposes of an example, the central shaft 94 of the auger 90 is a
 rigid, 24-inch-diameter pipe operatively connected to approximately 140 protruding
 5-inch finger pipes 96 distributed around the pipe along its length. The finger pipes
 96 extend internally into the steam-filled central shaft 94 to ensure proper
 condensate removal upon condensation of the primary steam during operation.
 Each of the finger pipes 96 and associated support web 98 are configured to
 accommodate the force of the drive motor's full torque if that torque was fully applied
 to the end of a single one of the finger pipes 96, while maintaining an actual material
 stress below the material allowable stress for the auger's designed pressure and
 temperature, such as approximately up to 100 psig and 328 0 F. In one embodiment,
 the finger pipes 96 are oriented in a generally helically arranged pattern down the
 length of the central shaft 94 in a configuration so no two finger pipes 96 initially
 engage the sludge material at precisely the same moment, thereby evenly
 distributing the impact loads throughout the auger's full rotation.           In addition,
 neighboring planar finger pipe groupings are rotationally offset by approximately 450
 to facilitate the sludge flow through the trough 72 during the drying process.
 [0064]        As indicated above, the sludge vapor generated within the trough 72 is
 extracted through a vapor outlet. In one embodiment, the vapor outlet is positioned
 adjacent to the trough's end panel that the sludge moves toward during the drying
 process. The sludge vapor removed from the trough 72 flows into a water treatment
                                               -13-

WO 2016/077241                                                       PCT/US2015/059765
 system 16 where the sludge vapor is cleaned and collected, as discussed in greater
 detail below.
 [0065]      In one embodiment wherein the system 10 is used to process very wet
 sludge (e.g., sludge having a solid content of approximately 15% solid materials or
 less). The system 10 dries the wet sludge utilizing a two-stage sludge dryer system
 that includes a high pressure first-stage dryer assembly 200 and a low pressure
 second-stage dryer assembly 220. Figures 13A and 13B are isometric views of a
 high-pressure first-stage dryer assembly 200 in accordance with an embodiment of
 the present technology. The first-stage dryer assembly 200 includes an elongated,
 large diameter outer pipe 202 that contains a plurality of spaced apart, axially
 aligned scraper discs 204 structurally interconnected to each other by one or more
 tie rods 205. For purposes of clarity for this discussion, the outer pipe 202 is shown
 in Figures 13A and 13B as generally transparent to avoid obscuring the internal
 components from view.
 [0066]      Each scraper disc 204 has a plurality of apertures 206 that axially align
 with the apertures 206 in the other scraper discs 204. A plurality of steam tubes 208
 extend substantially along the length of the outer pipe 202 and through the aligned
 apertures 206 in the scraper discs 204. The scraper discs 204 also include bearings
 209 that engage the inside surface of the outer pipe. The ends of the outer pipe 202
 are connected to manifold portions 210 that communicate with the interior of the
 steam tubes 208. One of the manifold portions 210 (i.e., an inlet manifold 210a) has
 a steam inlet port 212 connected to the primary water circuit and configured to
 receive high temperature primary steam exhausted from the steam engine 26
 (Figure 1). The primary steam flows from the inlet manifold 210a into the steam
 tubes 208 within the outer pipe 202.
 [0067]      The outer pipe 202 has a sludge inlet port 211 that directs a flow of very
 wet sludge into the pipe's interior area such that the wet sludge directly engages the
 high temperature steam tubes 208. The structurally interconnected scraper discs
 204 are connected to a reciprocating drive shaft 212 that sealably extends through
 the inlet manifold 210a and connects to an actuator 213, such as a hydraulic
 cylinder. The actuator 213 is operable to push and pull the drive shaft 212, thereby
 moving the scraper discs 204 as a unit axially back and forth within the outer pipe
                                              -14-

WO 2016/077241                                                         PCT/US2015/059765
 202 and through the wet sludge. The high temperature primary steam in the steam
 tubes 208 boils the water in the sludge to generate sludge steam, thereby
 decreasing the water content of the sludge.
 [0068]        An elongate auger assembly 214 sealably extends through the inlet
 manifold 210a and into the interior area of the outer pipe for engagement with the
 sludge. As the sludge thickens due to the water evaporation, the auger assembly
 214 helps move the thickened sludge through the outer pipe 202 to a sludge outlet
 port 215 at the end of the outer pipe 202 opposite the inlet port 211 of the dryer
 assembly 200. The extracted thickened sludge is then passed through a throttle 220
 to decrease the pressure and directed into the second-stage dryer assembly 220
 (Figure 14), discussed in greater detail below.
 [0069]        As the primary steam in the steam tubes 208 heats and boils the wet
 sludge, the primary steam condenses and the resulting primary liquid water flows out
 of the steam tubes 208 into a collection area in the outlet manifold 210b.           The
 primary liquid water flows out of the collection area through a primary water outlet
 port and into a conduit coupled to a radiator 190 (discussed below) that cools the
 liquid water in the primary water circuit 21.       The sludge vapor liberated from the
 sludge is heated and maintained a high temperature during the drying process,
 which results sterilizing the sludge vapor while in the outer pipe 202. As seen in
 Figure 14, the sludge vapor is extracted from the outer pipe 202 through a recovery
 port 216 and into a sludge vapor outlet conduit 218 that carries the sludge vapor to
 the water treatment system 16. The sludge vapor is then filtered via a cyclone, one
 or more pre-filters (-25 micron filter), and one or more fine filters (-1 micron). The
 filtered, sterilized sludge vapor is then directed into the second-stage dryer assembly
 220.
 [0070]        In the illustrated embodiment, the second-stage dryer assembly 220 is
 substantially identical to the sludge dryer assembly of Figures 8-10 or Figures 11-12,
 except that the high temperature steam that passes into the curved steam pipes 78
 in the trough 72 and into the rotating auger 74 or 90 is the filtered, sterilized sludge
 vapor from the first-stage dryer assembly 200 (Figure 13), rather than the high
 temperature primary steam from the steam engine.            In this embodiment, the heat
 from the filtered, sterilized sludge vapor from the first-stage dryer assembly 200 is
                                                -15-

WO 2016/077241                                                          PCT/US2015/059765
 used to dry the fecal sludge in the second-stage dryer assembly 220. Accordingly,
 this two stage sludge dryer system allows twice as much sludge to be processed
 with substantially the same amount of primary water.
 [0071]       After the heated, pressurized sludge vapor flows through the curve pipes
 78 and/or the auger 74/90, and the sludge vapor condenses.                   The resulting
 condensate extracted from the return manifold pipe 82 and from the auger's hollow
 central shaft 84 flows to the water treatment system 16.           In addition, the drying
 process within the second-stage dryer assembly 220 boils water out of the drying
 fecal sludge, and that sludge vapor exits the trough 72 of the dryer assembly 70 and
 flows to the water treatment system 16 (Figure 15).
 [0072]       Water Treatment System
 [0073]       Figure 15 is a schematic flow chart of the water treatment system 16.
 The sludge vapor flows into a steam filtration system 100 that includes a cyclone,
 which separates the steam from other particulates that may be in the sludge vapor.
 The remaining gases and any particulates (e.g., volatiles or VOCs, etc.) can be
 carried back to the combustor 18 and re-combusted, such that the VOCs are
 destroyed without ever being released to atmosphere, which significantly reduces or
 eliminates the release of bad odors into the atmosphere during sludge processing.
 The separated sludge steam is then passed through one or more pre-filters, such as
 a large pore filter (i.e., a 25 micron filter), and then through a fine steam filter (i.e., a
 1 micron filter).   The filtered sludge steam then flows to the condenser 104 that
 condenses the sludge steam and collects the resulting sterile liquid water. While the
 filtered sludge steam and the resulting condensed water may include some
 impurities, the filtered steam and condensed liquid water is pathogen free because
 the sludge vapor was exposed to very high temperature long enough to kill any
 pathogens in the sludge vapor.
 [0074]       The sterile water is then purified by an aeration process, then a
 bleaching process, and then a filtration process through selected purification filter,
 such as one or more charcoal filters. The purified, clean, potable water is then
 captured in a clean water storage tank 108, from which the clean water can be
 dispensed.

 [0075]         Figure 16 is a schematic flow chart of the water treatment system 16 in
 connection with an embodiment using the two-stage dryer assembly.                    In this
 embodiment, the high-pressure sludge vapor from the first-stage dryer assembly 200
 flows through a water treatment system 16 and is filtered, as discussed above, and
 then used in the second dryer stage assembly 220.                 The condensate from that
 sludge vapor in the second dryer stage assembly 220 is collected and passed
 through the water treatment system 16 where it is purified via the aeration,
 bleaching, and filtration processes, as discussed above. The sludge vapor from the
 second-stage dryer assembly 220 entering the water treatment system 16 is also
 filtered (i.e., with the cyclone, pre-filter, and fine filter), condensed, and the resulting
 condensate is purified and collected in the storage tank 108.
 [0076]         Dried Solid Fuel Handling System
 [0077]         Returning now to the dried solid fuel material, as it exits the sludge dryer
 assembly 14/70/200/220 as discussed above, dried solid fuel material enters the dry
 fuel hopper 56. Figure 17 is an isometric view of a dry fuel hopper 56 attached to
 the sludge dryer assembly 14 adjacent to the stiffening ribs 64.            Figure 18 is an
 enlarged, partially transparent isometric view of the dry fuel hopper 56 shown
 removed from the sludge dryer assembly 14. The dry fuel hopper 56 of the
 illustrated embodiment includes a bin that receives the dried solid fuel material
 through an open top side. A heating coil 110 is attached to the side of the bin and
 heats the bin to ensure no condensation of liquid water from any source gets to the
 dried solid fuel material. The heat from the heating coil 110 can also further drive
 the solid fuel material. In one embodiment, the fuel bin heating coil 110 can be a
 steam coil that receives a portion of the sludge vapor generated by the sludge dryer
 assembly 14 (Figure 17), such that the contents of the bin are preheated to above
 approximately 1200C (2400 F).
 [0078]         In the event that water or moisture somehow get into the hopper 56 and
 soaks the dried solid fuel material, or if that the dried fuel solid material is too wet to
 efficiently burn, then the hopper 56 will need to be emptied. Accordingly, the hopper
 56 includes a wet fuel out-feed auger 115 that will direct the wet fuel back to the wet
 sludge holding tank 32 (Figure 1).

 [0079]       As seen in Figures 18 and 19, the hopper 56 of the illustrated
 embodiment includes a dry fuel conveyor 112 coupled to the bottom of the hopper's
 bin.    The conveyor 112 is connected to a fuel in-feed auger assembly 114 that
 carries the dried solid fuel material to the firebox or fluidized bed 116 of the
 combustor 18 (Figure 19), wherein the dried solid fuel material is burned in a
 suspension of sand particles. In the illustrated embodiment, the in-feed auger 114
 feeds the dried solid fuel material into the fluidized bed combustor 18 approximately
 12 cm (4.5 in.) above the fluidized bed 116 and at approximately the same height as
 a flow of combustion air received from a combustion fan, discussed in greater detail
 below. While the illustrated embodiment utilizes a dry fuel feed auger assembly
 114, other fuel delivery systems need be used, including a gravity fed system, or
 other pain systems to provide the solid fuel material into the combustor.
 [0080]       In one embodiment, the waste processing system 10 (Figure 1) can
 include an auxiliary dry fuel hopper 118 (Figure 1) containing auxiliary fuel, such as
 coal, wood pellets, organic garbage, or other suitable dry fuel that can be burned in
 the fluidized bed combustor 18 along with the dried solid fuel material if needed. The
 auxiliary dry fuel hopper 118 also includes an in-feed auger 120 (Figure 19)
 connected to the combustor 18 for delivery of the auxiliary fuel to the fluidized bed
 116 for combustion. The in-feed auger 120 can also be used to add sand, limestone,
 or other selected bed material to the fluidized bed 116 of the combustor 18.
 [0081]       Combustor Assembly
 [0082]       As shown in Figure 19, the fluidized bed combustor 18 is connected to
 the lower portion of the boiler 20 so as to burn the dried solid fuel material and heat
 the boiler 20. The combustor 18 of the illustrated embodiment has a firebox 122
 that houses the fluidized bed 116 and associated heat transfer equipment. Figure
 20 is a partial cut away isometric view of the firebox 122, which is connected to an
 ash discharge bin 126 by a discharge auger 128. Figure 22 is an enlarged isometric
 view of the air distribution grate 130 shown removed from the firebox 122. The
 illustrated air distribution grate 130 is configured to fluidize the bed 116 in a
 homogeneous and stable manner, and it supplies the primary combustion air for the
 burning process within the combustor assembly 18. The illustrated fluidized bed 116
 comprises sand, although limestone or other suitable materials, or mixtures thereof
                                               -18-

WO 2016/077241                                                      PCT/US2015/059765
 may be used. The air distribution grate 130 is configured to operate for long time
 periods without warping, braking, or plugging. The air distribution grate 130 is also
 integrated into the firebox 122 in a manner allowing it to be easily and quickly
 replaced or repaired to minimize any down time of the combustor 18 and the
 associated system 10.
 [0083]       The air distribution grate 130 includes an insulated air distribution pipe
 140 with an air inlet 142 and a plurality of sparger-type air manifold tubes 144
 connected to the air distribution pipe 140 downstream of the air inlet 142.        The
 manifold tubes 144 are parallel and spaced fairly close to each other to allow ash
 and small sand particles to easily fall between the manifold tubes 144 for removal by
 the discharge auger 128 to the discharge bin 126 (Figure 20). The spaced apart
 manifold tubes 144, however, prevent clinkers and large unburned material from
 dropping into the discharge auger inlet. Each manifold tube 144 is connected to a
 plurality of bubble cap air nozzles 146 distributed in a grid format. The bubble cap
 air nozzles 146 provide smooth and even air distribution into the freeboard portion
 above the bed 116 for homogeneous fluidization in the firebox.
 [0084]       In the illustrated embodiment shown in Figure 21, the air distribution
 grate 130 is connected to an in-line burner assembly 138 that can be activated to
 preheat incoming combustion/fluidization air as needed, such as during initial startup
 and warm up of the fluidized bed 116 (Figure 20). The in-line burner assembly 138
 includes a shrouded heater 150 that receives a flow of air from a combustion fan
 148. The heater 150 is connected to the air inlet 142 of the air distribution pipe 140
 (Figure 22) to provide the combustion air to the fluidized bed 116 via the air
 distribution grate 130 (Figure 20).      The combustion fan 148 of the illustrated
 embodiment provides air at an approximate flow rate of up to 750 ft3/min
 compressed to approximately 50 in. H20. The heater 150 can run on natural gas,
 propane, butane, or other suitable fuel to preheat the combustion air when needed.
 Once the combustor 18 has warmed up close to operational temperature, the in-line
 burner assembly 138 is no longer needed, and the combustion fan 148 provides the
 unheated air to the fluidized bed 116 for combustion with the solid fuel material.

 [0086]      The combustor assembly 18 is positioned within the boiler 20, and the
 heat generated upon burning the dried solid fuel material provides a continuous flow
 of heated exhaust gas that flows through the boiler 20 along an exhaust gas path
 158 (Figure 23) and boils a continuous flow of primary liquid water flowing generally
 in the opposite direction through the boiler 20 along a primary water path 160
 (Figure 24) to produce high pressure steam that will power the steam engine 26
 (Figure 1). The boiler 20 and its components will be discussed in connection with
 the exhaust gas path 158 (Figure 23) and then in connection with the primary water
 path 160
 [0087]       Figure 23 is an enlarged, partially cut away, isometric view of the dry fuel
 combustor 18 and the boiler 20 showing the heated exhaust gas path 158 through
 the boiler. A lower portion of the boiler 20 includes an evaporator 162 embedded at
 least partially in and positioned immediately above the fluidized bed 116.
 Accordingly, the high-temperature heat generated from burning the solid fuel
 material in the fluidized bed 116 flows around and efficiently heats the evaporator
 162. The exhaust gas path 158 flows upwardly from the evaporator 162, over a
 primary superheater 164 connected to the evaporator 162, and then over a
 secondary superheater 166 connected to the primary superheater 164. The exhaust
 gas path 158 flows from the secondary superheater 166 over a primary economizer
 168 and then over a secondary economizer 170. The heated exhaust flowing along
 the exhaust gas path 158 cools as it transfers heat sequentially to each of the
 evaporator 162, the primary superheater 164, the secondary superheater 166, the
 primary economizer 168, and the secondary economizer 170. The secondary
 economizer 170 is contained in an economizer housing 172 and connected to an
 exhaust outlet 174.     By the time the exhaust gas reaches and flows over the
 secondary economizer 170, the exhaust gas transfers only low grade heat to the
 secondary economizer 170 before exiting the exhaust outlet 174.
 [0088]       Figure 24 is an enlarged partial isometric view of the economizer
 housing 172 and a multi-clone assembly 176 connected to the exhaust outlet 174.
 The exhaust gas enters the multi-clone assembly 176 and flows through one or
 more conventional cyclones to remove any remaining ash or particulates from the
 exhaust flow, thereby providing clean exhaust gas that exits the multi-clone

 water column to remove any additional contaminates before being released to the
 atmosphere.      The substantially particulate free exhaust gas exits the multi-clone
 assembly 176 and flows through an exhaust stack 178 open to the atmosphere. In
 the illustrated embodiment, an induced draft fan 180 is positioned between the multi
 clone assembly 176 and the exhaust stack 178 and is configured to facilitate flow of
 the exhaust gas along the entire exhaust gas path 158 and out the exhaust stack
 178. In the illustrated embodiment, the fan 180 is capable of pulling approximately 8
 inches of H2 0 vacuum at a flow rate of approximately 775 scfm, although other
 embodiments can use other fans or exhaust draw systems for controlling the flow
 and rate of exhaust gas along the exhaust gas path 158.
 [0089]        Figure 25 is an enlarged partial isometric view of the economizer
 housing 172, which has an ash collection area 182 in the bottom of the housing and
 an ash auger 184 connected to the ash collection area 182. By the time the exhaust
 gas enters the economizer housing 172, the exhaust gas has substantially cooled,
 and any heavier ash particles that may be flowing with the exhaust gas will drop into
 and collect in the ash collection area 182. The ash auger 184 is configured to carry
 the collected ash away from the economizer housing 172 and into a collection bin or
 other collection system (not shown).
 [0090]        Primary Water Circuit Prior to Boiler
 [0091]        Turning now to the primary water path 160, the flow of primary water
 enters the boiler 20 in the liquid phase. As discussed above in connection with the
 sludge dryer assembly 14, the primary water flow from the steam engine 26 is
 condensed in the sludge dryer assembly to the liquid phase.          In the illustrated
 embodiment shown in Figure 1, the flow of primary liquid water from the sludge dryer
 assembly 14 can pass through a radiator 190 to help cool the primary liquid water
 prior to continuing along the primary water circuit 21.
 [0092]        As the primary water (sometimes referred to as "feedwater") moves
 through the primary water circuit 21 in the steam/vapor and liquid phases, some of
 the primary water may be lost. For example, some primary water may be lost by
 steam blowing by in the steam engine 26 wherein steam blows past the piston along
 the cylinder walls in the engine.    In addition, some of the primary water may be
                                               -21-

WO 2016/077241                                                      PCT/US2015/059765
 removed from the system 10 and discarded at the lowest point in the system 10 to
 remove any used chemicals or minerals that may have precipitated out of the
 primary water, which is referred to as blowdown. Depending upon the water quality
 and the system 10, blowdown can constitute up to approximately 5% of the total flow
 of the primary water. Accordingly, makeup water can be added to the primary water
 circuit 21 via a water conditioner 192 located downstream from the radiator 190.
 [0093]       The water conditioner 192 can also add chemicals or additives to the
 primary water while in liquid phase. In some embodiments, the chemicals and/or
 additives are added to the makeup water introduced into the primary water circuit 21.
 For example, the makeup water may be softened via chemical additives prior to
 entering the primary water circuit to reduce scaling of the pipes in the boiler 20.
 Chemical additives may also be used to minimize impurities and corrosion products,
 which can negatively impact heating efficiencies or can potentially shorten the
 operational life of the conduits through which the primary water flows in the primary
 water circuit 21. In addition, the water conditioner 192 can be used to treat incoming
 water, which may be hard public water, prior to the makeup water being added into
 the primary water circuit 21.
 [0094]       The primary water flows from the water conditioner 192 and is collected
 in a feedwater tank 194 before the primary liquid water is introduced into the boiler
 20. The feedwater tank 194 can include a level switch so that after the primary liquid
 water is returned, the system has a way of measuring and adding the appropriate
 quantity of makeup water and chemicals to account for any losses in the primary
 water circuit 21. The primary liquid water is drawn from the feedwater tank 194 by a
 feedwater pump 196 that pumps the primary liquid water into the boiler 20.
 [0095]        Primary Water Path in Boiler
 [0096]        Returning now to the boiler 20, Figure 26 is an enlarged, partially cut
 away, isometric view showing the primary water path 160 through the boiler 20. The
 primary liquid water received from the feedwater pump 196 (Figure 1) is introduced
 as cold pressurized water into the boiler 20 through a water inlet 198 adjacent to the
 secondary economizer 170.          The cold primary water from the pump 196 is
 pressurized to approximately 4130 kPa (600 psia), and it flows through the
 secondary economizer 170, which is heated by the exhaust gas at the coolest
                                              -22-

WO 2016/077241                                                       PCT/US2015/059765
 portion of the exhaust gas path 158 (Figure 23) within the boiler 20. In the illustrated
 embodiment, the secondary economizer 170 heats the primary liquid water to its
 saturation point, which is approximately 525K at 4.135 MPa.
 [0097]       The primary water flows from the secondary economizer 170 through the
 primary economizer 168, wherein the primary water is heated to its boiling point.
 The primary water flows out of the primary economizer 168 as steam and into a
 steam drum 199, wherein the dry, saturated steam is separated from any saturated
 liquid. Any saturated liquid in the steam drum 199 is returned and reintroduced into
 the evaporator 162. The dry primary steam flows out of the steam drum 199 and
 sequentially through the secondary and primary superheaters 166 and 164. The
 primary steam exits the primary superheater 164 as high-temperature, superheated
 steam, which flows out of the boiler 20, along the downstream portion of the primary
 water path 160 to the steam engine 26.
 [0098]       Although the boiler 20 illustrated in Figures 23 and 26 includes two
 superheaters 164/166 and two economizers 168/170, the boiler 20 of other
 embodiments may include only one superheater and/or only one economizer. For
 example, Figure 27 is a partially cut away isometric view of the piping components of
 a boiler assembly 222 of an alternate embodiment that includes only one
 superheater 224 and one economizer 226 coupled to the evaporator 228 and the
 steam drum 199. In this alternate embodiment, the steam drum 199 is connected to
 a plurality of vertical pipes that form waterwalls 232 on opposing sides of the
 evaporator 228, which helps to shield the evaporator, the fluidized bed 116, and the
 firebox 122, to retain heat between the waterwalls, and to help heat the saturated
 water flowing through the waterwalls 232. Accordingly, use of the waterwalls 232
 helps to eliminate or decrease the amount of refractory material needed within the
 boiler.
 [0099]       Figures 28 and 29 are isometric views of a boiler 240 in accordance with
 another embodiment. The boiler 240 has a component layout similar to Figure 27,
 wherein one superheater 224 and one economizer 226 are positioned alongside the
 evaporator 228, which allows for significantly more freeboard within the evaporator
 section above the fluidized bed 116. This embodiment also includes the waterwalls
 232 extending from the steam drum 199. In addition, the boiler 240 has a housing
                                             -23-

WO 2016/077241                                                        PCT/US2015/059765
 241, and the superheater 224, the economizer 226, and the evaporator 228 are
 each mounted on frame structures 242 movably carried on one or more rails or
 sliders 244 connected to the housing 241.
 [00100]      Each frame structure 242 and its respective boiler components (i.e.,
 superheater 224, economizer 226, and/or evaporator 228) is movable as a unit
 relative to the housing 241 in a translatable manner analogous to a drawer motion
 between an open, exposed position (Figure 28) and a closed, operational position
 (Figure 29).    Any or all of the superheater 224, the economizer 226, and/or the
 evaporator 228 can be moved to the open, exposed position in a modular manner,
 such as for maintenance or replacement when the system 10 (Figure 1) is not
 running. Before the boiler components can be moved to the open, exposed position,
 some of the interconnecting piping defining the primary water path 160 may need to
 be disconnected. The superheater 224, the economizer 226, and/or the evaporator
 228 can be slid back into the housing 241 and to the closed operational position,
 and the interconnecting piping reconnected. This modular approach can greatly
 decrease potential down time of the system 10 as well as the cost for conducting
 regular maintenance of the boiler 240.
 [00101]      In another embodiment, the boiler 20 can be a concentric boiler having a
 central combustion chamber and fluidized bed. A generally cylindrical evaporator is
 coaxially arranged with the combustion chamber, and the superheater and the
 economizer are concentrically disposed radially outward of the evaporator. Other
 embodiments can utilize boilers with other configurations and/or components and/or
 component arrangements.
 [00102]      Power Plant
 [00103]      Figure 30 is an isometric view of the power plant assembly 22 with a
 generator 28 driven by the steam engine 26.        In the illustrated embodiment, the
 generator 28 is a 175 kW induction generator with an operational output of up to
 approximately 150kW (200hp). The electricity produced from the generator 28 is
 utilized to power any parasitic loads, including the air blower, all of the pumps, the
 motors that turn the augers, etc. The excess electricity can be made available for
 local use or provided to a selected power grid.
                                             -24-

WO 2016/077241                                                       PCT/US2015/059765
 [00104]       The steam engine 26 driving the generator 28 receives the superheated
 primary steam from the boiler 20 (Figure 1), and the primary steam is expanded in
 the engine to approximately 207 kPa (-30 psia).         The steam engine is a multi
 cylinder reciprocating piston engine with a head assembly 300 configured to use the
 hot steam at a temperature of up to approximately 4800C (9000 F) and to operate for
 long durations at high pressures, such as approximately 4130 KPa (600 psia). In the
 illustrated embodiment, the engine 26 is a six-cylinder engine, although other
 engines, such as a V-8 reciprocating piston engine, may be used.
 [00105]       Figure 31 is a partially cut away enlarged top isometric view of the
 engine's head 301 removed from the block. The illustrated head assembly 300
 includes a head 301 made of steel and that includes a steam inlet port 302 for each
 cylinder. The steam inlet ports are positioned generally on top of the cylinder head.
 The head assembly 300 includes a valve train 304 with poppet valves 306 and
 associated rocker arms 308 for each cylinder. A camshaft 310 has a plurality of
 precisely contoured cams 312 for each of the intake and exhaust poppet valves
 306a and 306b. Rotation of the camshaft 310 and the associated cams 312 controls
 the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves 306a and 306b for the
 specific operating parameters of the steam engine 26.
 [00106]       The reciprocating steam cycle of the steam engine 26 consists of four
 distinct events taking place over two strokes of the engine's piston within its cylinder.
 Starting at Top Dead Center (TDC), the cylinder's intake valve 306a opens and the
 superheated, high-pressure steam (received from the boiler) flows through the
 steam inlet port 302 and into the cylinder while the piston moves downwardly toward
 Bottom Dead Center (BDC). At a specified cut-off volume of steam, the intake valve
 306a closes and the piston completes the power stroke to BDC.              At BDC the
 exhaust valve 306b opens, and the exhaust stroke begins as the piston moves
 upwardly toward TDC.       At a specified time before TDC, the exhaust valve 306b
 closes so the cylinder pressure rises close to the boiler pressure. This minimizes
 the throttling losses when the intake valve 306a opens.
 [00107]       As the steam engine 26 of the illustrated embodiment is operating with
 steam based on a boiler pressure of approximately 4130 kPa (600 psia), the intake
 and exhaust valves 306a and 306b must be carefully controlled via precise cam
                                              -25-

WO 2016/077241                                                        PCT/US2015/059765
 profiles and valve train arrangement to maximize the engine's efficiency and power
 for the given boiler pressure and the engine torque limits.            In the illustrated
 embodiment, at a boiler pressure of approximately 4130 kPa (600 psia), the cut off
 ratio for each cylinder (i.e., the ratio of the cutoff volume to the total volume of the
 cylinder) is approximately 11%. Accordingly, the intake valve 306a must be opened
 just long enough to fill 11% of the cylinder with the high-pressure primary steam.
 The steam engine 26 (Figure 30) is configured to provide a clearance volume of
 approximately 17.7 cc rather than a typical, conventional clearance volume of
 approximately 70 cc for an engine with a compression ratio of approximately 9.8.
 This clearance volume of 17.7 cc provides 280 of crankshaft rotation to achieve the
 desired cut off ratio of 11%. Because the camshaft 310 rotates twice as fast as the
 crank shaft, the camshaft 310 and cams 312 must open and close each intake valve
 306a within 140 of revolution. This quick motion is controlled by the cam profiles and
 the intake valve 306a configuration.
 [00108]       Figures 31 and 32 are enlarged cross-sectional views of the head
 assembly 300 showing an intake cam 312a, the intake valve 306a, and associated
 rocker arm 308a.        Given that the cutoff ratio for the engine of the illustrated
 embodiment is only 11%, the cam profile for each intake cam 312a includes
 extremely small lobes 314 configured to quickly and precisely pivot the respective
 rocker arm 308a to open and close the associated intake valve 306a. This small
 lobe shape must have fairly steep transition areas 316 on the cam profile, which
 creates a substantially concave, small-radius curve that the cam follower 318 must
 follow. In the illustrated embodiment, the cam follower 318 is a rolling cam follower
 rotatably carried by a pair of bearings 320 within the rocker arm 308a above the
 respective intake cam 312a. This arrangement of the rolling cam follower 318 and
 bearings 320 in the rocker arm 308a allows the cam follower 318 to handle the
 inertial loads during operation of the engine 26.
 [00109]      As shown in Figure 33, when the intake valve 306a is closed, its valve
 head 319 sealably sets on top of a valve seat 321 in the head 301, and the steam
 inlet port 302 to delivers the primary steam above the intake valve 306a (i.e., on top
 of the valve head). The valve train 304 is configured with the cam follower 318
 positioned vertically above its respective cam 312, and the cam follower 318 is
                                                -26-

WO 2016/077241                                                       PCT/US2015/059765
 spaced apart from the rocker arm's pivot pin 322. Also, the distal end of the rocker
 arm 308 is positioned under and engages the bottom surface of a collar 324
 threadably attached to the top of the intake valve's shaft 326. When the intake cam
 312a rotates and the cam follower 318 engages the small lobe 314, the rocker arm
 308 pivots upwardly about the pivot pin 322 and pulls the intake valve 306a
 upwardly to lift the valve head 319 away from the valve seat 321, thereby briefly
 opening the intake valve 306a. Accordingly, the intake valve 306a is a pull poppet
 valve. As the cam's lobe 314 passes the cam follower 318, the intake valve 306a is
 quickly closed. Unlike intake valve 306a, the exhaust valve 306b does not require
 such quick, responsive action and can be a push poppet valve.
 [00110]      The illustrated cylinder head configuration is such that the hot, high
 pressure steam is on top of the cylinder head, and the inlet valve 306a needs to be
 on the same side as the high-pressure steam, otherwise the inlet valve 306a would
 open by the steam pressure. As the inlet valve's position is on the top of the head
 below the steam inlet port 402, the high-pressure steam holds the intake valve 306a
 closed. In the illustrated embodiment, the intake valve 306a is connected to a spring
 328 that provides additional forces to help lift and open the intake valve to let steam
 into the cylinder as the piston moves from TDC until the achieving the cutoff volume
 (~11%).
 [00111]      The configuration of the steam engine 26 of the illustrated embodiment
 also provides improved temperature control of the engine during operation,
 particularly at high RPMs (i.e., ~1850) over very long time periods.              Unlike
 conventional steam engines that use double acting cylinders with steam pressure
 applied alternately to either side of the piston and exhausted on either side of the
 piston, the steam engine 26 of the illustrated embodiment has single acting
 cylinders. To avoid steam leaking around the piston particularly at low operating
 temperatures (i.e., during start up), the current engine 26 utilizes liquid coolant built
 into the engine with both a radiator and heater to control the temperature of the
 engine. When the engine 26 is starting and not yet warmed up, the heater keeps
 the engine's cylinders well above water's boiling temperature, so the steam will not
 condense. Because the high-pressure steam is hot, once the engine is running, the
 temperature control system is in a cooling mode.        Accordingly, the temperature
                                              -27-

 control system carefully controls the engine temperature and prevents the engine 26
 from getting too hot, which would damage the oil, and from getting too cold (i.e.,
 below approximately 160 0 F), wherein the oil in the crank case and any water that
 gets past the piston via blow-by would mix and form an emulsion that would be
 impossible to separate.
 [00112]      Controls
 [00113]      The fecal sludge waste processing system 10 of the illustrated
 embodiment also includes a plurality of automated, integrated, computerized
 controls interconnected and configured for control of the entire system 10 with only
 minimal supervision from an operator, during normal operation.               Control and
 monitoring of the equipment and processes are accomplished primarily through a
 central programmable logic controller (PLC) that collects inputs from sensors and
 sets output levels for the control devices, such as the valves and motors. The PLC is
 also configured to control operation of specialty controls for the electric generator
 system and propane burner used during startup. The PLC is also configured to
 divide the overall system into manageable subsystems, such as clean water/steam,
 combustion, fuel handling, and power generation. Control inputs are provided to
 decouple subsystems from each other to the extent desired. The subsystems can
 be further divided into control loops to provide set points for individual outputs.
 [00114]      The clean water/steam subsystem is configured to provide steam at a
 constant temperature and pressure to power plant 22, and to provide heat (in the
 form of steam) to the sludge dryer assembly 14 for generating sufficiently dry solid
 fuel. Control loops are used to regulate the quantity of makeup water entering the
 system, the condensate quantity entering the evaporator, the quantity of steam
 bypassing the steam engine, and the heat applied to the sludge drying assembly.
 The clean water/steam system is also configured to monitor and treat any external
 water entering the system, such as city water, and to control the total dissolved
 solids content of the boiler water through a blowdown system.
 [00115]      The combustion subsystem is configured to provide sufficient heat to
 keep the clean water/steam system producing the correct amount and temperature
                                               -28-

 of steam. Control loops are provided that regulate the air flow through the fluidized
 bed, to operate the propane burner during startup, and to control the air pressure in
 the combustion chamber. This system will also monitor combustion emissions and
 exhaust gas handling and maintenance tasks, such as removal and fluidized bed
 material replacement.
 [00116]      The fuel handling subsystem is configured to provide the correct quantity
 of dried fuel to the combustion process and handle the waste water generated from
 the drying process. Control loops are used to provide the correct quantity of wet
 fuel, to regulate the dwell time of the solid fuel material in the sludge dryer assembly,
 to meter the dried solid fuel material into the combustor, and to handle the water
 condensation and treatment process.
 [00117]      The power generation subsystem is configured to provide power to the
 grid when available. This subsystem has control loops that regulate the electrical
 power output and regulate the engine speed and torque through modulation of the
 engine throttle. The control subsystems and low level loops can be integrated into a
 higher level controller to handle startup and shutdown sequences and to handle
 emergency and alarm situations appropriately.
 [00118]      From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of
 the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various
 modifications may be made without deviating from the invention.               Additionally,
 aspects of the invention described in the context of particular embodiments or
