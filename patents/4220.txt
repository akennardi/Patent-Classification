                                          WITH COMB AND INTEGRATED BLADE
   Background of the Inventions
 5
    1. Technical Field
   [0001]              The present inventions relate to safety razors and, more particularly, relate to
   razors for soft cut shaving and dry shaving.
10
   [0001A]                   The entire content of the complete specification of Australian Patent
   Application No. 2015211201 as originally filed is incorporated herein by reference.
   2. Description of the Related Art
   [0002]              Safety razor blades have had assemblies where a cutting blade is surrounded by
15 flexible portions or guards within a construction assembly used to house the cutting blade
   and are generally flexible for the purposes of temporarily allowing a greater cutting blade
   exposure when force is manually applied and when force is withdrawn the cutting blade
   exhibits less exposure. The cutting blades within these prior safety razor blades are
   typically fastened rigidly in order to disallow the cutting blade to move in relation to the
20 housing cartridge of the safety razor blade. We often see the housing or cartridge of the
   prior safety razors adjusting in order to contour to challenging surfaces while the blade is
   anchored in place for the purpose of remaining rigid. These characteristics prove beneficial
   in creating and allowing for a clean close shave cutting hairs as close as possible.
   Therefore, getting the cleanest and closest shave is often a primary competitive factor
25 between shaving companies. In fact, in today's market we even see multiple rows of
   cutting blades rigidly in place in order to continue this trend. Because of the closeness
   these safety razors offer and because of the level of cutting blade exposure to one's skin we
   find that shaving cream is a necessary promoted lubricant in the shaving method in order to
   prevent cutting or bleeding. These safety razors were typically created for men who seek to
30 shave their face as well as women who seek to shave their legs. Most prior art
   configurations illustrate flexible guards or a safety razor cartridge housing in order to
   safely contour a straight edge razor along the many curves that typically exist on a face of
   a man or legs of a woman while cutting hair as close as possible in order to promote the
   smoothest shave attainable.

                                                2
   [0003]       Examples of safety blade prior art are exhibited herein. One example is
   illustrated in US Patent 3,500,539 by Muros.
 5 [0004]       Another example of a prior art is US Patent 4,409,735 by Cartwright,
   wherein we see a shaving geometry that promotes a flexible cutting blade cartridge
   that offers more controlled flexibility when protruding a skin surface along the
   elongated side.
10 [0005]       Yet another prior art is EP Patent 1,537,964 by Pennella et al., wherein we
   see a wet shaving geometry that incorporates guard elements. The guard elements are
   staggered alongside the sharp edge of the razor while perpendicular and bisecting
   each razor row.
15 [0006]       Yet another prior art is US Patent 5,031,316 by Oldroyd wherein we see
   another illustration wherein a supporting member or guard surrounds the flexible
   cutting blade allowing a level of protection while the sharp edge of the cutting blade
   protrudes the skin surface.
20 [0007]       Yet another prior art is US Patent 2,670,533 by Kearney, wherein we see
   another illustration that similar to the US Patent 3,500,539 by Muros wherein the
   cutting blade protrudes into a skin surface which in turn allows an overexposure of a
   rigid cutting blade.
25 [0008]       Yet another prior art is US Patent 2,725,886 by Gagliano, wherein there is
   illustrated a comb or like structure used for cutting or trimming hair on one's head
   but the prior art does not have a supporting inner guard, pre-determined base, nor a
   void used to assist in creating the shaving geometry illustrated in embodiments of the
   present inventions.
30
   [0009]       Yet another prior art is US Patent 6,094,820 by Adachi, wherein there is
   illustrated a razor comb blade unit intended for cutting or trimming hair on one'.
   However, the cutting blade in this example is slidably held in the blade holder leaving
   no base, void or gap to allow a desired cutting blade flexibility as described in the
35 embodiments of the present inventions.

                                                   3
   [0010]       Yet another prior art is US Patent 8,413,334 by Walker, wherein there is
   illustrated a more recent art form where we are presented again a purposely rigid
   cutting blade that is rigidly anchored into place in order to allow the safety blade
 5 housing or cartridge to alone provide a level of safety through the depth margin of
   slots or grooves between each tooth in the comb guard.
   Summary of the Inventions
10
   [0011]       Thus, it is an object of the present inventions to provide a safety shaving
   razor blade that allows wet and dry shaving capabilities and the like.
   [0012]       It is still another object of the present inventions to minimize accidental
15 cutting, nicking or razor burn from the sharp edge of the cutting blade which can often
   be negative results of shaving without applying shaving cream.
   [0013]       It is another object of the present inventions to provide such a razor blade
   that will eliminate the need to use a hair trimmer prior to shaving with a straight edge
20 razor blade.
   [0014]       It is yet another object of the present inventions to provide such a razor
   blade that will cut hair at or slightly below a skin surface but not to the depth at which
   other safety razors provide. Thus, the shaving geometry eliminates the need of
25 shaving cream in order to protect the skin surface from cutting or nicking.
   [0015]       It is still another object of the present inventions to provide such a razor
   blade that will allow an individual the choice to choose whether to dry shave without
   the application of water and/or shaving cream or to choose to apply shaving cream or
30 shaving lubricant and/or water to one's back side during the shaving process such as
   in the shower.
   [0016]       It is still another object of the present inventions to allow certain
   individuals who may have extremely sensitive skin or even viruses such as MERSA

                                                   4
   the ability to shave certain areas without irritation the infected skin surface which
   when using an overly exposure cutting blade tends to irritate, flare up and spread a
   virus.
 5 [0017]       It is still another object of the present inventions to offer a quick and easy
   shave during situations where a medical emergency may occur. An example of this
   could be using embodiments of the present inventions in the effect that a medical
   team may need to shave an individual chest in order to apply defibrillator in order to
   control heart fibrillation when applying an electric current to the chest wall.
10
   [0018]       It is still another object of the present inventions to eliminate the user of
   batteries and moving parts which are all too often found when using electronic
   devices.
15 [0019]       It is still another object of the present inventions to eliminate the use of a
   device that possess moving parts which tends to break down and cause returns when
   selling through distributors, wholesalers and retailers.
   [0020]       It is still another object of the present inventions to offer a device that
20 maintains a handle of which can accept its replacement shaving blades as well as
   accepts a device used to lubricate one's back with a shaving cream or gel type of
   lubricant prior to shaving.
   [0021]       It is still another object of the present inventions to offer a device that can
25 be folded into a smaller more compact size that would be easily stored in a convenient
   space such as on the wall of one's shower and such. Folding the device would also
   prove efficient when selling in retail stores in that it would save space which is very
   important to retailers.
30 [0022]       It is still another object of the present inventions to offer a shaving device
   that would allow handicapped individuals access easily and effectively shave "hard
   to-reach" areas such as their legs without the effort that is normally required when
   using a traditional straight edge shaver handle and razor blade.

                                                  5
   [0023]      It is still another object of the present inventions to create a razor blade
   that could act as a handle itself or adhere to a handle that could be used for any part of
   the body.
 5 [0024]      It is still another object of the present inventions to create a razor that
   could prove beneficial for prepping during medical surgery or in an emergency matter
   time is crucial and shaving must be performed rapidly.
   [0025]      It is still another object of the present inventions to create a razor that
10 could prove beneficial for use in rehabilitation centers such as prisons or detention
   centers where safety is important.
   [0026]      There is a need for a safety razor blade with outer teeth, outer teeth edge,
   deep void, inner guard, inner guard edge and an integrated cutting blade whereby
15 deep void is intermediate of cutting blade and outer teeth.
   [0027]      The present inventions are illustrated by way of example and are not
   limited by the accompanying figures, in which like references indicate similar
   elements. Elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have
20 not necessarily been drawn to scale.

   Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
10
   [0049]       FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a razor blade shaving
   geometry illustrating a skin surface contour A, an outer comb 140, an outer teeth tip
   150, an outer teeth inside edge 190, an inner guard 130, an inner guard edge 180, a
   base 200, a deep void 160, a cutting blade 110 and a sharp edge 120 of cutting blade
15 110 wherein sharp edge 120 engages alongside skin surface contour A in a first
   position; and alongside inverted skin surface contour C in a second position while the
   opposite side view of this embodiment being identical according to a first
   embodiment of the present inventions. As illustrated in FIG. 1 a safety razor 100 with
   an outer comb 140 and cutting blade 110 and a shaving geometry coinciding with
20 present inventions. A cutting blade 110; a sharp edge 120 at the end of a cutting blade
   110; an inner guard 130; an outer comb 140; an outer teeth tip 150; a deep void 160;
   an inner guard edge 180; an inside edge 190 of outer teeth tips 150; a base 200; an
   elongated side 210; and a cutting blade end 220 whereby in one embodiment
   illustrated in FIG. 1 the members engaging in a first position or in other words making
25 initial contact with skin surface contour A includes the inside edge 190 of the outer
   teeth tip 150, the sharp edge 120, and the inner guard edge 180 wherein a skin
   surface contour A is defined by the inside edge 190 of outer teeth tips 150 and the
   inner guard edge 180 of the inner guard 130. In the first embodiment the sharp edge
   120 of the cutting blade 110 does not protrude the skin planar surface A. As will be
30 seem in each of the first through the fourth embodiments, the sharp edge 120 of the
   cutting blade 110 does not protrude the skin planar surface A. A cutting blade 110
   made of stainless steel extends along a path intermediate of a deep void 160 and inner
   guard 130. It should be known the preferred cutting blade 110 exposure is less than
   about 0.030 inches (about 0.0762 centimeter). A strong opposing force of at least 10

                                                 9
   pounds (4.536 kilograms (10 pounds)) may be applied while protecting and
   minimizing cutting or nicking on a skin surface when the apparatus engages.
   [0050]       A sharp edge 120 opposite of cutting blade end 220 is dependent on
 5 shaving blade geometry in order to produce greater or lesser friction. One
   characteristic in creating a lesser friction between sharp edge 120 of cutting blade 110
   and a skin surface contour A is presented in this invention wherein a sharp edge 120
   of a cutting blade 110 is prohibited from protruding said skin surface contour A. In
   the efforts to promote less friction, the level of distance between the base 200 and the
10 sharp edge 120 of the cutting blade 110 will be substantial. Flexibility of cutting
   blade 110 is dependent upon the distance exhibited between a base 200 and sharp
   edge 120 wherein the greater the margin of distance the more flexibility is exhibited
   which results in less friction between sharp edge 120 and skin surface when opposing
   force is applied. An extremely decreased level of friction by an extremely flexible
15 cutting blade 110 wherein said sharp edge 120 of cutting blade 110 does not protrude
   flat plane of a skin surface contour A and allows for a shave where lubricant is not a
   recommended application. The less the level of distance between base 200 and sharp
   edge 120 the more rigid and less flexible the cutting blade 110. Thus, a more rigid
   cutting blade 110 would be the result of an increased level of friction between sharp
20 edge 120 of a cutting blade 110 and a skin surface.
   [0051]       An inner guard 130 is a supporting member mounted adjacent of said
   cutting blade 110 where, within said shaving geometry, inner guard 130 embodies an
   inner guard edge 180 which with an inside edge 190 of outer teeth tips 150 together
25 create skin surface contour A. Inner guard edge 180 may have teeth wherein teeth
   possess a web covering in order to hide shorn hairs as will later be further disused and
   illustrated in FIG. 17. Overall preferred distance from inner guard edge 180 to outer
   teeth inside edge 190 of outer teeth tips 150 is about 0.068 inches (about 0.1727
   centimeter).
30
   [0052]       An outer comb 140 having elongated side 210 a row of outer teeth tips 150
   and allowing shorn hair to exit the safety razor rearward of outer teeth inside edge 190
   as illustrated in FIG. 19. Outer teeth tips 150, in a preferred embodiment as illustrated
   in FIG. 1-7 are no more than 0.032 inches (0.08128 centimeter) outside of sharp edge

                                                 10
   120 of cutting blade 110. The outer comb 140 is preferably made from injected
   molded plastic or flexible plastic material used in many of the prior art shaving
   assemblies and typically well acceptable by customers seeking shaving products as
   they are durable and productive. The outer comb 140 may also be manufactured of
 5 stainless steel or chrome in order to cater to an audience seeking a higher quality
   product which is common in the wet shaving industry market. An inside portion of
   the outer comb 140 removed in order to create a deep void 160.
   [0053]       A deep void 160 is spaced intermediately of outer teeth tips 150 and
10 cutting blade 110. Deep void 160 in a preferred embodiment having a preferred
   thickness "K" of 0.014 inches (0.03556 centimeter) or less in order to control over
   exposure and over flexibility of said cutting blade 110. The thickness K as described
   can be measured between inner side of comb and inner side of the cutting blade 110.
   The deep void 160 level of thickness limits the level of flexibility of the cutting blade
15 110 and plays an important role in the preferred level of friction displayed between
   the sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade 110 and a the skin surface contours in FIGS. 1
   4. Although said deep void 160 may run thicker than 0.014 inches (0.03556
   centimeter) a dangerous level of friction is presented wherein greater exposure of
   sharp edge 120 of cutting blade 110 is presented. Deep void 160 also maintains a
20 length which is referenced as "L" in FIGS. 1-7. However, the length of L plays a vital
   role in FIGS. 1-4 in that the L represents the distance from base 200 to sharp edge 120
   of cutting blade 110. It is important to remember that in seeking to prevent a
   dangerous level of sharp edge 120 exposure the opening between the sharp edge 120
   of the cutting blade 110 and an inside edge 190 of the outer teeth tips 150 of the outer
25 comb 140 has a dimension less than or equal to a dimension of an opening between
   the sharp edge 120 of the cutting blade 110 and an inner guard edge 180 of the inner
   guard 130. Dimension of said deep void 160 is chosen to control the level of
   flexibility of a cutting blade 110 in order to shave hairs effectively while maintaining
   a level of friction that reduces the risk of cutting or bleeding. When beginning the
30 shaving process an individual embracing the safety razor 100 makes initial contact to
   their skin surface on the skin surface contour A which is referred to as "first position".
   The distance from the inside edge 190 of the outer teeth tips 150 to the inner guard
   edge 180 define the skin surface contour A or the first position. In certain
   embodiments as illustrated by FIG. 1 and FIG. 6 the sharp edge 120 of cutting blade

                                               11
   110 is also engaged in first position along a skin surface contour A. When said sharp
   edge 120 of cutting blade 110 is engaging in a first position said sharp edge 120 will
   not protrude the skin surface contour A. As can be seen and will be further described
   cutting blade 110 in FIG. 3 engages in the second position.
 5
   [0054]      The skin surface contour A is flat when not pressed by the safety razor
   100. When the safety razor 100 is pressed against the skin surface contour A during
   shaving, the skin surface contours B or C result as illustrated in FIG. 1, depending on
   how hard it is pressed. The outer comb 140 and the inner guard 130 press against the
10 skin surface creating two impressions and a convex skin surface contour B or C
   therebetween. This convex surface of the skin raises the skin closer to the sharp edge
   120 for a closer cut of the hair. In some instances the convex skin surface may be
   considered protuberant.
15 [0055]      The skin surface contours B or C have a convex skin surface contour
   between a pair of skin indents respectively created between both the outer comb 140
   and the inner guard 130. When both the inside edge 190 of the outer comb 140 and
   the inner guard edge 180 of the inner guard 130 press into the skin, the recessed sharp
   edge 120 moves relatively closer towards the skin surface contour B or C of the skin
20 when cutting the hair.
   [0056]      The outer comb 140 and the inner guard 130 simultaneously touch the skin
   surface during shaving and can also firmly press respective indents into the skin
   surface during shaving. Thus the convex contour between a pair of skin indents is
25 respectively created between both the outer comb 140 and the inner guard 130
   pressing into the skin surface. Because the present inventions are suitable for dry
   shaving, without a shaving cream or surface lubricant, the inner guard 130 can firmly
   press against the skin surface and there is no concern about shaving cream or skin
   lubricant removal by scraping from the skin surface before the skin surface and hair
30 hit the sharp edge 120 of the cutting blade 110.

   [0058]      The safety razor 100 removes hair from skin using the cutting blade 110
   comprising a sharp edge 120 along an elongated side 210 of a planar surface. An
20 outer comb 140 has a row of outer teeth 140 running along the planar surface on an
   outside of the cutting blade 110, each of the outer teeth of the outer comb 140 is
   substantially perpendicular to the sharp edge 120 and spaced with a deep void 160
   between the row of the outer comb 140 and the planar surface of the cutting blade
   110, wherein ends of the outer comb 140 comprise outer teeth tips 150. An inner
25 guard 130 runs along the planar surface on an inside of the cutting blade 110. The
   sharp edge 120 of cutting blade 110 is recessed up to a skin surface contour A. The
   skin surface contour defined from the inside edges 190 of outer teeth tips 150 to the
   inner guard edge 180. When cutting blade 110 is flexing said cutting blade 110
   longitudinally bends in a curved-like arc while sharp edge 120 of cutting blade 110
30 causing further recess D relative to the skin surface contour A. The cutting blade 110
   is fixedly anchored on the cutting blade end 220 opposite the sharp edge 120.

                                               14
   [0059]      The inner guard 130 may comprise an inner comb comprising a row of
   inner teeth running along the elongated side of an inside of the cutting blade 110, each
   of the inner teeth substantially perpendicular to the sharp edge 120.
 5 [0060]      A user for hair removal moves the safety razor 100 across skin such that
   the outer comb 140 extends over the cutting blade 110 to contact the hair before the
   hair comes in contact with the sharp edge 120. Prior to the shaving operation or
   flexing of the cutting blade 110 the inner guard 130 can have substantially no void
   between the cutting blade 110 and inner guard 130. When the safety razor 100
10 moves across the skin, the hair first passes through the outer comb 140 and then
   second the sharp edge 120 of the cutting blade 110 bends in a direction towards the
   outer comb 140 against a skin surface contour shortening the width of the gap G
   between the sharp edge 120 of the cutting blade 110 and the row of outer teeth of the
   outer comb 140 in FIG. 1-4 and the hair is cut by the sharp edge 120. The base 200 is
15 positioned to create a level of distance between said base 200 and sharp edge 120 of
   cutting blade 110 in order to enable a controlled level of flexibility with said cutting
   blade 110. Outer comb 140 acts as a barrier to physically limit over bending of the
   sharp edge 120 of the cutting blade 110.
20 [0061]      The safety razor 100 is moved across skin such that an outer comb 140
   extends over the cutting blade 110 to contact hair before the hair comes in contact
   with a sharp edge 120. When moving the safety razor 100 across skin, the hair first
   passes through the outer teeth of the outer comb 140 and second then the sharp edge
   120 of the cutting blade 110 bends in a direction to shorten the width of the gap G
25 between the sharp edge 120 of the cutting blade 110 and the row of outer teeth of the
   outer comb 140 and the hair is cut by the sharp edge 120.
   [0062]      A deep void 160 exists between the planar surface of the cutting blade 110
   and the outer comb 140 in the first and second and third and fourth embodiments of
30 respective FIGS. 1-5. The deep void 160 extending from the outer teeth tips 150 to a
   base 200 of the outer comb 140. In order to create a desired "light friction" shave a
   preferred length of the deep void 160 reaching from outer teeth tips 150 to the base
   200 is 0.180 inches (0.4572 centimeter). The closer a base 200 in distance to the
   sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade 110 the more rigid and less flexible the cutting blade

                                                15
   110 becomes and thus the level of friction increases between sharp edge 120 of a
   cutting blade 110 and a skin surface contour. Just the opposite, the further in distance
   a base 200 is to the sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade 110 the less rigid or more
   flexible the cutting blade 110 becomes and thus the level of friction decreases
 5 between a sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade 110 and a skin surface contour. It is
   important to note that aside from the position of said base 200, the degree of thickness
   of the deep void 160 which is represented as K plays a factor in determining the level
   of flexibility by which said cutting blade 110 is granted.
10 [0063]       An opening G between the sharp edge 120 of cutting blade 110 and inside
   edges 190 of the outer teeth tips 150 of the outer comb 140 has a dimension G the
   same or less than a dimension J of an opening J between the sharp edge 120 of cutting
   blade 110 and an inner guard edge 180 of the inner guard 130. A dimension of the
   deep void 160 has a depth extending from the outer teeth tips 150 to a base 200 of the
15 outer comb 140 substantially greater than a dimension G of the gap G. A dimension
   of the gap G is chosen in connection with the preferred distance of a base 200 from
   the sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade 110. It should be noted that the closer the base
   200 is in distance to the sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade 110 the smaller the gap G
   becomes. The further away the base 200 is in distance to the sharp edge 120 of the
20 cutting blade 110, the larger the gap G may become.
   [0064]       A problem with prior safety razors is that while they do offer a level of
   protection when contouring within the shaving process, it is widely known that in
   order to attain such a close shave that they still do require and create a cutting blade
25 flexibility and exposure that is far too rigid to create a controlled atmosphere that
   would allow one to dry shave a hard-to-reach area such as one's back without
   application of shaving cream. More often in order to create a safety razor that
   navigates angles and bumps we see the safety razor 100 housing or "cartridge" being
   altered while the cutting blade 110 remains rigid. The strong friction is often
30 illustrated in today's market between the sharp edge 120 of the cutting blade 110 and
   a skin surface which is why the application of shaving cream or shaving gel prior to
   shaving is recommended in order to minimize the cutting or nicking of the skin
   surface. The prior safety razors do not allow a controlled shaving geometry that
   minimizes cutting blade 110 exposure while offering a level of flexibility take place

                                                16
   without the use of shaving cream or gel in order to greatly minimize cutting or
   bleeding. One common factor amongst the majority of safety razors is that the cutting
   blade, although engaging by guards that may assist in deflection when engaging a skin
   surface, often embody a cutting blade that is capable of protruding a skin surface
 5 contour A that is formed between an inner guard edge 180 and the inside edge 190 of
   the outer teeth tips 150. Another important missing characteristic of the prior art is
   that there does not exist an opening G between the sharp edge 120 of cutting blade
   110 and an inside edge 190 that remains the same level of distance or less than an
   opening represented by J which exists between the sharp edge 120 of cutting blade
10 110 and an inner guard edge 180 of the inner guard 130. A final important notation is
   that a cutting blade 110 that is most commonly found within razors today do not
   embody a preferred level of distance between a sharp edge 120 and a base 200 that
   would allow for a proper amount of cutting blade 110 flexibility which creates an
   extremely light or soft level of friction between sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade 110
15 and a skin surface.
   [0065]       Furthermore, in embodiments of the present inventions there is a deep void
   160 that is specified in FIG. 1 wherein said deep void 160 is embodied between the
   base 200 and outer teeth tips 150 and enables multiple contributing factors one of
20 which would be the thickness of the deep void 160 represented by K which the level
   of thickness controls the level flexibility of cutting blade 110. This ultimately
   controls the level of friction allowed between sharp edge 120 of cutting blade 110 and
   a skin surface contour which in FIG. 1 is represented as A in the first position. These
   are important factors of the present inventions since creating a light traction is
25 necessary when dry shaving and cutting at a lesser depth than a traditional over
   exposed and over rigid safety razor cutting blade 110. In summary, this prior art is
   generally designed to perform or cut hair at an aggressive level while creating a
   housing surrounding a cutting blade 110 or blades that create or allow a level of safety
   during the shaving operation. My invention, however, does not attempt to perform or
30 cut hair at an aggressive level but instead performs or cuts at a less aggressive level.
   Furthermore, my invention takes advantage of the flexibility of a skin surface. The
   human skin is flexible and is able to bend at many contour angles. Being that in my
   invention a skin surface is granted ability to bend in a convex contour between a pair
   of skin indents respectively created between the comb and guard with an aggressively

                                                17
   flexible cutting blade we notice a preferred level of friction throughout the shaving
   operation. Most prior art embodiments we see the guards or housing cartridges
   bending or flexing around the cutting blade wherein my invention I illustrate the
   cutting blade bending and flexing in relation to skin surface contour created by the
 5 fixed housing. The priority in my invention is that it cuts at a less aggressive level
   wherein an individual is not required to apply shaving cream or shaving lubricant to
   their back or back side prior to shaving in order to prevent several razor burn or
   cutting. It is very difficult for an individual to access their own back or back side with
   shaving cream without asking for assistance from another individual or without using
10 a handle that may extend in length to access their back or back side. Thus, is proves
   beneficial to have a safety razor designed to allow an effective shave that does not
   rely on shaving cream or a shaving lubricant to be applied to dry skin prior to the
   shaving operation in order to protect oneself from cutting or bleeding. In addition, the
   cost associated with purchasing shaving cream is saved since shaving cream is not a
15 requirement. Also, it is very scary for an individual to access their back or back side
   with a safety razor that does not cut at a level aggressive level of shaving friction.
   Not being able to accurately view your own back or back side while attempting to use
   a sharp safety razor is very dangerous and scary. The less aggressive level of shaving
   operation in my invention offers a level of protection and light friction that does not
20 require shaving cream or a shaving lubricant to be applied to dry skin prior to the
   shaving operation in order to protect a skin surface from cutting or bleeding from the
   cutting blade. It is widely known that cutting or bleeding is a common side effect
   when shaving one's face with a safety razor design for one's face. Also, an area such
   as one's back or back side offers a surface where the larger area of skin offers more
25 flexibility of a skin surface area which proves beneficial to my invention. The
   majority allows a redundant amount of rigid cutting blade exposure when attempting
   to dry shave without the use of shaving cream which can lead to severe cutting or
   what is commonly referred to as "razor burn" to take place which is described as a
   skin condition featuring a red rash, bumps, or even infected blisters.

   [0066]       FIG. 2 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a razor blade shaving
   geometry wherein a cutting blade 110 engages an opposing force of a convex skin
   surface contour C in a second position according to the first embodiment of the
   present inventions. FIG. 2 illustrates a skin surface contour A or C, a comb, an outer

                                                  18
   teeth tip 150, outer teeth inside edge 190, an inner guard 130, an inner guard edge
   180, a base 200 and a cutting blade 110 wherein the cutting blade 110 engages a
   convex skin surface in a second position; the opposite side view of this embodiment
   being identical according to a second embodiment of the present inventions. As
 5 illustrated in FIG. 2, while a first position is still active, a "second position" is created
   when an individual exercises a shaving stroke wherein an opposing force is applied
   allowing a determined degree of friction between sharp edge 120 of cutting blade 110
   and skin surface whereby the degree of friction is determined by the sharp edge 120
   of a cutting blade 110 being recessed up to a skin surface as well determined by the
10 degree of distance a base 200 is positioned from the sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade
   110. The further the distance a base 200 is positioned away from a sharp edge 120 of
   a cutting blade 110 the more flexibility is allowed by a cutting blade 110 which
   creates a lower level of friction and a softer shave. The closer the distance a base 200
   is positioned from a sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade 110 the cutting blade 110 is
15 more rigid and less flexible which creates a higher level of friction and a stronger
   shave. Although various measurements will create a light friction between the sharp
   edge 120 and a skin surface, the preferred length of the deep void 160 in creating a
   light friction is 0.180 inches (0.4572 centimeter) from the base 200 to the outer teeth
   tips 150. Furthermore, the thickness of the deep void 160 participates in controlling
20 the level of friction between the sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade 110 and a skin
   surface as it limits the flexibility level of a cutting blade 110. Said sharp edge 120 of
   cutting blade 110 may engage in a first and second position but always along with at
   least one outer teeth inside edge 190 and at least one inner guard edge 180 on each
   opposite side of cutting blade 110. An outer teeth inside edge 190 running along the
25 elongated side 210 of an outside of said cutting blade 110 and inner guard edge 180
   running along the elongated side 210 of an inside of said cutting blade 110 As
   illustrated in FIG. 2 a safety razor 100 with comb and integrated blade in accordance
   with FIG. 1 wherein the cutting blade 110 is engaged in a second position with an
   opposing force wherein sharp edge 120 is flexed against a convex skin surface
30 contour C. FIG. 2 illustrates a gentle friction between cutting blade 110 and skin
   surface contour which allows for an effective shave while cutting the hair a beneficial
   level versus the majority of straight edge razors assemblies on the market which aim
   to cut the hair as close as possible or even beneath the skin surface which is the reason
   shaving cream or shaving gel is often sold with straight razors. Skin surface contour

                                                19
   A, in a preferred embodiment, is positioned between 20 to 50 degrees. Due to the fact
   that my invention cuts a hair at a less aggressive length the presence of shaving cream
   or gel prior to shaving is not necessary to minimize cutting or nicking of the skin
   surface. Furthermore, embodiments of the present inventions work better in areas of
 5 the body that have hair follicles less coarse. For example embodiments of the present
   inventions work better one back or arm hair which often possesses hair less coarse or
   thick in comparison to facial hair which is known to be thicker in nature.
   [0067]       FIG. 3 is a schematic cross-sectional view of razor blade shaving geometry
10 illustrating whereby the base 200 is positioned closer in distance to the sharp edge 120
   in comparison to the first embodiment in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. When creating a less
   flexible cutting blade 110 in comparison to the first embodiment, it is necessary, in
   the spirit of maintaining a lighter friction between skin surface contour A and sharp
   edge 120, for said cutting blade 110 to be positioned inside of a skin surface contour
15 A creating less cutting blade 110 blade exposure which in turn creates a lighter
   friction. As illustrated in FIG. 3 is a safety razor 100 with comb and integrated blade
   in accordance with FIG. 1 wherein the cutting blade 110 is positioned at convex skin
   surface contour B in a second position inside a skin surface contour A. The cutting
   blade 110 is fixedly anchored at a cutting blade end 220. This FIG. 3 demonstrates
20 how when a cutting blade 110 maintains a base 200 closer in margin distance to the
   sharp edge 120 it is necessary to decrease the exposure of a cutting blade 110 is
   relation to the skin surface in order to maintain a less aggressive shaving friction.
   [0068]       FIG. 4 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a razor blade shaving
25 geometry whereby the base 200 is positioned in a closer distance in comparison to
   FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 and said cutting blade 110 is engages in the second position an
   opposing force at a convex skin surface contour C according to the second
   embodiment of the present inventions. The inverted skin surface contour C is a
   sharper arc shaped bend than the inverted skin surface contour B or the flat plane of
30 the skin surface contour A. As illustrated in FIG. 4 is a safety razor 100 in
   accordance with FIG. 3 wherein the cutting blade 110 is engaged in a third position
   with an opposing force and sharp edge 120 is flexed against a convex skin surface
   contour C. The cutting blade 110 is fixedly anchored at a cutting blade end 230.
   When said cutting blade 110 is engaged in a third position with an opposing force the

                                                20
   void margin indicated by K is minimized between the cutting blade 110 and the outer
   comb 140. FIG. 4 clearly illustrates since the distance margin between the base 200
   and the sharp edge 120 is increased when compared to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 the exposure
   of the cutting blade 110 is decreased. This adjustment allows a light friction to be
 5 maintained in order to create an effective shave that ultimately does not require
   shaving cream or lubricant in order to prevent severe cutting or nicking of a skin
   surface.
   [0069]       FIG. 5 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a razor blade shaving
10 geometry whereby the cutting blade 110 is fastened in a fixed position inside of the
   skin surface contour A according to a third embodiment of the present inventions. A
   fixedly anchored cutting blade 110 of a rigid material is substantially recessed inside
   the skin surface contour A of FIG 5. As illustrated in FIG. 5 is a safety razor 100
   wherein a cutting blade 110 is made from a non-flexible razor or perhaps ceramic.
15 The cutting blade 110 is fixedly anchored between cutting blade end 240 and a base
   200 wherein the sharp edge 120 remaining inside of a skin surface contour A at the
   same position in both the first position A and second position B for the purpose of
   allowing cutting accessibility while protecting the skin surface due to non-flexing
   attributes of cutting blade 110. Being that the cutting blade 110 in this example is
20 made from a non-flexible razor such as ceramic the position of the base 200 to the
   sharp edge 120 of the cutting blade 110 is not relevant in this example.
   [0070]       FIG. 6 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a razor blade shaving
   geometry whereby said sharp edge 120 of a cutting blade 110 is at the skin surface
25 contour A in a first position and a flexible spring 170 is embodied in order to prepare
   for the cutting blade 110 to engage an opposing force of a skin surface contour in a
   second position according to a fourth embodiment of the present inventions. As
   illustrated in FIG. 6 is a safety razor 100 wherein a cutting blade 110 is in an engaging
   first position alongside a skin surface contour A and not protruding the skin surface
30 contour A. Illustrated in FIG. 6 is a flexible spring 170 which is implemented in
   order to cutting blade 110 flexibility in a different manner when compared to FIG. 2
   and FIG. 4. The cutting blade 110 is fixedly anchored at a flexible spring 170. The
   flexible spring 170, of the fourth embodiment of FIG 6, is operatively coupled to the
   cutting blade 110 on a cutting blade end 250 of the planar surface opposite the sharp

                                                21
   edge 120, causes further recess relative to the skin surface contour A. Being that the
   cutting blade 110 in this example is allowed flexibility in a different manner when
   compared to FIG. 2 and FIG. 4 the position of the base 200 is not relevant in terms of
   determining a level of friction between sharp edge 120 of the cutting blade 110 and a
 5 skin surface.
   [0071]       FIG. 7 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a razor blade shaving
   geometry whereby said cutting blade 110 is flexed and engaged in a second position C
   inside of the skin surface contour A by a spring according to the fourth embodiment
10 of the present inventions. As illustrated in FIG. 7 and in accordance with FIG. 6 the
   cutting blade 110 is flexing due to a flexible spring 170 allowing the cutting blade 110
   to retract horizontally and away from skin surface contour A. The flexible spring 170,
   of the fourth embodiment of FIG 7, is operatively coupled to the cutting blade 110 on
   a cutting blade end 250 of the planar surface opposite the sharp edge 120, causes
15 further recess relative to the skin surface contour A. The cutting blade 110 is fixedly
   anchored at a flexible spring 170. Due to the manner in which the cutting blade 110 is
   flexing in FIG. 7 the need for a deep void 160 is irrelevant as the cutting blade 110 is
   not flexing or bending towards the outer comb 140. It can be seen in FIG. 7 that the
   margin indicated by L is greatly reduced when engaging in a second position with an
20 opposing force. Being that the cutting blade 110 in this example is allowed flexibility
   in a different manner when compared to FIG. 2 and FIG. 4 the position of the base
   200 is not relevant in terms of determining a level of friction between sharp edge 120
   of the cutting blade 110 and a skin surface contour. Furthermore, as illustrated in
   FIG. 1 - 6 a margin or gap represented by G in FIG. 7 is the equal to or less than the
25 margin represented by J.

   [0074]       FIG. 10 is an eye-level view of the apparatus of the present inventions
   illustrating the comb, cutting blade and inner guard with like reference numerals
   according to any of the first through fourth embodiments of FIG 1 - 7.
 5 [0075]       FIG. 11 is an elevated angled view of the present inventions whereby the
   inner guard 130 is end up and apparatus is up-side down with like reference numerals
   according to any of the first through fourth embodiments of FIG. 1 - 7. As illustrated
   in FIG. l Ithe safety razor 100 is in an upside-down position wherein the inner guard
   130 is upright.
10
   [0076]       FIG. 12 is an elevated angled up-side down view of the present inventions
   that illustrates a plurality of safety razors 100 assembled together as one apparatus
   with like reference numerals according to any of the first through seventh
   embodiments. As illustrated in FIG. 12 are redundant safety razors 100 creating a
15 dual-blade structure.
   [0077]       FIG. 13 is a side view the elongated handle 260 by which the safety razor
   100 attaches on the upper end 290 to in order to reach and shave areas of the body.
   As illustrated in FIG. 13 a safety razor 100 may attach to an elongated handle 260
20 which has an upper end 290 as well as a lower end 300 and a receiving end 320.
   Using the elongated handle 260 with attached safety razor 100 allows for access to
   desired shaving areas that may be hard-to-reach or prove difficult access.
   [0078]       FIG. 14 is a side close up view of the upper end 290 of the handle whereby
25 the safety razor 100 attaches. As seen from FIG. 14 upper end 290 or a portion
   thereof of receiving end 320 may be made from a material such as rubber or another
   flexible material that would allow the cutting blade 110 to pivot which would prove
   beneficial during the shaving process. A handle at the upper end 290 comprises a
   flexible coupling 350 coupled to the safety razor 100. Furthermore, a flexible
30 coupling 350 proves beneficial when a user to have flexibility in their shaving stroke
   in order to navigate bumps or contour angles that can otherwise prove difficult.
   [0079]       FIG. 15 is an elevated angled view illustrated a palm-fitted handle 270
   shaped to confirm to the shape of an individuals' hand or palm. As illustrated in FIG.

                                               23
   15 is a palm-fitted handle 270 used to accommodate desired shaving areas that would
   benefit from the safety razor 100 but would not necessarily require an elongated
   handle 260 in order to access the desired shaving area. One example of this
   embodiment would be for individuals who wish to shave hair on their arms or legs in
 5 order to better display their tattoos. Because a safety razor 100 that is wider would
   prove more beneficial to shaving quickly a palm-fitted handle 270 would be much
   more accommodating versus a traditional shaving handle found in most markets.
   [0080]      FIG. 16 is an elevated angled view of the present inventions whereby the
10 safety razor 100 is attached to handle 280 most commonly used in with traditional
   shaving razor blades that are used to shave one's face. As illustrated in FIG. 16 is a
   safety razor 100 is attached to a traditional shaving handle 280 to allow access to
   areas whereby such handle 280 may prove useful such as one's neckline. The present
   invention illustrated in FIG. 1 creates such a soft friction between sharp edge 120 of
15 cutting blade 110 and a skin surface which would not be the most desirable for
   accomplishing a clean close shave on one's face. FIG. 1 is most beneficial for areas
   of the body wherein hair may exist to be less dense in population as it strives to
   reduce the level at which hair is cut while still disallowing stubble. However, the
   closer the base 200 is positioned to the sharp edge 120 the more rigid the cutting blade
20 110 becomes and the easier the shaving operation becomes when attempting to shave
   areas consisting of more dense population of hair such as one's face.
   [0081]      FIG. 17 is and front elevated view of the razor blade illustrating the web
   covering 340 existing between each tooth in order to conceal shorn hair from view.
25 The illustration of FIG. 17 can apply to any of the first through fourth embodiments of
   FIGS 1 - 7. As previously mentioned and illustrated in FIG. 17 the inner guard 130 in
   a separate embodiment may embody a comb or teeth near the side wherein the inner
   guard edge 180 is positioned. That being said, the web covering 340 embodied in
   between each tooth can be implemented between the teeth embodied within the
30 elongated side H of the inner guard 130 as well as the elongated side of the outer
   comb 140. The web covering 340 acts much like an umbrella overhang covering
   between each tooth in order to conceal any shorn hairs from the public viewing. Being
   that the current invention embodies a deep void 160 there poses a risk of shorn hairs
   getting clogged over time. Though most shorn hairs will past through the safety razor

                                                24
   100 there is a small percentage that may still get stuck or clogged within the deep void
   160. Too often users of safety razors dispose far too quickly disposable razors that
   are esthetically unappealing due to a build-up of shorn hairs. The web covering 340
   acts to conceal any unappealing shorn hairs that cannot get brushed out or unclogged.
 5
   [0082]      FIG. 18 is a view of an individual utilizing the safety razor 100 by method
   of an elongated handle 260. As illustrated in FIG. 18 is an individual gripping the
   lower end 300 of the elongated handle 260 and utilizing the elongated handle 260
   attached to a safety razor 100 and shaving the back side which often proves difficult
10 in gaining appropriate access. Although the illustration of FIG. 18 illustrates the first
   embodiment of FIGS 1-2, FIG 18 can apply to any of the first through fourth
   embodiments of FIGS 1-7.
   [0083]      FIG. 19 is a close up view of the safety razor 100 cutting hair along the
15 back side of an individual. As illustrated in FIG. 19 is a close-up view of the safety
   razor 100 illustration of FIG. 18. Illustrated is the safety razor 100 shaving hair and
   cutting blade 110 flexing in a second position C according to the cutting action
   illustrated by FIG. 2 for the first embodiment. Furthermore, shorn hairs may pass
   through the outer teeth tips 150 and exit the safety razor 100 versus getting clogged or
20 caught in the deep void 160. Though some hairs may get clogged or caught the web
   covering 340 covers visible exposure.
   [0084]      As previously indicated, FIG. 19 is a close-up view of the safety razor 100
   as seen in FIG. 18 and illustrates the first embodiment illustrated in FIGS 1-2. The
25 skin surface contour has a convex skin surface contour between a pair of skin indents
   respectively created between both the outer comb 140 and the inner guard 130. When
   both the inside edge 190 of the outer comb 140 and the inner guard edge 180 of the
   inner guard 130 press into the skin, the recessed sharp edge 120 moves relatively
   closer towards the skin surface contour of the skin when cutting the hair.
30
   [0085]      The cutting blade 110 is at an angle nearly parallel to both the outer comb
   140 and the inner guard 130 in embodiments. The cutting blade 110 of embodiments
   longitudinally bends in a direction of uncut hairs when the safety razor 100 is moved
   across the skin surface.   This bend is in a direction less perpendicular to the skin

                                                25
   surface. In embodiments of the present inventions, the cutting blade 110 in the safety
   razor 100 performs less rigidly against the skin surface and hair than in most prior
   razors. The deeper the void, the more the blade is cantilevered and the less rigid is its
   flexibility. Alternately, with a springier cutting blade 110 material or an inner spring,
 5 the blade has more flexibility. Such contributes to enhanced performance on dry
   conditions knowing that the closest save is not a highest priority on certain skin such
   as self-shaving the skin surface of ones back with a long handle 280 and no mirror.
   [0086]       A user of the safety razor 100 of embodiments can adjust how far the sharp
10 edge 120 digs into the user's skin by varying the pressure of the safety razor 100
   thereby adjusting how far the cutting blade 110 longitudinally bends. This may in
   some embodiments adjust the relative blade recess depth from the skin. These
   embodiments can be one mechanism for a user who feels adverse cutting feedback to
   adjust the blade recess by altering the pressure during the movement stroke. In other
15 embodiments the cutting blade may be configured so altering speed or intensity of the
   movement stroke adjusts the blade recess.
   [0087]       FIG. 20 illustrates a side view of a safety razor 100 with an elongated
   handle 260 which embodies an upper end 290 and a lower end 300.           As illustrated in
20 FIG. 20 an elongated handle 260 can accept a shaving soap sponge 330 at a receiving
   end 320 near an upper end 290 opposite a lower end 300 and can easily be attached
   and removed in the same way the safety razor 100 can be easily attached and removed
   if an individual should decide to use the safety razor 100 in the shower which is
   commonly referred to as "wet shaving".
25
   [0088]       The term "flexible", as described previously in the first and second
   embodiment, is intended to describe the amount of bending or curved margin D the
   cutting blade 110 is granted in response to normal human opposing shaving forces.
   The "flexibility" of the cutting blade 110 in the first embodiment of FIG. 1 and 2 is
30 greater than the flexibility exhibited in the second embodiment or FIG. 3 and 4.       The
   term "flexible" takes on a different interpretation in the fourth embodiment wherein
   the flexible spring 170 is "flexed" allowing the cutting blade 110 to retract or flex
   horizontally and away from skin surface contour A.

                                                  26
   [0089]       A low friction between sharp edge 120 and a skin surface is illustrated in
   the first through the fourth embodiments illustrated in FIGS 1 - 7 of the present
   inventions wherein a cutting blade 110 capable of less coarse hair found on an
   individual's back or arms at a depth allowing a smooth surface and all while
 5 minimizing cutting, razor burn as well as minimizing pulling or tugging hair while
   absent of an application of shaving cream or a shaving gel. Though a stronger friction
   may be allowed through the methods previously described, the preferred light or low
   friction is best practice when shaving one's back, buttock, arms or other areas that
   contain less dense areas of hair or areas that may be very sensitive to close shaving.
10
   [0090]       It is important to note in embodiments of the present inventions preferred
   cutting axis is a cutting axis between 20 - 50 degrees. An axis outside of 20 - 50
   degrees, though may be accomplished, proves difficult when accessing petite skin
   surface areas whereby the risk of cutting or razor burn is greatly increased.
15
   [0091]       In further contrast to prior art the current invention does not require the
   razor blades to be exposed to water or shaving cream in order to offer a clean and
   close shave or to protect from cutting, nicking or skin irritation. This is a very
   important factor of the present inventions since application of shaving cream or
20 lubricant can be extremely time consuming especially when applying to one's back
   side. Thus, not requiring the shaving cream lubricant is very time efficient.
   Furthermore, because the cutting blade 110 may be made from stainless steel the
   invention allows the safety razor 100 to last longer without any rusting since water
   and shaving cream, which will cause erosion or rust, is not necessary.
25
   [0092]       The preferred distance of separation between the inner guard edge 180 and
   the sharp edge 120 is a preferable margin of about 0.030 inches (about 0.0762
   centimeter). The preferred distance of separation between the sharp edge 120 and the
   outer comb 140 inside edge 190 is about 0.032 inches (about 0.08128 centimeter).
30 The preferred thickness of inner guard 130 is about 0.024 inches (about 0.06096
   centimeter) or less. The preferred thickness of outer teeth tips 150 is about 0.026
   inches (about 0.06604 centimeter) or less. The preferred cutting blade 110 exposure
   is about 0.030 inches (about 0.0762 centimeter) or less. Although the shaving
   geometry can be accomplished outside of these measurements these are preferred.

                                                27
   [0093]       Although the invention is described herein with reference to specific
   embodiments, various modifications and changes can be made without departing from
   the scope of the present inventions as set forth in the claims below. Accordingly, the
 5 specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive
