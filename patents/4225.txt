METHOD AND SYSTEM TO DISPLAY A VIDEO IN AN EMAIL
Title of the Invention
[0001]     Method and System to display a video in an email
Cross-Reference to Related Applications
[0002]     The present patent application is a divisional application of Australian Patent
Application No. 2015268756, filed 16 December 2015, hereby incorporated by reference in its
entirety as if fully set forth herein. The present patent application claims the benefits of priority
of commonly assigned Canadian Patent Application No. 2,613,821, entitled "Method to Display
a Video in an Email" and filed at the Canadian Intellectual Property Office on December 7,
2007.
Field of the Invention
[0003]     The present invention generally relates to the display of a video in an email that is
opened or viewed on a computerized device, more particularly to the display of a video in an
email that does not need any video player to be installed or executed on the computerized device
to be viewed.
Background of the Invention
[0004]     Email marketing is the most cost-effective way for marketers to establish interactive
relationships with their customers and prospects.
[0005]     Video ads are significantly more effective at engaging viewers because they can
capture attention of more of the viewer's senses by communicating the three V's: Visual, Vocal,
and Verbal. Communication research has proven that a mere 7% of a message is perceived
through words, 38% is through the tone of the presenter, and 55% is through seeing the
presenter's body language. Video communicates the other 93% of an advertising message that
the viewer receives beyond a simple graphic with text.

                                                 2
[0006]     The challenge for today's email marketer is to stand out in the receiver's crowded
inbox with a compelling and entertaining message. The first issue is getting the message into the
inbox through the corporate firewall and spam filter. The second is creating content that will
compel viewers to engage with the ad and 'click-through' to your web site to interact with your
message. Indeed, marketers have only 3 seconds to grab the viewer's attention. The third is to
provide the irresistible offer that the viewer can easily register to accept. And, finally the
campaign must have the tracking metrics in place to measure effectiveness.
[0007]     There is thus a need to provide an email that attracts more traffic to a particular web
site and to augment the number of subscriptions, sales or registration for a product or an event.
Furthermore, the email should display quickly to grab the user's attention.
Summary
[0008]     It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome, or at least
ameliorate, one or more disadvantages of existing arrangements.
[0009]     According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an email in
which a video is displayed without the need to execute or install a player.
[0010]     According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided display of a
video in an email that plays instantly when the email is opened or viewed.
[0011]     The present disclosure also provides an email in which a first video is displayed when
the email is opened or viewed on a computerized device. If the user clicks on the email page, a
web page is opened, referred to as the landing page in the present document. The landing page
displays a second video and other information related to the topic of the email and/or the first or
second video. Finally, another web page may be opened or accessed, referred to as the launch
page. The launch page may contain, for example, details for special events, event registration,
event notification, turnkey e-commerce site, product launch page, special services, special
promotions, master corporate website home page, artist page, movie page.
[0012]     The first video, displayed in the email page, does not need any player to be viewed on
the computerized device. There is no delay to begin the display of the first video. Further, the
email will not be blocked or targeted as a virus or spam by most firewall and anti-virus. The

                                                      3
email page is custom programmed and integrated into an HTML (Hyper Text Markup
Language) file, which can be inserted into most popular email delivery programs.
[0013]      A first step to create a first video file by defining the frame elements to be included in
it. The frame elements may be images or frames coming from videos. The images may be, for
example, JPEG images, PNG images, PSD images (Photoshop) or Al files (Adobe Illustrator
files). The video frames may come from various digital video inputs (AVI, MPEG, MPEG2,
MPEG 4, MOV, RAM, VOB, WMV, MOVPortable Media) or come from an analog form from
digital video tapes (beta, VHS, mini DV) converted to a digital format. The first video may also
be an animation. The frames can have any dimensions and are not limited to a rectangular shape.
The first video file may also comprise audio components that may be, for example, WAV files,
MP3 files or any other suitable format.
[0014]      The chosen frames are ordered in a particular sequence and the first video file is
created using an off the shelf software package. A new video file format has been created for
this purpose, the CVITM format. It is possible to display the first video file for a particular
number of times in the email page. In this case, the html code of the email is implemented to
create loops according to the desired number of times chosen previously. The loops are
programmed by a consumer third party off the shelf software.
[0015]      The first video file having a CVITM format is then posted on a server which is
programmed to recognize the CVITM format.
[0016]      To display the first video file in an email, a hot link is embedded in the html code of
the email. The hot link calls the first video file, which is stored on the server, and sequently
displays the video frames in the email. The hot link is a mechanism where two applications are
linked together so that changes to one will affect the other. Thus, the hot link provides a link
between the email and the first video file located on the server to sequently display the frames of
the first video on a computerized device. The email page preferably integrates the first video and
graphic content artwork and text into a complete design layout.
[0017]      A frame editing system may be provided for the selection and the ordering of the
frames of the first video file by different parties. The frames can be added, deleted, and re
ordered to create the first video file without the need to have an editing system. Reviews are

                                                 4
made in sync using the frame by frame feature of the custom ClemstarTM Video Player. The
reviewing step can occur simultaneously in an unlimited number of geographical locations via
the internet, enhancing significantly the review time.
[0018]     The Clemstar TM player has been developed using action script in the Macromedia T M
software development environment. The player can be custom branded for a company for the
web video delivery solution in the landing page (special custom programming required). The
length of the second video displayed in the landing page can be as large as the server can store.
[0019]     All the files are custom programmed and integrated into an HTML (Hyper Text
Markup Language) file. The completed video landing page HTML file is posted on a server.
[0020]     The landing page may be automatically opened when the display of the first video file
is finished, or after a predetermined time period. The landing page comprises a second video file
and may comprise graphic components, such as graphical image files (JPEG or PNG images for
example) or text. The second video may come from a digital or an analog input. The second
video is preferably translated to a larger uncompressed video quality.
[0021]     Preferably, the video player of the landing page instantly analyses the bandwidth of
the computerized device and determines which video feed is best for the connection, allowing
the player to start streaming with minimal delay, while providing a high quality streaming video.
An automatic bandwidth detector can be a real performance booster to accelerate the time for
the delivering of the video playback. It has been noticed that in North America the recipient
bandwidth varies all the time depending on a company's bandwidth distribution and time of day.
So in order to achieve the quickest play back with minimal wait time, the second video is
encoded in several bandwidths. The bandwidth detector typically buffers for several seconds.
Viewers have experience 0-5 seconds to buffer a whole 2 hours movie, for any operating system
(Windows, MAC or UNIX).
[0022]     To further minimize the delay to see the second video of the landing page, the
download of the second video may begin as soon as the email is opened or viewed. When the
landing page is opened, a portion of the video has already been buffered.

                                                    5
[0023]     The video player of the landing page may be programmed to automatically launch to
the desired web launch page when the second video is finished. It is also possible to combine
both previous web pages in only one web page.
[0024]     The features of the present invention, which are believed to be novel, are set forth
with particularity in the appended claims.
Brief Description of the Drawings
[0025]     The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become
more readily apparent       from the following        description, reference   being made to the
accompanying drawings in which:
[0026]     Figure 1 is a diagram showing the steps to create the first video file.
[0027]     Figure 2 is a diagram showing the sequence for the display of the first video in an
email as seen by the viewer.
[0028]     Figure 3 is example of the frame by frame editing system.
Detailed Description Including Best Mode
[0029]     A novel video email will be described hereinafter. Although the invention is described
in terms of specific illustrative embodiment(s), it is to be understood that the embodiment(s)
described herein are by way of example only and that the scope of the invention is not intended
to be limited thereby.
[0030]     In Figure 1, the steps to create the first video to be displayed in an email are shown in
a flowchart. The first video file is constituted by a plurality of frames coming typically from a
source video 105. If the source video is analog 110, it is converted 115 into a digital video.
[0031]     To obtain the frames, a third party software 130 may be used to create frames from
the source video. It is also possible to use another method to extract the selected frames from a
source video.

                                                   6
[0032]      A plurality of frames is chosen 135 and ordered into a particular sequence 140 to
create the first video file to be displayed in the email page. An optional step is to determine the
number of times the video will be displayed in the email page 145, from 1 to infinity. The html
code of the first video file is consequently implemented to create the corresponding number of
loops for the display. This is typically realized by a third party software. The first video file
created is associated to the CVITM format 150 and posted on server 160. The CVITM format has
been created for this purpose and the server is configured to recognize this format 155.
[0033]      The email is coded in a HTML format containing the text and the design of the email.
A hot link is embedded 165 in the code of the email to call the first video file from the server
and to display the file in the email page when the email is opened or viewed.
[0034]      If the user clicks on the email page or on the first video file, a landing page is opened
170 where a second video is displayed.
[0035]      The video displayed in the email is not limited to a rectangular screen, it may be
almost any form such as, for example, a circle, a star, etc...
[0036]      In Figure 2, the diagram shows the sequence as seen by the viewer. First, the viewer
receives and views the email 205 containing the first video. When he/she clicks on the first
video or on the email page 210, he/she is brought to a landing page where he/she can see a
second video 215. It is also possible to automatically open the landing page when the display of
the first video is finished. At the end of the second video, he/she may be automatically brought
to another page, the launch page 220 that may contain, for example, details for special events, an
event registration, an event notification, a turnkey e-commerce site, a product launch page,
special services, special promotions, a master corporate website home page, an artist page or a
movie page. He/she may then interact with the launch page and enter information or request for
a product related to the sent email.
[0037]      On the landing page, many options for the video may be included, for example:
    -       Volume slider
    -       Information button
    -       Stop button

                                                 7
       -_  Fast rewind button with Video display
           Play/pause button
       -_  Fast forward with video display
           Timer button with elapsed time and time remaining toggle
           Navigation slider with time indicator
           Adjust Picture sliders
           Brightness and contrast
    -~     Saturation
           Play size selector on display window
           Half size or original
           Fit to window
[0038]     In Figure 3, an embodiment is shown for the frame by frame editing system, with a
frame by frame counter 310, the image 320 and the menu 330.
[0039]     It is to be understood that the video may be displayed on any computerized device
that is enabled to receive and display email messages. The computerized device may be, but not
limited to, a computer, a pocket PC, a PDA, a laptop, a personal e-mailing system (e.g.
Blackberry TM) or a cellular phone which can be linked to the Internet.
[0040]     While illustrative and presently preferred embodiment(s) of the invention have been
described in detail hereinabove, it is to be understood that the inventive concepts may be
otherwise variously embodied and employed and that the appended claims are intended to be
construed to include such variations except insofar as limited by the prior art.
