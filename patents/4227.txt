                                        TECHNICAL FIELD
        The present invention relates to a compound of formula (3Z,5S)-5
(hydroxymethyl) -1- [(2'-methyl- 1,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0
methyloxime, and/or an active metabolite thereof having antagonist action at the oxytocin
receptor and/or vasopressin Via receptor, to processes for their preparation,
pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in medicine.
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        Oxytocin (OT) is a cyclic nona-peptide that mediates its physiological actions
through activation of the oxytocin receptor (OT-R), a cell membrane receptor belonging to
the class of G protein-coupled receptors that is similar to arginine vasopressin receptors.
One important action of Oxytocin (OT) is to cause the contraction of the uterus of mammals
during labor. Repeated, concerted and regular contraction of the uterus will cause the
dilatation of the cervix, the rupture of fetal membranes and lead to expulsion of the fetus.
Premature labor is when these contractions occur before the normal term of pregnancy.
Preterm increase of uterine activity is the most common expression of preterm labor.
        Premature labor leads to undesired premature birth, a serious health problem that
remains the major cause of perinatal mortality and severe morbidity, especially respiratory
distress syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and
necrotising enterocolitis that are far more common in preterm than in term infants. Long
term impairments such as cerebral palsy, visual impairment and hearing loss are also more
common in preterm infants. Nowadays, preterm birth remains the leading cause of infant
mortality and morbidity in industrialized nations, where, despite the significant
improvements in obstetrical medicine, it is causing high costs for neonatal intensive care of
premature babies. The actual costs are even higher to society when taking into
consideration the healthcare provision of preterm childbirth-related ailments, such as
respiratory distress syndrome, heart conditions, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and severe
                                                1

learning disabilities. The management of preterm labor represents a significant problem in
the field of obstetrics.
        The OT/OT-R system plays a vital role in initiating labor in mammals, in particular
in humans. The density of OT-R increases markedly in the myometrium before the onset
and during labor. Also it is thought that the local OT peptide hormone concentration
increases markedly before parturition in human. The high circulating concentrations of
progesterone induce uterine quiescence while the uterus acquires contractile ability.
Shortly before term, plasma progesterone concentrations fall, OT-R expression in the
uterus increases markedly, OT is released and uterine contractile activity increases. At
term, the contractions rise to a crescendo, resulting in delivery as a result of two
interacting positive feedback loops. The first is a local uterine loop: within the uterus itself,
contractile prostaglandins are produced and released in response to OT and uterine
contractions. These prostaglandins may play a further role in cervical ripening and
weakening of fetal membranes. The second loop involves the hypothalamus: in response to
uterine contractions and vaginal and cervical distension, magnocellular oxytocin neurons
in the hypothalamus increase their activity resulting in the release of OT from their axon
terminals in the posterior pituitary. The released OT acts upon the uterus both to stimulate
the further production of prostaglandins and to contribute further to the contractions of
the uterus.
        Therefore, blocking the effect of OT by antagonizing OT-R might represent an
attractive modality for the treatment of diseases related to the OT-R activity, in particular
preterm labor.
        Tocolytic, i.e. uterus relaxing agents, have been used in clinical studies for the
pharmaceutical treatment of preterm labor. Most of these agents are used off-label. They
have shown very limited efficacy, if any, in prolonging gestation and without clear
demonstration of improvement of neonate outcome. Current tocolytics are very often
associated with unwanted adverse effects on women, foetus or neonate. Such tocolytics
include beta-2-adrenergic agonists, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, magnesium sulfate,
nitric acid donors and calcium channel blockers. Beta-2-adrenergic agonists such as
ritodrine or terbutaline cause a number of cardiovascular and metabolic side effects
including maternal tachycardia, palpitations, hypotension, altered thyroid function and
fetal and neonatal hypoglycaemia, tachycardia. Ritodrine is no longer FDA approved. The
                                                 2

calcium channel blocker nifedipine is also a medicine that is used to try to stop
contractions. Some of the side effects that may occur include facial flushing, headache,
nausea, palpitations, and lightheadedness. The total prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor
(NSAID) indomethacin has been used. It can also have serious effects on the fetus:
constriction of ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, decrease in renal function with
oligohydramnios, intraventricular hemorrhage, hyperbilirubinemia, necrotizing
enterocolitis. Maternal side effects include abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting,
depression and dizzy spells for the mother. Another NSAID is sulindac that has a side effect
profile similar to indomethacin. For magnesium sulfate, meta-analyses have failed to
support it as a tocolytic agent. Women reported important side effects such as flushing,
lethargy, headache, muscle weakness, pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest. A newborn
who has been exposed to magnesium sulfate may show lethargy, hypotonia, respiratory
depression, bone problems, osteopenia and fractures. Recently, the FDA is advising
healthcare professionals against using magnesium sulfate injection for longer than 5-7
days to stop preterm labor in women.
        Atosiban, a dual vasopressin Via receptor and OT-R antagonist is marketed in EU
and used to stop contractions and delay preterm delivery by a few days. Atosiban is a
peptide that is not orally bioavailable and must be administered parenterally. It is rapidly
degraded in circulation by enzymes and its use is limited to maximum 48h.
In addition, non-peptide OT-R antagonists were developed such as pyrrolidine derivatives
(WO 01/72705, WO 02/102799, WO 2002/074741, WO 2004/005249) as mixtures of
isomers.
        There remain significant unmet needs for efficient and orally selective OT-R
antagonist for the treatment of diseases related to the OT-R activity, in particular preterm
labor.

 Assisted reproduction technologies are methods applied in humans for the treatment of
infertility and in animals for producing pregnancies. Infertility, which affects about 10% of
human pairs worldwide, may be treated by in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF
ET) or in less complicated cases, by artificial insemination. Generally, a success of an
embryo transfer is dependant on uterine receptivity, an entity that is defined as an ability
of uterus to provide optimal conditions mandating proper implantation and embryo
development. Basic components of uterine receptivity are uterine contractile activity and
the condition of endometrium.
Uterine contractions occurring during the embryo transfer may expel embryos from the
uterus towards vagina or oviducts, which may be a cause of unsuccessful treatment, or in
latter case a cause of extrauterine pregnancy, a serious, potentially life-threatening
complication.
Generally, the present invention relates to a compound of formula (3Z,5S)-5
(hydroxymethyl) -1- [(2'-methyl- 1,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0
methyloxime, and/or an active metabolite thereof, for use in assisted reproduction
technology.

yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime, and/or an active metabolite thereof, and a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.
A "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient" used herein is a medium
generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to patients. A
person skilled in the art is aware of a whole variety of such carriers, diluents or excipients
suitable to formulate a pharmaceutical composition (see, for example, Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. Mack Publishing Company, 1990, pp. 1289- 1329). The
carrier(s), diluent(s) or excipient(s) must be compatible with the other ingredients of the
formulation, capable of pharmaceutical formulation, and not deleterious to the recipient
thereof.
        The compound of the invention and/or an active metabolite thereof, together with a
conventionally employed carrier, diluent or excipient may be formulated as pharmaceutical
compositions and unit dosages thereof, and in such form may be employed as solids, such
as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, or
capsules filled with the same, all for oral use, or in the form of sterile injectable solutions
for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use. Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit
dosage forms thereof may comprise ingredients in conventional proportions, with or
without additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may
                                                14

contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient, i.e. the compound of the
invention, commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed.
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered by a variety of
routes including oral, rectal, vaginal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous,
intramuscular, and intranasal. Depending on the intended route of delivery, the compounds
are preferably formulated as either injectable or oral compositions. The compositions for
oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk
powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms
to facilitate accurate dosing. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete
units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit
containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired
therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit
dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampoules or syringes of the liquid
compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such
compositions, the compound of the invention is usually a minor component (from about
0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the
remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the
desired dosing form.
Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (3Z,5S)-5
(hydroxymethyl) -1- [(2'-methyl- 1,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0
methyloxime, and/or an active metabolite thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier, diluent or excipient is administered by oral, vaginal or intravenous route.
Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or
nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and
the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or
compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth
or gelatine; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic
acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as
colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring
agent such as pepper-mint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.

Triethylamine (1.80L, 13.56 mol, 3.0 vol) was charged to a solution of (4R)-4-hydroxy-1
[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]-L-proline (0.598Kg, 1.84 mol, 1.0 wt) in dimethyl
sulfoxide (4.42L, 7.4 vol) at 15 to 20'C. Pyridine-sulphur trioxide complex (0.879Kg, 5.52
mol, 1.47 wt) was charged portion-wise at 15 and 25'C and the reaction mixture stirred at
that temperature until reaction completion, as determined by TLC analysis (typically 1 to 3
hours).7 The reaction was quenched with aq. hydrochloric acid (3M, 4.80L, 8.0 vol) at 0 to
30'C, tetrahydrofuran (3.OOL, 5.0 vol) and heptanes (0.60L, 1.0 vol) charged, the layers
separated and the aqueous phase extracted with tetrahydrofuran (2x 3.OOL, 2x 5.0 vol).

The combined organic phases were washed with aq. hydrochloric acid (1 M, 2x 1.20L, 2x
2.0 vol) and saturated sodium chloride solution (2x 1 .20L, 2x 2.0 vol), the aqueous washes
combined and back-extracted with tetrahydrofuran (2x 0.60L, 2x 1.0 vol). The combined
organics were dried over magnesium sulphate (1 .794Kg, 3.0 wt), filtered, the filtercake
washed with tetrahydrofuran (0.60L, 1 .0 vol) and the filtrates concentrated under vacuum
at 40 to 45'C to give a pale brown foam. Ethyl acetate (6.OOL, 10.0 vol) was charged to the
foam, the contents stirred for 5 to 10 minutes to reach dissolution and the solvent removed
under vacuum at 40 to 45'C. This was repeated using ethyl acetate (6.OOL, 5.0 vol) until
tetrahydrofuran was not detected by 1H NMR analysis (d6 -DMSO). The residue was slurried
in ethyl acetate (4.80L, 8.0 vol), activated carbon (0.084Kg, 0.14 wt) added followed by a
line rinse of ethyl acetate (3.OOL, 5.0 vol), the resultant heated to and maintained at 70 to
80'C for 20 to 30 minutes, cooled to 40 to 55'C and filtered through glass microfibre paper.
The filter-cake was washed with ethyl acetate (1.50L, 2.5 vol) and the combined filtrates
and wash concentrated to 2.5 to 3.5 vol under vacuum at 40 to 45'C.
Crystallisation commenced during the concentration. The concentrate was transferred to a
suitable vessel with a line rinse of ethyl acetate (0.30L, 0.5 vol) and heated to 70 to 80'C.
Additional ethyl acetate (0.30L, 0.5 vol) was added as necessary to achieve dissolution.
Heptanes (1.80L, 3.0 vol) was added at 70 to 80'C and the contents allowed to cool to
between 15 and 25'C over 1 to 2 hours. The slurry was further cooled to and aged at 0 to
5'C for 2 to 3 hours, filtered and the filtercake washed with ethyl acetate:heptanes (1:1,
0.60L, 1.0 vol) at 0 to 5oC followed by heptanes (3.OL, 2.5 vol). The collected solid was dried
under vacuum at 40 to 45'C to give 1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'- biphenyl-4-yI)carbonyl]-4-oxo-L
proline [0.444Kg, 74.7%th, 74. 2%w/w, 1H NMR (d6 -DMSO) concordant with structure] as

The initial solubility screen showed that pure (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl
1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime isomer is soluble in a range
of solvents.
On the basis of the above results, crystallisation by addition of anti-solvent was examined
and the results reported in Table III. The anti-solvent was added to a warm solution ca 40
50'C and allowed to cool to room temperature.
In particular, the water (anti-solvent) was added to a warm (40-50'C) solution of (3Z,5S)
5- (hydroxymethyl)- 1- [(2'-methyl- 1,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0
methyloxime in IPA until cloudiness was reached and the mixture was allowed to cool to
room temperature.

The IPA/water crystallisation conditions were applied to a crude isomeric mixture. The
toluene solution was first concentrated to dryness prior to dissolution in IPA (8 vol) and
addition of water (18 vol). Unfortunately, this resulted in material de-mixing as oil.
In another experiment, the antisolvent was added to a solution of crude (3Z,5S)-5
(hydroxymethyl) -1- [(2'-methyl- 1,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0
methyloxime (90.4%area purity, contained 0.5%w/w toluene and 3.7%w/w THF) at room
temperature until cloudiness was reached and the mixture was left to stand at room
temperature (Table IV).

 Crystallisation using ethyl acetate followed by aging in a freezer overnight gave
 crystallisation using the pure (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4
yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin-3 -one 0-methyloxime material, but quickly re-dissolved as the
sample warmed. No crystals were observed using crude material in ethyl acetate even
when seeds were added.
 Crystallisation using diethylether followed by aging in a fridge gave crystallisation using
the crude (3Z/E,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4
yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime material. The solid was collected in 41 %
recovery. Unfortunately, the collected solid had a slighter poorer E/Z ratio than the input
material and a slightly higher chemical purity.
TBME as solvent for both pure Z and crude gave oiling after aging in freezer, and stayed in
solution after aging in the fridge with and without seeds.
 Suitable crystallization conditions of the crude isomeric mixture allowing improvement of
the Z/E ratio and of the purity of the isomeric mixture (E+Z) have not been found.

yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one0-methyloxime
 1.4.1 Small scale purification
The isolation procedure in substantially pure form of (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'
methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime was performed by
 chromatography using a Biotage system ( Biotage AB, SE-751 03 Uppsala, Sweden) of the
 crude isomeric mixture isolated after reduction of the oxime ester (Stage 7 of Example 1).
 Five distinct batches (No. 020, 180, 062, 068, 076) of the crude isomeric mixture were
purified by Biotage chromatography. Furthermore, different conditions were used
regarding batches No. 068 and 076. Purification was performed with a 5%w/w spike of
 oxime methyl ester added (No. 068), and with an overloaded Biotage column (No. 076).
 Each chromatography was run using Biotage 40M cartridges (40 g silica) which had been
pre-flushed with toluene. Toluene:MeOH (99:1 v/v) was then eluted and collected in 100
ml fractions (total volume 4 L), followed by a flush of toluene:MeOH (96:4 v/v).
                                                29

Fractions were analysed by TLC (eluent: ethylacetate) to determine which fractions could
be discarded and which fractions contained Z isomer. These Z fractions were then
analyzed by HPLC. The pass criteria for a fraction was >96% Z isomer and <1.2% E isomer.
Surprisingly, the purification through Biotage chromatography of various batches was very
efficient as the substantially pure form of (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'
biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime is purified at 99.4% (Batches
No.020, No.062, No.068) and at 99.2% (Batches No.180, No.076). In particular, the Biotage
chromatography in presence of oxime ester removes 5%w/w oxime ester without
detriment to recovery or quality (Batch No.068) and a 25 % overcharge of the Biotage
column does not cause a decrease in yield or quality(batch No.076).

area, E-isomer     1.20% area) were combined and concentrated under vacuum at 40 to
45'C. Absolute ethanol (2x 2L) was added to the residue and the solution concentrated
under vacuum at 40 to 45'C until the foamy solid could be manipulated. The desired
product, (3Z, 5S)-1-[(biphenyl-4-yI-carbonyl)-5-hydroxy-methyl]pyrrolidine-3-one-0

Appropriate batches of (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4
yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime (2.713kg, 1.0 wt) isolated from the Biotage
chromatography were combined and dissolved in absolute ethanol (5.16L, 2.0 vol) at 15 to
25'C, clarified by filtration through glass microfibre paper and an absolute ethanol wash
(0.50L, 0.2 vol) applied to the filter. The combined filtrates were concentrated portion wise
under vacuum at 40 to 45'C. The resultant was transferred to drying trays and dried under
vacuum at 30'C for 24 hours. The oven temperature was then increased incrementally
from 30 to 40'C over 80 hours. The level of residual solvent was determined by 1H NMR
analysis (CDCl 3) and when found to be <1.0%w/w the solid was passed through a 500pm
aperture sieve. The solid was returned to the oven and dried at 40 to 42'C until the solvent

yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime binding to OT-R and vasopressin Via
receptor

Binding to the OT-R and Vasopressin Via receptor
Competition binding to the human oxytocin receptor was measured in vitro using a
scintillation proximity assay.
This assay allows determining the affinity of the test compounds for OT-R. Membranes
from HEK293EBNA (cells expressing OT-R) were suspended in buffer containing 50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgC12 and 0.1 % BSA (w/v). The membranes (2-4 tg) were mixed
with 0.1 mg SPA bead coated with wheat-germ aglutinin (WGA-PVT-Polyethylene Imine
beads from Amersham) and 0.2 nM of the 125 radiolabelled [I]-OVTA (OVTA being
Ornithin Vasoactive, an analogue of OT for competitive binding experiments). Non-specific
binding was determined in the presence of 1 tM Oxytocin. The total assay volume was 100
pl. The plates (Corning @ NBS plate) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and
counted on a Mibrobeta@ plate scintillation counter. Competitive binding was performed
in presence of compounds of the present invention at the following concentrations: 30 pIM,
10 tM, 1 tM, 300 nM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 100 pM, 10 pM. The competitive binding data
were analysed using the iterative, nonlinear, curve-fitting program, "Prism" (GraphPad
Software, Ine).
The ability of the compounds of the present invention to inhibit the binding of I-OVTA to
the OT-receptor was assessed using the above described in vitro biological assay. The
binding affinity of test compounds from the above examples is expressed by the inhibition
constant (Ki; nM). From these values, it can be derived that said test compounds according
to the present invention do show a significant binding to the oxytocin receptor.
The inhibition constant Ki of (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4
yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime to the oxytocin receptor is Ki (nM) = 52 nM
and to the vasopressin Via receptor is Ki (nM) = 120 nM. Thus (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)
1- [(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one   0-methyloxime is selective for
the oxytocin receptor.
Example 3: (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4
yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin-3 -one 0-methyloxime is a OT-R antagonist
                                              34

The inhibition of oxytocin-induced Ca2+ mobilization in OT-R transfected HEK293EBNA
cells was measured by FLIPR (fluorimetric imaging plate reader).
This assay allows the measurement of the inhibition of OT/OT-R mediated calcium
mobilization by the compound (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4
yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin-3 -one 0-methyloxime.
FLIPR@ is a fluorimetric imaging device using a laser (Argon-ion laser) for simultaneous
illumination and reading (cooled CCD camera) of each well of a 96-well-plate, thus enabling
rapid measurements on a large number of samples.
Preparing the plates: FLIPR -plates were pre-coated with PLL (Poly-L-Lysine) 10ptg/ml +
0.1%) gelatine to attach HEK293EBNA cells (Human Embryonic Kidney cells expressing
OT-R) and incubated for 30min up to 2 days at 37 'C. The cells were plated out into 96
well-plates (60000 cells/well).
Labelling with fluo-4: 50 tg of Fluo-4 (Ca2+ sensitive fluorescent dye) were dissolved in
20l pluronic acid (20% in DMSO). The dissolved fluo-4 was then diluted in 10ml DMEM
(Dubecco's Minimal Essential Medium)-F12 culture medium. The plates were washed one
time with DMEM-F12 medium. 100[pl of the Fluo-4 containing-DMEM-F12 medium were
added to the HEK-cells which were incubated for 1.5-2h in this fluorescent medium. Fluo-4
is taken up by the cytoplasm of the cells.
Buffer: 145mM NaCl, 5mM KC1, 1mM MgCl2, 10mM Hepes, 10mM Glucose, EGTA (Ethylene
bis oxyethylene nitrilo tetraacetic acid). The pH was adjusted to 7.4.
Performance of the assay: A minimum of 80pl/well of compound (3Z,5S)-5
(hydroxymethyl) -1- [(2'-methyl- 1,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0
methyloxime (5x) in the above buffer (lx) were prepared (96-well-plates). The compound
(3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one      0
methyloxime was added to the 96-well-plates at different concentrations (30 pIM, 10 pIM, 1
 tM, 300 nM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 100 pM, 10 pM). Oxytocin (OT) was added at a
concentration of 40 nM.
The relative fluorescence of Fluo-4 (Xex= 488nm, Xem= 590 nm) is then measured by the
FLIPR in presence or absence of compounds (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'
biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime. The fluorescence of the marker
                                               35

being sensitive to the amount of Ca2+, the Ca2+ movements can be detected. Then, it can be
determined the ability of compound (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'
biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0-methyloxime to antagonize the oxytocin
induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization mediated by the oxytocin receptor.
The compound of formula (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4
yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin-3 -one 0-methyloxime inhibits the activity of oxytocin on OT-R with
an IC50 = 81 nM.
Example 4: Inhibition of spontaneous uterine contractions in anesthetized late-term
pregnant rat
4.1 Experimentalprotocol
Late-term pregnant (certified at days 19-21 of pregnancy) Sprague Dawley CD (SD) BR
female rats (Charles River, Calco, Italy), weighing 350-400 g were anesthetized with
urethane (1.05 g/kg, i.p.) and placed on a homeothermic operating table. A midline incision
at the hypogastrium level was made, one pregnant uterine horn exposed and its tubal end
(near the ovary) was closed by a ligature with surgical silk.
Corresponding to the fetus close to the ovary, the uterine-horn wall was incised taking care
not to injure the adjacent placenta and PE240 tubing with a latex balloon (9 mm length
when empty, capacity 0.1 mL; Radnoti, Monrovia, CA, USA) on the top was inserted into the
lumen and secured to the uterine wall with surgical silk. After filling the internal cavity of
the latex balloon with 0.1 mL of sterile physiological saline solution, the catheter was
connected to an amplifying/recording system (MacLab, ADInstruments Pty Ltd, Castle Hill,
Australia) via a P231D Gould-Statham pressure transducer. One jugular vein was isolated
and cannulated with a PE60 polyethylene cannula for the i.v. administration. After the
surgical preparation, a 30-min stabilization period was observed and then the effects of
increasing doses of compounds of the present invention (given as 10-min i.v. infusion,
bolus i.v. or p.o.) were evaluated by measuring the resulting uterine contractions.
For the i.v. administration (infusion or bolus) the uterine contractile activity was quantified
by calculating the AUC during the 10-min injection period. The percent variation of the AUC
values relative to the spontaneous uterine response observed after each compound
administration was calculated in comparison to the value recorded before the first dose
                                               36

administration (basal value). The effect of test compounds of the present invention was
evaluated by comparing pre- and post-treatment luminal uterine pressure values.
For the oral administration the same computation procedure was applied at different time
points after treatment. Statistical differences between treatment groups at each time-point
were determined by using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test.
4.2 Results
Figure 1A and B describe dose-response effects of Z-isomer and E-isomer administered by
oral route on inhibition of spontaneous uterine contractions in anesthetized pregnant rats
near term (gestational days 19-21). Data as means + S.E. of n=6-8 animals per group. The
y-axis represents uterine contractions as % of value compared to pre-dose set at 100%.
The x-axis represents the time post-dose in minutes. Contractions were continuously
recorded and area-under-the-curve (AUC) integrated over 10-min time intervals.
The results presented on Figure 1A demonstrate that (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'
methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime (Z form) is capable to
rapidly inhibit spontaneous uterine contractions in anesthetized late-term pregnant rat at
various doses (10, 30 or 60 mg/kg) compared to control vehicle NP3S (5% N
methylpyrrolidone, 25% polyethyleneglycol 200, 30% polyethylene glycol 400, 20%
propylene glycol, 20% saline). Uterine contractions inhibition of 15% can be observed 5 to
15 min after administration of the substantially pure Z form. Efficient inhibition of 42% is
observed 170-180 minutes after administration of said compound.
In contrast, no inhibition of uterine contraction has been observed with (3E,5S)-5
(hydroxymethyl) -1- [(2'-methyl- 1,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0
methyloxime at various doses (10, 30 or 60 mg/kg, E form) at any time during the 170-180
minutes observation (Figure 1B).
Surprisingly, the present invention shows that the substantially pure Z form having
formula (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin
3-one 0-methyloxime inhibits uterine contraction whereas the substantially pure E form
has no efficacy. Thus, the present invention advantageously relates to biologically active
compounds of formula (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4
yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin-3 -one 0-methyloxime and/or metabolite thereof in substantially
                                               37

pure form that can be administered at lower dosage compared to said compounds
provided in isomeric mixture.
Example 5: In vivo stability of (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4
yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin-3 -one 0-methyloxime
The isomeric interconversion of [14C]- (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'
biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime was studied after single oral and
intravenous doses (nominal 30mg/kg, 25 pCi/rat) to eight healthy female rats (n = 4 for
each dose route).
The animals used in this study were Sprague-Dawley, Crl: CD@BR albino rats. All animals
were supplied by Charles River UK Ltd (Margate, Kent, UK). Animals were in the weight
range 200 - 260 g and were approximately 2 months old. Rats were given a unique identity
number and were identified by unique tail markings plus cage location.
The dose groups were as follows: 4 female were given an oral dose and 4 female were
given an intravenous dose.
[14C]-  (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3
one 0-methyloxime oral and intravenous dosing formulations were prepared separately at
each dose phase at a target dose level of 30 mg/kg, and at a radioactive concentration of
approximately 25pCi/rat. Dose formulations were prepared in an appropriate matrix;
intravenous doses were prepared in NP3S, whilst oral doses were prepared in
Labrasol:water (1:1 v/v).
Chromatographic analysis using HPLC indicated that radioactive components exhibiting co
chromatography with the E-isomer of formula (3E,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl
1,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0-methyloxime were not present in the oral
or intravenous dose formulations either pre- or post-dose administration. There was
therefore no detectable interconversion of (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'
biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one 0-methyloxime to (3E,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1
[(2'-methyl- 1,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0-methyloxime during dose
preparation or administration. There was no evidence that [14 C]- E-isomer of formula
(3E,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one      0
                                                38

methyloxime was present in plasma collected up to 6 hours after an oral or intravenous
administration of [14C]- (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4
yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin-3 -one 0-methyloxime.
Therefore, using the methods described [14C]- (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[(2'-methyl
1,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl) carbonyl] pyrrolidin- 3-one 0-methyloxime undergoes no detectable
isomeric interconversion in vivo after oral or intravenous dose administration.
