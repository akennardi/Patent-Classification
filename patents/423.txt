                              0H                       3C      SOH

The present invention relates also to the crystalline form I of N-hydroxy-4-{2-[3-(NN
dimethylaminomethyl)benzofuran-2-ylcarbonylamino]ethoxy}benzamide             tosylate, to the
preparation method thereof and also to the pharmaceutical compositions containing same.
N-hydroxy-4-{2-[3-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)benzofuran-2-ylcarbonylamino]ethoxy}
benzamide, also known as abexinostate, is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor described
in patent application W02004/092115. It allows inhibition of cell growth and induces
apoptosis in cultured tumour cells in vitro, and it inhibits tumour growth in vivo in

                                                   -2
   xenograft models (Buggy et al., Mol. Cancer Ther 2006 5(5) 1309). In view of its
   pharmacological profile, abexinostate is intended for use in the treatment of cancer.
   From the industrial point of view it is imperative to be able to synthesize the compound
   with excellent purity, especially in a perfectly reproducible form, having valuable
 5 characteristics of dissolution, filtration, drying, ease of formulation and stability allowing
   its prolonged storage without particular requirements for temperature, light, humidity or
   oxygen levels.
   Patent application     W02004/092115        describes   two   different  routes  for obtaining
   abexinostate. In both cases, 3-methyl-benzofuran-2-carboxylic acid is used as starting
10 material, but functionalisation of this central nucleus by the dimethylaminomethyl group in
   the 3-position is carried out at different stages in the synthesis process, namely before or
   after coupling of the        benzofuran-2-carboxylic     acid  derivative with methyl 4-(2
   aminoethoxy)benzoate. Obtaining abexinostate hydrochloride is specifically described in
   the W02004/092115 application. However, using this salt on an industrial scale is delicate
15 because of its hygroscopic properties.
   The present invention describes a process for obtaining abexinostate tosylate (abexinostate
   4-methylbenzenesulfonate) in a well-defined, perfectly reproducible crystalline form, and
   presenting a very good stability compatible with the industrial constraints of preparation
   (especially drying) and storage of pharmaceutical compositions.
20 The crystalline form I of abexinostate tosylate is characterised by an powder diffraction
   pattern X having the following diffraction lines (Bragg's angle 2 theta, expressed in
   degrees ±0.20): 6.50; 9.94;       11.35; 12.33;    14.08; 18.95; 21.08; 27.05. Even more

   Raman spectroscopy. Significant peaks were observed at the following positions: 940 cm-1 ,
 5 1088 cm- 1, 1132 cm- 1, 1242 cm- 1, 1360 cm- 1, 1608 cm-1.
   Alternatively, the crystalline form I of abexinostate tosylate may be characterised by the
   powder diffraction pattern X which includes the 12 significant lines presented previously
   and also by a Raman spectrum having a significant peak at the position 1608 cm-1 .

   The invention relates also to a preparation method of crystalline form I of abexinostate
   tosylate, characterised in that abexinostate is crystallised from a polar medium in the
   presence of para-toluenesulphonic acid. Preferably, the polar medium is composed of one
   or more solvents selected from water, alcohols, ketones and esters, it being understood
 5 that:
       -   "alcohols"   means the C1-C6 alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol,
           isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, isopentanol,
           hexanol,
       -   "ketones" means the C3 -C6 ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, 2
10         pentanone, 3-pentanone, 3-methyl-2-butanone,          2-hexanone, 3-hexanone, ethyl
           isopropyl ketone, methyl isopropyl ketone, 2,2-dimethyl-3-butanone,
       -   "esters" means the C3-C8 esters such as ethyl formate, isopropyl formate, ethyl
           acetate, propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, tert-butyl
           acetate, pentyl acetate, isopentyl acetate, hexyl acetate.
15 Preferred alcohols are ethanol and isopropanol. Among the preferred solvents preference
   will also be given to acetone and methyl ethyl ketone among the ketones and to ethyl
   acetate among the esters.
   Alternatively, the polar medium is a binary mixture, one constituent of which is water.
   Even more preferably, the polar medium is a binary mixture selected among:
20 acetone/water, ethanol/water, isopropanol/water, and methyl ethyl ketone/water.

                                                  -5
   In the crystallisation process according to the invention, abexinostate (free base) obtained
   by any process may be used.
   The invention relates also to another preparation method of the crystalline form I of
   abexinostate tosylate, in which process the crystallisation is seeded using a very small
 5 amount of the crystalline form I of abexinostate tosylate.
   In this second crystallisation process according to the invention, abexinostate (free base)
   obtained by any process may also be used.
   Obtaining the crystalline form I of abexinostate tosylate has the advantage of making it
   possible to prepare pharmaceutical formulations having a consistent and reproducible
10 composition, presenting good characteristics of dissolution and stability, which is
   especially advantageous when the formulations are intended for oral administration. More
   specifically, use of the crystalline form I of abexinostate tosylate is especially valuable in
   an industrial context in view of its low hygroscopicity.
   The crystalline form I of abexinostate tosylate is intended for the treatment of cancer, more
15 particularly for the treatment of a carcinoma, a tumour, a neoplasm, a lymphoma, a
   melanoma, a glioma, a sarcoma, or a blastoma.
   The invention relates also to the pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as active
   ingredient, a tosylate salt of abexinostate, even more particularly the crystalline form I of
   abexinostate tosylate, together with one or more appropriate, non-toxic, inert excipients.
20 Among the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention those that are suitable
   for oral, parenteral (intravenous or subcutaneous) or nasal administration, tablets or
   drag6es, granules, sublingual tablets, capsules, lozenges, suppositories, creams, ointments,
   dermal gels, injectable preparations, drinkable suspensions and chewing gums can be more
   particularly mentioned.
25 Preference is given to pharmaceutical compositions administered orally.

                                                 -6
   The useful dosage varies according to the sex, age and weight of the patient, the
   administration route, the nature of the cancer and any associated treatments; and the useful
   dosage ranges from 20 mg to 480 mg of N-hydroxy-4-{2-[3-(NN-dimethylaminomethyl)
   benzofuran-2-ylcarbonylamino]ethoxy}benzamide per day expressed in terms of the free
 5 base.
   The Examples below illustrate the invention but do not limit it in any way.
   Example 1: Process for obtaining the crystalline form I of abexinostate tosylate
   1.66 kg of abexinostate (free base) are placed in 9.48 kg of a mixture of isopropanol/water
   (50/50   weight/weight)    at   ambient   temperature.   The   para-toluenesulphonic     acid
10 monohydrate (0.83 kg) is added in 2.36 kg of water at ambient temperature. The mixture
   is then heated at 75'C for 30 minutes before being cooled to 00 C. When crystallisation is
   complete, the suspension is filtered at 20'C. After drying, the crystalline form I of
   abexinostate tosylate is obtained with a yield of about 85 % and a purity greater than 99 %.
   The solid was characterised by the powder diffraction pattern X, Raman spectrum and
15 NMR spectrum as set out in the following Examples 3-6.

   33.9 kg of abexinostate (free base) are placed in 170 kg of a mixture of isopropanol/water
   (45.6/54.4 weight/weight) at ambient temperature. A solution composed of para
20 toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate (17.06 kg) in water (24.1 kg) is added. The medium is
   then heated at 70-75'C, cooled, and seeded with 1.935 kg of crystalline form I of
   abexinostate tosylate. The suspension is then filtered at 20'C. After drying, the crystalline
   form I of abexinostate tosylate is obtained with a yield of about 86 % and a purity greater
   than 99 %. The solid was characterised by the powder diffraction pattern X, Raman
25 spectrum, and NMR spectrum as set out in the following Examples 3-6.

   Example 4: Crystalline form I of abexinostate tosylate (crystal unit cell)
   A saturated solution of abexinostate tosylate in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is prepared by
   stirring a suspension for 24 hours at ambient temperature, followed by filtration. 1 mL of
   the resulting solution is then poured into a 1.8-mL HPLC vial, to which 0.25 mL of water
 5 is added. The solution is maintained at ambient temperature for 75 minutes. After
   centrifuging and then drying, the solid is isolated for analysis. From among the crystals
   obtained a crystal of sufficient quality is taken for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
   The crystalline structure of the above single crystal was determined using a Bruker Kappa
   CCD diffractometer equipped with an FR590 generator having a molybdenum anticathode
10 (MoKcl      = 0.7093 A) with an angular range from 20 to 27.50 in terms of 0. The following
   parameters were established:
         - crystal unit cell: triclinic
         - unit cell parameters: a = 10.467 A, b = 14.631 A, c = 20.159 A, a            =  73.971',
            P = 79.040', 7 = 72.683'

         - number of molecules in the unit cell: 4
         - volume of the unit cell: Vunit een = 2813.0 A3
         - density: d = 1.345 g/cm 3 .
   Example 5: Crystalline form I of abexinostate tosylate (Raman spectrum)
20 The form I of abexinostate tosylate was characterised by Raman spectroscopy. The spectra
   were recorded in diffuse reflectance mode (Raman Station 400, PerkinElmer) using a
   785 nm laser. The signal was recorded by a CCD detector. The wavelength shift depends
   on the material and is characteristic of that material, which allows analysis of the chemical
   composition and of the molecular arrangement of the sample studied. The spectra were
25 acquired with maximum power (100 % laser capacity), a spot size of 100 pm, twenty
   exposures of 2 seconds and a spectral resolution of 2 cm-1. The spectral range explored
   ranges from 0 to 3278 cm .

                                                  -9
   Significant peaks were observed at the following positions: 940 cm-1, 1088 cm- 1,
   1132 cm- 1, 1242 cm-1, 1360 cm-1, 1608 cm-1.
   Example 6: Crystalline form I of abexinostate tosylate (solid NMR spectrum)
   The form I of abexinostate        tosylate was also characterised by solid-state NMR
 5 spectroscopy. The   13 C  NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature using a Bruker
   SB Avance spectrometer with a 4-mm CP/MAS SB VTN type probe under the following
   conditions:
    -   Frequency: 125.76 MHz,
    -   Spectral width: 40 kHz,
10  -   Magic angle spinning rate of sample: 10 kHz,
    -   Pulse sequence: CP (Cross Polarization) with SPINAL64 decoupling (decoupling
        power: 80 kHz),
    -   Repetition delay: 10 s,
    -   Acquisition time: 35 ms,
15  -   Contact time: 4 ins,
    -   Number of scans: 4096.
   An apodisation function ("5 Hz line broadening") is applied to the collected signal before
   the Fourier transform. The spectra thereby obtained were referenced relative to a sample of
   adamantane     (the highest-frequency peak of adamantane       has a chemical shift of
20 38.48 ppm).
   The peaks observed have been collated in the following table (expressed in ppm

   Example 8: Hygroscopicity
   Hygroscopicity of the form I of abexinostate tosylate was assessed using gravimetric water
   vapor adsorption (DVS - Dynamic Vapor Sorption). A sample of 5 to 10 mg of the drug
15 substance, accurately weighed, was placed into a DVS sample pan working at 25'C under
   controlled humidity. The mass variation was recorded whilst drying under 0 per cent RH
   (relative humidity) and during two subsequent cycles of increasing and decreasing linear
   variations of relative humidity in the range 0-90 per cent RH at a rate of 10 per cent per
   hour. The relative humidity was maintained constant when it reached either 0 or 90 per
20 cent RH until the mass variation was less than 0.002 per cent per minute within a limit of
   time of 15 h.
   An increase in weight lower than 0.5% was detected by DVS analysis when a sample was
   exposed to relative humidities included between 0% to 90% at 25'C.
