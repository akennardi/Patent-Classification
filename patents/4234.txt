                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Example embodiments relate to methods and systems that improve security
 5 of private information transmission.
   Multimedia contents, such as text, images, audio or video data, are
   transmitted in codes. The codes represent complex and diverse information
   and have various forms such as symbols combined in certain ways. Digital
10 coding converts continuous signals to discrete sample information, and the
   discrete sample information is converted to binary codes to be recognized by
   computers.
   Many security technologies have been developed to encrypt multimedia
15 information or multimedia contents that are transmitted over networks.
   Existing or conventional schemes or algorithms, such as Data Encryption
   Standard (DES) scheme, cannot generate a key derived from a relationship
   between one multimedia information with another one because the
   relationship is difficult to be determined by using conventional schemes.
20
   Example embodiments solve the problems and protect multimedia information
   from unauthorized access by transmitting the multimedia content through a
   negative-base number and by generating a key to encrypt the private
   information. The key is derived from the relationship between two multimedia
25 contents and is used to encrypt any of the two multimedia contents.
   Consider an example in which a computer system transmits a private text
   from a sender to a receiver of the computer system. The computer system
   includes a binary generator, a negative base generator, an encryptor, and a
30 decoder. The binary generator converts a binary image and the private text
   into binary sequences, respectively. The negative base generator converts
   the binary sequences into decimal numbers with a base of 10, and further
   converts the decimal numbers to negative-base numbers with a base of -2 or
   10. The encryptor derives or determines a key from the relationship between
                                             5

   the negative-base number of the binary image and the negative-base number
   the private text. The sender sends the key and the negative-base number of
   the binary image to the receiver of the computer system. The decoder
   communicates with the receiver and obtains the negative-base number of the
 5 private text based on the key. The decoder further calculates the binary
   sequence of the private text and obtains the private text.
   In one example embodiment, the key is predetermined by the encryptor of the
   computer system by a geometric operation between the binary image and the
10 private text. The geometric operation is, but not limited to addition,
   subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   FIG. 1 is a method executed by a computer system to transmit a multimedia
   content in accordance with an example embodiment.
15
   Block 110 states generating a binary sequence for the multimedia content by
   a binary generator of the computer system.
   Consider an example in which a computer system includes a binary
20 generator, a negative base generator, a receiver, and a decoder. The
   computer system transmits a multimedia content to a receiver of the computer
   system. The binary generator divides the multimedia content into pieces and
   represents each piece by a bit. The multimedia content can be one or more
   Chinese characters, one or more English letters, and one or more images.
25
   In one example embodiment, the multimedia content is a text. The text can
   be English words or Chinese characters. Three types of character codes for
   Chinese characters are used in computer, which are input code, NeiMa, and
   output code. Input code (Chinese characters outer code) contains a set of
30 western keyboard symbols (letters, numbers and special symbols). NeiMa
   (Internal code) stores Chinese characters. Output code (character code)
   outputs Chinese characters. Binary codes of text information are converted to
   character codes. For example, the internal code of Chinese character 'F'
                                            6

   is 'D6DO', and the internal code of Chinese character         '4'    is 'BFC6'
   The Internal code can be represented as a corresponding decimal number.
   In one example embodiment, the text is represented by an American
 5 Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). ASCII code convert 128
   specified characters into eight-bit integers, and the highest bit (parity bit) is set
   to 0. For example, the ASCII code of letter 7' is '01011010', the ASCII code of
   number 'O' is '00110000', and the ASCII code of symbol '?' is '00111111'.
   Each binary number corresponds to a decimal number.
10 The binary generator converts the ASCII code of the text into a decimal
   number with a base of 10, and then converts the decimal number into a binary
   sequence. By way of example, the ASCII code for '4IIlR'            is 'BOC4 C3C5
   CCD8 C7F8', which can be converted to a binary sequence of
   '1011000011000100 1100001111000101 1100110011011000
15 1100011111111000'. As another example, the binary sequence for 'Macao
   SAR' is '01001101 01100001 01100011 01100001 01101111 00100000
   01010011 01000001 01010010'.
   In another example embodiment, the multimedia content is an image. The
20 binary generator of the computer system divides the image into a matrix of
   pixels each corresponding to one or more bits in the binary sequence of the
   image.
   Block 120 states converting the binary sequence into a negative-base number
25 by a negative base generator of the computer system.
   By way of example, positional notation is a method of representing numbers.
   It is based on the base and a set of digital symbols. Integer bases are
   commonly used for positional notation. A numeral system that uses 'a'
30 different digits (0,1,2, -.- , a - 1) is called a base 'a' numeral system. For
   example, in the decimal system, the base is 10, and ten different digits
   0,1,2, -- ,9 are used in the decimal system. In computers, binary numeral
   system (base is 2) is widely used, with two binary digits, 0 and 1. Each digit
                                                7

   has unique counting unit in the base 'a' numeral system. The position of a
   digit is used to signify the power of base 'a' that the digit is to be multiplied
   with, as in:
                                               n
                    (enen_ 1 - eieo)a =            ek ak             (
                                             k=O
 5 where the number ak represents the weights of the corresponding digits.
   For the decimal system, every non-negative integer N has a unique decimal
   representation:
   N = n, x 10P + ny_1          x 10P-1+ --- + ni x 101+      no x 10      0          (2)
10 where nk E {0,1,2, -- ,9}, k = 0,1,2,          , p.
   Equation (2) can be simplified as:
                   N = (nyn,_np- 2           nn    o )1                (3)
15 For the binary system, the arbitrary non-negative integer N has a general form
   as follows:
       N = n, x 2P + n         1 x2P1+           +njx21+ no x 20                  (4)
   where nk E {0,1}, k = 0,1,2, ---, p.
20 Equation (4) can be simplified as:
                   N = (nyn,_inp-         '-'n    no) 2
                                        2       1                    (5)
   The arbitrary non-negative integer N can be represented with a non-negative
   integer 'a', as the base:
25    N = n, xaP +ny 1 xaP-1              +...+nix a' +no xao                     (6)
   where nk E {0,1,2,,        a - 11, k = 0,1,2, -,p.
                                               8

   Non-integer bases can also be used to represent N, such as base 'T' (tau)
   numeral system. Various base values in the positional number system are
   applied in various applications.
 5 By way of example, a negative base can be used to construct a non-standard
   positional numeral system. Like other place-value systems, each position
   holds multiples of the appropriate power of the system's base. The negative
   base negator converts a number to a negative-base number. The negative
   base is indicated by '-a', a = 2,3,4,5, --. A negative binary system includes
10 negative-base number with a negative base of -2.
   Gaussian integers 'N' based on a negative binary system can be represented
   as follows:
             N = n x (-2)P + ny_1 x (-2)P-1 + -.. + ni x (-2)1
15                         + no x (-2)0           (7)
   where nk E {0,1}, k = 0,1,2, ---, p.
   Equation (7) can be simplified as:
                 N =   (n  n _ np-2 'n    no)( _2)               (8)
20
   Gaussian integers 'N'       based on the negative decimal system can be
   represented as follows:
           N = n, x (-10)P + ny_1 x (-10)P-1 + - + ni x (-10)1
                         + n o X (-10)0            (9)
25 where nk E {0,1,2, -- ,9}, k = 0,1,2,    , p.
   Equation (9) can be simplified as:
                N =  (nn_np-2          nno)(_ )                  (10)
                                         9

   When selecting negative integer (b <-1) as the base, integers (including
   negative integers) can be represented by IbI digits. For example, if b = -2,
   then 5 and -3 in decimal system are represented as follows:
             5(10) = 1 x (-2)2 + 0 x (-2)1 + 1 x (-2)0 = 101(-2)
 5        -3(10) = 1 x (-2)3 + 1 x (-2)2 + 0 x (-2)1 + 1 x (-2)o
                       = 1101(-2)
   Conversion between binary systems, decimal systems and negative-base
   systems can be stored in a reference table.
10
   By way of example, the negative base generator of the computer system
   converts the binary sequences into negative-base numbers. The negative
   base can be -2 or -10 or any other negative numbers. As one example, the
   binary sequence of '1011000011000100 1100001111000101
15 1100110011011000 1100011111111000' is converted to a negative-base
   number of '(193343681100584742036) (10')"           in which the negative
   base is -10. As another example, the binary sequence of '01001101
   01100001 01100011 01100001 01101111 00100000 01010011 01000001
   01010010' is converted by the negative base generator to a negative-base
20 number of '(19588624954650081630598) (10)'.
   Block 130 states receiving the negative-base number by a receiver of the
   computer system.
25 Block 140 states calculating a decimal number corresponding to the negative
   base number by a decoder of the computer system.
   By way of example, a negative-base number nynyinp-2 '''nino is based
   on a negative base b = -r,       r = 2,3,4,5,--. A decimal integer N can be
30 written as:
                              p
                       N =       ni (-r)'                (11)
                             i=O
                                          10

   where each digit ni is a positive integer from 0 to r - 1. When the negative
   base number nynyinp-2 '''nino and the value of the negative base b are
   known, the corresponding decimal number N can be calculated by the
   decoder of the computer system based on equation (11).
 5
   Block 150 states retrieving the binary sequence based on the calculated
   decimal number by the decoder.
   By way of example, the decoder of the computer system stores a look-up
10 table that stores the binary code for each decimal number. For example, the
   binary code for the decimal number 29410 is 1001001102.
   Block 160 states obtaining the multimedia content based on the binary
   sequence.
15
   By way of example, the decoder of the computer system stores a look-up
   table that stores the binary code for each ASCII code, and the text for each
   ASCII code. For example, the ASCII code for binary sequence
   '1011000011000100 1100001111000101 1100110011011000
20 1100011111111000' is 'BOC4 C3C5 CCD8 C7F8', and the text for the ASCII
   code is 'M r IX'.
   FIG. 2 shows a table 200 of the positional number system in accordance with
   an example embodiment.
25
   Table 200 lists the relationship between decimal numbers and native-base
   numbers with a negative base of -2. Table 200 functions as a reference table
   for conversion between binary system, decimal system and negative-base
   system.
30
   FIG. 3 shows a table 300 of the positional number system in accordance with
   another example embodiment.
                                           11

   Table 200 lists the relationship between decimal numbers and native-base
   numbers with a negative base of -2. Table 200 functions as a reference table
   for conversion between binary system, decimal system and negative-base
   system.
 5
   FIG. 4 shows an algorithm 400 that converts decimal numbers to negative
   base numbers in accordance with an example embodiment.
   By way of example, a negative base generator executes algorithm 400 to
10 convert decimal number to negative-base numbers. Algorithm 400 shows an
   example process of converting a decimal number to a negative-base number.
   In the negative system notation, a decimal number 'M is divided by 'b' for
   multiple times. Let the divisible quotient as a new dividend in each division
   step, the new dividend is divided by 'b' until the dividend is equal to 0. The
15 remainder of each divisible step should be guaranteed between 0- - b - 1.
   If b = -16, the remainder should be in a range of 0 to 15. Writing down each
   remainder, all the remainders are arranged from back to front, leading to the
   negative system notation representation of the original decimal number 'M.
20 In one example embodiment, the process of converting decimal number -15
   to a negative base number with a base b of -2 is shown as follows:
       -15        -2
            8  -           The remainder is 1      Because -15    - 8 x (-2)=1
         -4    -           The remainder is 0      Because 8 - (-4) x (-2)=0
            2  -           The   remainder  is 0
         -1    -           The   remainder  is 0
            1  -           The   remainder  is I
            0  -           The   remainder  is 1                Over
   Hence, decimal number '-15' (the decimal system) is equal to '110001' (the
   negative base 'b = -2'     system).
25
   In one example embodiment, the process of converting decimal number -15
   to a negative base number with a base b of -8 is shown as follows:
                                           12

      -15            -8
           2      -        The remainder is 1       Because -15    - 2 x (-8)=1
           0  o     .....  The remlainder is 2                   Over
   Hence, '-15' (the decimal system) is equal to '21' (the negative base 'b =
   -8' system).
 5 In one example embodiment, the process of converting decimal number 8 to a
   negative base number with a base b of -2 is shown as follows:
          8         -2
       -4       -         The remainder  is 0    Because 8 - (-4) x (-2)=O
          2     -         The remainder  is 0    Because (-4) - 2 x (-2)=O
       -1       -         The remainder  is 0
          1     -         The remainder  is 1
          0  o    .....   The remainder  is 1                 Over
   Hence, '8' (the decimal system) is equal to '11000' (the negative base 'b =
   -2' system).
10
   In one example embodiment, the process of converting decimal number 8 to a
   negative base number with a base b of -8 is shown as follows:
         8         -8
       -1       -         The remainder is 0     Because 8 - (-1) x (-8)=O
          1 -             The remainder is 7
         0 o .....        The remainder is 1                  Over
   Hence, '8' (the decimal system) is equal to '170' (the negative base 'b = -8'
15 system).

10
   By way of example, the multimedia information to be transmitted by the
   computer system is one or more images. As an example, in a two
   dimensional space, a grey-scale image is divided into a plurality of blocks
   each corresponding to a pixel. The pixels form a two-dimensional (2D) matrix.
15 The 2D matrix is linearized to obtain a linearized sequence in a one
   dimensional space that is further converted into a binary sequence. FIG. 5A,
   FIG. 5B, FIG. 5C, FIG. 5D, FIG. 5E, and FIG. 5F show a number of
   linearization schemes 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, and 560, respectively. For
   each scheme, a linearized
20 sequence is obtained by starting from the upper left and running along the
   broken line as shown across each pixel or pixel block.
   In an example embodiment, the multimedia information is a color image. The
   color image is divided or partitioned into three components (e.g., Red (R),
25 Green (G) and Blue (B)) by dimension-reduction treatment, and then each
   component is linearized such that three linearized sequences are
   obtained corresponding to the three components respectively.
   FIG. 6A shows a binary image 610 in accordance with an example
30 embodiment.
   FIG. 6B shows a binary sequence 620 of the binary image of FIG. 6A in
   accordance with an example embodiment.
                                           14

   As shown by FIG. 6A, the binary image 610 includes 8X8 pixels. If the
   linearization scheme in FIG. 5A is selected, then the binary sequence of the
   binary image 610 is '00011000 00111100 01100110 11000011 11000011
   11111111 11000011 11000011', as shown in FIG. 6B. The binary sequence
 5 corresponds to decimal number 1746383746505884611. Based on the
   algorithm shown in FIG. 4. The decimal number 1746383746505884611 can
   be further converted to a negative-base number with a genitive base of -10.
   The negative-base number is '(2354424354506296791)(_10)'.
10 In another example embodiment, the linearization scheme in FIG. 5C is
   selected. The binary sequence of the binary image 610 is      '00011000
   0011111 1000011 111100011110 11111 00001 1111 1001 001 111 00000
   0'. The binary sequence corresponds to decimal number
   1747132531005690816. Based on the algorithm shown in FIG. 4. The
15 decimal number 1747132531005690816 can be further converted to a
   negative-base number with a genitive base of -10. The negative-base number
   is '(2353273549006490996)(_10)'.
   FIG. 7 shows a method executed by a computer system to improve security of
20 private information in accordance with an example embodiment.
   Block 710 states converting public information into a first binary sequence,
   and private information into a second binary sequence.
25 Consider an example in which a computer system includes a binary
   generator, a negative base generator, a receiver, an encryptor, and a
   decoder. The computer system transmits public information and private
   information to a receiver of the computer system. The binary generator
   converts the public information into a first binary sequence and private
30 information into a second binary sequence. The public and private information
   can be one or more Chinese characters, one or more English letters, and one
   or more images. As one example, the public information is a binary image that
                                           15

   is divided into a matrix of pixels each corresponding to one or more bits in the
   first binary sequence.
   Block 720 states converting the first binary sequence into a first negative-base
 5 number and the second binary sequence into a second negative-base number.
   In one example embodiment, the private information is a text that is converted
   into an American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). The
   ASCII is further converted into a binary sequence and further to a decimal
10 number with a base of 10. The decimal number is further converted to a
   negative-base number with a base of -2, -8, -10 or other negative numbers by
   a negative base generator, based on a converting algorithm as described in
   FIG. 4.
15 Block 730 states determining a key that represents a relationship between the
   first negative-base number of the public information and the second negative
   base number of the private information.
   By way of example, the encryptor of the computer system derives or
20 determines a key from the relationship between the negative-base number of
   the public information and the negative-base number the private information.
   For example, the key is predetermined by the encryptor of the computer
   system by a geometric operation between the public information and the
   private information, and the geometric operation is one of addition, subtraction,
25 multiplication, and division.
   Block 740 states sending the first negative-base number and the key to a
   receiver.
30 To improve the security of information delivery, the negative-base number of
   the private information is not transmitted from the sender to the receiver. As
   one example, the public information is a binary image and the private
   information is a text. The computer system hides the text from transmitting
   between the sender and the receiver of the computer system. The key that
                                            16

   indicates a relationship between the public information and the private
   information is transmitted, together with the negative-base number of the
   public information.
 5 Block 750 states retrieving a negative base and the second negative-base
   number based on the first negative-base number and the key.
   By way of example, the decoder of the computer system calculates the
   negative-base number based on the first negative-base number and the key.
10 For example, the first negative-base number is 2354424354506296791 and
   the key is 195698105455091038827, which is an addition operation of the first
   and second negative-base numbers. Then second negative-base number is
   retrieved by the decoder as 193343681100584742036 by substracting
   2354424354506296791 from 195698105455091038827.
15
   Block 760 states obtaining the second binary sequences based on the second
   negative-base numbers and the negative base.
   By way of example, the second negative-base number is first converted to a
20 decimal number. A decimal integer N can be written as:
                               p
                        N =       ni(-r(-(11)
                              i=O
   where each digit ni is a positive integer from 0 to r - 1. When the negative
   base number nynyinp-2 '''nino and the value of the negative base b are
   known, the corresponding decimal number N can be calculated by the
25 decoder of the computer system based on the above equation.
   By way of example, the decoder of the computer system stores a look-up
   table that stores the binary code for each decimal number. For example, the
   binary code for the decimal number 29410 is 111001011100010.
30
                                             17

   Block 770 states obtaining the private information based on the second binary
   sequence.
   By way of example, the private information is a text. The decoder of the
 5 computer system stores a look-up table that stores a plurality of binary codes
   each corresponding to a ASCII code, and stores the corresponding text for
   each ASCII code. For example, the ASCII code for binary sequence
   '1011000011000100 1100001111000101 1100110011011000
   1100011111111000' is 'BOC4 C3C5 CCD8 C7F8', and the text for the ASCII
10 code is 'Ai     L i'.
   The computer system transmits private information based on negative-base
   numbers. Hence, the process of converting the original information into
   negative-base numbers is a hiding process. If both the information based on
15 negative base and the selected negative base are known, the original
   information can be obtained. For example, P represents the public information
   and S represents the private information. An example hiding process performs
   the following functions:
         1)   Function M(x):x-*y represents the multimedia information to binary
20            sequence;
         2)   Function M -1(y):y-*x is the inverse process of M(x);
         3)   Function F(y) represents the binary sequence to the negative base
              representation;
         4)   Function F -1(y) is the inverse process of F(y);
25       5)   Function G is the relationship between two multimedia information.
   The hiding process performs the function M(x) for the public information P,
   then a binary sequence is obtained and noted as M(P)=yp. This binary
   sequence is converted to a negative-base number u1 by function F(yp). The
   same operations are used for the private information S whose negative-base
30 number is   U2. By performing a geometric operation between u1 and     U2, a key
   can be obtained. The receiver receives the key and can retrieves the private
   information based on the key.
                                             18

   FIG. 8 shows multimedia contents 800 in accordance with an example
   embodiment.
   In one example embodiment, 810, 820 and 830 are three multimedia
 5 contents. 812, 822, 832 are the negative-base numbers with a negative base
   of -10 for the three multimedia contents 810, 820 and 830, respectively. 810 is
   a binary image as a public information. 820 and 830 are private information.
   By way of example, when the negative base of -10 and the negative-base
10 number 812 of the binary image 810 are known to the decoder of the
   computer system, 822 can be retrieved based on key. The private information
   820 is then obtained based on 822. Further, the negative-base number 832 of
   the private information 830 can be obtained based on key2 and 822, or based
   on key5 and 812.
15
   In one example embodiment, the encryptor of the computer system
   determines key2 that represents a relationship between the negative-base
   number 822 of the private information 820 and the negative-base number 832
   of the private information 830. The receiver of the computer system receives
20 key2, and the decoder of the computer system retrieves the negative-base
   number 832 based on key2 and the negative-base number 822. The decoder
   further obtains a binary sequence that corresponds to the negative-base
   number 832 and further obtains the private information 830.
25 FIG.9 shows a computer system 900 in accordance with an example
   embodiment.
   The computer system 900 includes computer 910, computer 920, and a
   network 930. Computer 910 includes a binary generator 912, a negative base
30 generator 914, an encryptor 916, and a sender 918. Computer 920 includes a
   receiver 922 and a decoder 924. One or more elements in the computer
   system can communicate with each other through one or more networks 930.
   The computer system 900 securely transmits the private text between the
                                          19

   sender and the receiver of the computer system by encrypting a key into the
   private text.
   The networks 930 can include one or more of the internet, an intranet, an
 5 extranet, a cellular network, a local area network (LAN), a home area network
   (HAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a
   Bluetooth network, public and private networks, etc.
   In one example embodiment, the computer system transmits a private text
10 through a negative-base system with negative bases. The binary generator
   912 converts a binary image and the private text into binary sequences. As
   one example, the binary image is divided into a matrix of pixels each
   corresponding to one or more bits in a binary sequence. The private text is
   represented by an American Standard Code for Information Interchange
15 (ASCII), which can further be converted to a binary sequence.
   The negative base generator 914 converts the binary sequences into decimal
   numbers with a base of 10, and further converts the decimal numbers to
   negative-base numbers with a base of -2 or -10. For example, the private text
20 is first converted into an American Standard Code for Information Interchange
   (ASCII). Then the ASCII of the private text is converted into a decimal
   number. The negative base generator converts the decimal number to a
   negative-base number based on a converting algorithm as shown in FIG. 4.
25 The encryptor 916 derives or determines a key that represents a relationship
   between the negative-base number of the binary image and the negative
   base number the private text. As one example, the key is predetermined by
   the encryptor of the computer system by a geometric operation between the
   binary image and the private text. The geometric operation is one of addition,
30 subtraction, multiplication, and division. As one example, the encryptor further
   determines a second key that represents a relationship between the negative
   base number of the private text and another negative-base number of another
   private text.
                                            20

   The sender 918 sends the key and the negative-base number of the binary
   image to the receiver 922 of the computer system.
   The decoder 924 communicates with the receiver 922. The decoder 924
 5 calculates the negative-base number of the private text, based on the key and
   the first negative-base number. The decoder also retrieves a negative base
   from the negative base number of the binary image. The negative-base
   number of the binary image and the negative-base number of the private text
   have a same negative base. The decoder obtains the binary sequence based
10 on the calculated negative-base number and the negative base, and obtains
   the private text, based on the binary sequence of the private text.
   In one example embodiment, the decoder further retrieves a second negative
   base number of a second private text based on a second key that represents
15 a relationship between a first private text and the second private text. Based
   on the retrieved negative-base number of the second private text, a binary
   sequence of the second private text is obtained, which further leads to the
   content of the second private text.
20 As used herein, a "decimal number" is a mathematical notation that
   representing numbers with a base of 10 or with a base-ten positional numeral
   system.
   As used herein, a "negative-base number" is a mathematical notation that
25 representing numbers with a negative base.
   The methods and apparatus in accordance with example embodiments are
