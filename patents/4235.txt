Abstract
A fluid evacuation device is attachable to a hand-held instrument (104) to provide the hand-held
instrument with fluid evacuation capabilities. The fluid evacuation devices includes a nozzle, a
hose mount, and an evacuation hose (112). The nozzle has a receptacle that receives a portion
of a hand-held instrument therein. The distal end of the nozzle has an opening therein through
which fluid may be drawn into the nozzle. The fluid can pass through a flow region in the
nozzle. The hose mount extends from the nozzle and connects the hose to the nozzle. The hose
mount includes a passageway through which the fluid can pass from the flow region into the
evacuation hose.

ELECTROSURGICAL INSTRUMENT
BACKGROUND
 1. Technical Field
         This invention relates to electrosurgical instruments. More particularly, the
invention relates to electrosurgical instruments that facilitate the performance of various
procedures or reduce the amount of fatigue experienced by users performing the
procedures.
2. The Relevant Technology
        Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
        As is known to those skilled in the art, modern surgical techniques typically
employ radio frequency (RF) power to cut tissue and coagulate bleeding encountered in
performing surgical procedures. For a historical perspective and details of such
techniques, reference is made to United States Patent No. 4,936,842, issued to D'Amelio
et al, and entitled "Electroprobe Apparatus," the disclosure of which is incorporated by
this reference.
        As is known to those skilled in the medical arts, electrosurgery is widely used and
offers many advantages including the use of a single surgical instrument for both cutting
and coagulation. A monopolar electrosurgical generator system has an active electrode,
such as in the form of an electrosurgical instrument having a hand piece and a conductive
electrode or tip, which is applied by the surgeon to the patient at the surgical site to
perform surgery and a return electrode to connect the patient back to the generator.
        The electrode or tip of the electrosurgical instrument is small at the point of
contact with the patient to produce an RF current with a high current density in order to
produce a surgical effect of cutting or coagulating tissue. The return electrode carries the
same RF current provided to the electrode or tip of the electrosurgical instrument, thus
providing a path back to the electrosurgical generator.
        To make the electrical connection for the RF current between the electrosurgical
generator and the electrosurgical instrument, a cable having an electrically conductive
core extends from the electrosurgical generator to the electrosurgical instrument. The
cable may also include a cord with additional conductors. The cord provides a connection
for transmitting control signals from the electrosurgical instrument to the electrosurgical
generator. The control signals may be used to cause the generator to deliver RF currents
to the electrosurgical instrument for different cutting modes such as cut, coagulate, and
cut-coagulate blend.
        When an electrosurgical instrument is used for cutting or coagulation, smoke is
commonly produced. A surgeon or assistant uses a separate smoke evacuation device to
remove the smoke from the surgical field. Smoke evacuation devices commonly include a

                                              2
suction wand connected to a vacuum device via tubing. The surgeon or assistant holds the
suction wand close to the surgical site and the smoke is drawn into the suction wand and
through the tubing. However, using a smoke evacuation device separate from the
electrosurgical instrument is not ideal. Using a separate smoke evacuation device requires
additional hands and instruments near the surgical site, which can obscure the surgeon's
view of the surgical site and reduce the room available around the surgical site for the
surgeon to move.
        As a result, combination electrosurgical instrument and smoke evacuation devices
have been developed. These combination devices often include a hand piece that can
receive an electrode or tip in a distal end thereof for performing electrosurgical
procedures. The hand piece is connected to a generator via a power cable to convey RF
current to the electrode or tip. Additionally, a smoke evacuation hose is connected
between the hand piece and a vacuum to draw smoke away from the surgical site. In
some cases, the power cable runs through a portion of the smoke evacuation hose.
        The power cables and smoke evacuation hoses have certain flexibility and weight
characteristics that limit the ability of the physician during a surgical procedure. For
example, the weight/moment-arm effect and drag of the power cable and/or the smoke
evacuation hose as well as the connection location(s) of the power cable and/or smoke
evacuation hose to the electrosurgical instrument limit the physician's ability to
continually hold and use the electrosurgical instrument. The electrode or tip is received
within one end (distal end) of the hand piece (commonly referred to as a pencil) and the
power cable and/or smoke evacuation hose typically enter into the opposite end (proximal
end) of the hand piece. As the physician manipulates the electrosurgical instrument
during a surgical procedure, the weight of the power cable and/or smoke evacuation hose
continually pulls on the proximal end of the hand piece. More specifically, as the
physician moves his or her wrist or adjusts the orientation of the electrosurgical
instrument with his or her fingers so as to bring the electrode into contact with the
patient's tissue, the weight of the power cable and/or smoke evacuation hose resists the
physician's movement. The constant resistance or drag created by the power cable and/or
smoke evacuation hose can cause the physician to become fatigued during a surgical
procedure that requires extensive and continual use of the electrosurgical instrument.
        Additionally, many electrosurgical procedures are performed on very sensitive
parts of the body, such as on or around the eyes. When performing such procedures, the
physician must control the movements of the electrode with great precision and accuracy.
The resistance or drag created by the power cable and/or smoke evacuation hose can
make it more difficult for the physician to be as precise and accurate. For instance, when
moving the electrosurgical instrument to make a delicate incision, the physician must
accurately compensate for the resistance from the power cable and/or smoke evacuation
hose. If the physician overcompensates, an incision that is too deep or too long can result.
Alternatively, if the physician undercompensates, multiple passes may be required to
achieve the desired incision. Furthermore, the fatigue caused by the resistance from the
power cable and/or smoke evacuation hose can adversely affect the physician's ability to

                                               3
accurately compensate for the resistance from the power cable and/or smoke evacuation
hose.
        Furthermore, some existing combination electrosurgical instrument and smoke
evacuation devices include an extendable portion, typically in the form of an enclosed
tube, which can be selectively extended from the distal end of the hand piece. When the
extendable portion is extended, the device is able to reach deeper into a surgical site to
evacuate smoke. The extendable portion is typically slidably disposed within an internal
chamber in the hand piece. A seal is used between the extendable portion and the internal
chamber to prevent smoke from escaping the hand piece at the distal end. Similarly, a
seal is used at the proximal end of the hand piece, where the smoke evacuation hose is
connected to the internal chamber, to prevent smoke from escaping from the hand piece
at the proximal end. Thus, the internal channel acts as part of a flow conduit through
which the smoke is evacuated.
        Combination electrosurgical instrument and smoke evacuation devices that utilize
the foregoing internal chamber design have a number of drawbacks. For instance, this
arrangement usually increases the complexity of the hand piece design, assembly, and
physical size. By way of example, seals must be properly disposed in both the proximal
and distal ends of the hand piece in order to seal off the internal chamber and maintain
the vacuum pressure therein. Additionally, the ergonomics of the hand piece are also
hindered because the hand piece must remain linear to accommodate the extending
portion. Still further, the smoke evacuation hose must be connected at the proximal end
of the hand piece, which leads to the aforementioned undesirable resistance and moment
arm effects.
        The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any
disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above.
Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one exemplary technology area
where some embodiments described herein may be practiced.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         The present invention relates to hand-held instruments or hand pieces that
facilitate the performance of various procedures while reducing the amount of fatigue
experienced by users performing the procedures. In some embodiments a hand-held
instrument or hand piece is an electrosurgical instrument that holds an electrode tip in one
end thereof. The hand piece is connected to a utility conduit. In embodiments that include
an electrode tip, the utility conduit may include an electrical cable that is connected to an
electrosurgical generator. The utility conduit may also or alternatively include a
smoke/fluid evacuation hose that is connected to a vacuum device. Further, the utility
conduit may include other tubes, cables, or the like for conveying electrical signals,
smoke, fluid, and the like to or from the electrosurgical instrument. Still further, the hand
piece may include an extendable shaft that increases the reach of the operational
capabilities (e.g., electrical current delivery, smoke capture, etc.) of the device.
         In contrast to most electrosurgical instruments that have an electrical cable and/or
a smoke/fluid evacuation hose connected to a proximal end of the hand piece, the
electrosurgical instrument of the present invention provides for the utility conduit to be
connected to the hand piece at a distal end of the hand piece. Connecting the utility
conduit to the distal end of the hand piece reduces the resistance to the movement of the
electrosurgical instrument created by the weight/moment-arm effect and drag of the
utility conduit. The reduced resistance leads to less fatigue in the physician's hand and
arm during electrosurgery. In addition to connecting the utility conduit to the distal end of
the hand piece, the hand piece can be configured to allow the physician to adjust the
location at which the utility conduit exits the hand piece.

                                          6
The physician can, therefore, selectively adjust the utility conduit relative to the hand
piece in order to customize the electrosurgical instrument to the physician's liking.
         Referring to Figure 1, an exemplary environment is illustrated that provides
one operating environment for use of the present invention. In Figure 1, an
electrosurgical system 100 is illustrated, which includes a signal generator 102, an
electrosurgical instrument 104, and a return electrode 106. Generator 102, in one
embodiment, is an RF wave generator that produces RF electrical energy. Connected
to electrosurgical instrument       104 is a utility conduit     108. In the illustrated
embodiment, utility conduit 108 includes a cable 110 that communicates the RF
electrical energy from generator 102 to electrosurgical instrument 104. As also
illustrated, the present embodiment of utility conduit 108 also includes an evacuation
hose 112 that conveys smoke and/or fluid away from a surgical site.
         Generally, electrosurgical instrument 104 includes a hand piece or pencil 114
and an electrode tip 116. Electrosurgical instrument 104 communicates the RF
electrical energy to a patient to cut tissue and/or cauterize blood vessels of the
patient's body. Specifically, an electrical discharge is delivered from electrode tip 116
to the patient in order to cause heating of cellular matter of the patient that is in close
contact with electrode tip 116. The heating takes place at an appropriately high
temperature to      allow electrosurgical    instrument 104 to be used to perform
electrosurgery. Return electrode 106 and a cable 118 provide a return electrical path
to generator 102 for any excess charge that dissipates into surrounding tissue of the
patient's body.
         Illustrated in Figure 2 is an electrosurgical instrument 120 commonly used to
perform electrosurgical procedures and evacuate smoke from a surgical site.
Electrosurgical instrument 120 includes a hand piece 122 having a proximal end 124
and a distal end 126. An extendable evacuation tube 128 is selectively extendable
from distal end 126 and includes a channel extending therethrough. An electrode tip
130 is received within the distal end of the evacuation tube 128. A power cable 132
and an evacuation hose 134 are connected to electrosurgical instrument 120 at
proximal end 124. Cable 132 communicates electrical energy from an electrosurgical
generator to electrosurgical instrument 120. The electrical energy is passed through
electrode tip 130 and into a patient's tissue.
         Smoke resulting from the electrosurgical procedure is drawn into evacuation
tube 128, through an internal chamber in hand piece 122, and through evacuation hose

                                         7
134. A sufficient vacuum pressure must be maintained within hand piece 122 in order
to effectively evacuate smoke from the surgical site. Accordingly, the internal
chamber inside hand piece 122 is a closed chamber and is sealed off at each end.
More specifically, the interface between the internal chamber inside hand piece 122
and evacuation tube 128 is sealed. Similarly, the connection between evacuation hose
134 and the internal chamber is also sealed.
        Electrosurgical instruments, such as electrosurgical instrument 120, are
commonly referred to as electrosurgical pencils or pens because in use they are often
held in the same manner that a pencil or pen is held when writing. Figure 2 illustrates
one of the most common manners by which physicians hold electrosurgical
instruments during an electrosurgical procedure. As can be seen, hand piece 122 is
laid through the crook of the hand and is held in place by the middle finger and
thumb. The index finger is placed on top of hand piece 122 to further hold hand piece
122 in place as well as to activate input device 136.
        As noted elsewhere herein, the flexibility, weight/moment-arm, and drag
characteristics of cable 132 and evacuation hose 134 and the connection locations of
cable 130 and evacuation hose 134 to hand piece 122 limit the ability of the physician
during a surgical procedure. While holding electrosurgical instrument 120 as shown in
Figure 2, a physician will perform electrosurgery by activating input device 136 and
moving electrode tip 130 into contact with the patient's tissue. To make contact
between electrode tip 130 and the patient's tissue, the physician will move his or her
wrist or fingers to adjust the position and/or orientation of electrosurgical instrument
120.
        For instance, the physician may move his or her wrist or finders so that
electrode tip 130 moves in the direction of arrow A toward the patient's tissue.
Notably, as the physician moves electrode tip 130 in the direction of arrow A,
proximal end 124 moves in the direction of arrow B. The weight of cable 132 and
evacuation hose 134 constantly pulls proximal end 124 in the direction of arrow C.
Thus, the weight of cable 132 and evacuation hose 134 resists the movement of
proximal end 124 in the direction of arrow B.
        The resistance created by the weight of cable 132 and evacuation hose 134 is
accentuated by the location at which cable 132 and evacuation hose 134 are connected
to hand piece 122. As is understood, a torque is created by applying a force at a
distance from a pivot point. The magnitude of the torque is a result of the magnitude

                                         8
of the applied force and the distance between the pivot point and the location where
the force is applied. In the case of electrosurgical instrument 120, the weight of cable
132 and evacuation hose 134 is the force that contributes to the generation of the
resistive torque. Additionally, the location at which cable 132 and evacuation hose
134 attach to hand piece 122 and how hand piece 122 is held creates the lever arm
through which the weight of cable 132 and evacuation hose 134 works to create the
torque. More specifically, cable 132 and evacuation hose 134 enter or are connected
to hand piece 122 at or near proximal end 124. When electrosurgical instrument 120
is held as shown in Figure 2, proximal end 124 is positioned above and away from the
crook of the physician's hand, which acts as the pivot point. The weight of cable 132
and evacuation hose 134 pulls down on proximal end 124, thereby creating a torque
or moment-arm. Because the magnitude of the torque is dependent on the distance
between the pivot point and the force, the greater the distance is between the crook of
the hand and the connection point (i.e., between hand piece 122 and the ends of cable
132 and evacuation hose 134), the greater the torque will be. Understandably, the
larger the torque is, the greater amount of resistance the physician will experience
when manipulating electrosurgical instrument 120.
         To overcome the resistance created by the weight of cable 132 and evacuation
hose 134, the physician must exert additional energy to move electrosurgical
instrument 120 into the desired orientation. Continuously working against the
resistance created by cable 132 and evacuation hose 134 can cause the physician's
hand, wrist, and/or arm to become fatigued during an electrosurgical procedure. This
fatigue can also lead to a loss of accuracy and precision in the performance of the
procedure.
         Attention is now directed to Figures 3-12, which illustrate hand pieces
according exemplary embodiments of the present invention. More specifically, the
illustrated hand pieces are electrosurgical instruments that reduce the resistance
created by electrical cables and/or evacuation hoses, and/or provide increased reach
for operational capabilities (e.g., electrical current delivery, smoke/fluid evacuation,
etc.). The embodiments shown in Figures 3-12 include an extendable shaft that is
selectively extendable from the hand piece to increase the reach of the electrical
current delivery and/or smoke/fluid evacuation capabilities. The term "extendable
shaft" is used herein to broadly refer to any structure capable of performing the
functions described herein in connection with an extendable shaft.             Thus, an

                                         9
extendable shaft may include one or more extendable rods, rails, channels, or the like.
Additionally, the extendable shaft may be solid, hollow, or have various cross
sectional shapes (e.g., U- or C-shaped cross-section). Furthermore, the distal end of
the extendable shaft may include an electrode tip mounted therein for delivery of
electrical current to patient tissue. The distal end of the extendable shaft may also
include a nozzle into which the smoke and/or fluid is drawn.
        As also shown in the Figures, a utility conduit is connected near the distal end
of the extendable shaft. A power cable of the utility conduit delivers electrical current
to the electrode tip while an evacuation hose of the utility conduit is in fluid
communication with the nozzle to convey away the smoke and/or fluid. In addition to
the utility conduit being connected near the distal end of the extendable shaft, the
utility conduit can also exit the electrosurgical instruments from various locations
along the length of the hand piece, referred to hereinafter as the "exit locations."
Allowing a user to select and adjust the exit location of the utility conduit enables the
user to customize the electrosurgical instrument to his or her liking, such as to reduce
or eliminate the resistance created by the weight of the utility conduit, which can
reduce the fatigue experienced during an electrosurgical procedure.
        For example, Figures 3-9 illustrate one exemplary embodiment of an
electrosurgical instrument 150 according to the present invention. Electrosurgical
instrument 150 includes a hand piece 152 having a proximal end 154 and a distal end
156. An extendable shaft 158 is movably disposed within hand piece 152. Extendable
shaft 158 is usable to increase the reach of electrosurgical instrument 150 to perform
electrosurgical procedures and/or evacuate smoke/fluid from a surgical site.
        Extendable shaft 158 is movable relative to hand piece 152 between a fully
retracted position and a fully extended position. The fully retracted position of
extendable shaft 158 is shown in Figure 3 and the fully extended position is shown in
Figure 4. According to the illustrated embodiment, most of extendable shaft 158 is
disposed inside of hand piece 152 when extendable shaft 158 is in the fully retracted
position. Nevertheless, as can be seen in Figure 3, at least a portion of extendable
shaft 158 extends out of distal end 156 and is disposed outside of hand piece 152
when extendable shaft 158 is in the fully retracted position. In other embodiments,
however, extendable shaft 158 is disposed entirely within hand piece 152 when
extendable shaft 158 is in the fully retracted position.

                                       10
        Extendable shaft 158 is selectively movable from the fully retracted position
shown in Figure 3 to the fully extended position shown in Figure 4. In the illustrated
embodiment, extendable shaft 158 is slidable relative to hand piece 152 such that
extendable shaft 158 can be selectively slid between the fully retracted and fully
extended positions.
        In some embodiments, including the illustrated embodiment, extendable shaft
158 is also movable between one or more intermediate positions. In the one or more
intermediate positions, extendable shaft 158 extends out of hand piece 152 further
than when extendable shaft 158 is in the fully retracted position, but not as far as
when extendable shaft 158 is in the fully extended position.
        In the illustrated embodiment, extendable shaft 158 is selectively securable in
each of the fully retracted, the fully extended, and the one or more intermediate
positions. Extendable shaft 158 includes a proximal end 160 (Figures 6-7B) and a
distal end 162. Disposed along the length of extendable shaft 158 between proximal
and distal ends 160, 162 are a plurality of recesses 164 (Figure 4). Disposed on an
interior surface of hand piece 152 near distal end 156 are one or more protrusions 166
(Figure 8). Recesses 164 and the one or more protrusions 166 cooperate to selectively
secure extendable shaft 158 in each of the fully retracted, the fully extended, and the
one or more intermediate positions.
        For instance, when extendable shaft 158 is in the fully retracted position
shown in Figure 3, the one or more protrusions 166 may extend into one or more
recesses 164 disposed adjacent to distal end 162 of extendable shaft 158, thereby
securing extendable shaft 158 in the fully retracted position.         Similarly, when
extendable shaft 158 is in the fully extended position shown in Figure 4, the one or
more protrusions 166 may extend into one or more recesses 164 disposed adjacent to
proximal end 160 of extendable shaft 158, thereby securing extendable shaft 158 in
the fully extended position. Likewise, when extendable shaft 158 is in one of the one
or more intermediate positions, the one or more protrusions 166 may extend into one
or more recesses 164 disposed between proximal and distal ends 160, 162 of
extendable shaft 158, thereby securing extendable shaft 158 in one of the one or more
intermediate positions.
        It is understood that the illustrated recesses and protrusions are merely
exemplary. In other embodiments, for instance, an extendable shaft may have a
plurality of protrusions disposed along the length thereof and one or more recesses

                                       11
may be formed on an interior surface of a hand piece.             As with the illustrated
embodiment, such recesses and protrusions may cooperate to selectively secure the
extendable shaft in various discrete positions (e.g., fully retracted, fully extended, one
or more intermediate positions) relative to the hand piece.
        The recesses 164 and protrusions 166 may be selectively disengaged from one
other to enable extendable shaft 158 to be moved between the fully retracted, the fully
extended, and the one or more intermediate positions. For instance, extendable shaft
158 may be compressed adjacent to distal end 156 to disengage protrusions 166 from
recesses 164. As shown in Figures 4 and 6, for instance, extendable shaft 158 may
optionally include depression areas 168 where extendable shaft 158 may be
compressed to disengage protrusions 166 from recesses 164. Depression areas 168
may provide a visual and/or tactile indication to a user as to where extendable shaft
158 may be compressed in order to disengage protrusions 166 from recesses 164.
        To facilitate the compression of extendable shaft 158, a slot 170 is formed
therein, as can be seen in Figures 5 and 6.      Slot 170 extends along the length of
extendable shaft 158 from proximal end 160 toward distal end 162. Slot 170 enables
the sides of extendable shaft 158 to be compressed closer together, which enables
protrusions 166 to be disengaged from recesses 164. Thus, a user may selectively
adjust how far extendable shaft 158 extends from hand piece 152 by first compressing
the sides of extendable shaft 158 (e.g., at the depression areas 168 adjacent to distal
end 156 of hand piece 152) to disengage protrusions 166 from recesses 164. With
protrusions 166 disengaged from recesses 164, the user may slide extendable shaft
158 relative to hand piece 152 so that extendable shaft 158 is positioned in the fully
retracted, the fully extended, or one of the one or more intermediate positions. When
extendable shaft 158 is in the desired position, protrusions 166 may engage recesses
164 to secure extendable shaft 158 in the desired position.
        In the illustrated embodiment as shown in Figure 5, hand piece 152 has a
generally circular interior surface and extendable shaft 158 has a generally circular
exterior surface.    Such corresponding surfaces may allow for relative rotational
movement between hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158. While this may be
desirable in some instances, it may be less desirable in other instances. Accordingly,
hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 may include cooperating features to prevent
relative rotation therebetween during use or when extendable shaft 158 is being
repositioned between the retracted, extended, and intermediate positions.

                                        12
        For instance, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, extendable shaft 158 includes one
or more tracks 172 and hand piece 152 includes one or more rails 174. Tracks 172
may take the form of one or more grooves formed in an exterior surface of extendable
shaft 158. Tracks 172 may extend along at least a portion of the length of extendable
shaft 158. Rails 174 are formed or otherwise disposed on an interior surface of hand
piece 152. Tracks 172 receive rails 174 therein. Tracks 172 and rails 174 cooperate
to enable extendable shaft 158 to slide longitudinally relative to hand piece 152 while
also preventing hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 from rotating relative to one
another. In other embodiments, a hand piece and an extendable shaft may include
non-circular    interfacing  surfaces   that  prevent   relative   rotational  movement
therebetween.
        Connected to distal end 162 of extendable shaft 158 is a collet 176 and a
nozzle 178. As shown in Figures 7A and 7B, for example, collet 176 is mounted
partially within distal end 162 of extendable shaft 158 and nozzle 178 is mounted on
collet 176. As best seen in Figures 5 and 8, collet 176 includes a mount 180 for
receiving the shaft of an electrode tip 182 therein. Collet 176 is configured to deliver
electrical current to electrode tip 182 upon activation of one of input devices 184 on
hand piece 152.
        As shown in Figures 7A and 7B, input devices 184 are in electrical
communication with collet 176 by way of a flexible electrical ribbon 185. When one
of input devices 184 is activated, a signal is sent via electrical ribbon 185 that allows
electrical current to flow through collet 176 and into electrode tip 182.          When
electrode tip 182 is in close proximity to patient tissue, the electrical current is
transferred to the patient tissue to perform an electrosurgical procedure. In contrast,
when input devices 184 are not activated, electrical current does not flow to electrode
tip 182, thereby preventing the performance of an electrosurgical procedure.
        In the illustrated embodiment, electrical ribbon 185 is connected between
input devices 184 and collet 176. As seen in Figures 7A and 7B, a first portion of
electrical ribbon 185 is disposed between hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158,
and a second portion of electrical ribbon 185 is disposed inside of extendable shaft
158.    The first portion of electrical ribbon 185 extends from input devices 184
towards proximal end 154 of hand piece 152.            After extending proximally past
proximal end 160 of extendable shaft 158, electrical ribbon 185 extends around

                                        13
proximal end 160 and inside extendable shaft 158. The second portion of electrical
ribbon 185 then extends distally toward collet 176.
         The electrical current used to perform electrosurgical procedures is delivered
to hand piece 152 by way of a utility conduit 186. In the illustrated embodiment,
utility conduit 186 includes a power cable 188 and an evacuation hose 190. Power
cable 188 delivers the electrical current used to perform electrosurgical procedures
from a signal generator (e.g., signal generator 102, Figure 1) to hand piece 152.
Power cable 188 may be connected to input devices 184, electrical ribbon 185, collet
176, or combinations thereof
         The performance of electrosurgical procedures often results in the creation of
smoke at the surgical site. The smoke can be removed from the surgical site by way
of electrosurgical instrument 150. More specifically, the smoke may be drawn into
nozzle 178 and conveyed away via evacuation hose 190.                In the illustrated
embodiment, one end of evacuation hose 190 is connected to distal end 162 of
extendable shaft 158 and is in fluid communication with nozzle 178. A second end of
evacuation hose 190 may be connected to a vacuum device that draws the smoke (or
other fluids) into nozzle 178, through evacuation hose 190, and away from the
surgical site. Power cable 188 or another cable may connect hand piece 152 to the
vacuum device so that hand piece 152 may control the operation of the vacuum
device.
         The connection between utility conduit 186 and distal end 162 may allow for
relative movement between electrosurgical instrument 150 and utility conduit 186.
For instance, a swivel may be connected between distal end 162 and utility conduit
186. The swivel may allow for electrosurgical instrument 150 to rotate relative to
utility conduit 186 or vice versa. Such relative movement may reduce or eliminate
longitudinal rotational torque of electrosurgical instrument 150 by utility conduit 186.
         In addition or as an alternative to electrosurgical instrument 150 and utility
conduit 186 being movably connected together (e.g., with a swivel), utility conduit
186 may include two or more sections that are connected together in a manner that
allows for relative movement between adjacent sections. For instance, as shown in
the Figure 9, utility conduit 186 may include a first section 187A and a second section
187B that are connected together via a swivel 189. Swivel 189 may include a first
half and a second half that are able to rotate relative to one another. First section
187A may be connected to the first half of swivel 189 and second section 187B may

                                         14
be connected to the second half of swivel 189. The ability of the first and second
halves of swivel 189 to rotate relative to one another enables first and second sections
187A, 187B of utility conduit 186 to also rotate relative to one another. As a result,
electrosurgical instrument 150 and first section 187A are able to move and rotate
relative to second section 187B with less longitudinal rotational torque.
        In the illustrated embodiment, power cable 188 is shown extending through
the interior of evacuation hose 190 for a length thereof and exiting evacuation hose
190 proximal to hand piece 152. It is understood that this arrangement is merely
exemplary. In other embodiments, for instance, power cable 190 may extend through
the entire length of evacuation hose 190. Alternatively, power cable 190 may not
extend through evacuation hose 190 at all. Additionally, although utility conduit 186
is described herein as including both power cable 188 and evacuation hose 190, such
configuration is merely exemplary. In other embodiments, a utility conduit may only
include a power cable. In still other embodiments, a utility conduit may only include
an evacuation hose. In still other embodiments, a utility conduit may include one or
more cables and/or one or more hoses.
        According to the present embodiment, utility conduit 186 is connected to
distal end 162 of extendable shaft 158. As a result, when extendable shaft 158 is
moved between the fully retracted position and the fully extended position, utility
conduit 186 moves through or relative to hand piece 152.             For instance, when
extendable shaft 158 is moved distally from the fully retracted position to the fully
extended position or one of the intermediate positions, utility conduit 186 also moves
distally through hand piece 152.       Similarly, when extendable shaft 158 is moved
proximally (e.g., from the fully extended position to the fully retracted position or one
of the intermediate positions, or from one of the intermediate positions to the fully
retracted position), utility conduit 186 also moves proximally through hand piece 152.
        As shown in Figure 7A, for instance, when extendable shaft 158 is in the fully
retracted position, the distal end of utility conduit 186 is positioned adjacent to distal
end 156 of hand piece 152. When extendable shaft 158 is moved distally to the fully
extended position shown in Figure 7B, utility conduit 186 is also moved distally so
that the distal end of utility conduit 186 is spaced distally away from distal end 156 of
hand piece 152.
        As best seen in Figures 5 and 6, hand piece 152 includes a slot 192 that
extends along the length of hand piece 152 from proximal end 154 to a retainer

                                        15
portion 194 at or near distal end 156. Slot 170 in extendable shaft 158 and slot 192 in
hand piece 152 are aligned with one another. The alignment of slots 170, 192 enables
utility conduit 186 to exit electrosurgical instrument 150 at various exit locations
along the length of hand piece 152. That is, while utility conduit 186 is connected to
distal end 162 of extendable shaft 158, a portion of utility conduit 186 can be
positioned within extendable shaft 158 and hand piece 152 so that utility conduit 186
exits or extends from hand piece 152 at any one of a number of locations along the
length of hand piece 152, whether adjacent to or distant from distal end 156 of hand
piece 152.
         Slots 170, 192 are sized to selectively receive and retain at least a portion of
utility conduit 186 within hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158. That is, slots 170,
192 are sized to snuggly retain utility conduit 186 within hand piece 152 and
extendable shaft 158 so that utility conduit 186 does not inadvertently come out of
slots 170, 192 while electrosurgical instrument 150 is being used. Nevertheless, slots
170, 192 are also sized to allow at least a portion of utility conduit 186 to be
selectively removed from hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 therethrough.
         As a result of the size and configuration of slot 192, hand piece 152 is
substantially hollow between distal end 156 and proximal end 154. For instance, in
some embodiments, hand piece 152 is at least 70% hollow.            More specifically, in
some embodiments, slot 192 reduces the overall volume of hand piece 152 by more
than 70%. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, hand piece 152 has a width
between opposing side surfaces of about 0.65 inches and slot 192 has a width of about
0.55 inches. Accordingly, the ratio between the widths of hand piece 152 and slot 192
is about 0.85, resulting in hand piece 152 being about 85% hollow.              It will be
appreciated, however, that the foregoing percentages and ratios are merely exemplary.
By way of non-limiting example, a hand piece may be substantially hollow if the ratio
between the width of the hand piece and the width of the longitudinal channel is
greater than about 25%, about 40%, about 50%, or about 75%.
         Slots 170, 192 allow a user to select the exit location of utility conduit 186 by
positioning differing lengths of utility conduit 186 within hand piece 152 and
extendable shaft 158. For instance, as shown in Figures 6, 7A, 7B, and 9, a user may
position utility conduit 186 in hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 so that utility
conduit 186 exits hand piece 152 through proximal end 154, similar to conventional
electrosurgical and smoke evacuation instruments. Alternatively, less of utility

                                        16
conduit 186 may be positioned within hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 so that
utility conduit 186 exits hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 through one or both
of slots 170, 192.
         Figures 6, 7A, 7B, and 9 illustrate utility conduit 186 exiting from various
example exit locations along the length of hand piece 152.         For instance, utility
conduit 186A may exit through slots 170, 192 below input devices 184. As shown in
Figure 9, when utility conduit 186A exits electrosurgical instrument 150 at this
location and a user holds electrosurgical instrument 150, utility conduit 186A may be
positioned in the palm of the user's hand. As a result, the user may grasp utility
conduit 186A by wrapping some or all of his or her fingers around utility conduit
186A. While grasping utility conduit 186A, the user may also hold hand piece 152 as
shown in Figure 9 (e.g., between the thumb and middle finger, with the index finger
on top to control input devices 184). In this arrangement, utility conduit 186A may
act as a handle for electrosurgical instrument 150. Additionally, utility conduit 186A
may be formed to provide stability to electrosurgical instrument 150. For instance,
utility conduit 186A may be formed of or include a tubing that is stiff enough to
maintain the position or orientation of hand piece 152 when utility conduit 186A is
used as a handle. More specifically, utility conduit 186A may be stiff enough so that
utility conduit 186A maintains hand piece 152 in its current position even when a
physician lets go of hand piece 152 and is only holding utility conduit 186A.
Furthermore, utility conduit 186A may be sized to comfortably fit within a user's
hand and allow for the user to securely hold utility conduit 186A.
         To provide the above noted stability and grip functionalities, a utility conduit
may have an outer diameter of between about 0.1 inches and about 3 inches. In one
example embodiment, a utility conduit has an outer diameter of about 0.5 inches. A
utility conduit may also have some elastic flexibility that contributes to the above
noted functionality. For instance, a utility conduit may be formed to allow for the
utility conduit to be angled or bent without collapsing or significantly reducing the
inner lumen or flow channel therein. By way of example, the material used to form
the utility conduit may allow the utility conduit to have a bend radius of between
about 0' and about 1800. In the case of a utility conduit with a bend radius of about
1800, a swivel may be connected between the utility conduit and the hand piece to
allow the utility conduit to extend away from the hand piece as shown in the Figures.

                                        17
In other embodiments, all or portions of a utility conduit may be segmented and
joined together to provide a moving joint flexibility.
         Utility conduit 186 may also exit from other exit locations along the length of
hand piece 152. For instance, as shown in Figures 6 and 7B, utility conduit 186B is
shown exiting hand piece 152 through slot 192. As shown in Figure 9, this exit
location for utility conduit 186B may be near the crook of the user's hand so that
utility conduit 186B extends down the crook of the hand towards the wrist. Still
further, utility conduit 186C may exit hand piece 152 at a location even closer to
proximal end 154, as shown in Figures 6, 7A, 7B, and 9.
         Slots 170, 192 are configured to allow a user to select substantially any
location along the length of hand piece 152 as an exit location. For instance, a user
with a larger hand may desire utility conduit 186 to exit closer to proximal end 154.
This can be accomplished by simply positioning more of utility conduit 186 within
hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 so that the exit location of utility conduit 186
is closer to proximal end 154. Alternatively, a user with a smaller hand may desire
utility conduit 186 to exit closer to distal end 156. This can be accomplished by
positioning a shorter length of utility conduit 186 within hand piece 152. Thus, slots
 170, 192 allow a user to customize instrument 150 so that instrument 150 is most
comfortable to that user and reduces the resistance and fatigue caused by the weight
of utility conduit 186.
         As noted herein, a cable or hose that exits from a proximal end of a hand piece
creates resistance, typically in the form of a torque, to the movement of the hand
piece. Thus, when a user manipulates the hand piece, either to move the hand piece to
a new location or to reorient the hand piece within the same general location, the
cable or hose resists the movement or reorientation of the hand piece. Accordingly,
allowing the exit location of utility conduit 186 to be adjusted along the length of
hand piece 152 reduces the amount of resistance typically created by the cable or
hose.
         In addition to reducing the overall resistance typically created by a cable or
hose, moving the exit location of utility conduit 186 closer to the distal end of hand
piece 152 also reduces the change is resistance experienced when moving or
reorienting hand piece 152.       As a hand piece 152 is moved or reoriented, the
resistance created by a cable or hose changes. While the change in resistance may be
due at least in part to the direction of movement or reorientation and/or the speed of

                                         18
the movement, the change in resistance is primarily due to the exit location of the
cable or hose. As discussed herein, the increased distance between the exit location
and the pivot point of the hand piece creates a larger torque. As a result, when the
exit location of the cable or hose is at or near the proximal end of the hand piece, the
change in resistance during movement or reorientation of the hand piece is greater
than the change in resistance created when the exit location is closer to the distal end
of the hand piece.
         With reference to Figure 9, for instance, when utility conduit 186 extends out
of proximal end 154 of hand piece 252, utility conduit 186 creates resistance to the
movement of hand piece 152. Additionally, as hand piece 152 is moved or reoriented,
the resistance created by utility conduit 186 changes. When utility conduit 186 exits
hand piece 152 from a location closer to the distal end 156 of hand piece 152, the
resistance created by utility conduit 186 is reduced.       Additionally, the change in
resistance created by utility conduit 186 when hand piece 152 is moved or reoriented
is also reduced as the exit location of utility conduit 186 moves toward the distal end
156 of hand piece 152. When utility conduit 186 exits near the distal end 156 of hand
piece 152 (e.g., as illustrated by utility conduit 186A), the resistance and change in
resistance created by utility conduit 186 falls dramatically. In such arrangements, the
resistance and change in resistance may drop to near zero or at least negligible levels.
         The following tables demonstrate that the amount of torque resulting from a
distally located exit location is significantly lower than when the exit location is
disposed at or near the proximal end of a hand piece. The torque resulting from the
cables and/or hoses connected to numerous hand pieces were measured. Specifically,
the torques associated with eleven different devices were measured at various heights
and at various orientations.    Devices 1-4 were standard electrosurgical instruments
that include power cables extending from the proximal ends of the hand pieces.
Devices 5-10 were electrosurgical instruments that include both power cables and
smoke evacuation hoses extending from the proximal ends of the hand pieces. The
torque associated with electrosurgical instrument 150 was also measured with utility
conduit 186 extending from two different exit locations. The first exit location was at
proximal end 154 as shown in Figure 7A. The second exit location was below user
inputs 184 as shown by utility conduit 186A in Figure 7A.
         Table 1 includes the torques associated with the eleven devices when the hand
pieces were in a level orientation (i.e., the proximal and distal ends of the hand pieces

                                                19
were at substantially the same height).              In contrast, Table 2 includes the torques
associated with the eleven devices when the hand pieces were held at a 450 angle with
the distal end of the hand piece being disposed lower than the proximal end.                   In
addition to measuring the torques when the devices were at different orientations, the
torques were also measured when the hand pieces were held at different heights (i.e.,
2.5 ft, 3 ft, 3.5 ft, and 4 ft).
          Tables 1 and 2 also include other basic information regarding each of the
evaluated devices.          This information includes the lengths of the hand pieces, the
masses of the hand piece and associated cables/hoses, and the distances between the
pivot points of the hand pieces and the ends of the hand pieces.                    To provide
consistency throughout the samples, the pivot point for each hand piece was
determined to be at the user input button positioned closest to the proximal end of the
hand piece.

          As can be seen from the data in Tables 1 and 2, the power cables for the
standard electrosurgical devices create torques ranging from 0.65 oz. in. to 3.5 oz. in.
in the horizontal orientation and from 0.7 oz. in. to 3.5 oz. in. in the angled
orientation.      Similarly, the power cables and hoses for Devices 5-10 create torques
ranging from 1.5 oz. in. to 7.5 oz. in. in both the horizontal and angled orientations. It
is observed that the torque for each device generally increases as the height of the
hand piece increases. This is understandable since the length, and thus the weight, of
the suspended portion of the power cable and/or evacuation hose increases as the
height of the hand piece increases.
          With regard to electrosurgical instrument 150, it is noted that the torque from
utility conduit 186 is significantly higher when utility conduit exits hand piece 152 at
proximal end 154 than when utility conduit 186 exits hand piece 152 near user inputs
184.     Specifically, when utility conduit exits hand piece 152 at proximal end 154,

                                        21
utility conduit 186 creates torques ranging from 5 oz. in. to 7 oz. in., depending on the
height of hand piece 152. In contrast, when utility conduit 186 exits hand piece 152
near user inputs 184, utility conduit 186 creates no torque, or negligible levels of
torque. Thus, by allowing the exit location of utility conduit 186 to be adjusted along
the length of hand piece 152, a user can customize electrosurgical instrument 150 to
provide torques ranging anywhere from about 0 oz. in. up to about 7 oz. in. or more.
         As can be seen in Figures 7A and 7B, depending on the position of extendable
shaft 158 relative to hand piece 152 and the exit location of utility conduit 168, utility
conduit 168 may pass through one or both of slots 170, 192. By way of example,
when extendable shaft 158 is in the fully retracted position shown in Figure 7A, utility
conduit 186 may pass through both of slots 170, 192 when exiting hand piece 152. In
contrast, when extendable shaft 158 is in the fully extended position shown in Figure
7B, utility conduit 186 may only pass through slot 192 when exiting hand piece 152.
For instance, utility conduits 186B, 186C are shown in Figure 7B passing through slot
192, but not through slot 170. Nevertheless, even when extendable shaft 158 is in the
fully extended position, utility conduit 186 may still pass through both of slots 170,
192, as illustrated in Figure 7B with utility conduit 186A passing through both of slots
170, 192.
         Additionally, utility conduit 186 may pass through different portions of slots
170, 192. The portions of slots 170, 192 through which utility conduit 186 passes
may or may not correspond to one another. For instance, when extendable shaft 158
is in the fully retracted position shown in Figure 7A, utility conduit 186 may pass
through corresponding portions of slots 170, 192 when exiting hand piece 152. More
specifically, as shown in Figure 7A, utility conduit 186A passes through the distal
ends of slots 170, 192. Similarly, utility conduit 186B passes through intermediate
portions of slots 170, 192 and utility conduit 186C passes through the proximal ends
of slots 170, 192.
         In contrast, when extendable shaft 158 is in the fully extended position shown
in Figure 7B, utility conduit 186 may pass through non-corresponding portions of
slots 170, 192 when exiting hand piece 152. For instance, as shown in Figure 7B,
utility conduit 186A passes through the proximal end of slot 170 and the distal end of
slot 192. In other instances, such as when extendable shaft 158 is in one of the one or
more intermediate positions, utility conduit 186 may pass through a proximal end of

                                         22
slot 170 and an intermediate portion of slot 192. Likewise, utility conduit 186 may
pass through an intermediate portion of slot 170 and the distal end of slot 192.
        Notably, by connecting utility conduit 186 adjacent distal end 162 of
extendable shaft 158, hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 do not include or act as
a smoke/fluid conveying conduit.        For instance, hand piece 152 does not have to
include a closed channel or other conduit that extends from distal end 156 to proximal
end 154 and that is sealed along its entire length. Similarly, extendable shaft 158 does
not have to include a closed channel or other conduit that extends from distal end 162
to proximal end 160 and that is sealed along its entire length.         Furthermore, the
interface between hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 does not have to be sealed.
        With a typical smoke evacuation device, a first seal is required between the
nozzle and a distal end of a conduit in the hand piece and a second seal is required
between a proximal end of the conduit in the hand piece and the smoke evacuation
hose. Furthermore, when an extendable tube is included, the interface between the
extendable tube and the conduit in the hand piece has to be sealed. Because utility
conduit 186 is connected and sealed adjacent to nozzle 178, a second seal is not
required between extendable shaft 158 and hand piece 152 or between proximal end
154 and utility conduit 186.
        Connecting utility conduit 186 near distal end 162 also provides a flow
channel that has a generally uniform diameter from distal end 162 to an associated
vacuum device. More specifically, the interior of utility conduit 186 provides a flow
channel through which smoke/fluids may be conveyed away from a surgical site.
Because utility conduit 186 has a generally uniform inner diameter throughout its
length, the flow channel from distal end 162 of extendable shaft 158 to an associated
vacuum device is generally uniform. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill
in the art, a generally uniform flow channel provides increased flow efficiency of the
smoke/fluid being conveyed away. In contrast, common smoke evacuation devices
include a flow channel through a hand piece and a smoke evacuation hose that have
different diameters, thereby reducing the flow efficiency therethrough.
        Slots 170, 192 may be generally straight and smooth to allow for utility
conduit 186 to exit hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 at substantially any
location along the length of hand piece 152. Accordingly, slots 170, 192 may allow
for the exit location of utility conduit 186 to be continuously variable. In other words,

                                         23
the exit location of utility conduit 186 may be selectively adjusted to substantially any
location along the length of hand piece 152.
         As can be seen in Figure 6, slots 170, 192 may also include one or more
cutouts that allow utility conduit 186 to exit hand piece 152 at one or more
predefined, discrete exit locations along the length of hand piece 152. For instance,
slot 192 includes a cutout 196 just proximal to retainer portion 194. Similarly, slot
170 includes multiple cutouts 198 at various positions along the length thereof which
can be aligned with cutout 196 (e.g., when extendable shaft 158 is extended or
retracted). Cutouts 196, 198 are wider than the rest of slots 170, 192 to allow utility
conduit 186 to exit hand piece 152 and extendable shaft 158 therethrough. Slot 192
may also include one or more additional cutouts at various positions along the length
thereof to provide multiple discrete exit locations along the length of hand piece 152.
         As can be seen in the Figures, at least a portion of utility conduit 186 may be
corrugated, convoluted, fluted, or have detents disposed on the outer surface thereof
The corrugation, flutes, or detents on utility conduit 186 may facilitate secure holding
of utility conduit 186 within slots 170, 190 and/or create one or more predefined,
discrete exit locations along the length of hand piece 152. More specifically, the exit
locations may be defined by the corrugations, convolutions, flutes, or detents on
utility conduit 186. It will be understood, however, that utility conduit 186 may not
be corrugated, convoluted, fluted, or include detents thereon.         Additionally, it is
understood that any combination of a utility conduit (corrugated, convoluted, fluted,
detented, or smooth) and slots (straight or with cutouts) may be used.
         As noted, a utility conduit may be formed from multiple sections.            The
sections of the utility conduit may have diameters and/or flexibility characteristics
that are difference from one another. For instance, a first section connected to the
hand piece may be relatively stiff to provide the above-noted stability and grip
functionalities.  In contrast, a second section connected to the first section may be
more flexible than the first section.
         As also noted herein, a utility conduit may be formed by one or more cables
and/or one or more hoses. Accordingly, the noted diameters and flexibilities may be a
result of multiple hoses, cables, and/or combinations thereof        For instance, two or
more hoses may have a combined diameter of between about 0.1 inches and about 3
inches.

                                        24
        Attention is now directed to Figures 10-12, which illustrate electrosurgical
instruments similar to electrosurgical instrument 150, but that include additional or
alternative features.    Accordingly, particularly attention will be directed to the
additional or alternative features, with the understanding that these features may
replace or be combined with the other features described herein.
        Figures 10-11 illustrate an electrosurgical instrument 200 that includes a hand
piece 202 and an extendable shaft 204 that is selectively extendable relative to hand
piece 202.    In contrast to extendable shaft 158, which is selectively securable in a
plurality of discrete positions, extendable shaft 204 is securable in an infinite number
of positions relative to hand piece 202. More specifically, extendable shaft 204 may
be secured relative to hand piece 202 in a fully retracted position (Figure 10), a fully
extended position (Figure 11), and an infinite number of positions therebetween. That
is, a user may position extendable shaft 204 at any position at or between the fully
retracted and fully extended positions and extendable shaft 204 can be secured in the
selected position.
        A locking nut 206 may be used to secure extendable shaft 204 in the desired
position relative to hand piece 202.     As can be seen, locking nut 206 is disposed
around extendable shaft 204.        Locking nut 206 can be selectively screwed or
otherwise attached onto the distal end of hand piece 202. When locking nut 206 is
screwed or otherwise attached onto hand piece 202, the radius of an internal bore in
locking nut 206 decreases.      The decreased radius of the bore in locking nut 206
increases the friction between locking nut 206 and extendable shaft 202, thereby
securing extendable shaft 202 in the desired position.
        Electrosurgical instrument 200 also includes a nozzle 208 disposed at the end
of extendable shaft 204. Disposed on the end of nozzle 208 is a light 210. Light 210
may be used during an electrosurgical procedure to illuminate the surgical site. Light
210 may be activated by input devices 212.
        Figure 12 illustrates a view of the distal end of an electrosurgical instrument
220. As can be seen, electrosurgical instrument 220 includes a hand piece 222 with a
nozzle 224 into which smoke/fluid can be drawn. Electrosurgical instrument 220 also
includes an electrode tip 226 mounted in the distal end thereof Unlike electrode tip
182 that is disposed within the flow channel of nozzle 178, electrode tip 226 is
mounted outside of the flow channel of nozzle 224. As a result, electrode tip 226
does not obstruct the flow channel of nozzle 224 at all.

                                        25
        For various reasons it can be beneficial to have electrode tip 226 generally
aligned with a longitudinal axis of electrosurgical instrument 220. For instance, when
a user rotates electrosurgical instrument 220 about the longitudinal axis, electrode tip
226 will rotate, but not revolve, around the axis.       As a result, the orientation of
electrode tip 226 may change, but not the location.
        In order to allow for electrode tip 226 to be aligned with the axis of
electrosurgical instrument 220 and to provide a large enough flow channel through
nozzle 224, the opening in nozzle 224 may wrap at least partially around electrode tip
226. For instance, as seen in Figure 12, the opening in nozzle 224 can be generally
kidney shaped, with the ends of the opening extending at least partially around
electrode tip 226.   It is understood, that the opening in nozzle 224 may take other
shapes without departing from the scope of the invention.
        While the embodiments disclosed herein have been directed to electrosurgical
instruments with adjustable utility conduits and extendable shafts, the present
invention is not intended to be limited only to electrosurgical instruments. Rather, the
present invention is broadly directed to any hand-held instrument that includes one or
more of the features described herein. Examples of such hand-held instruments may
include, but are not limited to, dental instruments (e.g., drills, polishing tools, scalers,
compressed air tools, suction tools, irrigation tools, carries detection tools, water
flossing tool (e.g., waterpik)), soldering tools (e.g., heated tools, smoke collection
tools, de-soldering tools), high speed grinding and polishing tools (e.g., Dremel tools,
carving tools,    manicure tools, dental lab grinders/polishers),          laser treatment
instruments,   laser   surgical  instruments,  light   probes,    suction    handles  (e.g.,
Yankauser), blasting tools (e.g., sandblast, gritblast), shockwave therapy tools,
ultrasonic therapy tools, ultrasonic probe tools, ultrasonic surgical tools, adhesive
application instruments, glue guns, pneumatic pipettes, welding tools, RF wrinkle
therapy hand pieces, phaco hand pieces, shears, shaver, or razor hand pieces, micro
drill hand pieces, vacuum hand pieces, small parts handling hand pieces, tattoo needle
handles, small torch hand pieces, electrology hand pieces, low speed grinding,
polishing and carving tools, permanent makeup hand pieces, electrical probe hand
pieces, ferromagnetic     surgical hand pieces, surgical suction instruments (e.g.,
liposuction cannulas), surgical suction cannulas, microdermabrasion hand pieces,
fiberoptic camera handles, microcamera hand pieces, pH probe hand pieces, fiberoptic
and LED light source hand pieces, hydrosurgery hand pieces, orthopedic shaver,

                                         26
cutter, burr hand pieces, wood burning tools, electric screwdrivers, electronic pad
styluses, and the like.
        Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to hand-held instruments that
allow for the adjustment of an exit location of a utility conduit therefrom. Rather, the
present invention also encompasses hand-held instruments that have a utility conduit
connected thereto and that extend therefrom at a location other than at the proximal
end of the hand-held instrument. For instance, the exit location of the utility conduit
may not be adjustable along the length of the hand-held instrument. Nevertheless, the
exit location of the utility conduit may be positioned at a location along the length of
the hand-held instrument that is away from the proximal end of the hand-held
instrument.
        Even more specifically, the hand-held instrument may have a central portion
disposed approximately midway between the proximal and distal ends of the
instrument. The exit location of the utility conduit may be positioned at about the
central portion of the hand-held instrument or between the central portion and the
distal end of the hand-held instrument. The hand-held instrument may also have a
three-quarter portion disposed approximately midway between the central portion and
the proximal end. In other words, approximately one quarter of the length of the
hand-held instrument is disposed between the proximal end and the three-quarter
portion, while three quarters of the length of the hand-held instrument are disposed
between the three-quarter portion and the distal end. The exit location of the utility
conduit may be positioned at about the three-quarter portion of the hand-held
instrument or between the three-quarter portion and the distal end of the hand-held
instrument.
        Still further, the present invention is not limited to hand-held instruments that
have extendable shafts for increasing the reach of operational capabilities of the
instrument. Rather, instruments according to the present invention may include
electrode tips and/or smoke/fluid capture features that are fixed relative to a hand
piece.    Likewise, instruments according to the present invention may provide
electrosurgical capabilities, but not smoke/fluid capture capabilities.       In contrast,
instruments according to the present invention may provide smoke/fluid capture
capabilities, but not electrosurgical capabilities.
        The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without
departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are
