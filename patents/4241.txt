                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         [00021     The present invention relates to the fields of medicine and cell biology. In
particular, the present invention relates to the encapsulation of cells derived from human
embryonic stem cells and other pluripotent human cells.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         100031     Human embryonic stem (hES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cells from adult differentiated cells are uniquely suited for cell therapy applications because
they are pluripotent and self-renewable. Owing to the large variety of cell types that can arise
in differentiating pluripotent stem cell cultures, success in achieving efficient, directed
differentiation is useful for therapeutic application of human pluripotent stem cells. Efficient
directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to various intermediate cell types
including pancreatic lineage cells using various growth and signaling factors and small
molecules is necessary.

 WO 2010/057039                                                          PCT/US2009/064459
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           [00041     Embodiments described herein relate to methods of producing insulin in a
 mammal by providing an implantable chamber into a host mammal, providing a pancreatic
 progenitor cell derived from human pluripotent stem cell (e.g., hES or iPS cells) to said
 chamber, maturing the pancreatic progenitor cell to a mature pancreatic hormone secreting
 cell, wherein the pancreatic hormone secreting cell is an insulin secreting cell which produces
 insulin in response to glucose stimulation in vivo, thereby producing insulin in vivo in the
 mammal.        In some embodiments, the chamber is implanted into the mammal prior to
 introducing the pancreatic progenitor cell. In other embodiments, the chamber is allowed to
 vascularize prior to introducing the pancreatic progenitor cell. In yet other embodiments, the
 cell is introduced into the chamber prior to implantation.
           [00051     One embodiment relates to a method for producing insulin in a mammal,
 comprising: (a) providing a human PDXl-positive pancreatic progenitor cell population into
 an implantable semi-permeable device; (b) maturing the cell population in said device to an
 islet, wherein the islet comprises endocrine and acinar cells, and wherein the endocrine cell is
 at least an insulin secreting cell which produces insulin in response to glucose stimulation in
vivo, thereby producing insulin in vivo to the mammal.
          [0006]      Another embodiment relates      to a cell encapsulating      assembly for
implanting a cell population into a mammalian host. In one aspect, the assembly comprises a
sealed periphery defining at least one chamber for encapsulating living cells.        In another
aspect, the assembly comprises a wall means having a peripheral edge, wherein the assembly
comprises a first seal at the peripheral edge of the wall means, thereby forming the
encapsulating assembly.        In some aspects, the assembly comprises a second seal which
effectively reduces the chamber volume.
          [00071      Another embodiment      relates to a cryopreserved      human pancreatic
progenitor cell population. In one aspect of the embodiment, the cell population is suitable
for transplantation into a mammal.
          [00081      Another embodiment relates to a method of obtaining a population of cells
suitable     for transplantation.   In one aspect of the embodiment,          cells suitable for
transplantation are obtained by a method comprising: a) contacting a population of human
                                                -2-

pancreatic progenitor cells with a cryopreservation solution to thereby obtain a population of
cells for cryopreservation; b) decreasing the temperature of the progenitor cells for
cryopreservation to about -196'C to obtain cryopreserved cells; and c) increasing the
temperature of the cryopreserved cells to thereby obtain a population of pancreatic progenitor
cells suitable for transplantation. In some embodiments the temperature of the progenitor
cells for cryopreservation is decreased to less than 00 C, -10 'C, -20 'C, -30 0C, -40 0C, -50 0C,

              DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
          100201     Embodiments described herein are directed to methods of producing
 insulin in vivo by implanting in a mammal human pancreatic progenitor cells derived from
 human embryonic stem         cells in encapsulating    devices,  including a bio-compatible
 polyethylene glycol-based device and a mechanical/medical device.
          100211     Unless otherwise noted, the terms used herein are to be understood
according to conventional usage by those of ordinary skill in the relevant art. In addition to
the definitions of terms provided below, definitions of common terms in molecular biology
may also be found in Rieger et al., 1991 Glossary of genetics: classical and molecular, 5th
Ed., Berlin: Springer-Verlag; and in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F.M. Ausubel et
al., Eds., Current Protocols, a joint venture between Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and
John Wiley & Sons, Inc., (1998 Supplement).        It is to be understood that as used in the
specification and in the claims, "a" or "an" can mean one or more, depending upon the
context in which it is used. Thus, for example, reference to "a cell" can mean that at least
one cell can be utilized.
         100221     Also, for the purposes of this specification and appended claims, unless
otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, percentages or
proportions of materials, reaction conditions, and other numerical values used in the
specification and claims, are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term
"about". Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in
the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending
upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least,

 and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the
 claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of
 reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.
          [00231     In one embodiment, hES-derived cells are encapsulated using a bio
 compatible polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG-based encapsulation is described in more detail
 in   U.S.   Patent   No.   7,427,415, entitled    IMPLANTATION         OF    ENCAPSULATED
 BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS FOR TREATING DISEASES; U.S. Patent No. 6,911,227,

 OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS, which is herein incorporated by reference in their
 entireties.
          [00241     In another embodiment, the encapsulating device is a TheraCyte device
 (Irvine, California). TheraCyte cell encapsulation devices are further described in U.S. Patent
Nos. 6,773,458;       6,156,305; 6,060,640;    5,964,804; 5,964,261;      5,882,354;   5,807,406;

 5,100,392; and 5,011,494, which are all herein incorporated in their entireties by reference in
their entireties.
          100251     In one embodiment, methods are described for producing hES cell
aggregate suspensions from a single cell suspension of pluripotent stem cell cultures or hES
derived cell cultures. The pluripotent stem cell can be initially cultured on fibroblast feeders,
or they can be feeder-free. Methods of isolating hESC and culturing such on human feeder
cells was described in U.S. Patent No. 7,432,104 entitled METHODS FOR THE CULTURE
OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS ON HUMAN FEEDER CELLS, which is herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety. Various methods for producing hES cell aggregate
suspension cultures and/or hES-derived cell aggregate suspension cultures are described in
detail   in U.S.    Application No.     12/264,760,    entitled STEM     CELL AGGREGATE

 WO 2010/057039                                                         PCT/US2009/064459
          100261     The differentiation culture conditions and hES-derived cell types described
 herein are substantially similar to that described in D'Amour et al. 2006, supra or those
 described in U.S. Patent No. 7,534,608; U.S. Patent Application Nos. 11/681,687, filed
 March 2, 2007; and 11/773,944, filed July 5, 2007 , the disclosures of which are incorporated
 herein by reference in their entireties.     D'Amour et al. describe a 5 step differentiation
 protocol: stage I (results in mostly definitive endoderm production), stage 2 (results in
 mostly PDXl-negative foregut endoderm production), stage 3 (results in mostly PDX1
 positive foregut endoderm production), stage 4 (results in mostly pancreatic endoderm or
 pancreatic   endocrine progenitor production) and stage 5 (results in mostly hormone
 expressing endocrine cell production).
          100271     As used herein, "definitive endoderm (DE)" refers to a multipotent
 endoderm lineage cell that can differentiate into cells of the gut tube or organs derived from
 the gut tube.   In accordance with certain embodiments, the definitive endoderm cells are
 mammalian cells, and in a preferred embodiment, the definitive endoderm cells are human
 cells. In some embodiments, definitive endoderm cells express or fail to significantly express
 certain markers.   In some embodiments, one or more markers selected from CER, FOZA2,
 SOX17, CXCR4, MIXL1, GATA4, HNF3-6, GSC, FGF17, VWF, CALCR, FOXQI,
 CMKOR1 and CRIPI are expressed in definitive endoderm cells. In other embodiments, one
or more markers selected from OCT4, a-fetoprotein (AFP), Thrombomodulin (TM), SPARC,
 SOX7 and HNF4-a are not significantly expressed in definitive endoderm cells. To be clear,
a definitive endoderm cell is distinguished from other endoderm-lineage cells, such as foregut
endoderm or gut endoderm or PDXI-negative foregut endoderm cells, which appreciably
express HNF4-a as compared to definitive endoderm. Definitive endoderm cell populations
and methods of production thereof are also described in U.S. Patent No. 7,510,876, entitled
DEFINITIVE ENDODERM, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety.
         [00281      Still other embodiments relate to cell cultures termed "PDXl-negative
foregut endoderm cells" or "foregut endoderm cells" or "gut endoderm" or equivalents
thereof. In some embodiments, the foregut endoderm cells express SOX 17, HNF 1-p, HNF4
a and FOXAl markers but do not substantially express PDXI, AFP, SOX7, SOXl. PDXI
negative foregut endoderm cell populations and methods of production thereof are also
                                                -6-

 WO 2010/057039                                                          PCT/US2009/064459
 described in U.S. Application Number 11/588,693, entitled PDX1-expressing dorsal and
 ventral foregut endoderm, filed October 27, 2006 which is incorporated herein by reference in
 its entirety.    Again, gut endoderm appreciably expresses HINF4-a as compared to the
 definitive endoderm cells, or Stage I cells; see Examples below.
           100291    Other embodiments described herein relate to cell cultures of '"PDXl
 positive, dorsally-biased, foregut endoderm cells", "PDX1-positive foregut endoderm cells",
 or "PDX1-positive endoderm" or equivalents thereof. In some embodiments, the PDX1
 positive foregut endoderm cells express PDX1, HiNF6, SOX 9 and PROX I markers but do
 not substantially express NKX6.1, PTF1A, CPA, cMYC, SOX17, HNF1B or HNF4alpa.
 PDX1-postive foregut endoderm cell populations and methods of production thereof are also
 described in U.S. Application Number 11/588,693, entitled PDX1-expressing dorsal and
 ventral foregut endoderm, filed October 27, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference
 in its entirety.
          [00301     Other embodiments described herein relate to cell cultures of "pancreatic
progenitors",     "PDXI-positive    pancreatic   endoderm  cells,"  "PDXI-positive    pancreatic
progenitor," "pancreatic epithelium", "PE" or equivalents thereof. PDX 1-positive pancreatic
progenitor cells are multipotent and can give rise to various cells in the pancreas including
but not limited to acinar, duct and endocrine cells. In some embodiments, the PDXI-positive
pancreatic progenitor cells express increased levels of PDX1 and NKX6.1 as compared to
non pre-pancreatic endoderm cells which do not appreciably express these markers. PDX1
positive pancreatic progenitor cells also express low to no levels of PTF1A, CPA, cMYC,
NGN3, PAX4, ARX and NKX2.2, INS, GCG, GHRL, SST, and PP.
          [00311     Alternatively, other embodiments relate to cell cultures of "PDXI-positive
pancreatic endoderm tip cells," or equivalents thereof. In some embodiments, the PDX1
positive pancreatic endoderm tip cells express increased levels of PDX1 and NKX6.1 similar
to PDX 1-positive pancreatic progenitor cells, but unlike PDX 1-positive pancreatic progenitor
cells, PDX1-positive pancreatic endoderm tip cells additionally express increased levels of
PTF1A, CPA and cMYC. PDXl-positive pancreatic endoderm tip cells also express low to
no levels of NGN3, PAX4, ARX and NKX2.2, INS, GCG, GHRL, SST, and PP.
                                                -7-

WO 2010/057039                                                          PCT/US2009/064459
         [00321     Other embodiments relate to cell cultures of "pancreatic endocrine
precursor cells," "pancreatic endocrine progenitor cells" or equivalents thereof. Pancreatic
 endocrine progenitor cells are multipotent and give rise to mature endocrine cells including
alpha, beta, delta and PP cells. In some embodiments, the pancreatic endocrine progenitor
cells express increased levels of NGN3, PAX4, ARX and NKX2.2 as compared to other non
endocrine progenitor cell types. Pancreatic progenitor cells also express low to no levels of
INS, GCG, GHRL, SST, and PP.
         [00331     Still other embodiments relate to cell cultures of "pancreatic endocrine
cells," "pancreatic hormone secreting cells", "pancreatic islet hormone-expressing cell," or
equivalents thereof refer to a cell, which has been derived from a pluripotent cell in vitro, e.g.
alpha, beta, delta and/or PP cells or combinations thereof. The endocrine cells can be poly
hormonal or singly-hormonal, e.g. expressing insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, somatostatin and
pancreatic polypeptide or combinations thereof. The endocrine cells can therefore express
one or more pancreatic hormones, which have at least some of the functions of a human
pancreatic islet cell. Pancreatic islet hormone-expressing cells can be mature or immature.
Immature pancreatic islet hormone-expressing cells can be distinguished from mature
pancreatic islet hormone-expressing cells based on the differential expression of certain
markers, or based on their functional capabilities, e.g., glucose responsiveness in vitro or in
vivo. Pancreatic endocrine cells also express low to no levels of NGN3, PAX 4, ARX and
NKX2.2.
         [0034]     Most of above cell types are epithelialized as compared to mesenchymal
definitive endoderm cells. In some embodiments, the pancreatic endoderm cells express one
or more markers selected from Table 3 and/or one or more markers selected from Table 4 of
related   U.S.  Application    11/588,693    entitled PDX1    EXPRESSING         DOSAL       AND

        [00351     In certain embodiments, the terms "enriched", "isolated", "separated",
"sorted", "purified" or purifying by depleting or equivalents thereof refer to a cell culture or a
cell population or cell sample that contains at least 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%,

         [00361      As used herein, the term "contacting" (i.e., contacting a cell e.g., a
differentiable cell, with a compound) is intended to include incubating the compound and the
cell together in vitro (e.g., adding the compound to cells in culture). The term "contacting" is
not intended to include the in vivo exposure of cells to a defined cell medium comprising an
ErbB3 ligand, and optionally, a member of the TGF-p family, that may occur naturally in a
subject (i.e., exposure that may occur as a result of a natural physiological process). The step
of contacting the cell with a defined cell medium comprising an ErbB3 ligand, and
optionally, a member of the TGF-p family, can be conducted in any suitable manner. For
example, the cells may be treated in adherent culture, or in suspension culture.                 It is
understood that the cells contacted with the defined medium can be further treated with a cell
differentiation environment to stabilize the cells, or to differentiate the cells.
         100371      As used herein, the term "differentiate" refers to the production of a cell
type that is more differentiated than the cell type from which it is derived.               In some
embodiments, the term "differentiate" means to produce a cell that has fewer fate choices
than the cell from which it was derived. The term therefore encompasses cell types that are
partially and terminally differentiated. Differentiated cells derived from hES cells are
generally referred to as hES-derived cells or hES-derived cell aggregate cultures, or hES
derived single cell suspensions, or hES-derived cell adherent cultures and the like.
         100381     As used herein, the term "differentiable cell" is used to describe a cell or
population of cells that can differentiate into at least partially mature cells, or that can
participate in the differentiation of cells, e.g., fuse with other cells, that can differentiate into

 "immature cells", "precursor cells", "multipotent cells" or equivalents thereof include those
 cells which are not terminally differentiated, e.g., definitive endoderm cells, PDXI-negative
 foregut endoderm cells, PDX1-positive pancreatic endoderm cells which further include
 PDX1-positive pre-pancreatic endoderm cells and PDX1-positive pancreatic endoderm tip
 cells.    All are cells that exhibit at least one characteristic of the phenotype, such as
 morphology or protein expression, of a mature cell from the same organ or tissue but can
 further differentiate into at least one other cell type.        For example, a normal, mature
 hepatocyte typically expresses such proteins as albumin,             fibrinogen, a-1-antitrypsin,
 prothrombin clotting factors, transferrin, and detoxification enzymes such as the cytochrome
 P-450s, among others. Thus, as used herein, a "partially mature hepatocyte" may express
 albumin or another one or more proteins, or begin to take the appearance or function of a
 normal, mature hepatocyte.
          [0039]     As used herein, the term "substantially" refers to a great extent or degree,
 e.g. "substantially similar" in context would be used to describe one method which is to great
 extent or degree similar to another method. However, as used herein, the term "substantially
 free", e.g., "substantially free" or "substantially free from contaminants," or "substantially
 free of serum" or "substantially free of insulin or insulin like growth factor" or equivalents
 thereof, is meant that the solution, media, supplement, excipient and the like, is at least 98%,
 or at least 98.5%, or at least 99%, or at least 99.5%, or at least 100% free of serum,
 contaminants or equivalent thereof. In one embodiment, a defined culture media contains no
 serum, or is 100% serum-free, or is substantially free of serum. Conversely, as used herein,
the term "substantially similar" or equivalents thereof is meant that the composition, process,
method, solution, media, supplement, excipient and the like is meant that the process,
method, solution etc., is at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, at least 85%, at least
90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% similar to that previously described in the specification
herein, or in a previously described process or method incorporated herein in its entirety.
         [00401      Also, as used herein, in connection with the composition of a cell
population, the term "essentially" or "substantially" means predominantly or mainly. In some
embodiments these terms mean at least 85% of the cells in a cell population, at least 86% of
the cells in a cell population, at least 87% of the cells in a cell population, at least 88% of the

 cells in a cell population, at least 97% of the cells in a cell population, at least 98% of the
 cells in a cell population, or at least 99% of the cells in a cell population. In other
 embodiments, the terms or phrases "essentially free of' and "substantially free of' refer to a
de minimus or a reduced amount of a component or cell present in any cell culture, e.g.,
pancreatic progenitors as described herein are "essentially or substantially homogenous",
 "essentially   or substantially homo-cellular",     "essentially  hES cells",    "essentially  or
 substantially definitive endoderm cells", "essentially or substantially foregut endoderm cells",
"essentially or substantially gut endoderm cells", "essentially or substantially PDXl-negative

"essentially or substantially pancreatic epithelial cells", "essentially or substantially PDX1
positive pancreatic endoderm tip cells", "essentially or substantially pancreatic endocrine
precursor cells", "essentially or substantially pancreatic endocrine cells" and the like. The
terms, "essentially" and "substantially" can also mean that at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%,
70%, 75%, 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% that cell (definitive
endoderm; PDX1-negative foregut endoderm; PDXl-positive pre-pancreatic endoderm;
PDX1-positive pancreatic progenitor cells; PDXI-postiive pancreatic tip cells; endocrine
precursor cells, and endocrine hormone-secreting cells).
         [00411     As used herein, the term "effective amount" or equivalents thereof of a
compound refers to that concentration of the compound that is sufficient in the presence of
the remaining components of the defined medium to effect the stabilization of the
differentiable cell in culture for greater than one month in the absence of a feeder cell and in
the absence of serum or serum replacement. This concentration is readily determined by one
of ordinary skill in the art.
         [00421     As used herein, the term "express" refers to the transcription of a
polynucleotide or translation of a polypeptide in a cell, such that levels of the molecule are

measurably higher in a cell that expresses the molecule than they are in a cell that does not
express the molecule. Methods to measure the expression of a molecule are well known to
those of ordinary skill in the art, and include without limitation, Northern blotting, RT-PCR,
in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunostaining.
         100431     As used herein when referring to a cell, cell line, cell culture or population
of cells, the term "isolated" refers to being substantially separated from the natural source of
the cells such that the cell, cell line, cell culture, or population of cells are capable of being
cultured in vitro. In addition, the term "isolating" is used to refer to the physical selection of
one or more cells out of a group of two or more cells, wherein the cells are selected based on
cell morphology and/or the expression of various markers.
         100441     As used herein, the term "preserving cells" means maintaining cells in a
viable state for a period of time before transplantation. The period of time may be 1 hour, 2
hours, 5 hours, 10 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 4 days, 5 days, I week, 2
weeks, 4 weeks, I month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 8 months, 10 months, 1 year, 2

between any times provided in this range.
         [0045]     Differentiable cells, as used herein, may be pluripotent, multipotent,
oligopotent or even unipotent. In certain embodiments, the differentiable cells are pluripotent
differentiable cells. In more specific embodiments, the pluripotent differentiable cells are
selected from the group consisting of embryonic stem cells, ICM/epiblast cells, primitive
ectoderm cells, primordial germ cells, and teratocarcinoma cells. In some embodiments, the
differentiable cells are derived from a preimplantation embryo.                 In one particular
embodiment, the differentiable cells are mammalian embryonic stem cells.                In a more
particular embodiment, the differentiable cells are human embryonic stem cells.
         [00461     The cell types that differentiate from differentiable cells have several uses
in various fields of research and development including but not limited to drug discovery,
drug development and testing, toxicology, production of cells for therapeutic purposes as
well as basic science research. These cell types express molecules that are of interest in a
wide range of research fields. These include the molecules known to be required for the

 function of the various cell types as described in standard reference texts. These molecules
 include, but are not limited to, cytokines, growth factors, cytokine receptors, extracellular
 matrix, transcription factors, secreted polypeptides and other molecules, and growth factor
 receptors.
         100471      It is contemplated that differentiable cells can be differentiated through
contact with a cell differentiation environment. As used herein, the term "cell differentiation
environment" refers to a cell culture condition wherein the differentiable cells are induced to
differentiate, or are induced to become a human cell culture enriched in differentiated cells.
 Preferably, the differentiated cell lineage induced by the growth factor will be homogeneous
in nature.     The term "homogeneous," refers to a population that contains more than
approximately 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%,
94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% of the desired cell lineage.
         [00481      A cell differentiating medium or environment may be utilized to partially,
terminally, or reversibly differentiate the differentiable cells described herein. In accordance
with the embodiments described herein, the medium of the cell differentiation environment
may contain a variety of components including, for example, KODMEM medium (Knockout
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium), DMEM, Ham's F12 medium, FBS (fetal bovine
serum), FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2), KSR or hLIF (human leukemia inhibitory factor).
The cell differentiation environment can also contain supplements such as L-Glutamine,
NEAA      (non-essential    amino acids), P/S      (penicillin/streptomycin), N2,   B27 and p
mercaptoethanol (p-ME). It is contemplated that additional factors may be added to the cell
differentiation environment, including, but not limited to, fibronectin, laminin, heparin,
heparin sulfate, retinoic acid, members of the epidermal growth factor family (EGFs),
members of the fibroblast growth factor family (FGFs) including FGF2, FGF7, FGF8, and/or
FGF10, members of the platelet derived growth factor family (PDGFs), transforming growth
factor (TGF)/ bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/ growth and differentiation factor (GDF)
factor family antagonists including but not limited to noggin, follistatin, chordin, gremlin,
cerberus/DAN family proteins, ventropin, high dose activin, and amnionless or variants or
functional fragments thereof. TGF/BMP/GDF antagonists could also be added in the form of
TGF/BMP/GDF receptor-Fc chimeras. Other factors that may be added include molecules
                                                -13-

that can activate or inactivate signaling through Notch receptor family, including but not
limited to proteins of the Delta-like and Jagged families as well as inhibitors of Notch
processing or cleavage, or variants or functional fragments thereof. Other growth factors may
include members of the insulin like growth factor family (IGF), insulin, the wingless related
(WNT) factor family, and the hedgehog factor family or variants or functional fragments
thereof.    Additional factors may be added to promote mesendoderm stem/progenitor,
endoderm       stem/progenitor,    mesoderm        stem/progenitor,   or   definitive    endoderm
stem/progenitor proliferation and survival as well as survival and differentiation of
derivatives of these progenitors.
         100491      The progression of the differentiable cells to the desired cell lineage, or its
maintenance in an undifferentiated state can be monitored by quantitating expression of
marker genes characteristic of the desired cell lineage as well as the lack of expression of
marker genes characteristic of differentiable cell types. One method of quantitating gene
expression of such marker genes is through the use of quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Methods
of performing Q-PCR are well known in the art. Other methods that are known in the art can
also be used to quantitate marker gene expression. Marker gene expression can be detected
by using antibodies specific for the marker gene of interest.
         [00501      Embodiments described herein also contemplate differentiable cells from
any source within an animal, provided the cells are differentiable as defined herein.           For
example, differentiable cells may be harvested from embryos, or any primordial germ layer
therein, from placental or chorion tissue, or from more mature tissue such as adult stem cells
including, but not limited to adipose, bone marrow, nervous tissue, mammary tissue, liver
tissue, pancreas, epithelial, respiratory, gonadal and muscle tissue. In specific embodiments,
the differentiable cells are embryonic stem cells.          In other specific embodiments, the
differentiable cells are adult stem cells. In still other specific embodiments, the stem cells are
placental- or chorionic-derived stem cells.
         [00511     Other embodiments contemplate using differentiable cells from any animal
capable of generating differentiable cells. The animals from which the differentiable cells are
harvested may be vertebrate or invertebrate, mammalian or non-mammalian, human or non

which the non-pluripotent cells are harvested may be vertebrate or invertebrate, mammalian
or non-mammalian, human or non-human. Examples of animal sources include, but are not
limited to, primates, rodents, canines, felines, equines, bovines and porcines.
         [0053]     The differentiable cells described herein can be derived using any method
known to those of skill in the art. For example, human pluripotent cells can be produced
using de-differentiation and nuclear transfer methods. Additionally, the human ICM/epiblast
cell or the primitive ectoderm cell used herein is derived in vivo or in vitro. Primitive
ectodermal cells may be generated in adherent culture or as cell aggregates in suspension
culture, as described in WO 99/53021.        Furthermore, the human pluripotent cells can be
passaged using any method known to those of skill in the art, including, manual passaging
methods, and bulk passaging methods such as enzymatic or non-enzymatic passaging.
        100541      In certain embodiment, when ES cells are utilized, the embryonic stem
cells have a normal karyotype, while in other embodiments, the embryonic stem cells have an
abnormal karyotype. In one embodiment, a majority of the embryonic stem cells have a
normal karyotype. It is contemplated that greater than 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%,
80%, 85%, 90% or greater than 95% of metaphases examined will display a normal
karyotype.
Storing cells for encapsulation and transplantation
        [00551      Some embodiments relate to methods for cyropreserving cells which have
been cultured and/or differentiated in vitro. Such storage would allow banking, quality
control, and other desired procedures and manipulations, either in connection with in vitro
analysis or implantation in vivo. Methods for cell storage prior to transplantation include

 123-135; Gage et al. 1985 Neurosci Lett 60: 133-137, the disclosures of which are herein
incorporated by reference in their entireties.      Although hibernation has been reported to
increase rates of graft survival and function as compared to cryopreserved tissue, cells may
not be capable of long term maintenance under such conditions without jeopardizing cell
viability during the hibernation period.
         [00561       As used herein, a "cell suspension" or equivalents thereof refers to cell
aggregates and/or clusters and/or spheres that are contacted with a medium.           Such cell
suspensions are described in detail in U.S. Application 12/264,760, entitled Stem cell
Aggregate Suspension Compositions and Methods of Differentiation Thereof, filed on
November 8, 2008, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
         [0057]       As used herein, "adapted cell suspension" or cell suspension cultures or
equivalents thereof includes a cell suspension that has been stored above freezing, preferably

 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,20,21,22,23,24,25 or up to 30 days.
         10058]       As used herein, a cell suitable for transplantation refers to a cell or a
population of cells sufficiently viable and/or functional for in vivo treatment of a metabolic
disorder. For example, diabetes, or one or more symptoms thereof, can be ameliorated or
reduced for a period of time following implantation of a cell suitable for transplantation into
a subject suffering from diabetes.     In one preferred embodiment, a cell or cell population
suitable for transplantation is a pancreatic progenitor cell or population, or a PDX1-positive
pancreatic progenitor cell or population, or an endocrine precursor cell or population, or a
poly or singly-hormonal endocrine cell and/or any combination of cell or populations of cells,
or even purified or enriched cells or populations of cells thereof.       Cells suitable for the
embodiments described herein are further described in detail in U.S. Patent 7,534,608 the

         100591      As used herein the term "storing" or equivalents thereof refers to holding
or maintaining cells either above or below freezing.         The term is also meant to include
maintaining cells prior to use in transplantation in a subject.
         [00601      As used herein the term "cryopreservation" or equivalents thereof refers to
preservation of cells at temperatures below freezing.
         [00611      As used herein the term "hibernation" or equivalents thereof refers to
preservation of cells at temperatures        above freezing and sufficiently below normal
physiological temperature such that one or more normal cellular physiological processes are
decreased or halted. In one embodiment, preferred hibernation temperatures range between 0
and 40 C, preferably about 4C.      Hibernation medium as used herein includes any medium
which lacks a cryopreservative and is physiologically compatible for storage of a cell at
above freezing temperatures, preferably about 4C.
Hibernation Conditions
         [00621      Hibernation temperatures typically range from between 0 and 5' C,
preferably about 4' C. Numerous types of media can be used as hibernation media in
conjunction with the instant methods. Prior art methods for freezing and hibernating cells
utilize complex media comprising buffers and added protein, sometimes including entirely
undefined components, such as serum. However, to minimize toxicity and immunogenicity
such additives are not desirable for transplantation into humans. In preferred embodiments,
hibernation media is free of added Ca+*. In certain embodiments, medium for hibernating
cells is free of added protein and/or free of a buffer. A preferred hibernation medium includes
or consists of minimal amounts of glucose or moderate amounts of glucose in a saline
solution, e.g., either no additional glucose or between about 0.1%-0.9% glucose in saline. In
preferred embodiments, the hibernation medium includes or consists of about 0.1-0.5%
glucose. In a more preferred embodiment, the medium includes or consists of about 0.2%
glucose. In preferred embodiments, the hibernation medium includes or consists of a very
small percentage (vol/vol) of NaCl, e.g., about 0.1 - 1% NaCl, preferably about 0.5-0.9%
NaCl. In certain embodiments, more complex media can be used, e.g., Hank's balanced salt
solution, Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, or Eagle's modified minimal essential
medium. In certain embodiments it may be desirable to supplement the chosen hibernation

serum (preferably heat inactivated)) buffers (e.g., phosphate buffers, HEPES, or the like)
antioxidants, growth factors, KCI (e.g., at about 30 mM), lactate (e.g., at about 20 mM),
pyruvate, MgCl 2 (e.g., at about 2-3 mM), sorbitol (e.g., at about 300 mM) or other additives
as are well known in the art.
         [00631     In certain embodiments, the cells are hibernated at about 0-5'C, preferably
about 40C. In certain embodiments, cells are maintained at about 4C in hibernation medium
prior to freezing or use. In other embodiments, the cells are maintained at about 4C in
hibernation medium post freezing. In still other embodiments, the cells are maintained at
about 4'C in hibernation medium without freezing. In certain embodiments, the cells are
maintained in hibernation medium at about 4'C for at least about I hour and up to about 1, 2,
3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,20,21,22,23,24,25 or up to 30 days
prior to freezing, post freezing or prior to use in transplantation. In other embodiments, the
cells are maintained in hibernation medium at about 4'C for at least about 12-72 hours prior
to freezing, post freezing or prior to use in transplantation. In certain embodiments the cells
are maintained at 4'C in hibernation medium for at least about 24 hours prior to freezing,
post freezing or prior to use in transplantation. In a more preferred embodiment, the cells are
maintained in hibernation medium from at least about 36-48 hours at about 40C prior to
freezing, post freezing or prior to use.
Cyropreservation conditions
         [00641     In some embodiments cells are cryopreserved using a cryopreservation
solution.    A cryopreservation solution or medium includes a solution which contains a
cryopreservative, i.e., a compound which protects cells against intracellular and/or cell
membrane damage as the cells are frozen or thawed. A cryopreservative is identified by
enhanced viability and/or functionality of cells in contact with the cryopreservative when
compared with cells which are similarly frozen or thawed in the absence of the
cryopreservative. Any cryopreservative can be used in conjunction with the instant methods
and the term is meant to encompass both intracellular and extracellular cryopreservatives.
        100651      Any cryopreservative known in the art can be used in a cryopreservative
solution.    In certain    embodiments,    cryopreservation    solutions   include  intracellular

triols (e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediol and triol and glycerol), as well as
various aides (e.g., formamide and acetamide); and extracellular cryopreservatives
including     but   not   limited  to  phosphomono      and   phosphodiester   catabolites   of
phosphoglycerides, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or methylcellulose (e.g., at least 0.1%) can also be
used alone or in combination with any of the intracellular cryopreservatives.
         [00661      In preferred embodiments, DMSO is used as the cryopreservative. DMSO
can be used at a wide range of concentrations, e.g., about 1%, about 2%, about 3%, about 4%,
about 5%, about 6%, about 7%, about 8%, about 9%, about 10%, about 11%, about 12%,
about 13%, about 14%, about 15%             or more. In more preferred embodiments the
concentration of DMSO ranges from about 6% to about 12%. In particularly preferred
embodiments the concentration of DMSO is about 10%.
         100671      In certain embodiments, the cryopreservative is added to the cells in a
stepwise manner in order to gradually increase the concentration of the cryopreservative until
the desired final concentration of cryopreservative is achieved. In certain embodiments, the
cells are contacted with a cryopreservation solution containing the cryopreservative at the
desired final concentration or the cryopreservative is added directly to the base medium
without a gradual increase in concentration.
        100681       The cryopreservation    solution includes   the cryopreservative   in an
appropriate base medium. Any type of media can be used for this purpose. In preferred
embodiments, the base medium to which the cryopreservative is added is free of added Ca+*.
In certain embodiments the medium to which the cryopreservative is added is free of added
protein and/or free of a buffer. In other embodiments, the base medium (e.g. DMEM or
DMEM/F 12) to which the cryopreservative is added includes or consists of about 0.1-0.5%
glucose or no or low glucose. In some aspects of this embodiment, the base medium (e.g.
DMEM or DMEM/F12) to which the cryopreservative is added includes or consists of about
0.5-0.9% NaCl. In preferred embodiments, the base medium to which the cryopreservative is
added includes or consists of very low to no glucose and about 0.5-0.9% NaCl. In another
preferred embodiment, the base medium to which the cryopreservative is added includes or
                                              -19-

WO 2010/057039                                                          PCT/US2009/064459
consists of about 0.1 to 0.2% glucose. In some aspects of this embodiment, the base medium
to which the cryopreservative is added includes or consists of about 0.5-0.9% NaCl.
         [00691      In certain embodiments the cryopreservation solution can also contain
added protein, for example, serum, e.g., fetal calf serum or human serum, or a serum protein,
e.g., albumin or knockout serum replacement. In other embodiments, the cryopreservative
can also contain other additives, such as those described above for inclusion in hibernation
media, for example, antioxidants, growth factors, KCI (e.g., at about 30 mM), lactate (e.g., at
about 20 mM), pyruvate, MgCl       2 (e.g., at about 2-3 mM), sorbitol (e.g., to an osmolarity of
about 300 mM) or other additives as are well known in the art.
         [00701      Once the cells are suspended in cryopreservation solution, the temperature
of the cells is reduced in a controlled manner. In cooling the cells to below freezing, the
reduction in temperature preferably occurs slowly to allow the cells to establish an
equilibrium between the intracellular and extracellular concentration of cryopreservative such
that intracellular ice crystal formation is inhibited. In some embodiments, the rate of cooling
is preferably fast enough to protect the cells from excess water loss and the toxic effects of
cryopreservatives. The cells can then be cryopreserved at a temperature of between -20C and
about -250C. Preferably, the cells are stored below -900 C to minimize the risk of ice
recrystalization. In particularly preferred embodiments, the cells are cryopreserved in liquid
nitrogen at about -196 0 C. Alternatively, controlled freezing may be accomplished with the aid
of commercially available electronically controlled freezer equipment.
Thawing Conditions
        [00711       After cryopreservation, the cells can be thawed through any available
method. In a preferred embodiment, the cells are thawed rapidly, e.g., by quick immersion in
liquid at 37C. Once the cells are thawed, dilution of the cryopreservative is accomplished by
addition of a dilution medium.
        [00721       Any media can be used for diluting the cryopreservation solution which is
in contact with the thawed cells. For example, any of the media listed above for use in
hibernating cells, or for growth and differentiation of cells, can be used for diluting the
cryopreservation solution. Other media are also appropriate, for example, Hank's balanced
salt solution (preferably without Ca++), DMEM containing media with no glucose or
                                                 -20-

minimal to low amounts of glucose. Additives, e.g., as listed above for inclusion in
hibernation or freezing media can also be used in media for dilution. Exemplary additives
include, for example, buffers (e.g., phosphate buffers, HEPES, or the like) antioxidants,
growth factors, KCl (e.g., at about 30 mM), lactate (e.g., at about 20 mM), pyruvate, MgCl 2
(e.g., at about 2-3 mM), sorbitol (e.g., to an osmolarity of about 300 mM) or others additives
as are well known in the art. Another suitable additive includes DNase (e.g., commercially
available from Genentech, Incorporated as PULMOZYMEOR). The medium which is used
for diluting the cryopreservation solution can, optionally, contain added protein, e.g., added
protein (e.g., mammalian serum (preferably heat inactivated) or a serum protein such as
albumin. In other embodiments, the medium contains no added protein and/or no added
buffer.
         [0073]      After dilution of the cryopreservative, the cells can then be allowed to
settle or a pellet of cells can be formed under centrifugal force in order to remove as much of
the cryopreservation solution from the cells as possible. The cells can then be washed in
medium which does not contain a cryopreservative. It may be preferable for the cells to
remain at room temperature after the addition of the wash media and prior to letting the cells
settle or form a pellet under centrifugal force. In preferred embodiments, the cells remain at
room temperature for about 10, 15, 20, 30 minutes prior to the second centrifugation. Any
medium known in the art can be used to wash the cells, for example, any of the hibernation or
dilution media set forth above can be used.
         100741      After thawing and washing, cells are cultured at 37C for varying lengths
of time to allow recovery prior to transplantation. Cells can be cultured in any culture
medium, preferably in medium appropriate to their stage of differentiation. During this time
some cell may death occur.
         [00751      For use in transplantation, cells should be suspended in a final medium
which is suitable for administration to a subject. Transplantation of cells is substantially
similar to that described in U.S. Patent No. 7,534,608, which is herein incorporated by
reference in its entirety.
         [00761     In addition, the thawed cells may be maintained in hibernation medium as
described above at between 0 and 37'C, preferably about 40 C for up to 1 hour and up to about

 days prior to use in transplantation without a significant loss in viability. In some
 embodiments, no statistically significant loss in cell viability occurs.
 Determining viability of recovered cells
          [00771      After storage, it may be desirable to assay the viability and/or functionality
 of the cells prior to transplantation to confirm their suitability for use, e.g., in transplantation.
 This can be accomplished using a variety of methods known in the art. For example, the cells
 can be stained using vital stains, such as, e.g., trypan blue or ethidium bromide or acridine
orange. In certain embodiments, a population of cells suitable for transplantation is at least
between about 50-100% viable. In preferred embodiments, a population of cells suitable for
transplantation is at least about 50%, is at least about 55%, is at least about 60%, is at least
 about 65%, is at least about 70%, is at least about 75%, is at least about 80%, is at least about
 85%, is at least about 90%, is at least about 95%, is at least about 96%, is at least about 97%,
 is at least about 98%, is at least about 99%, viable. In particularly preferred embodiments,
 such a population of cells is at least about 85% viable.
          100781      In other embodiments, the morphometric characteristics of the cells can be
determined as a measure of the suitability of cells for use in transplantation. In preferred
embodiments, the morphology of cells which have been stored using the instant methods and
are suitable for transplantation does not differ (e.g., statistically significant) from that of fresh
cells. In preferred embodiments, the in vivo morphology of cells which have been stored
using the instant methods and are suitable for transplantation does not differ (e.g., statistically
significant) from that of fresh cells.
          [0079]      In the case of cell clusters, cell mass can be quantitated before and after
cell freeze/thaw and recovery. In one embodiment, cell clusters cultured in suspension can be
manipulated to pack in closely. The area occupied by the clusters can then be photographed
and measured. By comparing the areas occupied by cells before and after freeze/thaw and
recovery, a value for percent recovery can be determined.
         [0080]       Cells which have been stored can also be assayed for the presence of
certain hES and/or pancreatic progenitor or hormone secreting cell markers to determine if
they are suitable for use in transplantation. This method has been described in detail in the
                                                 -22-

Encapsulation devices
         100821     One embodiment described herein relates to encapsulation devices. Such
devices can be implanted into a mammal to treat a variety of diseases and disorders. In
preferred embodiments, the device comprises a biocompatible, immuno-isolating device that
is capable of wholly encapsulating a therapeutically biologically active agent and/or cells
therein. For example, such devices can house therapeutically effective quantities of cells
within a semi-permeable membrane having a pore size such that oxygen and other molecules
important to cell survival and function can move through the semi-permeable membrane but
the cells of the immune system cannot permeate or traverse through the pores. Similarly, such
devices can contain therapeutically effective quantities of a biologically active agent, e.g., an
angiogenic factor, a growth factor, a hormone and the like.
        [00831      The devices described herein can be employed for treating pathologies
requiring a continuous supply of biologically active substances to the organism. Such devices
are, for example, can also be referred to as, bioartificial organs, which contain homogenous
or heterogenous mixtures of biologically active agents and/or cells, or cells producing one or
more biologically active substances of interest. Ideally, the biologically active agents and/or
cells are wholly encapsulated or enclosed in at least one internal space or are encapsulation
chambers, which are bounded by at least one or more semi-permeable membranes. Such a
semi-permeable membrane should allow the encapsulated biologically active substance of
interest to pass (e.g., insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide and the like), making the
active substance available to the target cells outside the device and in the patient's body. In a
preferred embodiment, the semi-permeable membrane allows nutrients naturally present in
the subject to pass through the membrane to provide essential nutrients to the encapsulated
cells. At the same time, such a semi-permeable membrane prohibits or prevents the patient's
cells, more particularly to the immune system cells, from passing through and into the device
                                               -23-

WO 2010/057039                                                           PCT/US2009/064459
and harming the encapsulated cells in the device. For example, in the case of diabetes, this
approach can allow glucose and oxygen to stimulate insulin-producing cells to release insulin
as required by the body in real time while preventing immune system cells from recognizing
and destroying the implanted cells.          In a preferred embodiment, the semi-permeable
membrane prohibits the implanted cells from escaping encapsulation.
          100841     Preferred devices may have certain characteristics which are desirable but
are not limited to one or a combination of the following: i) comprised of a biocompatible
material that functions under physiologic conditions, including pH and temperature;
examples include, but are not limited to, anisotropic materials, polysulfone (PSF), nano-fiber
mats, polyimide, tetrafluoroethylene / polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE;            also known as
Teflon@), ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene), polyacrylonitrile, polyethersulfone,
acrylic resin, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, polyamide, as well as hydroxylpropyl methyl
cellulose (HPMC) membranes; ii) releases no toxic compounds harming the biologically
active agent and/or cells encapsulated inside the device; iii) promotes secretion or release of a
biologically active agent or macromolecule across the device; iv) promotes rapid kinetics of
macromolecule diffusion; v) promotes long-term stability of the encapsulated cells; vi)
promotes vascularization;      vii) comprised of membranes or housing structure that is
chemically inert; viii) provides stable mechanical properties; ix) maintains structure/housing
integrity (e.g., prevents unintended leakage of toxic or harmful agents and/or cells); x) is
refillable and/or flushable; xi) is mechanically expandable; xii) contains no ports or at least
one, two, three or more ports; xiii) provides a means for immuno-isolating the transplanted
cells from the host tissue; xiv) is easy to fabricate and manufacture; and xv) can be sterilized.
         100851      The embodiments of the encapsulation devices described herein are in not
intended to be limited to certain device size, shape, design, volume capacity, and/or materials
used to make the encapsulation devices, so long as one or more of the above elements are
achieved.
Device designs
         [00861      In one embodiment, the encapsulated device is improved by creating one
or more compartments in the device, other than that created by sealing or welding the device
around the periphery or edges to prevent leakage of the cells and/or biologically active
                                                 -24-

WO 2010/057039                                                                   PCT/US2009/064459
agents. Figure 1 is an example of a schematic of one embodiment of the device, but the
device is not intended to be bound to just this design.                 Rather, the design can include
variations such as those routine in the art. In some embodiments, device design can be
modified depending on the type of biologically active agents and/or cells encapsulated and to
meet the needs and function of the study. A device of any size or shape reasonable can be
further compartmentalized into having at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at
least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, a least 14,
at least 15, at least 16, least 17, at least 18, at least 19, at least 20, at least 21, at least 22, at
least 23, at least 24 or more chambers or compartments. One purpose for creating a plurality
of compartments is that it increases the surface area for nutrient and oxygen exchange
between the encapsulated cells and, for example and the interstitial space surrounding the
device; see FIGs. 1-11 for example. Further, such designs prohibit or do not promote large
cell aggregates or clusters or agglomerations such that cells packed in the center of the large
clusters/agglomerations are denied, or receive less, nutrients and oxygen and therefore
potentially do not survive.        Devices containing a plurality of chambers or compartments
therefore are better capable to disperse the cells throughout the chamber/compartment or
chambers/compartments.          In this way, there is more opportunity for each cell to receive
nutrients and oxygen, thereby promoting cell survival and not cell death.
         [00871       One embodiment relates to a substantially elliptical to rectangular shape
device; see FIG. I and 6. These devices are further compartmentalized or reconfigured so
that instead of a slightly flattened device there is a weld or seam running through the center
of the device, either sealing off each half of the device, thus forming two separate reservoirs,
lumens, chambers, void spaces, containers or compartments; or the weld or seam creates one
U-shaped chamber which is separated or divided in the middle due to the weld but such a
weld in this instance does not completely seal off the chambers; see FIG. 1. In FIG. I two
ports provides for ease of filling and flushing cells into and through the chambers.
         [00881       Another embodiment relates to a similar elliptical or rectangular shape
device having 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more welds across the plane of the device. In some
aspects the welds are across the horizontal aspect or plane of the device. In other aspects the
welds are across the vertical aspect or plane of the device. In still other aspects, intersecting
                                                     -25-

WO 2010/057039                                                           PCT/US2009/064459
welds are present across both the horizontal and vertical aspects of the plane.          In some
aspects the welds are parallel and equidistant to each other. In other aspects the welds are
perpendicular.    In still other aspects the welds are parallel but not equidistant. As in the
above example, such a design can effectively form up to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more
chambers, wholly separated if the weld runs traverses and connects both boundaries of the
device, or it can create one continuous chamber but interdigitated. Further, although certain
exemplary devices are described in FIGs.1-11 with welds being parallel or parallel and
equidistant, still other devices can be customized or made with welds in any direction or
orientation, including long welds which have regions interrupted by no welds. The type and
number of welds used can depend on the cell population or agent employed and for what
treatment or purpose. In some embodiments, welds can be arranged to modify the look of the
device.
         100891     Figure 1 shows an encapsulation device that embodies features described
herein, but as described above, this is just one illustration and one of ordinary skill in the art
can envisage that by forming different configurations using welds or seams in any such
device, one can customize the number of compartments suitable for the purpose. Figures 2-5
show top, side and end cross sections of the same device. The device can be ultrasonically
welded around the entire perimeter 1 to create a completely enclosed internal lumen. Other
means of sealing or walling off membranes to form the pouch like device can be used. The
lumen is further compartmentalized by an internal weld 2 that is centrally located and extends
down the long axis of the device. This weld extends to a point 3 that effectively limits the
thickness or depth of each compartment yet does not completely segregate the internal lumen.
By this approach, the width and depth of the compartments are controlled and can be varied
as is required to enable cell product survival and performance. Moreover, all dimensions of
the device, which include but are not limited to, the overall length, overall width, perimeter
weld    thickness,   perimeter    weld   width,   compartment    length,   compartment     width,
compartment depth, internal weld length, internal weld width and port position are design
specifications that can be modified to optimize the device for unique cell products and/or
biologically active agents.

WO 2010/057039                                                             PCT/US2009/064459
         [0090]     Referring to Figure 1, the compartment is loaded with a cell product or
biologically active agent through two individual ports 5, 5' that are incorporated into the
device during ultrasonic welding of the perimeter. These ports extend into the lumen or
compartments and allow access to the compartment for the purpose of evenly distributing
cells and/or agents during loading. Further, as the ports 5, 5' are connected via the U-shaped
internal lumen as in FIG.1, gas is allowed to vent through each port 5 while the adjacent port
5' is being loaded, thus preventing the accumulation of pressure in the device.
         [00911        Alternatively, in another embodiment, the devices provided herein
contain no ports of entry or exit, i.e. the devices are said to be port-less. Such an embodiment
is shown in FIG. 6. Figures 7-9 show a top, side and end cross section of a substantially
similar device. A two, three or more stage welding process may be necessary to create a port
less device as that shown in FIGs. 6-11. For example, in one aspect, the elliptical/rectangular
outer perimeter 6 and the compartmentalization spot welds 7 are first created by ultrasonic
welding. The spot welds 7 function similarly to the internal weld 2 of FIG.1. The spot welds
7 are placed is a manner across the device to periodically limit the expansion of the lumen or
compartment 8 at any given point. Again, the lumen or compartments 8 created by spot
welding, therefore interconnecting the compartments 8, and not isolating or wholly separating
any one lumen or compartment. Moreover, the total number, diameter and distribution of the
spot welds 7 are design parameters that can be optimized to accommodate the loading
dynamics and growth rates of any cell product or agent.
         100921        Once cells are loaded into the device, the outer perimeter is completely
and aseptically sealed by a second ultrasonic weld across the edge 9 of the device. The result
of the multi-step sealing process is that finished devices are totally enclosed and have no
ports extending from the perimeter. This approach simplifies the loading process and
improves the overall integrity and safety of the device, as the ports can be an area of the
perimeter where breaches can occur as a result of suboptimal ultrasonic welding.
         100931        Further, although the above process was described in 2 sequential
steps, the means for encapsulating the cells and/or agents is not limited to the described 2
steps but to any number of steps, in any order, necessary to encapsulate the cells and at the
same time prevent or reduce the level of breach of the device.

         100941          In another embodiment, FIGs. 10 and 11 show an encapsulation device
substantially similar to the device shown in FIG. 6, but the spot welds 10 have been modified
during the welding process to have the centers removed. One of ordinary skill in the art cam
accomplish this in various ways, e.g., by using an ultrasonic sonotrode that has an internal
sharpened edge, which can cut the material immediately after welding. These cut-out welds
 10 have an advantage in that they are more readily integrated with the host tissue because the
cut-out welds 10 promote vascularization of the device, thus improving the survival and
performance of oxygen-dependent cell products and/or agents. As a consequence of
facilitating and promoting new vasculature through the device, there is improved diffusive
transport of oxygen in the X-Y direction, which is normally limited towards the center of
planar sheet devices.
         [00951          In other embodiments, the device design can be different shapes, e.g.
the cell encapsulation device can be in the shape of a tube or flattened tube or any other such
shape which satisfies one of the above requirements for a device of the invention.

         100971      In one embodiment, the encapsulating devices are comprised of a
biocompatible material including, but are not limited to, anisotropic materials, polysulfone
(PSF), nano-fiber mats, polyimide, tetrafluoroethylene / polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; also
known      as   Teflon@),    ePTFE     (expanded    polytetrafluoroethylene),  polyacrylonitrile,

 membrane types and components are manufactured by at least Gore®, Phillips Scientific®,
 Zeus®, Pall® and Dewal@ to name a few.
 Immobilized device
        [00981       Also provided is an implantable device, which is immobilized at an
 implantation site to maintain the encapsulated cell and/or biological active agent at the
 implantation site and permit diffusion of, for example, an expressed and secreted therapeutic
polypeptide from the implantation site. In one aspect, the implantation site is at, or close in
proximity to, the tissue or organ which is focus of the treatment. In other aspects, where
delivery of the secreted agent from the device is not location dependent and biodistribution of
the agent is dependent on the vasculature, the device can be implanted in a remote location.
For   example,    in a preferred       embodiment,     the biocompatible    device    is implanted
subcutaneously under the skin on the forearm, or flank, or back, or buttocks, or leg and the
like, where it substantially remains until such time as it is required for it to be removed.
Expandable devices
        100991           Devices described herein have inner and outer surfaces wherein the
device contains at least one void (or reservoir, or lumen, or container or compartment) and
wherein at least one void is open to the inner surface of the device. Conventional implantable
devices are commonly made of rigid, non-expandable                biocompatible materials. One
embodiment of the device described herein is made of an expandable material.                 Other
embodiments are directed to non-expandable materials.          Whether the device is capable of
expanding may be an inherent part of the materials employed to make the device, e.g., a
polymer sheath which is expandable, or can be designed such that they are expandable or
have expandable capabilities.        For example, a device which expands in size to house
additional cells or to refill an existing device is provided.
        [01001      In another embodiment, the implantable device is contained in a housing
or holder, which is slightly more rigid, and non-expandable but allowing sufficient means to
increase cell or agent capacity by increasing the number of or implant devices. For example,
means for inserting an additional reservoir, lumen, container, compartment or cassette each
having pre-loaded cells or agent. Alternatively, the housing contains a plurality of devices
only some of which are loaded with cells or have cells encapsulated therein, while others are

WO 2010/057039                                                           PCT/US2009/064459
 empty, which can be loaded and filled with cells or agents at a later period in time or any time
 subsequent the initial implantation.      Such an expandable housing is comprised of inert
 materials suitable for implantation in the body, e. g. , metal, titanium, titanium alloy or a
 stainless steel alloy, plastic, and ceramic appropriate for implantation in the mammal, more
 specifically, the human body.
          101011       Still in another embodiment, such a housing or implant device holder
 includes an outer sleeve having a longitudinal axis, at least one passage along the longitudinal
 axis, and a distal end and a device engagement area adapted to cooperatively engage the
 device.   As an analogy, the device holder functions similarly to a disk or cassette holder
 capable of housing more than one disk or cassette at any one time or for a long period of
time.    In still another embodiment, the device holder contains an expander adapted to
 increase the height of the holder
 Refillable cell encapsulation devices
         101021       Another embodiment relates to an encapsulation device with a refillable
reservoir, lumen, container or compartment, which can be periodically filled or flushed with
appropriate therapeutic or biologically active agents and/or cells. Such filling may be
accomplished by injecting a therapeutically effective amount of the appropriate therapeutic or
biologically active agents and/or cells into an implanted reservoir, lumen, container or
compartment, e.g., subdermally or subcutaneously using a syringe or other standard means in
the art for filling like reservoirs, lumens, containers or compartments in vivo.
Encapsulated cells
         [01031       In some embodiments, the system comprises a cell density between about
 1x10 5, 1x10 6 cells/ml to about lxIO10 cells/mL or more. In some embodiments, the cell
survives under culture conditions or in vivo in the system for at least a month, two months,
three months, four months, five months, six months, seven months, eight months, nine
months, ten months, eleven months, twelve months or a year or more with a functionality that
represents at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%,
87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more of the
function expressed at the time the cells are/were introduced into the system or at the time the
cells fully develop and/or mature in the system, e.g. implantation of progenitor cells which
                                                -30-

WO 2010/057039                                                            PCT/US2009/064459
need to further develop or mature to functional cells in vivo. In some embodiments, the cell in
the system expands in said system to increase in cell density and/or cell function upon
 implantation of the system in vivo.
Methods for increasing cell viability
         101041         One obstacle to the field of cell and tissue encapsulation/immuno
isolation has been the lack of sufficient oxygen and nutrient transport across the polymer
membranes used to encapsulate cells and tissues. The result of this insufficient gas and
nutrient exchange is lowered metabolic activity and cell death. Embodiments described
herein relate to an implantable cell encapsulation device addressing this drawback of the prior
art.
         101051         Oxygen partial pressures have been measured within islets, in their
native environment, after isolation, and post-transplant in various polymer devices as well as
naked or free, for example, under the kidney capsule. Oxygen partial pressures in pancreatic
islets are the highest of any organ in the body (37-46 mmHg). However, upon isolation, these
values fall drastically (14-19 mm Hg). Upon transplantation of pancreatic islets into normo
glycemic animals the values decrease slightly (9-15 mmHg) as compare to their isolated
values. See Dionne et al., Trans. Am. Soc. Artf. Intern. Organs. 1989; 35: 739-741; and
Carlsson et al., Diabetes July 1998 47(7):1027-32, the disclosure of which is herein expressly
incorporated by reference. These studies demonstrate that when tissues are immuno-isolated
and transplanted, even in a vascularized region such as the kidney capsule, the oxygen partial
pressures drop as compared to their native states (37-46 mmHg). Hence, these nearly anoxic
conditions can result in cell death, particularly the nearer the cell to the core of a cell cluster
or core of an encapsulating device.
         [01061         In order to achieve better oxygen availability and delivery to the
encapsulated cells or tissues and/or biologically active agents, embodiments described herein
relate to the use of, for example, perfluorinated substances in the device design and/or
formulation, e.g., in the membranes or materials employed for assembly of the device. In
particular, perfluoro organic compounds, e.g., perfluorocarbons (PFCs), are good solvents
because they have several fold higher solubility for oxygen than water. For example, under
normal conditions, liquid PFCs dissolve between 40 and 55% by volume of oxygen and
                                               -31-

WO 2010/057039                                                             PCT/US2009/064459
 between 100 and 150% by volume of C02. PFCs are largely used as blood substitutes and
 tissue preservation.    Additionally, PFC derivatives are dense, chemically inert, and water
 insoluble compounds that cannot be metabolized.
          101071          In another aspect of the embodiments, enhanced 02 delivery is
performed by a PFC-emulsion or mixture of PFC with some matrix. The device components
 or cells for example could be suspended or soaked or incubated in the emulsion/matrix to
 form a coating. Still certain PFC emulsions with higher weight/volume concentrations have
been known to have improved oxygen delivery and retention properties. And because of the
higher oxygen partial pressure created by the 02 carrying capabilities of PFCs, an 02 pressure
gradient is created that drives diffusion of dissolved oxygen into the tissue, thereby enhancing
02   delivery to the cells.
          101081          The     PFC      substance    includes    but    is   not    limited   to
perfluorotributylamine (FC-43), perfluorodecalin, perfluorooctyl bromide, bis-perfluorobutyl
ethene, or other suitable PFCs. Preferred PFCs typically contain about 60 to about 76 weight
percent carbon-bonded fluorine. The perfluorinated fluids can be single compounds, but
usually will be a mixture of such compounds. U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,500,388 (Simons); 2,519,983

the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. PFCs useful
in the embodiments described herein also include those described in Encyclopedia of
Chemical Technology, Kirk-Othmer, Third Ed., Vol. 10, pages 874-81, John Wiley & Sons
(1980).       For    example,       useful    PFCs      include     perfluoro-4-methylmorpholine,
perfluorotriethylamine,      perfluoro-2-ethyltetrahydrofuran,   perfluoro-2-butyltetrahydrofuran,
perfluoropentane,           perfluoro-2-methylpentane,         perfluorohexane,        perfluoro-4
isopropylmorpholine, perfluorodibutyl ether, perfluoroheptane, perfluorooctane, and mixtures
thereof. Preferred     inert   fluorochemical    liquids include    perfluorohexane,   perfluoro-2
butyltetrahydrofuran, perfluoroheptane, perfluorooctane, and mixtures thereof. Commercially
available PFCs useful in the embodiments described herein include FLUORINERT.TM.

In vivo imaging capability
         101091      In one embodiment, there is provided a means for imaging or detecting the
cells inside the encapsulating devices in vivo. Imaging serves important roles in stem cell
therapies. For example, noninvasive forms of imaging can be used to: (1) determine the
presence, severity or phenotype of the cell and/or disease to be treated; (2) monitor engrafted
cell therapies for the appearance of deleterious or non-target cell types and structures, such as
cysts or microcysts; (3) guide the delivery of therapy; (4) follow the time-course of disease
and evaluate the effects or efficacy of therapy; (5) provide labels and define mechanisms of
therapy; (6) analyze and evaluate survival and function of engrafted cells; and (7) generally
facilitate the process of any cell therapy, e.g. by determining the engraftment, survival, and
local function of cell therapy, including cell therapies described herein for treatment of
diabetes by substitution and/or implanting pancreatic progenitor cells. In addition, although
cell therapies aim to decrease morbidity/mortality, noninvasive imaging techniques as
described herein and in more detail below can serve as a useful surrogate endpoint, for
example, in preliminary trials or preclinical studies.
         [01101      Any in vivo imaging technology is ideally: i) non-invasive; ii) reliably
repetitive; iii) capable of tissue penetration up to a depth of at least 3mm; iv) resolution
capabilities of no greater than 100tm and ideally no greater than 50 tm; v) imaging is not
attentuated by device materials, e.g., can image through PTFE; vi) clinically compatible and
not technically cumbersome or complicated; vii) commercially available; viii) FDA approved
for human use; ix) reasonably cost-effective; and x) can image cells in a reasonable period of
time (e.g., seconds or minutes), or any combination of the above.
         10111]      To date, current methods include but are not limited to confocal
microscopy, 2-photon microscopy, high frequency ultrasound, optical coherence tomography
(OCT), photoacoustic tomography (PAT), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron
emission tomography (PET). These alone or combined can provide useful means to monitor
the transplanted cells. Also, it is expected that such technologies will improve over time but
that the essential tenets of how each technology functions or its utility is substantially similar.
That said, in vivo imaging described herein is not intended to be limited to technologies
                                               -33-

WO 2010/057039                                                            PCT/US2009/064459
described below but to technologies later discovered and described which would serve the
same utility as that described herein.
         [0112]      In one embodiment, the imaging technique employed would be non
invasive and provide for a 3-dimensional tomographic data, have high temporal and spatial
resolution, allow molecular imaging, and would be inexpensive and portable. While at
present no single modality is ideal (discussed in more detail below), each has different
attributes and these modalities together can provide complimentary information.
         [0113]          Confocal microscopy is an optical imaging technique that increases
micrograph contrast and is capable of reconstructing three-dimensional images by using a
spatial pinhole to eliminate out-of-focus light in specimens that are thicker than the focal
plane. Since only one point in the sample is illuminated at a time, 2D or 3D imaging requires
scanning over a regular raster (i.e. a rectangular pattern of parallel scanning lines) in the
specimen.    Three principal scanning variations are commonly employed to produce confocal
microscope images. Fundamentally equivalent confocal operation can be achieved by
employing a laterally translating specimen stage coupled to a stationary illuminating light
beam (stage scanning), a scanned light beam with a stationary stage (beam scanning), or by
maintaining both the stage and light source stationary while scanning the specimen with an
array of light points transmitted through apertures in a spinning Nipkow or Nipkov disk. Each
technique has performance features that make it advantageous for specific confocal
applications, but that limits the usefulness of that feature for other applications.
         [0114]     All confocal microscopes rely on the ability of the technique to produce
high-resolution images, termed optical sections, in sequence through relatively thick sections
or whole-mount specimens. Based on the optical section as the basic image unit, data can be
collected from fixed and stained specimens in single, double, triple, or multiple-wavelength
illumination modes, and the images collected with the various illumination and labeling
strategies will be in register with each other. Live cell imaging and time-lapse sequences are
possible, and digital image processing methods applied to sequences of images allow z-series
and three-dimensional representation of specimens, as well as the time-sequence presentation
of 3D data as four-dimensional imaging. The use of above confocal microscopes is not
                                               -34-

WO 2010/057039                                                           PCT/US2009/064459
limiting as other confocal microscopes now or later discovered are also encompassed in the
embodiments described herein.
         101151     A large number of fluorescent probes are available that, when incorporated
in relatively simple protocols, can stain certain cellular surface markers and/or proteins and
intracellular organelles and structures, e.g., Celltracker, Dil, nuclear vital dyes, and the like.
Fluorescent markers which specifically bind directly or indirectly to certain cell surface
markers can be especially useful for identification of for example unwanted cell types. In one
preferred embodiment, real time in vivo imaging for the presence of encapsulated pluripotent
cells provides a means to detect, and therefore the potential to prevent, teratoma formation
caused from pluripotent stem cells, such as hES or human embryonic gonadal cells or
induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells or parthenote cells and the like. The same means of
detection can also identify pluripotent Stem cells which have escaped or leaked out of the
device (or become un-encapsulated). Identification of such cells can also be performed using
fluorescently labeled promoter genes OCT4 and NANOG that are up-regulated in expression
in pluripotent stem cells. Similarly, certain intracellular fluorescent markers that label nuclei,
the Golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria, and even dyes such as
fluorescently labeled phalloidins that target polymerized actin in cells, are also commercially
available and can provide critical information about the fate of a cell.
         101161    In   another   embodiment,       two-photon   excited  fluorescence    (TPEF)
microscopy is a noninvasive means to monitor differentiation or, stated in the reverse, to
identify pluripotent stem cells (e.g., hESCs or IPS cells or parthenote cells) which did not
differentiate and were inadvertently implanted as a very small percentage of the product cells
that were encapsulated in the device described herein.         Two-photon excited fluorescence
microscopy relies substantially on endogenous sources of contrast, but can also detect, for
example, fibrillar matrix molecules via second harmonic generation. In brief, two-photon
microscopy relies on fluorescence emission similar to that employed by confocal microscopy.
Rice et al. (2007) described that TPEF can be used to reveal quantitative differences in the
biochemical status and the shape of differentiating and nondifferentiating stem cells in two
dimensional (2-D). See Rice et al. (2007) J Biomed Opt. 2007 Nov-Dec;12(6), the disclosure
of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. In one embodiment, pluripotent stem
                                               -35-

WO 2010/057039                                                            PCT/US2009/064459
cells can be genetically modified to express a fluorescent protein, e.g., enhanced green
fluorescence protein, and driven by a pluripotent stem cell promoter (e.g., OCT4 or NANOG
or any other pluripotent stem cell promoter later identified). For those implantable devices
that are deeper than subcutaneous implants, i.e. deep below the skin surface, two-photon
provides for a non-invasive deeper imaging than confocal microscopy. Further, the infrared
light used is less harmful to living cells than visible or ultraviolet exposure, as the photon
energy required for fluorescence excitation only occurs at the plane of focus and is not
experienced by cells or tissues in the out-of-focus planes.
         [0117]     In still another embodiment, ultrasound is portable, essentially harmless,
versatile, and can be done in real-time at the time of implantation of the encapsulated cell
product and/or encapsulated biologically active agent. In particular, high frequency
ultrasound such as that described by VisualSonics. High-resolution imaging enables in vivo
assessment of anatomical structures and hemodynamic function in longitudinal studies of
mammal. For example, Vevo by VisualSonics offers:             (1) ability to perform longitudinal
studies of disease progression and regression in individual subjects; (2) image resolution of
anatomical and physiological structures of down to 30 microns; (3) ability to visualize image
guided needle injection and extraction; (4) microcirculatory and cardiovascular blood flow
assessment; (5) high throughput via user-friendly equipment and research-driven interface;
and (6) open architecture allowing comprehensive measurement and annotations and offline
data analysis. The ability to assess microcirculatory and cardiovascular blood flow will assist
in determining the viability of the cells, e.g. 02 flow and delivery.
        101181      In another embodiment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be
utilized to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue using a contrast agent. Yet, in
another embodiment, computerized tomography (CT) or CT scans can be used to create a
detailed picture of the body's tissues and structure. Again here, a contrast agent is utilized
and makes it easy to visualize abnormal tissue due to specific absorption rates. One use of a
contrast agent such as Indium-1Il     (I-1 11) oxine is for tracking stem cells although it does
have a short half-life. Still, in another embodiment, Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
scans can be used to measure emissions from positron-emitting molecules e.g., carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen to name a few, and provide valuable functional information. In yet
                                                -36-

another embodiment, optical coherence tomography (OCT) or photoacoustic tomography
(PAT) may also be used to examine cells and tissues inside and outside the device. OCT
detects differences in the reflectivity of various tissues while PAT detects ultrasonic waves
created when tissues are heated by exposure to low energy laser light.
         101191     Various methods and techniques or tools, alone or combined, can be
employed to visualize, analyze and assess the implanted cells inside the device in vivo.
These and other technologies now known or later developed can be utilized to the extent they
allow for in vivo imaging and monitoring of the cells and/or agent as described herein.

          101231      Briefly, undifferentiated   human embryonic      stem   (hES)   cells were
 maintained on mouse embryo fibroblasts feeder layers (Specialty Media) in DMEM/F12
 (Mediatech) supplemented with 20% KnockOut serum replacement (KOSR, GIBCO BRL), 1
 mM       nonessential     amino    acids    (GIBCO       BRL),   Glutamax     (GIBCO      BRL),
penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO BRL), 0.55 mM of 2-mercaptoethanol (GIBCO BRL) and 4
ng/mL recombinant human FGF2 (R&D Systems) and alternatively supplemented in 10-20
ng/mL of Activin A (R&D Systems). Human ES cell cultures were manually passaged at
about 1:4 to 1:8, 1:9, or 1:10 split ratio every 5 to 7 days. Prior to differentiation either as
adherent cultures or in cell aggregate suspensions, they were given a brief wash in PBS +1+
(containing Mg** and Ca+*, Invitrogen). Human ES cell lines can include, but are not limited
to, CyT49, CyT203, Cyt25, BGO1 and BG02.

          [01251      The differentiation culture conditions were substantially similar to that
described in D'Amour et al. 2006, supra, and Example 4 below, both describing a 5 step
differentiation protocol: stage 1 (definitive endoderm; d 1- d 4), stage 2 (primitive gut tube or
foregut endoderm; d 5 to d 8), stage 3 (posterior foregut or Pdx 1-positive endoderm; d 9 to d

d 15) and stage 5 (hormone expressing endocrine cell, d 16 or more).
         [01261     At stage 4, retinoic acid (RA) was withdrawn from the stage 3 cultures, the
cultures were washed once with DMEM plus B27 (1:100 Gibco), and then the wash was
replaced with either DMEM+1XB27 supplement alone or with any combinations of or any or
all of the following factors:    Noggin (50 ng/ml), FGF1O (50 ng/ml), KGF (25-50 ng/ml),
EGF (25-50 ng/ml), 1-5% FBS for 4-8 days. In cases where no RA was added, noggin at 30
 100 ng/mL (R&D systems) was added to the media for 1-9 days. Alternatively, no additional
growth factors were added at stage 4. Also, cell-survival agents such as Y-27632, fasudil, H
 1152P, and a mixture comprising insulin/transferrin/selenium (ITS) can be added to the
cultures.
         [01271     Regardless of whether the pancreatic progenitors were produced from
adherent cultures or in cell aggregate suspensions, all pancreatic progenitor cell populations
when transplanted in mammals developed and matured into functional endocrine tissues in
vivo. In vivo production of insulin by the hES-derived transplanted cells is described in the
U.S. Applications and references above, e.g., U.S. Application No. 11/773,944, entitled

 11/773,944 and Kroon et al. 2008 supra, the pancreatic progenitors in this study were wholly
isolated or encapsulated in vivo. Pancreatic progenitor cells were encapsulated using a bio
compatible polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is described in more detail in U.S. Patent No.
7,427,415, entitled IMPLANTATION OF ENCAPSULATED BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS
FOR TREATING DISEASES, which is herein incorporated by reference. PEG-encapsulated
pancreatic progenitors were transplanted under the epididymal fat pad (EFP); serum C
peptide levels at various time points post glucose-stimulation were determined; and
immunohistochemical analysis was done on the PEG-encapsulated explants.           Again, these
methods have been previously described in U.S. Application No. 11/773,944, entitled

were capable of maturing in vivo and contained hormone expressing cells such as insulin,
glucagon and somatostatin.
        [01291      Encapsulation of the pancreatic progenitor cells was also performed using
a medical or mechanical device, e.g., a TheraCyte cell encapsulation device. All references
to TheraCyte cell encapsulation devices are to devices that were purchased directly from the

Pancreatic progenitor cells were either loaded into the devices ex vivo, or once the devices
had been implanted for a period of time to allow for prevascularization of the device, then the
cells were loaded in vivo via the loading port on one side of the device.
        101301      Therefore, the device contains a first membrane which is impermeable to
cells (0.4 microns) but at the same does not restrict movement of oxygen and various
nutrients in and out of the inner membrane, e.g. glucose from outside the inner membrane can
permeate into the capsule containing the mature pancreatic hormone secreting cells, which in
response to the glucose, can secrete insulin which then permeates out of the inner membrane.
The device also contains an outer vascularizing membrane.
        [0131]      In order to use a device for any cell therapy, the device has to wholly
contain the cells in vivo (e.g., immuno-isolate the hES-derived cells from the host).       To
determine the integrity of the TheraCyte device, intact devices containing the pancreatic
progenitor cells were compared to those devices which had perforated holes in the
membranes in vivo. Perforating holes into the devices allows for host cellular invasion and
therefore establish host-graft cell-to-cell contact.
        101321      Two 4.5 pL TheraCyte devices were first prevascularized by surgically
implanting them under the epididymal fat pads (EFP) or subcutaneously (SQ) in each male
severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-beige (Bg) mice. That is, one animal received 2
devices under the EFP, and another animal received 2 devices SQ. These intact but empty

(no pancreatic progenitor cells) devices remained in the animal for a sufficient period of time
allowing for host vasculature structures to form and associate with the device, e.g., at least 2
to 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, about 1.5 x 106 cells pancreatic progenitor cells derived from hES
cells were loaded into each of the 4 devices. At the same time as the animals with the
prevascularized devices were being loaded, 3 other animals were implanted with two
modified Theracyte devices wherein an original Theracyte device of the same size (4.5 piL)
was modified with perforations in the membranes of the device. These perforated devices (2
perforated devices per animal) were loaded with cells ex vivo with about the same dosage of
cells as was loaded into of the perforated devices.     Also at the same time, two positive
controls were carried along side these experiments and both animals were grafted with
pancreatic progenitors on Gelfoam as described in U.S. Application No. 11/773,944, entitled

although in one animal two grafts were placed under the EFP and in the other animal only
one graft was placed in the EFP. Table I summarizes the results of the above experiments.

 See Table 1. Additionally, to determine the integrity of the devices, some animals were
 sacrificed and immunohistochemical examination of the devices was performed.
          [01341    Applicants previously demonstrated that serum human C-peptide levels
below 50 pM, or insulin levels below 25 pM, are insignificant to demonstrate that insulin
secreting cells are responsive to glucose in vivo.     This same standard was used in these
studies. The results of the studies are shown in Table 1. Both the original Theracyte device
and the modified Theracyte device after 8, 12 and 15 weeks had comparable serum human C
peptide levels (animal nos. 675-676 & 679-681), with the exception of animal number 681 at
30 minutes post glucose stimulation whereby the serum C-peptide levels was much higher
than any other animal at that time period.
          101351    First with regard to the integrity of the TheraCyte encapsulating device,
standard hematoxylin and eosin stains of the original Theracyte device and the modified
Theracyte device (animal nos. 675-676          and 679-681,    respectively) were performed.
Microscopic examination of these devices showed that the original Theracyte devices have
various host vasculature structures including vascular type cells surrounding the device, but
these similar structures were not observed invading the inner cell impermeable membrane
and into the space containing the hES-derived cells. That is, there was no host vasculature
structures observed inside the inner cell impermeable membrane housing the hES-derived
cells, or the graft. In contrast, microscopic examination of the modified Theracyte devices
showed that not only was there host vasculature structures associated on the outside of the
device, but there were vasculature structures and vascular cells found inside the perforated
inner cell impermeable membrane.         Hence, the original TheraCyte devices can wholly
contain the hES-derived cells and host cells and tissues were not observed in the space
housing the hES-derived cells.
         [01361     In summary, the TheraCyte device is capable of wholly encapsulating
(isolating) the hES-derived cells in vivo and the pancreatic progenitors can survive and
mature to functioning hormone-secreting cells in vivo in these devices.
         [01371     In addition to demonstrating the integrity of the TheraCyte device, the
present studies also demonstrate that the wholly intact devices allow for sufficient oxygen
and various nutrients exchanged between the contained hES-derived cells and the host
                                              -43-

WO 2010/057039                                                          PCT/US2009/064459
milieu, and the pancreatic progenitors are capable of surviving and maturing in vivo. For
example, serum human C-peptide levels in the prevascularized devices at 9 and 12 weeks
were not as robust as the equivalent time point as compared to the controls (animals 682 and
684). However, by the    15 th week (post-implant with cells), serum human C-peptide levels in
the prevascularized devices were comparable to the unencapsulated (Gelfoam) controls.
         [01381    Further, animals with the original Theracyte (prevascularized) devices
were sacrificed and the devices (or explants) extracted (animal nos. 675 & 676).
Immunohistochemistry was performed substantially again as described in and Kroon et al.
2008, supra by fixing the extracted devices and/or the explants and cutting the 10- sections
into thin micrometer sections. Sections were washed with PBS twice, followed by PBST
(PBS/0.2% (wt/vol) Tween20; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blocking was done for lh at 24 *C
with 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson Immuno Research Labs)/PBSTr (PBS/0.1% (wt/vol)
Triton X-100 (Sigma)). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA
(Sigma)/PBSTr for grafts. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4'C overnight and secondary
antibodies for about I h 15 min in a moisture chamber. The following primary antibodies and
dilutions were used; guinea pig anti-insulin (INS), 1:500 (Dako,A0564); rabbit anti
somatostatin (SST), 1:500 (Dako, A0566); goat anti-somatostatin (SST),1:300 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, SC-7819); goat anti-glucagon (GCG), 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC
7780). Imaging was done by confocal microscopy (Nikon, Eclipse 80i, Ci).
         [01391    Immunohistochemical        examination      of   the   original   Theracyte
devices/explants clearly demonstrated singly-positive hormonal cells, e.g., GCG, INS and
SST expressing cells.    This data supports the serum human C-peptide data demonstrating
glucose responsiveness of the transplanted hES-derived cells.       The presence of hormone
secreting cells demonstrates that pancreatic progenitors are capable of survival and
maturation in vivo, even when wholly encapsulated.
         101401    The above studies clearly demonstrate the efficacy of both the original and
modified TheraCyte devices to wholly contain the hES-derived pancreatic progenitor cells
without host cellular invasion across the inner cell impermeable membrane. These studies
also demonstrate that the devices inner cell impermeable membrane, although impermeable
to cells, is permeable to oxygen and various nutrients required for hES-derived pancreatic

        [01431       Pancreatic progenitor cell populations were generated substantially as
described above in Example 1. No devices in this study were prevascularized, and all
TheraCyte devices (4.5 tL) were loaded ex vivo with at least 1.5x106 cells (1.5M) or 4.5x10 6
cells (4.5M) in each device. Three devices containing              1.5M cells were implanted
subcutaneously (TC SQ 1.5M), and 3 devices containing 4.5x106 cells (4.5M), or about 15
pL, were implanted subcutaneously (TC SQ 4.5M) ex vivo.              In contrast and as controls,
animals with implanted unencapsulated pancreatic progenitors were carried along side the
encapsulated, but not prevascularized, experiments. Three mice were each implanted
subcutaneously with two Gelfoam constructs loaded with about 1.9-2.4x1 06 cells (total for
two constructs), or about 4 ptL/ construct, and 2 mice were implanted under the EFP with two
Gelfoam constructs loaded with about with about 1.9-2.4x 106 cells (total for two constructs),
or about 4 ptL/ construct. 'Fable 2 summarizes the results of the above experiments.

        [01441      Although Example 1 demonstrated that hES-derived cells can survive,
mature and function in vivo in prevascularized devices, based on Table 2 prevascularization
is not essential for cell survival, growth and/or maturation. Table 2 compares encapsulated
pancreatic progenitor cells with unencapsulated pancreatic progenitor cells on Gelfoam, the
later has been well documented to produce functioning hormone secreting cells in vivo, see

 Kroon et al. 2008 supra. In fact, at 60 minutes post glucose-stimulation, serum C-peptide
 levels from the encapsulated cells were comparable to serum C-peptides levels observed from
cells which were unencapsulated.      Compare animal numbers 833-838 to animal numbers
 819-823.    In fact, the encapsulated cells performed better than the unencapsulated when
implanted subcutaneously, e.g. compare animal numbers 833-835 (TC SQ 1.5M) to 819-821
(SQ 1.9-2.4M). Thus, host-graft cell-to-cell contact is not essential because as clearly
demonstrated in this example, transplanted wholly encapsulated cells survive, grow and
mature in the absence of any host-graft cell-to-cell contact all together.
         [01451      The methods, compositions, and devices described herein are presently
representative of preferred embodiments and are exemplary and are not intended as
limitations on the scope of the patent.    Changes, alternatives, modifications and variations
therein and other uses will occur to those skilled in the art which are encompassed within the
spirit of the invention and are defined by the scope of the disclosure.           For example,
TheraCyte devices come in 4.5 tL, 20 tL, and 40 tL sizes, and therefore one of ordinary
skill in art can scale-up the above studies if employing a device which is capable of
containing more cells. Further, since Kroon et al. 2008 supra has demonstrated the efficacy
of pancreatic progenitors in rescuing streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic mice before and
after graft implantation, one of ordinary skill in the art can perform analogous studies using
the encapsulated cells described herein. Also, methods of purifying or enriching for certain
hES-derived populations are described in detail in U.S. Application 12/107,020, entitled
METHODS FOR PURIFYING ENDODERM AND PANCREATIC ENDODERM CELLS

        [01461      Because cell transplantation is hindered by the lack of available cell
sources and operational and logistical problems, there is a need to provide an unlimited cell
source for transplantation at times convenient to the patient.
        [0147]      Human ES cells were differentiated substantially as described in Examples
 I and 2 and Kroon et al., 2008, supra, as well as in Tables 3a-h below. At day 14 of
differentiation, the pancreatic progenitors were centrifuged and then resuspended in freezing
media containing DMEM with 30% Xeno-free Knockout Serum Replacement, 25mM
HEPES and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide solution. Cells were aliquoted into freezing vials. Cells
were equilibrated in freezing medium for about 15 minutes at ambient temperature, then 45
minutes at 40 C, then placed on ice and put in a programmed freezer which was equilibrated to
0 C.
        [01481      The cells and the freezing chamber were brought to -9 0 C at a rate of 2'C
/min. The chamber and the sample were held at this temperature for about 10 minutes, and
the vials were seeded manually. The sample was held at -9 'C for about 10 minutes and then
cooled at a rate of 0.2 0 C /minute until the sample reached -40'C. The freezing chamber was
subsequently cooled at a rate of 25'C /minute until the sample reached about -150'C. The
vialed cells were then moved to the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen storage freezer.
        [01491      At desired times, the vials was rapidly thawed by transferring the cells to a
37 0C. water bath. The cells were transferred to a 15 ml sterile tube, containing DMEM with
B-27 (1:100) and KGF + EGF (each at 50ng/mL), mixed gently and spun briefly at 50 x g.
Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in the same buffer plus DNAse at
25ptg/mL and placed in rotation culture.
        101501      Cell survival was quantitated by photographing the pancreatic progenitor
aggregates when they have been swirled to the center of the tissue culture well, promptly
upon thawing before any significant cell loss has occurred, and at 4 days post-thaw when the
decrease in cell mass has completed. The area occupied by the cells in the photographs was
quantitated, and expressed as a percent survival at 4 days post-thaw. In this example, at least
                                               -48-

52% survival was obtained. The morphology of cultured pancreatic progenitor cells after
cryopreservation and thawing was identical to that of fresh cells.
        101511       After 4 days of post-thaw culturing, the cells were loaded in devices
substantially as described above and surgically implanted in the mammal as described above.
The cryopreserved cells were capable of developing and maturing into functioning hormone
secreting and acinar cells of the pancreas in vivo similar to that described for fresh pancreatic
progenitor cell aggregates. See Example 4.
        101521       Hence, cryopreservation of in vitro human pancreatic progenitors derived
from hES        cells has little or no effect on development after implantation. Thus,
cryopreservation proves to be a reliable method of storing hESC-derived pancreatic
progenitor cells suitable for transplantation.

Pluripotent stem cell culture conditions
         [01531      Culturing, proliferation and maintenance      of pluripotent stem cells, in
particular ES and IPS cells, are performed substantially as described in D'Amour et al. 2005
& 2006 and Kroon et al. 2008, supra. ES base medium of DMEM-F12 / 1% Glutamax / 1%
Non-essential amino acids / I %Pen-Strep / 0.2% b-mercaptoethanol was used. For stage 0 or
proliferation of hES cells, various growth factors and or insulin and insulin-like growth
factors levels were kept very low. Feeder-free pluripotent stem cells were cultured using low
levels of human serum.         The pluripotent stem cells were maintained using a Rho-kinase
inhibitor Y27632.      It will be appreciated that other Rho-kinase inhibitors can be used with
similar results. The ES or pluripotent stem cell culture conditions are substantially similar to
Examples 1 and 2 as described above.
        101541       It will be appreciated that the ES base medium can routinely contain about
20% Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) or Xeno-free (XF) Knockout serum replacement.

WO 2010/057039                                                            PCT/US2009/064459
         [0155]      It will be appreciated that hES cell cultures routinely contain about
Ong/mL, about 4ng/ml or about 1Ong/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).                  As
previously demonstrated, under certain conditions low levels of Activin A help promote
pluripotent stem cell proliferation without promoting hES cell differentiation. Hence,
pluripotent stem cell cultures typically contain about 5 ng/mL, about lOng/mL or about
20ng/mL of Activin A or B, or other similarly biologically active TGF-P growth factor
families, for example, at least GDF-8 and GDF-11.            Still in other pluripotent stem cell
cultures, an Errb2-binding ligand such as heregulin at low levels also helps to promote hES
cell proliferation, for example, at about 5 to lOng/mL. Also, any combination of different or
low levels of bFGF, Activin A, B or other TGF-3 growth factor family members, specifically
GDF-8 and -11, and Errb2-binding ligands such as heregulin can be employed to promote
hES cell cultures, so long as low levels of the growth factors are maintained as to promote
proliferation of hES cells and their pluripotency and not differentiation of the cells thereof.
Embodiments described herein describe various growth factors (in some cases large proteins)
in maintaining and proliferating pluripotent stem cell cultures, however, the high cost of
these proteins on a large-scale manufacturing basis makes is cost-prohibitive.          As such,
identifying and characterizing certain small molecules to replace the larger growth factor
proteins may be beneficial. One such molecule is nor-epinephrine (NE), which is described
in more detail in U.S. Application 61/172,998, titled SMALL MOLECULES SUPPORTING
PLURIPOTENT CELL GROWTH AND METHODS THEREOF, and filed 27 April 2009,
and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, about 5ng/mL,
about 1Ong/mL, about 20ng/mL, about 30ng/mL, about 40ng/mL, about 50ng/mL, about
60ng/mL, about 70ng/mL, about 80ng/mL, about 90ng/mL, about 100ng/mL or more is
employed to maintain pluripotent stem cultures, for example, hES or iPS cultures. In one
preferred embodiment, about 50ng/mL can be employed in hES cell cultures.
        [01561       It will be appreciated that proliferation of pluripotent stem cells are
routinely sustained on fibroblast feeder cells, Alternatively, ES cells can be cultured on an
extracellular matrix coated plates (Corning).       Further, Bodnar et al. (Geron Corporation,
Menlo Park, California, USA) describe growing hES cell cultures on a monolayer of
extracellular matrix, which matrix was derived by lysing fibroblast feeder layer in U.S. Patent

in 6,800,480, the disclosure of which is herein expressly incorporated by reference.
However, in a preferred embodiment, feeder-free pluripotent stem cells are cultured using
low levels of human serum, for example, about 0.1%, about 0.2%, about 0.3%, about 0.4%,
about 0.5%, about 0.6%, about 0.7%, about 0.8%, about 0.9%, about 1%, about 1.2%, about
1.4%, about 1.6%, about 1.8%, about 2% to about 10% or more in a base ES cell medium.
Human serum can be added to the base media simultaneously thereby obviating any need to
pre-coat tissue culture dishes as contemplated in U.S. Patent in 6,800,480 or that provided by
Corning. Use of human serum for culturing, maintaining and proliferation of pluripotent
stem cell cultures is described in more detail in U.S. Application 11/875,057,             entitled

incorporated by reference in its entirety.
         [01571 Pluripotent stem cells can also be maintained with the addition of a Rho
kinase family of inhibitors, for example at least Y27632. Y27632 has recently been found to
prevent apoptosis, as well as enhance the survival and cloning efficiency of dissociated
human pluripotent stem cells without affecting self-renewal properties or pluripotency.
Although, embodiments described herein use Y27632 due to its commercial availability,
other Rho kinase inhibitors can be employed and still be within the scope of the invention.
Pluripotent stem cell differentiation conditions for Stage 1
         [01581      Directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, in particular ES and IPS
cells, were performed substantially as described in D'Amour et al. 2005 & 2006 and Kroon et
al. 2008, supra and in above related U.S. Applications, including U.S. Application
61/171,759, titled CELL COMPOSITIONS DERIVED FROM DEDIFFERENTIATED

in their entireties.
         101591      Prior to differentiation Stage 1, or at day 0 of the differentiation process,
pluripotent stem cells were cultured in a medium comprising of RPMI1640 / 1% Glutamax /
1%Pen-Strep and substantially no serum and/or about 0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA).
Also,      1:5000     or    1:1000     or    about    0.02%     or   0.1%,      respectively,    of

Insulin/Transferrin/Selenium (ITS) supplement was added.          In addition, various growth
factors including a TGF-p super family growth factor and a Wnt family member were added
to the differentiation medium.
        [01601       It will be appreciated that the added TGF-p super family growth factors
include but are not limited to Activin A, Activin B, GDF-8 or GDF-l 1.                 In some
embodiments a Wnt pathway activator can be used. In another embodiment, Wnt-3a is used
in conjunction with one of the TGF-p super family growth factors. In a further preferred
embodiment, about 50 ng/mL of Wnt3a is employed with about 1OOng/mL of a TGF-p super
family member such as Activin A, Activin B and GDF-8 and -11.                  Still in another
embodiment, small molecules which activate similar signal transduction pathways can be
substituted for the growth factors. See, for example, Borowiak, M. et al. (2009) describing
two small molecules which direct differentiation of mouse and human embryonic stem cells
to endoderm. Borowiak, M. et al. (2009) Cell Stem Cell, 4(4):348-358 is herein incorporated
by reference in its entirety.
        101611       The pluripotent cells were incubated in the above media conditions for at
least 24 hours, after which time the medium was exchanged to a medium comprising
RPMII640 / 1% Glutamax / 1% Pen-Strep and a slight increase in FBS, aproximately 0.2%
FBS and further containing about lOOng/mL of a TGF-            super family member.      A Wnt
family member was not added. It will be appreciated that a Wnt family member may be
added to the culture after about 24 hours.
        101621       The cells were cultured in this medium for another 24 hours. After about a
total of 48 hours since the cells had been differentiation (day 0 to day 2), the cells in the
culture comprise differentiated definitive endoderm cells.
        [01631       It will be appreciated that the total number of days of differentiation in
stage 1, starting with day 0 (pluripotent stem cells), can be about 1-3 days, preferably about

differentiation, the cells in the culture will comprise    about 10%, about 20%, about 30%,
about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about

         [01641     Methods for determining the composition of the cultures has been
previously described in the above related applications, but principally by RNA and protein
assays well known in the art. Definitive endoderm cells express increased levels of certain
signature cell surface markers such as SOX17 and FOXA2, but can also express increased
levels of CER and CXCR4, but do not appreciably express HNF4-a which is expressed
appreciably in foregut endoderm (or PDX1-negative foregut) cells.         Definitive endoderm
cells also do not appreciably express markers observed in later Stage 3, 4 or 5 cells such as or
PDX1, NNF6, SOX9 and PROX 1 expressed in PDXI-positive foregut endoderm cells, or
PDXI, NKX6., PTFIA, CPA and cMYC expressed in PDX1-positive pancreatic progenitor
or PDXl/NKX6.1 co-positive pancreatic progenitor cells,          or NGN3, PAX4, ARX and
NKX2.2 expressed in endocrine precursor cells, or INS, GCG, GHRL, SST or PP expressed
in polyhormonal or singly hormonal pancreatic endocrine cells.
Differentiation conditions for Stage 2
         [0165]     After about 48 hours (about 2 days) of differentiation of pluripotent stem
cells to DE, the DE differentiation media was replaced by another media condition which
promotes human foregut endoderm (PDX 1-negative foregut endoderm) formation or Stage 2
cells. This cell culture medium comprises RPMl1640 / 1% Glutamax / 1% Pen-Strep and
0.2% FBS or a further increase in FBS, e.g. about 2% FBS. Similar to the above Stage I
culture medium, about 1:5000 or 1:1000 or about 0.02% or 0.1%, respectively, of ITS
supplement was added.
         [0166]     It will be appreciated that the DE differentiation media is not always
supplemented with ITS.
         [0167]     However, DE differentiation growth factors such as TGF-$ super family
growth factors or Wnt family members were intentionally not included in the medium. A
TGF-p kinase inhibitor was added to the medium.
         [01681     Because removal of TGF-$ super family members is beneficial for proper
foregut endoderm formation, use of TGF-p super family member inhibitors such as a TGF-3
kinase inhibitors, ensures that the effects of the action of TGF-p super family members are
substantially inhibited.   This allows efficient direct differentiation of the DE to foregut
                                              -53-

endoderm     (PDX1-negative      foregut endoderm)      without the   lingering effects of DE
differentiation in the culture.
         [01691      Instead of TGF-p super family members, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF)
was added to the culture to promote foregut endoderm formation. Cells were incubated in this
media for about 24 hours, after which the media was replaced with substantially the same
media except that now the TGF-p kinase inhibitor was removed from the culture. The cells
were then incubated in this media (minus TGF-p kinase inhibitor) for 5 days with media
changes.
         [01701      It will be appreciated that the cells can be incubated in this media (minus
TGF-p kinase inhibitor) for up to about 3 days for Stage 2 with permissible media changes.
The total number of days of differentiation, starting with day 0 and pluripotent stem cells, is
about 3-5 days, preferably about 4-5 days, and more preferable, about 5 days.
         101711      Again, methods for determining the composition of the cultures has been
previously described in the above related applications, but principally by RNA and protein
assays well known in the art. Foregut endoderm cells, or PDXI-negative foregut endoderm
cells, express increased levels of certain signature cell surface markers such as Sox 17, HNF3
p and  HNF4-a. This is distinguished from DE of Stage I which does not appreciably express
HNF4-a, but does appreciably express the other two markers, Soxl7 and HNF3-p. PDXI
negative foregut cells also do not appreciably express markers observed in later Stage 3, 4 or
5 cells such as or PDX1, NNF6, SOX9 and PROX 1 expressed in PDX1-positive foregut
endoderm cells, or PDX1, NKX6.1, PTF1A, CPA and cMYC expressed in PDXI-positive
pancreatic progenitor or PDXI/NKX6.1 co-positive pancreatic progenitor cells, or NGN3,
PAX4, ARX and NKX2.2 expressed in endocrine precursor cells, or INS, GCG, GHRL, SST
or PP expressed in polyhormonal or singly hormonal pancreatic endocrine cells.
Differentiation conditions for Stage 3
         [01721      To promote differentiation of PDXI-positive foregut endoderm cells from
PDX 1-negative foregut endoderm cells of Stage 2, the PDX 1-negative foregut endoderm cell
culture medium was exchanged and incubated in a medium comprising DMEM high glucose
/ 1% Glutamax / 1% Pen-Step / 1 % B27 Supplement with either about 1 or 2 uM of Retinoic

Acid (RA), about 0.25 uM of KAAD-Cylcopamine and with or without about 50 ng/mL of
Noggin. Alternatively, some cultures instead of receiving RA, received I nM to about 3nM of
aromatic     retinoid   (E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthylenyl)-1
propenyl] benzoic acid (TTNPB). Still other cultures received about ImM of dorsomorphin.
The cells were incubated in this culture medium for about 3 days. It will be appreciated that
cells can be incubated about 1-5 days, preferably 2-4 days, and more preferably 3 days.
        101731      Similar to the above, methods for determining the composition of the
cultures has been previously described in the above related applications, but principally by
RNA and protein assays well known in the art.            PDXl-positive foregut endoderm cells
express increased levels of certain signature cell surface markers besides PDXI such as Sox9,
H-NF6 and PROX, but do not appreciably express other markers of later Stage 4 or 5 cells
such as or PDX1, NKX6.1, PTF1A, PCA and cMYC found in pancreatic progenitor cells, or
NGN3, PAX4, ARX and NKX2.2 expressed in endocrine precursor cells, or INS, GCG,
GHRL, SST or PP expressed in polyhormonal or singly hormonal pancreatic endocrine cells.
Differentiation conditions for Stage 4
        10174]      To    further   promote      differentiation   of  properly   differentiated
PDX 1/NKX6.1 co-positive pancreatic progenitor cells from PDX 1-positive foregut endoderm
cells, the PDX1-positive foregut endoderm cell culture medium was exchanged and
incubated in a medium comprising a similar base medium as in Stage 3 above, DMEM high
glucose / 1% Glutamax / 1% Pen-Step / 1 % B27 Supplement, except that there is no RA or
retinoic acid derivative such as TTNPB or noggin or dorsomorphin. Instead, about 50ng/mL
of Noggin, KGF and FGF was added to the culture. It will be appreciated that about 10 to
100 ng/mL of epidermal and fibroblast growth factors (EGF and FGF) can be added to the
culture. There is preferably about 10 to 50 ng/mL, or preferably, about 10 ng/mL of EGF and
about 50ng/mL of FGF added to the cultures.          Alternatively no FGF can be added to the
cultures, or about 25 to 100 ng/mL each of Noggin, KGF, FGF, or preferably about 50ng/mL
of Noggin, KGF and FGF was used.            The cells were kept in this medium with media
exchanges for about 4 to 5 days. It will be appreciated that cells can be kept in medium for
                                               -55-

Transplantation & purification of PDX 1-positive pancreatic progenitors
        [01761     After about 3-5 days in the Stage 4 cell culture medium, the cell cultures
were either prepared for: i) flow cytometry separation and/or purification and analysis; ii)
encapsulation into cell encapsulation devices as discussed in more detail above; and/or iii)
transplanted into the mammal. Alternatively, the cell culture from Stage 4 was transferred or
adapted in media of DMEM high glucose / 1% Glutamax / 1% Pen-Step / I % B27
Supplement minus the growth factors for about 1 to 2 days, before flow cytometry and/or
transplantation.
        10177]     Detailed descriptions for enriching, separating, isolating and/or purifying
pancreatic progenitors and/or pancreatic endocrine cells or endocrine precursor cells are
described in detail in U.S. Application Number 12/107,020, entitled METHODS FOR
PURIFYING ENDODERM AND PANCREATIC ENDODERM CELLS DERIVED FROM
hES CELLS, filed 8 April 2008, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
        101781      Briefly, CD142 was used to enrich for PDX1-positive             pancreatic
progenitor (or pancreatic epithelia cells or PE) by quickly washed with PBS and
enzymatically dissociated into a substantially single cell suspension using TrypLE and 3%
FBS/PBS/lmM EDTA (sorting buffer). The single cell suspension was passed through a 40
 100 uM filter and then pelleted and washed again in a sorting buffer, re-pelleted and then
resuspended again as a substantially single cell suspension in sorting buffer at about lx108
                                             -56-

WO 2010/057039                                                          PCT/US2009/064459
cells/mL.    The resuspended cells were then incubated with Phycoerythrin conjugated anti
mouse CD142 antibody (BD PHARMIGEN m) at 1Oul per lx107cells. The cells were washed
at least once with volume sorting buffer, pelleted and resuspended again as a substantially
single cell suspension in sorting buffer containing a solution of anti-Phycoerythrin
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and incubated. Cells were washed at least once and immuno
magnetic selection of CD142-positive cells was performed. The pre-sort, bound and flow
through fractions were each collected and counter-stained with anti-PDX1 and/or anti
CHGA.
         101791      The bound fraction was highly enriched for CD142-positive cells and for
PDX1-positive pancreatic progenitor cells as compared to the pre-sorted and flow through
fractions.   See Table 9 of U.S. Application Number 12/107,020.          For example, the anti
CD142-positive or bound fraction was comprised of about 71% PDX1-positive pancreatic
progenitor cells as compared to about 22% PDXI-positive pancreatic progenitor cells in the
pre-sort fraction and about 8% PDX 1-positive pancreatic progenitor cells in the flow through
fraction. Hence, there was about a 3-fold enrichment in PDX1-positive pancreatic progenitor
cells in the anti-CD142-positive or bound fraction relative to the pre-sort population. Also,
the CD142-positive or bound fraction was depleted of chromograninA (CHGA)-positive cells
indicating that multi- or singly-hormonal endocrine cells were not selected or enriched in this
population.    CD142 therefore can be used for positive immuno-selection to enrich and/or
purify for PDX1-postiive pancreatic progenitors or epithelial cells, whereas the flow through
fraction (the fraction or cells not binding to the antibody column; or CD142-) is enriched with
pancreatic endocrine type cells.       Also, refer to Table 10 of U.S. Application Number
 12/107,020.

         101801      To determine whether the PDXI-positive          pancreatic progenitor cell
cultures or enriched populations, including the cryopreserved populations, were fully capable
of developing and maturing in vivo to glucose sensitive insulin secreting cells, the progenitor

WO 2010/057039                                                           PCT/US2009/064459
populations were loaded into the encapsulating devices similar to that described above in
Examples I and 2 using either a Hamilton syringe with a blunted appropriately sized gauge
needle or centrifuge loading method per the manufacturer's procedure.
         101811     Before loading the cells into the device, the device was deemed suitable
for transplantation and use in mammals including humans, e.g., the device has passed typical
standards of quality control including sterilization. Because membrane components of the
device are likely to be comprised of hydrophobic membranes, e.g. PTFE and therefore repel
water, sterilizing the devices is typically accomplished by wetting the devices in an alcohol
solvent (e.g. 95% ETOH) and then washing them in saline solution repeatedly.             Devices
therefore should be kept moist prior to loading. Ideally any device loading method is
performed under sterile conditions ensuring that any device component which is implanted
will not be contaminated with unwanted cells.
         101821     Device loading can be performed by either using a Hamilton syringe or the
like plus a blunted appropriately sized gauge sterile needle (size will vary depending on the
diameter of the port of the device) or the like, e.g., a 22 gauge needle.          The needle is
connected to a the appropriate Hamilton syringe and contains about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,
40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100 or more pL of cell volume which reflects a
therapeutically effective amount or dose of cells. The needle is then inserted through at least
one a port of the device and through to the lumen (or chamber or reservoir) but without
touching the walls of device.      Substantially the entire contents of the syringe are expelled
slowly into the device while at the same time the needle is being withdrawn.
         101831     Alternatively, another method of loading the device using a needle is by
using a sterile plastic or silicone port tube which connects the device port to the needle which
is inserted into the port but not in the lumen. In this method, a silicone adhesive is injected
into the silicone port tube, walling or sealing off the device port. The port tube is then cut off
and inspected for leaks or breaches.
         [01841 To load the device using a centrifuge method, a certain cell volume containing
a therapeutically effective amount or dose of cells is drawn up in a micropipette tip and the
tip contacted with the device port. The device and the pipette tip can also be put into a larger
container or centrifuge conical tube, either immobilized or not. Often certain volumes of
                                                -58-

WO 2010/057039                                                         PCT/US2009/064459
media is layered on top of the cell suspension in the pipette tip and also in the larger conical
tube.   The conical tube in then centrifuge at about 1000 rpms for a few minutes, preferably
20 seconds up to about 2 minutes or until cells are loaded into the device. Then great care is
used to remove the loading components and secure the loaded device.
        101851      The encapsulated cells in the device were then prepared for implantation
into a mammal, e.g., immuno-compromised mice such as SCID/Bg, rat, larger mammal or
human patient. Methods of implanting the encapsulated cells and device is substantially as
that described above in Examples 1 and 2 and Kroon et al., 2008, except in Kroon et al. the
cells are implanted on a GELFOAM and not contained inside a device. However, because
the encapsulated cell population contains substantially a progenitor population similar to that
described by Kroon et al. 2008 and U.S. Patent No. 7, 534,608, titled METHODS OF
PRODUCING         PANCREATIC       HORMONES,         filed July   5, 2007,    which   is herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety, assays for determining cell functionality were
substantially the same. Briefly, the animals were tested about every two, three or four weeks
by injecting them with a bolus of arginine or glucose, preferably glucose, which if the
encapsulated cells have properly matured into now beta cells in vivo, will secrete insulin in
response to the glucose. In short, the mature beta cells are responsive to glucose not unlike
naturally occurring beta cells. Blood was collected from the mammal to determine levels of
human C-peptide which is secreted from the human transplanted progenitor cells having
matured into human beta cells. Human C-peptide was detected in animal serum as early as 4
to 6 weeks after transplantation and the levels of human C-peptide increase over time as more
progenitors or endocrine precursor cells mature into properly functioning beta cells.
Typically amounts of human C-peptide above 50 pM were considered an indication of
function of the transplanted cells. It was previously shown that engrafted cells from the
PDXI-positive pancreatic progenitors faithfully give rise to endocrine cells expressing
markers and physiological characteristic of functioning pancreatic hormone-secreting cells.
See Kroon et al. 2009, supra and U.S. Application 11/773,944, titled METHODS OF
PRODUCING PANCREATIC HORMONES filed July 5, 2007, which is herein incorporated
by reference in its entirety.

WO 2010/057039                                                             PCT/US2009/064459
         [01861     Immuno-suppression is contemplated for certain mammals for an initial
interim period until the progenitors inside the device fully mature and are responsive to
glucose. In some mammals immuno-suppression regimens may be for about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or
more weeks, and likely depend on the mammal.
         101871     Lastly, similar to Kroon et al. 2008, the encapsulated cells not only
matured into pancreatic islet clusters with endocrine cells but also developed into islet
associated cells such as acinar cells. Thus, the transplanted PDXl-positive pancreatic
progenitors were not committed to becoming just singly-hormonal endocrine secreting cells
but were capable of maturing and developing into what is substantially similar to a human
islet, comprising both endocrine and acinar cells.       And this in vivo maturation and glucose
responsiveness of the transplanted cells was observed whether the progenitor cells
(PDXI/NKX6.1       co-positive; endocrine precursors, or certain poly-hormonal or singly
hormonal cells) were cultured and differentiated in vitro and subsequently transplanted, or
whether certain progenitors were purified or enriched before transplantation, or whether they
were previously made from one or more batches and cryopreserved, thawed and adapted in
culture before transplantation.
         [01881     Briefly, after transplant, the transplanted cells were allowed to differentiate
and further mature in vivo. To determine whether the transplanted cells had normal
physiological function as a naturally occurring beta cell for example, levels of human insulin
were determined by testing levels of human C-peptide. Human C-peptide is cleaved or
processed from human pro-insulin, hence, the detection of human C-peptide, and not
endogenous mouse C-peptide, indicates that insulin secretion is derived from the grafted
(exogenous) cells.
         101891     Glucose stimulated human C-peptide secretion of the transplanted cells in
serum was measured at various time points post transplant.             It will be appreciated that
glucose stimulated human C-peptide secretion can be measured at various time points, e.g. at
least 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and more days.         Glucose stimulated human C-peptide
levels could be acutely measured in the serum as early as about 15 minutes post-glucose
administration or injection. Blood was withdrawn from the animals at about 15, 30 and 60
minutes time intervals post glucose administration. The serum was separated from the blood
                                                 -60-

WO 2010/057039                                                          PCT/US2009/064459
cells through centrifugation in micro-containers as described by the manufacturer (Becton
Dickinson).     The ELISA analysis was performed of the serum using ultrasensitive human
specific C-peptide ELISA plates (Alpco).        In general, more than the majority of animals
receiving the encapsulated transplanted cells responded to glucose as demonstrated by levels
greater than threshold levels 50 pM of human C-peptide.
         [0190]      In summary, wholly encapsulated cells by the above device does not affect
maturation of the cells nor the physiological function of the cells once they have matured.
Further, the amelioration of hypoglycemia in these diabetic induced animals was observed
and was substantially similar to that previously described in Kroon et al. (2008) supra, as well
as in U.S. Patent No. 7, 534, 608, although neither described wholly encapsulated
transplanted cells or grafts. These references are herein incorporated by reference in their
