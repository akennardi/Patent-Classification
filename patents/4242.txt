Aqueous Dispersion of Polymer Particles with Acorn Morphology
Background of the Invention

wherein the pigment volume concentration of the formulated paint is at least 11.
[0002]     Emulsion polymers that are useful as vehicles for coatings applications are well
documented in the prior art, but there is an on-going need to develop new binder systems that
exhibit improved and/or differentiated performance, such as hot-block resistance, relative to the
current state of the art.
Summary of the Invention
[0003]     The present invention addresses a need in the art by providing a composition
comprising 1) an aqueous dispersion of polymer particles having a particle size as measured by
dynamic light scattering in the range of from 40 nm to 300 nm, wherein the polymer particles
have a core-shell morphology wherein the core protuberates from the shell; wherein the core
comprises less than 0.09 structural units of a phosphorus acid monomer, based on the weight of
the core; wherein the weight-to-weight ratio of the shell to the core is in the range of from 3:1 to
50:1; and 2) pigment particles with a refractive index in the range of from 2.0 and 3.0, wherein
the pigment volume concentration of the pigment particles is at least 11. The composition of the
present invention is useful for improving block resistance in coatings applications.

[0018]     In a preferred method of making the aqueous dispersions of polymer particles, a first
monomer emulsion is advantageously prepared by contacting water, butyl acrylate, methyl
methacrylate or styrene, allyl methacrylate, sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate, and methacrylic
acid under emulsion polymerization conditions to form a precursor to the protuberating core.
The precursor to the protuberating core (the preform) is isolated and characterized. Then, water,
the precursor, and a monomer emulsion of butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid,
sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate are reacted in a separate and distinct step from the
polymerization of the precursor under emulsion polymerization conditions to form the stable
aqueous dispersion of polymer particles with acorn morphology.
[0019]     In another preferred method of making the aqueous dispersion, the polymer particles
are made via a two-stage approach where a first monomer emulsion is advantageously prepared
by contacting water, butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate or styrene, allyl methacrylate, sodium
4-vinylbenzenesulfonate, and methacrylic acid under emulsion polymerization conditions to
form a dispersion of polymer particles. In the same reactor, the dispersion of polymer particles is
then reacted with a second monomer emulsion of butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate,
methacrylic acid, and sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate under emulsion polymerization
conditions to form the stable aqueous dispersion of polymer particles with acorn morphology.
[0020]     The composition may include other ingredients selected from the group consisting of
dispersants, pigments, defoamers, surfactants, solvents, additional binders, extenders,
coalescents, biocides, opaque polymers, and colorants. It has been surprisingly discovered that
pigmented aqueous dispersions of polymer particles with acorn morphology and a substantial
absence of phosphorus acid functionalization show improved block resistance as compared to
pigmented aqueous dispersions of spherical particles or pigmented aqueous dispersions of acorns
containing phosphorus acid functionalization.

[0058]     To a 5-L, four necked round bottom flask equipped with a paddle stirrer, a
thermometer, N2 inlet, and a reflux condenser was added deionized water (600 g) and Disponil
FES 32 surfactant (43 g, 30% active). The contents of the flask were heated to 85 'C under N 2
and stirring was initiated. A portion of the first monomer emulsion (70 g) was then added,
quickly followed by a solution of sodium persulfate (2.6 g) dissolved in deionized water (30 g)

first monomer emulsion, followed by a rinse (25 g), and b) an initiator solution of sodium
persulfate (0.64 g) dissolved in deionized water (50 g) were added linearly and separately over
40 mins and 50 mins, respectively. After the monomer emulsion feed was complete, the contents
of the flask were held at 85 'C for 10 min, after which time the co-feed was complete; and the
contents of the flask were then held at 85 'C for an additional 10 min. The contents of the flask

thermometer, N2 inlet, and a reflux condenser was added deionized water (975 g). The contents
of the flask were heated to 84 'C under N2 and stirring was initiated. A portion of the preform

followed by a solution of ammonium persulfate (5.1 g) dissolved in deionized water (20 g), and a
rinse of deionized water (5 g). After stirring for 5 min, the second monomer emulsion and a
solution containing ammonium persulfate (1.7 g) and ammonium hydroxide (2 g, 29% active)
dissolved in deionized water (60 g), were each added linearly and separately to the flask over a
total period of 80 min. The contents of the flask were maintained at a temperature of 84 'C
during the addition of the second monomer emulsion. When all additions were complete, the
vessel containing the second monomer emulsion was rinsed with deionized water (25 g), which

Block Test Method
[0069]     ASTM D4946-89 was followed to perform peel block resistance. For each coating,
eight 1.5" x 1.5" sections were cut from the chart to run duplicates for room temperature and hot
block. Two each of the cut squares were placed face-to-face, with paint surfaces in contact with
each other. For room temperature block testing, for each pair of square on a flat surface, a
rubber stopper (No. 8) was placed on the top with the narrow side in contact with the
specimens. A 1000-g weight was placed on the top of the stopper. After 30 min, the weights
and stoppers were removed from the specimens, which were then tested for room temperature
block resistance. For hot block, specimens were placed in an oven at 50 'C on a flat metal
plate. Rubber stoppers (No. 8) and weights were equilibrated in the oven. A rubber stopper was
placed with narrow side down on top each specimen in the oven. Then, a 1000-g weight was
placed over each stopper. After 30 min, weights and stoppers were removed and the specimens
were removed from the oven and allowed to cool at room temperature for 30 min before testing
for hot block resistance. The results of room temperature block and hot block were reported on a
scale of 0 to 10 by peeling apart the specimens with slow and steady force. Table 2 describes the
rating system for reporting peel block resistance.

[0073]     The results show that block resistance is best when no PEM is present in the core or
the shell (Examples 1, 3, and 5) and that latexes with PEM functionality in the shell but not the

in the core (Comparative Example 1) or PEM functionality in the shell and the core
(Comparative Example 2).
