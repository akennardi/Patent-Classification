A HEAT STORAGE SYSTEM
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present invention relates to a heat storage system. The present
invention has particular, although not exclusive application to industrial solar systems.
BACKGROUND
[0002]      The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of
the common general knowledge.
[0003]      Solar systems provide cost and greenhouse gas emissions savings.
[0004]      A common type of solar system is an evacuated tube solar collector.
Evacuated tubes use two glass tubes fused at the top and bottom. The space between
the two tubes is evacuated to form a vacuum. A copper pipe (called a heat pipe) runs
through the centre of the tube and meets a common manifold. The manifold is then
connected to a slow flow circulation pump that pumps water to a storage tank, thus
heating the water during the day. The hot water can be used at night or the next day
due to the insulation of the tank.
[0005]      The use of liquids, such as the hot water, as high temperature heat storage is
not ideal. Water has very high specific heat, which is an advantage (water can absorb
high amounts of heat per unit of mass and per unit of temperature increase at certain
amounts of heat deposition). However, for water to remain contained as a liquid, as
distinct from vapour or steam, it has to be permanently pressurised. Pressurisation is a
major disadvantage of water as a high temperature heat storage medium. To store heat
at 2000C, a minimum pressure of 1.60 MPa is required which involves the use of more
complex and expensive equipment.
[0006]      In addition, there are very severe safety implications and compliance
requirements at this sort of high pressure, combined with a very large volume of water
required for storing large amounts of heat for industrial processes.

                                               2
[0007]      Heat Transfer Fluids (HTFs) including oil are high cost, and have a finite life
because oil needs to be replenished on regular basis for temperatures above 2000C.
Depending on the properties of the HTF, a protective blanket of gas (such as a layer of
C02 or other protective gas) is often required to prevent degradation of the HTF which
incurs additional costs and complexities. Besides, HTFs have a volumetric specific heat
of the order of only one third of that of water (per liter per deg C at same investment of
heat into the HTF when compared with water).
[0008]      The applicant has perceived a need for heat storage alternatives to liquids
such as hot water and HTFs.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009]      According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a heat
storage system including:
        a container for containing a heat transfer fluid (HTF); and
        a heat storage solid for locating in the container and storing heat from the HTF.
[00010]     Advantageously, the heat storage solid takes the place of liquids such as hot
water and HTFs. Furthermore, the HTF may need not be pressurized thereby avoiding
the need for complex and expensive equipment, as well as providing less severe safety
implications and compliance requirements.
[00011]     The solid may be inert. The solid may be durable and resistant to chipping or
other deterioration. The solid may be water insoluble. The solid may include a ceramic.
The solid may include metal. The solid may include aluminium. The solid may include
an aluminum oxide, especially A12 0 3 (commonly known as "alumina"). The solid may
include a heat conductor. The solid may have a thermal conductivity greater than 20,
25, 30 or 35 W-m-'K-1 .
[00012]     The HTF may include an oil. The HTF may pass through the heat storage
solid. The heat transfer fluid may be in the temperature range between 1400C to 8000C.
Even more preferably, the HTF may be in the temperature range between 1400C to
3000C.

                                               3
[00013]    The heat storage solid may include spheres. The system may include a
holder for holding the spheres. The holder may hold the spheres in an array. The holder
may be segmented to facilitate removal of a subset of the spheres during cleaning or
maintenance. The holder may include a cage. The holder may occupy about 13 m3 at
800C.
[00014]    The container may include an insulated storage tank. The system may further
include an open vent from the container. The system may further include a filter coupled
to the open vent. The system may further include a fluid inlet to the container. The
system may further include a fluid outlet from the container. The inlet may be located
above the outlet so that fluid there-between moves with gravity thereby assisting a
pump. The heat storage solid may be located between the inlet and the outlet. The inlet
and outlet may both include a network of distributed pipes with ports.
[00015]    According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a heat
storage solid for a heat storage system, the heat storage solid including alumina.
[00016]    Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination
with any one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the
invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[00021]      According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a
heat storage system 100 as shown in figure 1. The storage system 100 includes a cubic
container 102 for containing a flowing heat transfer fluid (HTF). A heat storage solid 104
is provided for immersing in, and storing heat from, the HTF.
[00022]      Advantageously, the heat storage solid 104 takes the place of liquids such as
hot water and HTFs used in known systems. Furthermore, the HTF need not be
pressurized thereby avoiding the need for complex and expensive equipment, as well
as providing less severe safety implications and compliance requirements.
[00023]      The immersed solid 104 is inert, durable and resistant to chipping or other
deterioration, water insoluble, ceramic and includes an aluminum oxide, especially
A120 3 (commonly known as "alumina"). The alumina is a heat conductor having a
thermal conductivity greater than 20, 25, 30 or 35 W-m- 1 K-1 .
[00024]      The HTF is an oil operating in a temperature range of between about 1400C
to 8000C. Even more preferably, the HTF operates in the temperature range between
1400C to 3000C.
[00025]      The heat storage solid 104 includes respective alumina spheres 106. The
system 100 includes a cage holder 108 for holding the spheres 106 in a three
dimensional array. The holder 108 is segmented to facilitate removal of respective
subsets of the spheres 106 during cleaning or maintenance of the container 102. In one
embodiment, a 1 MWh system 100 occupies about 13 m3 at 800C.
[00026]      The container 102 is an insulated storage tank. An open pipe vent 110
extends from the top of the container 102. The system 100 further includes a filter 112
coupled to the open vent 110.
[00027]      The system 100 further includes a fluid inlet 114 to the container 102, and a
fluid outlet 116 from the container 102. As can best be seen in figure 1C, the inlet 114 is
generally located above the outlet 116 so that HTF there-between moves with gravity

                                               5
thereby assisting a recirculating pump (not shown). The HTF passes through the heat
storage solid 104 which is located between the inlet 114 and the outlet 116. As can best
be seen in figure 1B, the inlet 114 and outlet 116 both include a mirrored network of
distributed pipes with spaced apart ports.
[00028]     There are many advantages in using Alumina as heat storage material. The
price is moderate when compared to the cost of HTFs or other comparable material,
and there is no need to pressurise Alumina at any temperature. Alumina has an endless
life span, and there is no need to ever replenish the Alumina or to maintain special gas
or other protective envelopes from keeping the Alumina from degradation.
[00029]     Alumina is available in geometrical forms such as the spheres 106 conducive
to fast heat exchange which is required for rapid heat delivery (burst heat) in industrial
processes. Alumina has very high thermal conductivity (better than Stainless Steel),
aiding in fast burst heat delivery. The system operating temperature can be more than
8000C, (i.e. far above the max operating temperature of any known HTF system,
whether mineral based or synthetic).
[00030]     Alumina is totally inert, does not deteriorate and does not react with any
fluids/air/gasses with which it may come in contact with in service as a heat storage
medium. Properly processed Alumina does not chip or generate any solid residue which
could find its way into hydraulic assets such as the pump, thereby causing havoc and
damage. Furthermore, Alumina has very high specific heat, meaning that it can absorb
a lot of heat per unit of volume/weight, and for a specific temperature band.
[00031]     A person skilled in the art will appreciate that many embodiments and
variations can be made without departing from the ambit of the present invention.
[00032]      In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language
more or less specific to structural or methodical features. It is to be understood that the
invention is not limited to specific features shown or described since the means herein
described comprises preferred forms of putting the invention into effect.
[00033]      In one embodiment, the heat storage solid 104 can be partially located in,
and store and release heat from, the HTF.

                                             6
[00034]     The container 102 may be varied shape and dimension.
[00035]     Reference throughout this specification to 'one embodiment' or 'an
embodiment' means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in
connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present
invention. Thus, the appearance of the phrases 'in one embodiment' or 'in an
embodiment' in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all
referring to the embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or
characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more combinations.
