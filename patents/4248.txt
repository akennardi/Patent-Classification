                                    An Electric Strike Assembly
       Technical Field
       This invention broadly relates to an electric strike assembly. In particular, this
       invention relates to an electric strike assembly having a removable and/or
   5   replaceable adaptor. Also, the invention relates to a removable and/or replaceable
       adaptor for an electric strike module. Furthermore, the invention relates to a
      housing for an electric strike module.
      Background of the Invention
      Conventionally, an electric strike includes a casting which functions as a housing
 10   for various electronic components and the keeper etc. The electric strike is typically
      installed as a recess installation in, or as a surface mount installation on, the jamb
      of a door frame. There are two main types of door frames, namely metal frame and
      timber frame. Castings with different designs and configurations are required to
      suit metal and timber door frames. As such, an electric strike with a casting tailor
15    made to be recessed in a metal frame can not be used or installed on surface
      mounted frames. This has the disadvantage of electric strikes lacking flexibility in
     that they are not being able to be removed from a frame with a cut-out and re
      applied to a surface mount frame and vice versa.
     Also, electric strikes are generally capable of operating in two different modes,
20   namely fail-safe and fail-secure modes. Switching from one mode to the other
     requires the steps of removing fastening means such as screws or pins relocating
     the solenoid contained within the casting and putting the fastening means back in
     to secure the position of the solenoid. Switching between the two operating modes
     may otherwise involve relocation of fastening means such as screws or pins. Either
25   way, the current mode-switching mechanisms have the disadvantages of being both
     cumbersome and time consuming.

                                                  2
    It is an object of the present invention to provide an electric strike assembly, a
    replaceable and/or removable adaptor for an electric strike module and a housing
    for an electric strike module which may overcome or ameliorate the above
    disadvantages, or which will at least provide a useful alternative.

    Detailed Description of the Drawings
    Referring to Figure 1, an electric strike module 10 is a self-contained unit which
    may be nested within adaptor (not shown) to form an electric strike assembly for
    installation in or on a door frame (not shown).
  5 There are two main types of door frames, namely a surface mount frame and a
    frame with a recess or cut-out. Both of these two types of door frames may be
    made of timber or metal. Metal door frames are commonly hollow whereas timber
    door frames are usually solid. In any case, whether the electric strike module 10 is
    to be installed on or in the frame depends upon the style of the lock that is to be
10  used on the door. For instance, a mortise lock requires a cut-out installation
    whereas a surface mounted lock such as Lockwood T 001 requires a surface
                                                           M
    mounted installation.
    As shown in Figure 1, the electric strike module 10 has a housing 12, a strike plate
    or keeper 14, a cover plate 16, a solenoid 18, a coiled spring 20, a bearing pin 22
1s  and screws 24 & 26. Referring to Figures 2 to 5, in the assembled electric strike
    module 10, the keeper 14 is pivotally mounted on housing 12 via bearing pin 22 so
    as to be able to rotate between a latch releasing position and a latch retaining
    position. Coiled spring 20 is provided to bias the keeper 14 towards the latch
    retaining position. The solenoid 18 is connected to a bracket 28 which has two
20  holes 30 and 32 for receiving screws 24 and 26 respectively. The solenoid 18 when
    in use is attached to a wall 34 of housing 12 but may be moved between two
    positions to facilitate operation of the strike module 10 in two different modes,
    namely fail-safe and fail-secure. The housing 12 has an aperture 36. The electric
    wires 40 stemming from the solenoid 18 is designed to exit the housing 12 through
25  the aperture 36. The housing 12 also includes an recess 38..
    Turning now to Figure 6, an adaptor in the form of a cover 42A is shown for
    receiving the electric strike module 10 to form an electric strike assembly for

     24108
                                                 8
     attachment to a metallic surface mount frame. The cover 42A has a cavity 46 for
    receiving the electric strike module 10 and is designed in use to be attached to a
    metal door frame 44 (see Figure 8). The cover 42A is separable from the electric
     strike module 10. The cover 42A can be removed to enable the electric strike
  5 module 10 to be installed in a frame with a recess or cut-out as a standard rim
    strike which will be described in further detail below. Also, the cover 42A may be
    replaced by another cover 42B to facilitate installation on a wooden surface mount
    frame.
    As shown in Figures 6 and 7, the cover 42A has a first attachment means which
10  facilitates attachment of the electric strike assembly 10 to the metal surface mount
    frame 44. The first attachment means is in the form of a flat section 48 having a
    pair of orifices 50. The cover 42A has another flat section 52 with another pair of
    orifices 54. As best shown in Figure 6, the flat sections 48 and 52 are on the same
    plane extending from the upper and lower ends of the cover 42A respectively.
15  Referring to Figure 7, the cover 42A has a pair of detachable caps 56 & 58 which
    are configured to be mounted onto the upper and lower ends of the cover 42A. The
    caps 56 & 58 are secured to the cover 42A by screws 57. Screws 59 and 61 are
    passed through the orifices 50 and 54 respectively to secure the cover 42A onto the
    frame 44. The caps 56 & 58 conceal the heads of the screws 59 and 61,
20  respectively, rendering the electric strike assembly 66 aesthetically pleasing. The
    cover 42A also has an indent 60 which receives a faceplate 62. The faceplate 62 is
    connected to the cover 42A by screws 64 which ultimately engage corresponding
    holes in 69 and 71 provided in the housing 12 (see Figure 1).
    Referring to Figures 8 and 9, an assembled electric strike 66 with the electric strike
25  module 10 contained within the cover 42A is affixed to a first plane 68 of the door
    frame 44.

    24108
                                               9
    Turning to Figures 10 and 11, another cover 42B is identical to cover 42A except
   that cover 42B has a second attachment means in the form of an extended flat
    section 73 having three orifices 70. The extended flat section 73 is perpendicular to
    sections 48B and 52B. As shown in Figure 11, caps 56 & 58 and faceplate 62 from
 5  cover 42A can also be fitted onto cover 42B to form an electric strike assembly
    66B (see Figures 12 and 13). The caps 56 & 58 conceal the heads of the screws 63
   and 65, respectively, for aesthetic purposes. The cover 42B is configured so as to
   facilitate installation on a wooden surface mount door frame 72. As shown in
   Figures 11 and 12, the extended flat section 73 is affixed to a (second) plane 74 of
10 the wooden door frame 72. As best shown in Figure 12, plane 74 is inclined to
   plane 76. The extended flat section 73 is perpendicular to the flat sections 48B &
   52B.
   As described above, the assembled electric strike module 10 having wires 40 is to
   be received within housing 42A or 42B. As the electric strike module 10 is nested
15 into the housing 42A or 42B, the wires 40 protrude through a hole 67 provided in
   the cover 42A (see Figure 7) or 42B. In order to enable surface mounted cabling to
   installed from either end, the recess 38 is provided at one end of the housing 12
   such that the wires 40 sticking out of the aperture 36 can be bent in an opposite
   direction and exit the cover 42A or 42B through the hole 67 (see Figure 7 showing
20 cover 42A for example).
   As an option, the electric strike module 10 may be installed in a metal or wooden
   door frame having a recess or cut-out without a cover. Referring to Figure 14, the
   uncovered housing 12 of the electric strike module 10 is detachably connected to a
   replaceable spacer which takes the form of a lip 78. A faceplate 80 with holes 86 &
25 88 is secured to the electric stike module 10 by screws 64. The faceplate 80 has
   enlarged portions 82 and 84 each having an aperture 90, 92. As shown in Figures
   15 and 16, an electric strike assembly 66C including the electric strike module 10

   24108
                                                10
    connected to the lip 78 is installed in a cut-out (not shown) provided in a metal
   frame door 94.
   Turning now to Figure 17, three differently sized spacers in the form of extension
   lips 96, 98 & 100 can be used for installation into a metal or wooden door frame
 5 with a wide jamb. Each extension lip 96, 98, 100 has a pair of attachment points in
   the form of internally threaded holes 102, 104, 106. The housing 10 also has a
   pair of throughgoing holes 108. When installing the electric strike module 10 into
   the metal door frame with a wide jamb, one of the extension lips 96, 98 or 100 may
   be selected, depending on the size of the gap in the wide jamp, to take up the empty
10 space. The selected extension lip 96, 98 or 100 is connected to the electric strike
   module 10 via lip 78 by a pair of fastening means in the form of screws 110. It
   should be noted that during installation, the screws 110 penetrate through the holes
    108 provided in the housing 10 first before engaging the corresponding holes 102,
   104 or 106 provided in the extension lip 96, 98 or 100. As such, the screws 110 are
15 concealed and hence invisible after installation.
   The electric strike module 10 may be set to operate in a fail-safe or fail-secure
   mode. In order to switch between the fail-safe and fail-secure operating modes, the
   solenoid 18 has to be moved back and forth between two positions. Referring to
   Figure 18, the housing 12 includes a countersunk hole 112 configured to facilitate
20 easy and speedy switching between the two positions. The countersunk hole 112
   has two recesses 114 and 116, each of which is configured to receive the enlarged
   head of the countersunk screw 26 (see Figure 1). The two recesses 114 and 116 are
   in communication with one another. As such, the countersunk screw 26 can be
   partially unscrewed, moved freely from one end to the other of the countersunk
25 hole 112, and screwed back down at the desired end. This offers the benefit of
   enabling the user to switch between the two operating modes without having to
   fully unscrew and detach the countersunk screw 26.

     24108
                                                11
    Referring to Figures 19a, the faceplate 62, being detachably connected to cover
    42A, forms part of the electric strike assembly 66 for mounting onto a metal door
    frame. The faceplate 62 has a recess 11 8X which allows entrance of a latching
    means into a cavity 120 provided in the housing 12 upon closing of the door 122
  5 (see Figure 9). As shown in Figures 19b and 19c, the faceplate 62 may be removed
    by unscrewing the screws 64 and replaced by either faceplate 62Y or 62Z. Each of
    faceplates 62Y and 62Z has a recess 11 8Y, 11 8Z provided in a different position.
    As shown in Figure 19a, the recess 118X is located in a central position where an
    imaginary midline 126 of the recess 11 8X is aligned with an imaginary midline 124
10  of the cavity 120. In contrast, the recesses 11 8Y and 11 8Z are located in a
    downwardly offset position where the imaginary midline 126 of the recesses 118Y
    and 11 8Z is distanced from the imaginary midline 124 of.the cavity 120. Changing
    between replaceable faceplates 62, 62Y and 62Z allow a user the flexibility of
    accommodating a gradual unintentional change of position of the door 122 over
15  time due to the weight of the door or the hydraulic mechanism commonly provided
    at the upper end of the door. It should be noted that each of the faceplates 62, 62Y
    and 62Z may be installed in a first orientation (which is as shown in Figures 19a,
    19b and 19c) or second orientation (as a result of rotating the faceplate 62, 62Y or
    62Z by 180 degrees clockwise or anticlockwise as indicated by arrows P &      Q).
20  After rotation, the recess 11 8X will end up in the same central position. Recesses
    11 8Y and 11 8Z will however result in an upwardly offset position.
    It will be appreciated that the faceplates 62, 62Y and 62Z may equally be
    connected to the cover 42B for a wooden door frame and function in the same
    manner.
25  Turning to Figures 20a, 20b and 20c, faceplates 80 and 80Y are interchangeable
    and replaceable for connection with housing 12 of the electric strike module 10. As
    described above in relation to Figures 19a to 19c, each of faceplates 80 and 80Y
    can be installed in two orientations. For example, faceplate 80Y having its recess

   24108
                                              12
    130 in a downwardly offset position as shown in Figure 20b may be rotated 180
   degrees clockwise or anticlockwise to end up in an orientation where the recess
    130 is in a upwardly offset position as shown in Figure 20c.
   Now that preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described in
 5 some detail, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that embodiments of the
   electric strike assembly, cover and housing may offer at least the following
   advantages:
   (1) easy and quick to assemble and install;
   (2) provide the user with the flexibility of installing the electric strike module
10       containing the same components in or on different types of door frames; and
   (3) save costs due to a significant reduction of inventory.
   Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention described herein is
   susceptible to variations and modifications other than those specifically described.
   All such variations and modifications are to be considered within the scope and
1s spirit of the present invention the nature of which is to be determined from the
   foregoing description.
