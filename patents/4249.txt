      CHARACTER HOLDER FOR HAND SOAP / SANITIZER DISPENSER
An apparatus used in conjunction with an automatic hand soap / sanitiser dispensing unit 1 to
dispense a measured dose of soap or sanitiser liquid 6 onto user's hands. The apparatus includes a
character moulding 2 in which the existing hand sanitiser / soap dispenser 1 is housed.
The apparatus is assembled by placing the automatic hand soap / sanitising dispenser 1 into the
location ring 5 inside the head base assembly 3 of the moulding of a character. The upper head part
4 of the assembly, resembling the top of the head of the character then closes over the soap /
sanitiser dispenser 1, providing a large opening, resembling the mouth of the character.
The user's hands are inserted to the large mouth opening of the character to receive a measured
dose of liquid soap or sanitiser 6.
The apparatus can be placed on a counter top or attached to a wall.

BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
FIELD
This invention is in the field of hand cleaning and sanitising. More particularly, this invention
provides a method to help develop good hand cleaning behaviour in children by providing a fun
character based soap / sanitiser delivery system.

    BACKGROUND
    Automatic hand soap / sanitising dispensing gadgets have been available for several years. The
    gadget works by using a motion sensor to trigger a pump to deliver a measured dose of hand soap or
 .0 sanitiser onto the user's hands.
    It is well documented that most germs are transferred from person to person via surfaces. Frequent
    and thorough hand washing reduces the risk of germ transfer. In a number of studies with children,
    it has been proven that a regime of regular hand washing significantly reduces illnesses, but the
 .5 challenge is to motivate children to wash their hands regularly.
    This invention has been designed to motivate children to wash their hands more regularly by making
    hand washing fun. A series of character mouldings with big open mouths are designed to attract
    children to the process of applying soap or sanitiser onto their hands. When the child inserts their
 .0 hands into the big mouth, the automatic hand soap / sanitiser dispenser delivers a measured dosage
    of soap or sanitiser onto their hands.
    In addition to making the hand wash process fun for kids, the measured dosage also helps prevent
    over application of soap, a common problem with smaller children, and as a result will save money.
25
    More recently there has been some criticism of ingredients like triclosan and other antibacterial
    agents in hand soap. The advantage of this invention is that it will encourage more frequent hand
    washing and therefore regular soap will be more than adequate to do the job.

                                           CLAIMS
     CHARACTER HOLDER FOR HAND SOAP / SANITIZER DISPENSER
   1. An apparatus that holds an automatic hand soap / sanitiser dispenser inside a moulded
      character head, so as to deliver a measured dose of soap or sanitiser when the hands of a
      user are inserted into the mouth opening of the character.
   2. The moulded character head in claim 1, can resemble any character and when opened, a
      soap dispenser can be inserted into a location slot, which holds the soap dispenser in
      position.
   3. When the top of the character head in claim 2 is closed with the hand soap / sanitiser
      dispenser inside, the apparatus provides a big mouth opening in which hands can be
      inserted to receive a measured dose of soap or sanitiser.
