Technical field
The     invention          relates            to        an     activation              device          for
triggering an outflow of a gas                              from a        storage container
into    a  rescue       means        fillable             with the         gas,       wherein          the
activation           device            has          a       detection              element             for
determining         the       instant            of       triggering            and       a   trigger
element for immediately opening the storage container.
Definitions
A    rescue    means        can       be      a     lifejacket            which        provides            a
person       situated             in         water,             in       particular,                with
additional        buoyancy.              Preferably,                this      is      a     piece        of
clothing      embodied          like        a     vest.        In     general,          this      piece
of    clothing      has      holes         for       the     arms,       through          which       the
arms     can   be     inserted,             with         the     remaining           body       parts,
namely     back,       chest       and        stomach,            being       covered          by      the
vest.     Closure        elements,              such       as     a    zipper,          buckles          or
the    like,   keep the lifejacket                         in the necessary position
on the body.
Colloquially,           the      term          life        vest       is    known.           However,
this     should       in     fact         also        be     understood             to      mean      the
lifejacket.          Buoyancy             aids         can      also       be     mistaken             for
lifejackets          in      respect             of       their        look.         Compared            to
lifejackets, buoyancy aids have less buoyancy.
Lifejackets        are known             in     different            embodiments             and with
different buoyancy properties.
Within     the    scope        of      the       particular             specification,                the
lifejacket       is able to rotate even an unconscious person
into a safe swimming position and/or keep them there.
Here,     the   fitting          size        is      dependent           upon       the      required
buoyancy      volume        of     the       lifejacket.               This      is      calculated
from     the   overall          weight           of      the     wearer,         including             his

clothing           and equipment,              and the          body       of water      traveled
on. Here, the following classifications are provided:
     -    50 N       buoyancy:         buoyancy           aid       -   only     for    competent
          swimmers          near      the     shore        or    when       accompanied          by    a
          rescue vehicle;               not     safe for the unconscious;
     -    100 N       buoyancy:          lifejacket              for      inland      waters       and
         protected             territories;                limited           safety      for       the
         unconscious;
     -    150 N        buoyancy:          lifejacket              for      all    waters,        safe
          for the          unconscious,            but     only to          a  limited       extent
          for wearers with heavy waterproof clothing;
     -    275 N       buoyancy:          lifejacket             for      the    high     seas      and
         extreme           conditions,             safe      for       the     unconscious            in
         almost all cases despite heavy clothing.
Within         the      current        meaning,           rescue        means      can     also       be
devices          which,       for     example,          are       fastened        to   an    object
in     order        to    prevent        said        objects,           provided       they      fall
into       a    body      of    water,       from       sinking          to   the    bed    and       no
longer being retrievable.
Prior art
Various            embodiments             of       rescue           means       for     rescuing
persons           and      animals        who,        for      example,           involuntarily
come          into         contact          with         deep          water        are      known.
Lifejackets are known as rescue means.
On      the      basis        of     the      buoyancy             systems        thereof,         the
lifejackets can be subdivided into                                    solid body vests and
inflatable            lifejackets.             Solid       body        vests     have    securely
worked-in           buoyancy         means,        as    result         of    which    the     vests
have a relatively large volume.
This       lifejacket            is    intended          to      prevent        the    person         or
the     animal        from drowning              and at         least       keep    them     on the
water's           surface.          Such      lifejackets              are     designed         in     a

jacket-like             manner           (without        sleeves)             and      are        affixable
to     the      body      of      the        wearer      using         one       or      more         closure
elements.           In     order         to    ensure         that       the      lifejacket                lies
on      the      body      appropriately,                  additional               leg          or     crotch
strap        elements           are      provided,          which        keep        the        lifejacket
in     position,           even         in    the     case        of     contact           with        water.
Preferably,               these            lifejackets               have         an        appropriate
signal          color.        In       order      to    provide           a     safe       position              on
the     water, even if the wearer is unconscious, provision
is    made       for the arrangement                     of      a    collar element                   on the
lifejacket            such that              the    person         on    the      water's             surface
comes        to a      stable position                  lying on the back                         in    such a
way      that       the       head         region       is      supported              and         thus       the
airways are kept free.
Inflatable            lifejackets               are     generally              worn        in      a    small,
folded-together                  state.        In    the case           of use,           inflation              is
triggered manually or by way of an automated mechanism.
This      embodiment              provides          for     providing             a    lifejacket                in
such       a    way    that         it     does      not      keep       any      static            buoyancy
bodies          available              outside         of      the       water.           Rather,             the
buoyancy            bodies             are     only        generated               once           there          is
corresponding                   contact            with          water.             Triggering                   is
generally           carried            out    by type          of     sensor         element           which,
for      example,          is      provided          by     a    salt        tablet            (or     any       of
the      material          which           changes        the       properties                thereof            in
connection             with        water) .         This        salt        tablet            releases              a
mechanism            which         enables          an    immediate              outflow              of     C02,
which        is     stored         in      a   container,             into       a    body          element.
The      body       element             is     arranged           in     a      tube-like              manner
around          the      neck.           A     suspenders-like                   structure                 (life
belt)        secures          the       tube-like           structure             to      the        body        of
the      wearer,          particularly                once        the       gaseous             means         has
flowed into the body element.
Buoyancy           aids        (so-called            regatta,            kayak,          rower         vests,
etc.)         have       a      similar           design.          However,             in         order         to
provide          the    wearer           with     a   greater           freedom          of       movement,
these have            smaller buoyancy bodies made of                                     solid bodies
 (approximate             buoyancy            50 N) .       Moreover,             a     corresponding

head      support       safe      for the          unconscious,           namely        a    collar
element, generally is lacking.
Lifejackets             or    buoyancy             aids     (often         also        known           as
regatta         or      kayak        vests)         fitted       to      the       person           are
prescribed            by     law      as     personal         safety          equipment,               in
particular           for water          sportsmen         such      as    e.g.      sailors            or
kayakers.
Here,         a     key      distinction               is    made         between            safety
equipment           which,       on      the       one    hand,       is      safe       for        the
unconscious           and,     on the other             hand,      is    not safe          for the
unconscious;            that      is     to     say,    the    latter         are     unable           to
keep       the    head      of   the      person        securely          afloat        and       keep
the      airways         free        when        said     person         is      unconscious.
Therefore,            such     buoyancy            aids,     such        as     e.g.       regatta
vests,       are     predominantly               used in      sports,         where       aid       can
generally be provided quickly.
Furthermore,            the    prior        art     has    disclosed           an    inflatable
apparatus          which       is      worn        by   persons         directly            on      the
body. Here, the rescue apparatus                             can be tied in a belt
like      manner       both     around        the     hip region           and the         stomach
region,         with     said     rescue         apparatus        accordingly              filling
with       gas    in    the     case       of      contact      with       water.         To      this
end,      body     elements          are provided,            which       are     arranged             on
the     system       in    a   belt-like            manner     and      which       are       filled
with the gas-like element.
Developments             provide          for       the     rescue         means         to       have
electronic assistance elements.
The      assistance           elements           are    embodied           in     such        a     way
that,        for     example,          the        water     pressure            is     measured.
Triggering            or     inflating             of   the      body        elements              only
occurs at a            specific water pressure. By way of example,
this device is known from US 6,246,329 B1.
However,         in order        to     be    able     to   operate          such a        device,
the      arrangement           of      an     electrical          unit        is    necessary.

These      electrical              units          which,        inter       alia,         also       contain
a     power           supply            and          a      timer           (time           measurement
instrument)              are       arranged             separately              from         the        rescue
means.        The       connections                 must      be      formed         in      such        a    way
that      they        are        waterproof               and        function            over         a     long
period       of    time,         since,           in    general,          rescue         means         of     the
aforementioned type either are                                   stored in            rooms or boxes
for      relatively              long       periods            of      time       or      else        are       in
daily      use      and       then        need       to      provide          their         function            in
the     case of an emergency.
If    a   person         at     sea      or      in    water        finds       themselves               in     an
emergency,           it     is     necessary             that       they       have       a    lifejacket
arranged         on     the      body.         If    the      person        can      keep        afloat         by
their      own      power,          lifejackets               with      a    buoyancy             of     up     to
100 N      are      sufficient.                 However,           if    said        person          becomes
unconscious,                the        rescue           means          must         provide             enough
buoyancy          that          the       body,          including              the       water-soaked
clothing,          is      kept        afloat.          Lifejackets               with        a    buoyancy
of    up   to     100 N         can      no       longer        satisfy         this        demand.           The
person         would           sink.           To      wear          lifejackets                 with         the
appropriate             buoyancy             in      advance           is     uncomfortable                   and
unconventional,                  particularly                 in     sports.          Alternatively,
use     can be made of so-called automatic lifejackets.
The     aforementioned                 rescue          means        do   not       indicate            to     the
user      as    to      whether           they        actually          function.              By     way       of
example,          if      a     salt       tablet,            which        is      responsible                 for
triggering the outflow of the gas                                      stored in a container
into the body elements,                            does not           completely dissolve in
the     automatic            lifejackets,                 no     gas     flows         into        the      body
element        and       inflation              does       not      take       place.          Therefore,
the     rescue        means         has      no      function.           Nevertheless,                   it     is
very      clear         to      the       observer             that,        by       specifying               the
green      indicators              which          only      confirm         a    partial            function
 (e.g.      a    tensioned              spring),            the       function           is      provided.
Therefore,            reliability                  and      absolute           security             are       not
provided.          In     the      case        of     solid       body      lifejackets,                  there
are only tactile and visual checks.

Activation              devices             for     triggering            an      outflow            of     a   gas
from         a     storage           container              into       a   lifejacket                 fillable
with gas are                 already known from the prior art. They are
used          in     the         so-called               automatic              lifejackets.                  This
device           has     a     detection             element          and     a    trigger            element.
The detection element                            serves to determine the                            status as
to      whether             or      not        the       rescue         means          has        come        into
contact            with       water.          The      use      of    so-called             salt        tablets
is     a     very       simple           and      currently            conventional                 solution.
These salt tablets                        dissolve in the case of contact with
water         and     provide            the       pulse        predetermined                by      a     spring
to     a    trigger           element.           The      trigger         element,            in      turn,       is
provided            to     punch         an     opening          into      a     cartridge              (of     the
order          of    20g         to      40g)        filled         with        gas       so      that        this
cartridge             immediately                 enters          the     stored          gas        into       the
body          elements             of        the       lifejacket,               which           act         as      a
buoyancy            bodies,           in     the      case      of    emergency,              i.e.        in    the
case          of     contact              with         water.          Should            the       detection
mechanism                fail          or       if       there          should           be        a       faster
activation               of      the       lifejacket,              provision             is       also       made
for        a       manual           actuation               means         which           bypasses              the
detection               mechanism                and         immediately                activates               the
trigger mechanism.
Such         devices            are       used         in      many       and        varied            in     such
lifejackets.                 The       salt       tablet          should        have       the        property
of     always,            i.e.        invariably               dissolving             in     the       case       of
contact             with           water            and        of        then          correspondingly
activating the trigger mechanism such that gas                                                        can flow
out.      In order to ensure this,                               regular checks are always
necessary,                at       least           in      commercial               shipping.                These
checks           are     also       prescribed                because        it      is    not        possible
to     tell         by      looking            at     the      device        whether             or      not      it
still          is,     in       fact,         in      good      working           order.           Then,        dry
triggering                is       carried             out       -     at       least          at       regular
intervals              -       such       that         use       must       be       made         of       a    new
detection means and a new trigger mechanism.
An     alternative                embodiment               is     known       from EP             1    961      654
Al.      Here, a piece of clothing which provides a buoyancy

body      is    proposed,             said buoyancy                  body being               inflated           in
an     emergency           of     the       user.        The      emergency              is     determined
by     parameters            such        as     saltwater             or     freshwater,                 length
of      stay        in      the        water,            orientation                 in       the        water.
Provided              that          the          emergency               is           determined                 by
undershooting                  one           or       more            parameters,                    a       time
measurement               in       the         embodiment               of       a       countdown               is
started. If the countdown is completed without a                                                         change
in      the      parameters,                   the       triggering                 and         hence          the
inflation           of    the       buoyancy          body        is    carried             out.       Various
adjustment             switches             allow         the       countdown              timer         to      be
adjusted,           as     well        as     the      depth         which,          in      the      case       of
being exceeded, leads to the triggering.
US     2010/0167608               Al       and      US     2013/0109260                  Al      have        also
disclosed a device which provides buoyancy if the water
pressure         increases.               Here,       it     is      possible           to      adjust         the
depth        at  which        a     timer         (countdown)             is      activated,               after
the completion of which the buoyancy is provided.
However,          some       devices            also       provide            for       the       detection
mechanism           to     be     able       to     be     switched            off.         This       measure
is     resorted          to      if      it     is     necessary              for       the       automatic
vest      not    to     be    able         to    be    triggered             precisely              by     spray
or     foam.      This       is       carried         out       in     the      form         of     a    splint
which        shuts      down         the      detection             mechanism.               The       splints
are     generally characterized in                               color such that the user
is     already          able        to      identify            from       the         outside            in     an
unavoidable                unmissable                manner            that           the         detection
mechanism           is    out       of     operation.             This      is       carried           out,      in
particular,             if      work        is     carried            out      in      the       region          of
water,        for example               in     the     region         of     spray water,                 and a
popcorn-like               explosion             is      not       wanted           in      the       case       of
each contact.
Disadvantages of the invention
However,         it     is      a    need       of     the       user      always            to     have       the
certainty           in     any       situation            that        such        lifejackets                also
in      fact     work.          However,             this        is      only         provided             to      a
restricted extent in the present known systems.

Automatic             lifejackets            have      the      significant             disadvantage
that         they          cannot         reliably            provide            the        certainty,
particularly                 in    the     case     of     a     relatively            long       storage
time.       The user cannot be assured and rely on the rescue
means        in     fact       being      ready       for use           in   an     emergency.          The
aforementioned rescue means do not                                       indicate to the user
whether           they        actually         work.        By      way      of     example,         if     a
salt       tablet,            which       is    responsible                for     triggering           the
output          of     the      gas     stored      in     a     container           into       the   body
elements,              does       not     dissolve          completely,               no     gas    flows
into        the        body        element        and       inflation              does        not    take
place.          Therefore,              the     rescue          means        has       no      function.
Nevertheless, it is very clear to the observer that, by
specifying               the      green      indicators              which        only       confirm        a
partial             function             (e.g.         a     tensioned                spring),          the
function               is       provided.            Therefore,               reliability               and
absolute             security           are     not       provided.             In     the       case     of
solid         body         lifejackets,             there           are      only       tactile         and
visual checks.
However,            on      the      other      hand,        it      is     desirable            for    the
automatic            vests         not    to   trigger           necessarily             in     the   case
of     each        direct          contact       with       water,          for       example       spray
water, which passes over the boat as result of                                                  foam, or
in     the       case         of     a   short      contact            with       water        in   which
there is no danger to life                              (sailing dinghies                   or trapeze
sailing)         .     However,          since       this        is      a   purely         mechanical
system,           in      which        the    detection             means       is     dissolved          in
the      case         of      appropriate            water          contact,           this       process
cannot be adapted to the individual requirements.
However,             for       many      types       of      sports,           such       as      rowing,
windsurfing,                         kitesurfing,                     kayaking,                   standup
paddleboarding,                    jet    skiing,         etc.,          or   else       for      bathing
children,               contact          with       water           is      not       an       emergency
situation             but       part     of    physical            exercise.           However,         the
automatic             lifejackets            known        from        the     prior        art     cannot
detect           these           situational              differences,                 and       so     the
lifejackets are not worn when carrying out                                             such sports.

Therefore,          no     automatically                 inflatable             lifejackets
which     are     worn    in    the      aforementioned                 water     sports       or
water      activities         are       known.         Only        vests      with       a   low
buoyancy of         50 N,     so-called kayak or regatta vests, are
known,      but    these,      in     turn,        do    not       cover     an   emergency
situation.
Object of the invention
The   object       of   the    invention           is     to    provide       a   device       in
which automatic vests reliably provide the rescue means
function depending on individual use and requirements.
Solution to the object
The   solution        to  the     object        is     provided         by the      features
of claim 1 and claim 6.
Advantages of the invention
The basic fundamental concept of the invention consists
in   adaptively         replacing          previous           systems        which      enable
the   triggering         or   inflation            of    automatic          rescue      means.
In   the    process,      a   reliable          system         in    the    embodiment         of
a   device       should      be     provided,            which        the    user      of    the
rescue means can            rely on. This              is achieved by virtue of
an activation device having a detection apparatus under
microprocessor           control         being        provided.           The    controller
provides       for    one    sensor       or    for      different          sensors        being
able to determine physical variables                                (in an alternative
or    additive         manner),          such         as      e.g.       water      contact,
movement,         pressure,          temperature,                 etc.,      which         then,
after      a   corresponding            evaluation              and     comparison          with
one     or      more     predetermined                 tables          or     individually
programmed         threshold          parameters              or      individually           set
threshold        parameters,          trigger          the      trigger        element       for
opening the         storage       containers            filled        with     gas.     In   one
exemplary embodiment, provision is made                                  for only one          or
a   few     physical       variables           to      be      measured,         which       are
subsequently           compared           to       a     table          stored       in      the
microprocessor           control.         If     one      or     more      of   the     values
 (threshold        parameters          of     the      sensors)           are    undershot,

the       detection          apparatus             signals        the     trigger           process,
namely starting the opening up of the storage container
for      the     outflow        of      the      gas    into     the    provided           means        of
the        rescue         means,           to      the       trigger         element.             These
threshold           parameters              are       set     depending         on     the        sport
performed          with      the       activation           device.       These       can      be     set
individually              or      in      a     sport-specific             manner,           without
needing to operate the activation device.
Therefore,            the       activation              device       does       not      have         any
operating           elements             (except         for     a   touch        function            for
checking          the      functionality)                 either,        and      so     erroneous
operation          prior       to,      or else         during,      the     application,               in
particular during sport, is precluded.
A    lifejacket           can     be     provided          as   rescue      means.         With       the
device          according            to     the       invention,          the       life        jacket
brings about the possibility of being worn in all types
of      sports       which         come       into       contact       with       water.          Then,
when necessary, the lifejacket provides the buoyancy of
at     least      150 N,        required           in    an    emergency,          and provides
the        necessary           collar            function          for     safety           for       the
unconscious.
The activation device according to the invention can be
attached          as   a    so-called            OEM product,           or    else      it     can be
retrofitted               to       automatic              lifejackets.              It       can        be
operated           by     means          of      a    smartphone          or     a     comparable
device by way of an interface arranged at the device in
such         a   way       that        the        trigger        parameters             (threshold
parameters           of     the       sensors)          themselves          can      be     modified
or      selected         for     the       corresponding             application              (child,
type       of    sport,        etc.)        in     a   simple       manner       by    way       of     an
application             (app) .       The      wearer       of   the    lifejacket             is     not
impeded          when      carrying            out     sports       by    way      of      the     vest
designed           like      a    buoyancy            aid      and   nevertheless               has       a
full-value           rescue          system        available         should        an    emergency
arise.

A    preferred          embodiment               provides            for       the     user       to   be
warmed by way of an acoustic signal about the fact that
the     rescue      means        will       be      inflated         in     an     explosion-like
manner       in    a    few      seconds.             A    touch       element         provided        at
the     device        gives       the      user         the     option         of     stopping       the
triggering            process          before             the     storage            container         is
opened.         This       may       be      the        case       if       the      sensors        have
established            corresponding                   humidity           or      water       but    the
user     is    not     at    all      at      such       risk      that       the     rescue       means
would in fact be necessary.
The       device           itself            consists              essentially                of     two
components,            namely          the         detection             apparatus            and    the
trigger          element.              The           detection              apparatus             is     a
preferably            closed           system            which         is       worked         into      a
capsule-like             embodiment                in      a   waterproof              manner,       for
example        with      a    cylindrical                design.          Only       one    or    a  few
touch        elements             serve          to         accordingly               control        the
process.         Signal          elements              assure        the       user       about      the
actual        current            state.           The        sensor          elements          of    the
detection           apparatus              are          likewise            worked         into      the
latter.         As     result,          they          are      substantially                protected
from        mechanical            loads.            Nevertheless,                 these        can     be
flooded         by     water        due        to      the      special           design        of   the
housing           which,              specifically,                    has          a       slit-like
embodiment.            As    result,            it      is     accordingly             possible        to
detect       not      only       amounts            of     water        but      also      the     water
temperature            and     also        the        movement           in     a    corresponding
manner.
The      trigger         mechanism                itself         directly             adjoins        the
detection            apparatus,                preferably                 likewise            in     the
cylindrical           manner.           Corresponding                 ignition          mechanisms,
which provide an electrical connection to the detection
means,       are     likewise          part        of     the    trigger          mechanism.         The
connection          mechanism,              in      turn,       provides            for    driving       a
bolt-like element over a short path at a high velocity,
which then opens up a                     corresponding hole in the storage
container          such        that       the         gas       stored          in     the      storage
container          can      flow       into          the      provided           regions        of   the

lifejacket             in       an      explosion-like                  manner.            After          an
ignition            process,            it       is      only       necessary              to       newly
interchange               the      trigger            mechanism           and        the        storage
container           must       likewise           be     replaced,            the     latter          then
once again containing corresponding gas.
The device is configured in such a way that it provides
corresponding adapter elements                               such that            an assembly on
virtually             any       conventional               automatic              lifejacket              is
possible.           These        connecting             elements          differ          from        each
type        of    automatic            lifejacket.               In    order         to     ensure          a
large       adaptability,              the      device        is    configured             in     such      a
way      that      any     connecting             element         can     be      received           in     a
very simple manner.
A     further          advantageous                embodiment            provides             for       the
users themselves to be able to adjust the predetermined
values           which          predetermine                  when         a        corresponding
triggering            mechanism           takes        place.        This        adjustment             can
be    carried         out     by way         of    electronic           aids,        such      as e.g.
a   USB      cable      on    a   computer,            or else        by way of Bluetooth
interfaces with smartphones, tablet PCs or the like.
However,           since         the      power         of       the     device           should          be
provided          for a      relatively             long period of time,                      care      has
to      be     taken         that       the        energy         is     not        affected            too
strongly          by    the      data       transfer.           To   this        end,       provision
is     made       according            to      the     invention            for      use       of     e.g.
light-flash            frequencies,               as    are      known,        for    example,            in
current         electronic            banking,          as    an    interface            instead          of
the      conventional              transfer           techniques.              A    corresponding
smartphone            or   tablet         PC is        held against              the     device         and
the        data        are        to       be       transferred                by      way          of       a
corresponding              flash        technique,            which        is     received           by     a
light         sensor       within          the      activation            device.           The       data
contain          the      threshold            parameters,             set       in     advance           or
defined          for      the     respective             type       of     sport,         which         are
necessary           for     triggering             the     activation             device         if     the
actual values are undershot.

However,           if    critical             values        are      adjusted,          which         may be
life       threatening,                 the     user      is     warned        against         selecting
such        values.          A      system         apparatus             can     provide           for      the
values         to      automatically                be     reset        to   normal         values.           On
the          other           hand,            the         users           must         clearly              and
unequivocally                acknowledge                by    another          confirmation               that
they want precisely these value settings.
In     this       way     it      is      possible          to     provide         an    individually
adjustable              automatic               vest       which         builds         on     the        many
years of           experience with automatic vests                                   known from the
prior          art.          Therefore,                 an       individually               adjustable
lifejacket              which         can     be    employed           for     different            demands
is    provided           by way           of     an    adaptive          means       which       replaces
the      conventional                triggering            mechanism.            Thus,      it      is    also
conceivable              to    use        such      lifejackets             for      dinghy         sailing
and       for       these          only         to     become          active         when        a     life
threatening situation is also in fact present.
Alternative                embodiments                  can        also      provide             for        the
situation             to be        analyzed           on     the     basis      of     the     detection
of the physical data and for only so much gas to be let
into        the      chambers             of    the      lifejacket            that       buoyancy            is
just        reached,          as       it    is    unnecessary             in      many      situations
to provide buoyancy of the order of more than 200 N.                                                          In
many       cases,        the       provision            of    buoyancy          between          50 N       and
75 N or          100 N is sufficient.
In      contrast           to         conventional               devices           known       from         the
prior        art,       the      device          according            to   the       invention            only
provides          the rescue function if an emergency is in                                               fact
present.
The      device         has     a     power       supply,           for example            embodied           as
a    lithium           ion     battery            which         reliably           provides            energy
over several years without maintenance. Preferably, the
device         switches            itself         on     independently               when      necessary
and      switches          itself           off     again        -   after       a   defined           period
of     time       of     non-use.            In    the       case      of    a    manual        query,           a
clear         acoustic              and       optical           communication                connection

confirms           the      readiness           of    the      device          by     confirming           a
test       switch.          This      comprises          a    self-test,              by    virtue       of
the       system         state,         the     readiness            of     the       battery,         the
sensors          and the correct installation of                                 the pyrotechnic
trigger being checked.
In the case of a life-threatening situation, the device
initiates             a   pyrotechnic            action         which         is     based        on   the
airbag         triggering             technology           from       vehicles,             which      has
proven           its       worth         millions           of       times.           This         device
releases           a    spring        mechanism          which        in     turn       pierces        the
C02      cartridge           with       a    spike,        and      hence        this       C02     flows
into        the      rescue        means        and     automatically                 inflates         the
latter and therefore provides a buoyancy body.
The      device         can be        returned        to    operational                readiness         by
simple replacement of the pyrotechnic trigger.
Therefore,              the      device       substantially               has      the       following
advantages:
     -    Continuous              calculation            of     the      risk         of     drowning:
          the      installed microcomputer                        continuously evaluates
          the       data         from       various         contactless                sensors         and
          thereby           calculates           the      current          risk         of     drowning
           for the wearer.
     -    Autonomous              learning        capacity            by     interaction             with
          the        wearer:          the       system         announces               an      upcoming
           rescue action by clear sound signals.                                       The user can
          now abort the rescue action by pushing a button or
          by getting out                 of the water. Such interactions are
          taken          into       account,         as      a     result          of      which       the
           system         adapts          itself        to      the       abilities              of    the
          wearer.
     -    Robust          airbag         technology           from       the       motor        vehicle
           industry:            the     trigger        unit        consists            of     a    simple
          and       replaceable               system        which         is       based         on    the

          airbag technology                of vehicles which has proven its
          worth.
     -    Configuring                 lifejackets                    with             smartphones
          corresponds to the current trends:                                 even though the
          device         can    be    used       and       operated          without         further
          operation,             specific              customer            adjustments             are
          nevertheless possible by way of a smartphone.
     -    Adaptation           of    trialed           and      robust         technology          for
          the       data       transfer:            the       data        transfer          of     the
          configuration              data        from       the        smartphone            to    the
          device        is preferably carried out by way of optical
          flash        signals      from the           display          of   a    smartphone         or
          web      portal.        This       old       and     rudimentary             technology
           (comparable           to    IR     remote        control          of    televisions)
          was      adapted        accordingly             for      connecting           two     high
          tech        instruments          and       enables           a   very       robust       and
          simple communication. There is no need for cables,
          additional            instruments              or     even       settings          on    the
          instruments.                The          connection                is        intuitive,
          independent of the smartphone type and can                                         even be
          carried         out    by   all       conventional              computer         monitors
           (CRT or LCD) by way of a webpage.
All      further          operating         options          were        dispensed          with     on
purpose          in     order      to     avoid        incorrect           manipulation            and
increase          the      acceptance         by the         user.        As    a  consequence,
the     system         does    not    have       a   main       switch.         Activation         and
deactivation is carried out automatically.
However,           the      invention         is     not      restricted            only      to   the
application              in    automatic            lifejackets.               Rather,         it    is
suitable             wherever         trigger             mechanisms              need       to      be
provided           in    a   simple       but      reliable          manner,         wherein       the
triggering            takes      place      in     a   manner         dependent         on     set   or
selectable physical variables.
By way of example,                  such rescue means can be attached to
luggage. If the latter becomes wet,                                    conventional rescue

means      trigger.         However,       by way          of     the      application,            the
device       according         to    the    invention            is     set     in    such      a  way
that      spray       water,      rain     etc.,        or     else        carrying         through
water        (e.g.      a    river),        does        not       lead       to      triggering.
Triggering is carried out                      if sinking of the goods to be
protected is            imminent or has               occurred and therefore the
goods per se would be lost in a non-retrievable manner.
As    result         of  triggering,            the      goods        float        back      to    the
water's        surface        and     can    be     retrieved             therefrom.           It    is
precisely           important        objects,          such        as     e.g.      flare       guns,
binoculars,            tracking        systems,          means         of     defense,          which
can thus be protected from a non-retrievable loss,                                                even
though        they      are      exposed         to     the       weather,            i.e.      rain,
spray water, or else to permanent water contact, at all
times.

                   according to the invention.
Description of an exemplary embodiment
Figures        1 to 6 depict the                activation device                  1 according
to      the      invention             in    two      embodiments.               It      consists
essentially            of    the      detection        element       2    and the          trigger
element        3.     Both      elements,        namely         the   detection            element
2    and      the      trigger           element        3,      have     a     substantially
cylindrical            design         in   these       exemplary          embodiments              and
are arranged on a common axis                            4.    Indication elements 5,
in    the     embodiment            of   display       elements         such      as    e.g.       LED
lights       or     something           comparable,          show the         status         of    the
activation             device          1.   Here,         the      user        can       identify
whether        the      activation          device         1    is  operating            reliably
and actuates the corresponding trigger mechanism in the
case        of     an      emergency           or     whether         malfunctions                 are
present.
Additionally,                provision          is       made       for       an       actuation
element         6     in    the       form    of     a    pushbutton.             The      trigger
mechanism is             interrupted if this actuation element                                   6 is
actuated.          On    the      basis     of   a    sounding        signal,          the     users
identify         that      triggering          will      take      place      within         a   very
short        period          of      time     and        they      are       thus       able         to
interrupt the latter by way of this actuation.

The      activation             device       1    has       neither        a  main       switch        nor
other        switching           elements.            It      is     constantly         in     use     and
can only be switched off by removing the battery, which
guarantees                a        long-term                duration.            Alternatively,
provision             is    made       for      a     sensor          which      determines            the
use.       By way of example,                   if the device is in a cupboard,
the       activation             device        1     autonomously              switches           itself
off.
Figures          2    and     5   substantially                  depict      the     housing         7  of
the detection element 2.
The      housing          7     of    the      detection              element        2   preferably
consists of             impact-resistant plastic. It                             is an integral
component            which        can     be     sealed           in    a  waterproof             manner
after introduction of the                            electronics into the cavity 8
provided             in     the       housing            7.       Sealing        is      preferably
brought          about       by way of           adhesive            bonding        or   ultrasonic
welding.            Hence,        the      housing            is     completely          waterproof
and        then        can       also        only          be      replaced          as       a     whole
component.
Openings            10,     arranged           in      such        a    way    that        fluid,       in
particular             water,         can     flow        therethrough,              are      provided
in    the      housing wall              9.    This        brings        about      the     provision
of,      in    turn,        a    further          cavity          11    behind       the      openings
10,      at    which        further          cavity          the      corresponding             sensors
12,     which are           required          for the            detection element                2,   are
arranged.            Thus,        sensors          are       protected          correspondingly
well against mechanical damage.
Figures         3 and 6 additionally                        depict the trigger element
3.    It     has     a   housing         15,     on which             an  adapter        element        16
and      a    detonator           17    with       a     firing         pin   18      (depicted         in
figures           2    and      5)     are      arranged.              On    one     end       face     19
thereof,           the     housing          15    is      connected          to    the      detection
element          2,    whereas,          by way          of the        coupling        element         13,
it    is screwed onto a lifejacket via the adapter element
16 on the other end face 20.

The       screwing          is     configured              in      such         a    way        that       the
firing         pin       18   lies        at     least         indirectly                against           the
opening of a storage container 14,                                    which is filled with
gas,       or     it    accordingly           releases            a   pre-tensioned                  firing
pin.
The      coupling         element        13    per       se   is      a    component             which        is
coupled          to    the   lifejacket.               This      is      a    typical          component
which,         in      principle,            also        finds         use        if     there          is       a
conventional              form      of     the      trigger,             for      example           a    salt
tablet.           Hence,      this       coupling            element            13     is      producer
dependent              and,      firstly,            serves           to        bring          about          an
opening of the storage container 14                                      filled with gas and
secondly             serves       to      allow         manual            triggering               of      the
lifejacket             by   way     of     a    grip        element            connected            to     the
coupling element 13.                     Therefore, it is also an object of
the      activation          device         1   to      be    adaptable             by     way      of     the
corresponding               adapter        element           16      to      any      embodiment              of
coupling            element      13,      independently                 of      the     manufacturer
of the latter.
Figures          2    and 5    also       depict         the     arrangement                of part           of
the       trigger         element         3     in      relation             to     the        detection
element          2.     The   corresponding                 adapter            element          16    has        a
different              design,        depending              on       the         design           of      the
connection              element       on      the       lifejacket.                At      least,          the
internal             design       of     the       cavity           11       of     the        detection
element 2 is depicted schematically. A                                          further cavity 8
of      the      detection         element           2    is     occupied             by      a    circuit
board          21.       This      circuit             board          21        constitutes                the
microprocessor-controlled                                  trigger                  system                 for
lifejackets.              The     sensors          12     are       connected             directly           to
the      circuit         board      21     such        that       these          can     be      inserted
together into the cavity 8 as an assembly. A battery 23
ensures a reliable voltage, even over a relatively long
period of time.
As       a     result        of     the        relatively                high         short-circuit
current          required        for     the      ignition,             i.e.       the      opening up
of an opening in the storage container, use can only be

made       of    so-called             wound       batteries           or    the       circuit         is
developed           in     a      corresponding                manner       such        that        high
discharging            currents             are     available.           These        embodiments
can     provide        a     typical           discharging            current       of      1000 mA.
Since       these      are       also       obtainable            in   the    region         of     3 V,
the        voltage           can         also        be       used       to       operate             the
microprocessor.                Thus,        a   service        life     of   approximately                2
to    3 years is guaranteed in any case.
The        indication              elements           5      are       likewise           connected
directly         to    the       circuit          board       21.     These      are      alignable
in     such     a   way       that       these       are      then      contactable            with       a
housing        end side.            The       confirmation            element       6    is     also      a
constituent of the circuit board 21.
The      cavity      8    is     predominantly                occupied        by    the       circuit
board        21    with         the       battery          23.       However,         as      already
described          above,          part        of   the      extent      of    the       housing          9
has     openings         10,       within         which      the      sensors       12      then      are
arranged. A           corresponding grating serves to protect the
sensors        12    from        corresponding               mechanical           damage.          As     a
result,         the      already            mentioned            further        cavity           11    is
created         within          the       cavity        8.      The     cavity         8     and      the
cavity       11    are     completely              separated          from one         another         in
terms         of       fluids             such        that          the      sensor            12      is
correspondingly exposed to the water whereas the cavity
8 has a completely fluid-tight embodiment.
Furthermore,             a     contact           pin     24     extends        away        from       the
circuit board 21.                   Said contact pin serves to provide an
electrical            connection                to     the       trigger         element.             The
electrical           connection               takes     place         between       the       contact
pin 24       and the detonating cap                        18.      If the thresholds are
correspondingly                 exceeded,           there       is    an   electrical             pulse
on    the     detonating             cap      which      then        explodes       in      turn      and
immediately             drives            a     pin-like            embodiment            into        the
opening of the storage container 14 with the gas.

The      connection          between          the    detection          element          2   and the
trigger element               3 preferably likewise has                           a    fluid-tight
design.
The       embodiment            in      accordance            with         figures          4     to      6
provides         for a       retaining            ring     25   to   be provided               in    the
region        of    the     detection           element       2,    said        retaining          ring
being         suitable          for       the       indication             element          5     being
visible         to      the      user       and      for     the     retaining              ring       25
enclosing           the      material          provided          by    the       rescue        means,
e.g.       cloth,        in    a     positionally             secured          manner         between
itself and the detection element 2.
Figure        7 shows the application of the activation device
1.    The     activation           device         1   is    arranged         on     an    automatic
vest       A.    It     is    affixed          by     way     of    appropriate               adapter
elements,           which     will       still       be     described          in     more     detail
below,        to    the     automatic          vest      A.   The    user         who wears          the
automatic            vest       can       identify          whether           the       activation
device         1      is     functioning                reliably           by      way       of      the
indicators           5. Additionally,                  said user can download data
from      the     activation            device         1  by way         of    an     appropriate
transfer         technology            U using,          for     example,           a   smartphone
S    or    comparable            devices.           By   way     of    example,            data      can
include          the        operating            state,        charge           state        of      the
battery         or     the     like.        Additionally,             it      is      possible         to
adjust          the        trigger           parameters,             depending               on      the
embodiment.
The depicted activation device                              1 is    simply screwed onto
the       provided          location           on      the    automatic              vest       A.     It
replaces          the       previous           conventional            trigger            mechanism
and can replace the latter without further aids.
The       actuation           element           6    can      also        be      provided           for
manually actuating the trigger mechanism if the                                               sensors
12    have      not     yet     detected          the    corresponding                data     or    the
thresholds             of     the       present          data      have          not      yet      been
exceeded.           Alternatively,                the     manual         trigger          mechanism

can      be     arranged            -     as     previously              -      on     the       coupling
element 13.
A    further         application               of      the      activation              device           1     is
depicted           in     figure           8.      The        activation               device           1     is
embodied          as    depicted           in,      for      example,            figures          1    to      7,
but      with     the     difference              that        said      activation              device            1
is    fastened          with       a    buoyancy          body        30    onto       an      object         by
means       of     a   belt       element          31.       The      activation              device          1,
belt element             31 and buoyancy body 30                            form one unit.                  The
activation             device           1    triggers             the       inflation              of       the
buoyancy         bodies        30      if    at    least        one      threshold             parameter
of     a   sensor        12     is       undershot.            This        means         that       in      the
case       where        the      object           G     is      underwater,                the       latter
returns          to     the      water's           surface            as     a      result          of      the
buoyancy          body      30.       However,          the       activation              device         1    is
preferably            defined            in     such        a    way       that        there          is      no
triggering           in     the       case       of     spray        water,          rain,        or      else
when carried through a river or swimming on the water' s
surface.           Predetermined                  applications                   (software             apps)
offer        a    corresponding                 selection              for       the       application
such       that       a     simple          configuration                  of     the        activation
device 1 is possible.
Preferably,             the     activation               device         1    is      embodied            as      a
belt      together          with the           buoyancy           body       30     such that             said
activation           device          can     easily          be     attached           to      an    object
G.    Since       the    activation              device         1    and the          buoyancy            body
30     are     scalable            in     terms         of     the      dimensions               thereof,
attachment           to     different            objects           -    also        with       different
dimensions            -     is      possible.             Therefore,               figure           8     only
shows one possible exemplary embodiment.
In    principle,            the       device        is     delivered             in     a     completely
configured            and     operational                manner.           This        configuration
consists          of    the      generally             valid        pre-adjustment                  of      the
parameters.              That         is       to       say,        the         users          need         not
configure their instrument                             themselves but                 can rely upon
the      system being              ready        for     use       from the            outset         and      at
all times.

However,          so   that      users      active         in     multiple         sports       or
users        for     securing         objects        can      accordingly             optimize
their          activation             device          to        application-specific
boundary          conditions,           the     system         provides          a    wireless
configuration              option,          configurable               by       way        of     a
smartphone           (or   commercially            available          laptop) .         The    use
of         a      personal           smartphone              allows           a       specific
configuration            of     the     device       and      offers       the      following
technical and commercial advantages:
The         device       can       be      adapted           to       specific             sports
applications            and      user     profiles           by     personalizing              the
trigger         parameters.         For    example:          surfers        are     regularly
dragged         to   several       meters       depth      by     waves,       but      this    in
itself        does    not    constitute          a   reason        for    rescue         action.
The surfers           use the light to orient themselves and swim
to      the     water's        surface.         The      situation           only       becomes
critical          when    a    surfer       becomes         disoriented            and       swims
downward          or   else       does     not      move       towards         the      water's
surface.         This    dangerous         situation          can     be    identified          by
the      device by way of a specific                      configuration and, when
necessary, the latter can initiate a rescue action.
The      device     has    a   software        application            which       can     run   on
tablets,          smartphones           or    else       computers.            An     enticing
design         invites       a   download          and     said       application             also
offers         certain       useful        functions           without         the       device,
such       as    e.g.    medical        information            in    respect         of      water
sports           accidents,            emergency            numbers,            first          aid
measures,           information           about         lifejackets              (also        from
competitors),            and      also     e.g.      links        to    qualified            shops
and other subject-related websites.
The       shop     function        of    the     software          allows       replacement
parts        for     the     device        and     also        for     other        automatic
rescue vests to be ordered at the push of a button.
Direct           communication             with        the         customer            or      the
"community" is likewise envisaged.

This      software         is    offered    as      an    application             (app)      for
various platforms                (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.).
The      configuration             adjustment          of     the      device         can     be
carried        out,      for     example,     by       way    of     a    data      transfer
protocol.          NFC,        Bluetooth,        WLAN        or      similar          can     be
provided as data protocols. However, so that the device
requires        as   little        current    as possible,              a   light       sensor
is provided on the activation device, said light                                        sensor
recording light               pulses transferred to the light                         sensor.
The     device      decodes         these   light        pulses        which       serve      to
configure        the      device      (for  example          adjusting          thresholds
in relation to the trigger time).
Since        the    device         is    configured           by     way       of     device
independent         light       pulses    on the        screen,        programming           can
be    carried      out       from all     platforms          and by way            of    a   web
portal/web         shop       by means     of    a     screen.        To   this       end,    it
is    only     necessary          for   the   device        with       a   sensor        to   be
held      so   close       to   the   screen      that      the     light       pulses       are
transferred.
