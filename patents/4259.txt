FIELD
[0002]               The present invention relates to feeder breakers for the mining industry and, in
particular, to an arrangement for coupling a pick to a feeder breaker.
SUMMARY
[0003]              Feeder breakers include a breaker for processing material that is traveling along
a conveyor. Typically, the breaker includes an axle, a drum supported by and rotatable
with the axle, and holders positioned on an exterior surface of the drum. Each holder
supports a pick or an intermediate holder that supports a pick, and the pick engages and
breaks apart the material on the conveyor to ensure that the material on the conveyor
remains at an acceptable size. A conventional holder includes a straight bore that receives
a shank of an intermediate holder. The shank is inserted into the bore from one end and
secured at the opposite end by a threaded nut. A spacer ring is positioned in the bore
between the holder and the shank. As the breaker engages the material, the impact force of
the material against the pick is absorbed by the front face of the holder around the bore
from the intermediate holder. Over time, the holder's face may become distorted and
cause the intermediate holder to become loose, which may cause the impact forces to shear
the shank of the intermediate holder.
[0004]              In one embodiment, the invention provides a pick system including a holder
and a pick assembly. The holder includes a first end, a second end, and a bore extending
between the first end and the second end and defining a longitudinal axis. The surface of
the bore may be tapered so that the diameter of the bore proximate the first end is greater

than the diameter of the bore proximate the second end. The pick assembly includes a
shaft. The shaft is received within the bore of the holder along the longitudinal axis, and
the shaft may be tapered to mate with the bore.
[0005]              In another embodiment, the invention provides a feeder breaker for processing
cut material. The feeder breaker includes a conveyor and a breaker for engaging the cut
material. The conveyor includes a first end for receiving material and a second end for
discharging material. The breaker is positioned between the first end and the second end
of the conveyor. The breaker includes a drum rotatably supported on an axle and a
plurality of pick systems positioned circumferentially around the drum. Each pick system
includes a holder and a pick assembly. The holder has a first end and a second end and
defines a bore extending between the first end and the second end along a longitudinal
axis. A surface of the bore is tapered with a diameter of the bore proximate the first end
being greater than a diameter of the bore proximate the second end. The pick assembly
includes a shaft received within the bore of the holder along the longitudinal axis. The
shaft is tapered to mate with the bore.
[0006]              In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method of manufacturing
a pick system for a breaker including a drum rotatable about a drum axis and having an
outer surface. The method includes forming a pick holder having a first end and a second
end, securing the pick holder to the outer surface of the drum, inserting a pick assembly
into the first end of the bore, and securing the pick assembly relative to the holder. The
pick holder defines a bore extending between the first end and the second end along a
longitudinal axis. Forming includes forming a surface of the bore to be tapered with a
diameter of the bore proximate the first end being greater than a diameter of the bore
proximate the second end. The pick assembly includes a tapered shaft that mates with the
bore.
[0007]               Other independent aspects of the invention will become apparent by
consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0014]              Before any independent embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it
is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of
construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or
illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other independent
embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to
be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of
description and should not be regarded as limiting.
[0015]              FIG. 1 shows a feeder breaker 10 that operates to process material, such as coal,
to a desired size and to convey the material. The feeder breaker 10 includes a frame 14, a
conveyor 18, and a breaker 22. The conveyor 18 moves material from an intake end 26 to
a discharge end 30, and the breaker 22 processes the material therebetween.
[0016]              FIGS. 2-4 illustrate a breaker 22. The breaker 22 includes an axle 34, a drum
38 supported by the axle 34 for rotation therewith, and pick systems 42 extending radially
outward from the drum 38. As shown in FIG. 4, each pick system 42 includes a holder 46
and a pick assembly 50 received within the holder 46. In the illustrated embodiment, the
holder 46 is welded to the drum 38, and each of the holders 46 includes ribs formed on an
exterior surface, which are formed by weld lines. In other embodiments (not shown), the
structure of the holder 46 may be different or the holder 46 may be coupled to the breaker
22 in a different way (e.g., fasteners), as desired. The pick assembly 50 is a replaceable
part that breaks up material being processed. The pick assembly 50 facilitates simple and
easy removal and replacement of the breaker pick 78. As shown in FIG. 4, the pick
assembly 50 includes an intermediate holder 62, a washer 70, a nut 74, a locking pin 76
10075864v1 (GHMatters) P96485.AU.2 3/14/2018

                                                  -4
(FIG. 5), a breaker pick 78, and a pin 80. The pick assembly 50 is coupled to the holder 46
along a longitudinal axis 118 and forms a mining point for processing material.
[0017]              Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the holder 46 has a first end 82 and a second end 86
and defines a bore 90 (FIG. 6) extending between ends 82, 86. As best shown in FIG. 6,
the bore 90 tapers from the first end 82 to the second end 86, so that the diameter of the
bore 90 proximate the first end 82 is larger than the diameter of the bore 90 proximate the
second end 86. In the illustrated embodiment, the bore 90 forms a continuous, inclined
taper substantially between the first end 82 to the second end 86. The tapered bore 90
forms an angle 92 relative to the longitudinal axis 118. In the illustrated embodiment, the
angle 92 is approximately 1.493 degrees. In other embodiments, the angle may be
between approximately one and two degrees relative to the longitudinal axis 118. In still
other embodiments, the angle may be between approximately 0.5 degrees and ten degrees
relative to the longitudinal axis 118.
[0018]              As shown in FIGS. 4-6, the intermediate holder 62 includes a shank or shaft 94,
a threaded end portion 98, a body portion 102, and a shoulder 106 between the shaft 94
and the body portion 102. A pick opening 110 (FIG. 6) is formed on an end of the body
portion 102 and is configured to receive the breaker pick 78. A pin aperture 114 (FIG. 4)
is formed in the body portion 102 and is transverse to and offset from the longitudinal axis
 118 of the pick assembly 50. In the illustrated embodiment, the shaft 94 forms a
continuous surface without any slots or breaks, and the shaft 94 is tapered in a manner that
is substantially identical to the tapered surface of the bore 90. That is, in the illustrated
embodiment, the tapered shaft 94 forms an angle relative to the longitudinal axis 118 that
is substantially equal to the angle 92. The shaft 94 substantially mates with the bore 90
while forming a space 120 between the first end 82 of the holder 46 and the shoulder 106.
In one embodiment, the space 120 is between approximately 0.0625 inches and 0.125
inches (one-sixteenth of an inch to one-eighth of an inch). In other embodiments, the
space may be between approximately 0.090 inches and 0.120 inches.
[0019]               The breaker pick 78 includes a mining point 122, a pick shoulder 124
transitioning to a pick shaft 126, and a pin receiving feature in the form of a groove or a
pin recess 130 formed in the shaft 126. The pick shaft 126 is sized to be received within
the pick opening 110 of the intermediate holder 62. Further, the pin recess 130 is
10075864v1 (GHMatters) P96485.AU.2 3/14/2018

                                                  -5
positioned on the pick shaft 126 such that when the breaker pick 78 is installed in the
intermediate holder 62, the pin recess 130 is aligned with the pin aperture 114 (FIG. 4). In
other constructions (not shown), the pin receiving feature could be an aperture, a
depression, a blind hole, or another feature, as desired.
[0020]              In the illustrated embodiment, the pin 80 is a coiled spring pin, and both the pin
80 and the pin aperture 114 are sized such that the pin 80 is retained by friction within the
pin aperture 114. In the illustrated embodiment, the pin 80 is made from stainless steel.
The pin material resists reaction loads and shear failures that result from the impacts that
the breaker pick 78 absorbs during normal use. In other embodiments (not shown), other
suitable materials may be used or the pin aperture 114 and the pin 80 may be a different
shape (e.g., square, rectangular, oval), as desired.
[0021]               The pick assembly 50 is installed by first inserting the shaft 94 of the
intermediate holder 62 into the holder 46 such that the shoulder 106 faces the first end 82
of the holder 46. With the intermediate holder 62 positioned in the holder 46, one or more
washers 70 are aligned and installed on the shaft 94 of the intermediate holder 62
proximate the second end 86. The nut 74 is then threaded onto the threaded end portion 98
of the intermediate holder 62. The nut 74 is tightened to a desired torque and/or until the
washer(s) 70 are compressed or flattened to a desired thickness. Preferably, this tightness
is applied by a torque wrench to prevent over-tightening. The washer 70 acts in
cooperation with the nut 74 to inhibit the nut 74 from unthreading (i.e., loosening). The
locking pin 76 (FIG. 5) is inserted through at least a portion of the threaded end portion 98
to secure the nut 74 and washer 70 on the threaded end portion 98. In the illustrated
embodiment, the locking pin 76 is a cotter pin.
[0022]               Once the intermediate holder 62 is tightened and secured within the holder 46,
the pick shaft 126 of the breaker pick 78 is inserted into the pick opening 110 such that the
recess 130 aligns with the pin aperture 114. The pin 80 is inserted into the pin aperture
 114 and into the recess 130 of the breaker pick 78 so that the pin 80 is engaged between
the body portion 102 of the intermediate holder 62 and the breaker pick 78. Such positive
engagement holds the breaker pick 78 securely in position, while the pin 80 remains within
the pin aperture 114.
10075864v1 (GHMatters) P96485.AU.2 3/14/2018

                                                      -6
[0023]               To remove the breaker pick 78, the above installation process is reversed. The
pin 80 is pushed out of the pin aperture 114 and therefore out of engagement with the
breaker pick 78. Once the used breaker pick 78 is removed, a new breaker pick 78 may be
reinserted into the holder 62.
[0024]               The pick assembly 50 provides a system for replacing breaker picks on feeder
breakers with relatively simple tooling. Also, the tapered shaft 94 provides a larger surface
area for distributing stress from the impact loads, which may prevent the stress from being
concentrated around the first end 82 of the holder 46. In addition, the tapered bore 90 and
shaft 94 eliminate the need for a spacer ring, which may reduce the likelihood of shear
failure caused by the spacer ring becoming distorted during operation.
[0025]              Furthermore, in the illustrated embodiment, if the nut 74 were to become loose
during operation, the intermediate bit holder 62 would re-seat itself within the bore 90
during the subsequent impact. As a result, the stress would continue to be distributed
among the tapered surfaces, which may reduce wear on the intermediate pick holder 62
and extend the life of the pick assembly 50. These and other independent advantages may
lead to savings and physical advantages for the end user. When installed, the breaker pick
system 50 does not penalize machine performance and may provide an added benefit for
the end user.
[0026]               Thus, the invention may provide, among other things, a tapered pick holder.
Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred
embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or more
independent aspects of the invention as described.
