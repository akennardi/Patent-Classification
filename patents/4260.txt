                                                FIELD
[0003]      The disclosed examples relate generally to user interfaces of electronic devices.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0004]      Messages can include a variety of media, such as audio, video, or images. Some
systems may require users to launch media applications outside of the messaging application in
order to capture, transmit, and view media. Furthermore, including media in a message may
require the user to perform multiple steps to capture the content, include the captured content in a
message, and send the message to a recipient. The recipient may then need to perform multiple
steps or explicitly launch a separate media application to play back or view the content.
                                        BRIEF SUMMARY
[0005]      In addition to sharing media, users may also wish to easily share their location
information with one or more other users from within a message application, or initiate an audio
                                                   1

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
operation for communication. A message user interface that supports quick capture and sending
of media and location information in a message, or initiates an audio operation, to one or more
recipients is desirable.
[0006]       Some techniques for sharing media and location information using electronic devices,
however, are generally cumbersome and inefficient. For example, to the extent that sharing of
media and/or location information is supported, existing techniques use a complex and time
consuming user interface, which may include multiple key presses or keystrokes. Existing
techniques require more time than necessary, wasting user time and device energy. This latter
consideration is particularly important in battery-operated devices.
[0007]       In some embodiments, a method for capturing and sending media from within a
message application comprises: at an electronic device having a touch-sensitive surface and a
display: displaying, on the display, a media affordance and a message region for displaying
messages sent between participants in a message conversation; detecting a gesture on the touch
sensitive surface that includes detecting a contact at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that
corresponds to a location of the media affordance on the display; in response to detecting the
contact: displaying a send affordance on the display; detecting a continuation of the gesture that
includes detecting movement of the contact across the touch-sensitive surface followed by
detecting lift-off of the contact from the touch-sensitive surface; determining whether the
contact moved to a location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to a location of the
send affordance on the display; and in accordance with a determination that the contact moved to
the location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the location of the send
affordance, and in response to detecting the lift-off, sending media captured in response to at
least a portion of the gesture to a participant in the message conversation.
[0008]       In some embodiments, a method for capturing and sending video from within a
message application comprises: at an electronic device having a touch-sensitive surface and a
display: displaying, on the display, a media affordance and a message region for displaying
messages sent between participants in a message conversation; detecting a first input on the
touch-sensitive surface, wherein the first input corresponds to a location of the media affordance
on the display; in response to detecting the first input, displaying a record affordance and a send
affordance; detecting a second input on the touch-sensitive surface, wherein the second input
corresponds to a location of the record affordance on the display; in response to detecting the
second input, beginning to record a video; detecting a third input on the touch-sensitive surface,
wherein the third input corresponds to a location of the send affordance on the display; and in
response to detecting the third input: sending the recorded video to a participant, and removing
the send affordance and the record affordance from the display.

plurality of messages meets message grouping criteria; in accordance with a determination that
the plurality of messages does not meet the message grouping criteria, displaying a plurality of
separate bounded message areas representing the plurality of messages; and in accordance with a
determination that the plurality of messages meets the message grouping criteria, displaying a
single group bounded message area representing the plurality of messages.
[0011]       In some embodiments, a method for deleting expired messages from a message
conversation comprises: at an electronic device comprising a touch-sensitive surface and a
display: receiving a first message; displaying a representation of the first message on the display,
wherein the first message is scheduled to be deleted upon satisfaction of expiration criteria;
displaying an affordance for keeping the first message; in accordance with a determination that
the affordance was selected prior to the satisfaction of the expiration criteria, keeping the first
message; and in accordance with a determination that the expiration criteria has been satisfied
without detecting selection of the affordance, ceasing to display the representation of the first
message on the display.
[0012]       In some embodiments, a method for sharing location information comprises: at an
electronic device comprising a touch-sensitive surface and a display: displaying, on the display, a
message region for displaying messages sent between a first participant and a second participant
in a message conversation; displaying a share-location affordance for sharing the location of the
first participant with the second participant as the location changes over at least a predetermined
time period; detecting a selection of the share-location affordance; and in response to detecting
the selection of the share-location affordance: providing the second participant with information
enabling the second participant to determine a current location of the first participant during at
least the predetermined time period.

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0089]      The following description sets forth exemplary methods, parameters and the like. It
should be recognized, however, that such description is not intended as a limitation on the scope
of the present disclosure but is instead provided as a description of exemplary embodiments
[0090]      There is a need for electronic devices with faster, more efficient methods and
interfaces for capturing, sending, and playing media content or location data on portable
electronic devices. For example, user interfaces that enable users to capture and send media
content from within a messaging application can reduce the number of inputs required to share
such content and reduce the cognitive burden on a user who participates in a message
conversation, thereby enhancing productivity. Further, such techniques can reduce processor
and battery power otherwise wasted on redundant user inputs.
[0091]      Below, FIGS. 1A-IB, 2, 3, 4A-4B, 5A-5B, and 50-59 provide a description of
exemplary devices for performing the techniques for capturing, sending, and playing or viewing
media objects or location content. FIGS. 6A-32C illustrate exemplary user message user
interfaces for capturing, sending, playing or viewing media objects or location content, and
sending recorded audio messages. FIGS. 33-49 are flow diagrams illustrating methods of
capturing, sending, and playing or viewing media and location content, grouping messages for
display, removing expired messages from a conversation, initiating an audio operation, and
sending a recorded message.
[0092]      Although the following description uses terms "first," "second," etc. to describe
various elements, these elements should not be limited by the terms. These terms are only used
to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first touch could be termed a second
touch, and, similarly, a second touch could be termed a first touch, without departing from the

[0094]       The term "if' may be construed to mean "when" or "upon" or "in response to
determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase "if it
is determined" or "if [a stated condition or event] is detected" may be construed to mean "upon
determining" or "in response to determining" or "upon detecting [the stated condition or event]"
or "in response to detecting [the stated condition or event]," depending on the context.
[0095]       Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices, and associated
processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the device is a portable
communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also contains other functions, such as
PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary embodiments of portable multifunction devices
include, without limitation, the iPhone@, iPod Touch@, and iPad @ devices from Apple Inc. of
Cupertino, California. Other portable electronic devices, such as laptops or tablet computers
with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or touchpads), are, optionally,
used. It should also be understood that, in some embodiments, the device is not a portable
communications device, but is a desktop computer with a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch
screen display and/or a touchpad).
[0096]       In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display and a
touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the electronic device
optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices, such as a physical
keyboard, a mouse, and/or a joystick. The device may support a variety of applications, such as
one or more of the following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word
processing application, a website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet
application, a gaming application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application, an
                                                   10

    WO 2015/183756                                                            PCT/US2015/032309
e-mail application, an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a photo
management application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera application, a web
browsing application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital video player application.
[0097]      The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at least one
common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface. One or more
functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information displayed on the
device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the next and/or within a
respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch-sensitive
surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of applications with user interfaces that are
intuitive and transparent to the user.
[0098]      Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch
sensitive displays. FIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction device 100
with touch-sensitive display system 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch-sensitive
display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience, and is sometimes known as or
called a "touch-sensitive display system." Device 100 includes memory 102 (which optionally
includes one or more computer-readable storage mediums), memory controller 122, one or more
processing units (CPUs) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF circuitry 108, audio circuitry 110,
speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (1/0) subsystem 106, other input control devices 116,
and external port 124. Device 100 optionally includes one or more optical sensors 164. Device
100 optionally includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of
contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112
of device 100). Device 100 optionally includes one or more tactile output generators 167 for
generating tactile outputs on device 100 (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive
surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device
300). These components optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or
signal lines 103.
[0099]      As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact on a touch
sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g., a finger
contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for the force or pressure of a
contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of values that
includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of distinct values (e.g.,
at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or measured) using various
approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For example, one or more force
sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally, used to measure
force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, force
                                                   11

    WO 2015/183756                                                            PCT/US2015/032309
measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a weighted average) to determine
an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure-sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used
to determine a pressure of the stylus on the touch-sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the
contact area detected on the touch-sensitive surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of
the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance
of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally,
used as a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In
some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are used
directly to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity
threshold is described in units corresponding to the substitute measurements). In some
implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are converted to an
estimated force or pressure and the estimated force or pressure is used to determine whether an
intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure threshold
measured in units of pressure). Using the intensity of a contact as an attribute of a user input
allows for user access to additional device functionality that may otherwise not be accessible by
the user on a reduced-size device with limited real estate for displaying affordances (e.g., on a
touch-sensitive display) and/or receiving user input (e.g., via a touch-sensitive display, a touch
sensitive surface, or a physical/mechanical control such as a knob or a button).
[00100]      As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to physical
displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical displacement of a
component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another component (e.g.,
housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center of mass of the
device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For example, in situations
where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a surface of a user that is
sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile output generated
by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile sensation corresponding
to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the component of the device.
For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-sensitive display or trackpad)
is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down click" or "up click" of a physical actuator
button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as an "down click" or "up click"
even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button associated with the touch
sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's movements. As another
example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally, interpreted or sensed by the
user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface, even when there is no change in smoothness
of the touch-sensitive surface. While such interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to
                                                   12

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
the individualized sensory perceptions of the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch
that are common to a large majority of users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as
corresponding to a particular sensory perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click,"
"roughness"), unless otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical
displacement of the device or a component thereof that will generate the described sensory
perception for a typical (or average) user.
[00101]     It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has more or fewer components than shown,
optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different configuration or
arrangement of the components. The various components shown in FIG. 1A are implemented in
hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software, including one or more
signal processing and/or application specific integrated circuits.
[00102]     Memory 102 may include one or more computer-readable storage mediums. The
computer-readable storage mediums may be tangible and non-transitory. Memory 102 may
include high-speed random access memory and may also include non-volatile memory, such as
one or more magnetic disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid
state memory devices. Memory controller 122 may control access to memory 102 by other
components of device 100.
[00103]     Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output peripherals of the
device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120 run or execute various
software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory 102 to perform various functions
for device 100 and to process data. In some embodiments, peripherals interface 118, CPU 120,
and memory controller 122 may be implemented on a single chip, such as chip 104. In some
other embodiments, they may be implemented on separate chips.
[00104]     RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also called
electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from electromagnetic
signals and communicates with communications networks and other communications devices via
the electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 optionally includes well-known circuitry for
performing these functions, including but not limited to an antenna system, an RF transceiver,
one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more oscillators, a digital signal processor, a CODEC
chipset, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, memory, and so forth. RF circuitry 108
optionally communicates with networks, such as the Internet, also referred to as the World Wide
Web (WWW), an intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular telephone network, a
wireless local area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network (MAN), and other devices
by wireless communication. The RF circuitry 108 optionally includes well-known circuitry for
                                                 13

detecting near field communication (NFC) fields, such as by a short-range communication radio.
The wireless communication optionally uses any of a plurality of communications standards,
protocols and technologies, including but not limited to Global System for Mobile
Communications (GSM), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), high-speed downlink
packet access (HSDPA), high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA), Evolution, Data-Only (EV

communication (NFC), wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA), code division
multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low
Energy (BTLE), Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) (e.g., IEEE 802.1la, IEEE 802.1lb, IEEE 802.11g,
IEEE 802.1 In, and/or IEEE 802.1 lac), voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Wi-MAX, a
protocol for e-mail (e.g., Internet message access protocol (IMAP) and/or post office protocol
(POP)), instant messaging (e.g., extensible messaging and presence protocol (XMPP), Session
Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), Instant
Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), and/or Short Message Service (SMS), or any other
suitable communication protocol, including communication protocols not yet developed as of the
filing date of this document.
[00105]     Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio interface
between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from peripherals
interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the electrical signal to
speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human-audible sound waves. Audio
circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by microphone 113 from sound waves.
Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to audio data and transmits the audio data to
peripherals interface 118 for processing. Audio data may be retrieved from and/or transmitted to
memory 102 and/or RF circuitry 108 by peripherals interface 118. In some embodiments, audio
circuitry 110 also includes a headset jack (e.g., 212, FIG. 2). The headset jack provides an
interface between audio circuitry 110 and removable audio input/output peripherals, such as
output-only headphones or a headset with both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears)
and input (e.g., a microphone).
[00106]     1/0 subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as touch
screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118. 1/0 subsystem 106
optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158, intensity sensor
controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161, and one or more input controllers 160 for other
input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160 receive/send electrical signals
from/to other input control devices 116. The other input control devices 116 optionally include
physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker buttons, etc.), dials, slider switches, joysticks, click
                                                  14

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
wheels, and so forth. In some alternate embodiments, input controller(s) 160 are, optionally,
coupled to any (or none) of the following: a keyboard, an infrared port, a USB port, and a pointer
device such as a mouse. The one or more buttons (e.g., 208, FIG. 2) optionally include an
up/down button for volume control of speaker 111 and/or microphone 113. The one or more
buttons optionally include a push button (e.g., 206, FIG. 2).
[00107]      A quick press of the push button may disengage a lock of touch screen 112 or begin a
process that uses gestures on the touch screen to unlock the device, as described in U.S. Patent
Application 11/322,549, "Unlocking a Device by Performing Gestures on an Unlock Image,"
filed December 23, 2005, U.S. Pat. No. 7,657,849, which is hereby incorporated by reference in
its entirety. A longer press of the push button (e.g., 206) may turn power to device 100 on or off.
The user may be able to customize a functionality of one or more of the buttons. Touch screen
112 is used to implement virtual or soft buttons and one or more soft keyboards.
[00108]      Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output interface
between the device and a user. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals
from/to touch screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual
output may include graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof (collectively termed
"graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output may correspond to user
interface objects.
[00109]      Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor, or set of sensors that accepts
input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112 and display
controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in memory 102)
detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch screen 112 and convert
the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects (e.g., one or more soft keys,
icons, web pages, or images) that are displayed on touch screen 112. In an exemplary
embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112 and the user corresponds to a finger of
the user.
[00110]      Touch screen 112 may use LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, LPD (light
emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode) technology, although other
display technologies may be used in other embodiments. Touch screen 112 and display
controller 156 may detect contact and any movement or breaking thereof using any of a plurality
of touch sensing technologies now known or later developed, including but not limited to
capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well as other proximity
sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact with touch screen
112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected mutual capacitance sensing technology is used,
such as that found in the iPhone@ and iPod Touch@ from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.

reference in its entirety. However, touch screen 112 displays visual output from device 100,
whereas touch-sensitive touchpads do not provide visual output.
[00112]      A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be as
described in the following applications: (1) U.S. Patent Application No. 11/381,313, "Multipoint

Application No. 11/367,749, "Multi-Functional Hand-Held Device," filed March 3, 2006. All of
these applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
[00113]      Touch screen 112 may have a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In some
embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi. The user may
make contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or appendage, such as a stylus, a
finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user interface is designed to work primarily with
finger-based contacts and gestures, which can be less precise than stylus-based input due to the
larger area of contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some embodiments, the device
translates the rough finger-based input into a precise pointer/cursor position or command for
performing the actions desired by the user.
[00114]      In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100 may include a
touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some embodiments,
the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch screen, does not display
visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from touch screen
112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the touch screen.
[00115]      Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various components.
Power system 162 may include a power management system, one or more power sources (e.g.,
                                                  16

battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power failure detection circuit, a power
converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light-emitting diode (LED)) and any other
components associated with the generation, management and distribution of power in portable
devices.
[00116]      Device 100 may also include one or more optical sensors 164. FIG. 1A shows an
optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in I/O subsystem 106. Optical sensor 164
may include charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164 receives light from the environment, projected
through one or more lenses, and converts the light to data representing an image. In conjunction
with imaging module 143 (also called a camera module), optical sensor 164 may capture still
images or video. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the back of device 100,
opposite touch screen display 112 on the front of the device so that the touch screen display may
be used as a viewfinder for still and/or video image acquisition. In some embodiments, an
optical sensor is located on the front of the device so that the user's image may be obtained for
video conferencing while the user views the other video conference participants on the touch
screen display. In some embodiments, the position of optical sensor 164 can be changed by the
user (e.g., by rotating the lens and the sensor in the device housing) so that a single optical sensor
164 may be used along with the touch screen display for both video conferencing and still and/or
video image acquisition.
[00117]      Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165.
FIG. 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159 in I/O
subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more piezoresistive
strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric force sensors, optical
force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity sensors (e.g., sensors used to
measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch-sensitive surface). Contact intensity
sensor 165 receives contact intensity information (e.g., pressure information or a proxy for
pressure information) from the environment. In some embodiments, at least one contact
intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch
sensitive display system 112). In some embodiments, at least one contact intensity sensor is
located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112, which is located on the
front of device 100.
[00118]      Device 100 may also include one or more proximity sensors 166. FIG. 1A shows
proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, proximity sensor 166
may be coupled to input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106. Proximity sensor 166 may
perform as described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 11/241,839, "Proximity Detector In

And Systems For Automatic Configuration Of Peripherals," which are hereby incorporated by
reference in their entirety. In some embodiments, the proximity sensor turns off and disables
touch screen 112 when the multifunction device is placed near the user's ear (e.g., when the user
is making a phone call).
[00119]      Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators 167.
FIG. 1A shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback controller 161 in 1/0
subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes one or more electroacoustic
devices such as speakers or other audio components and/or electromechanical devices that
convert energy into linear motion such as a motor, solenoid, electroactive polymer, piezoelectric
actuator, electrostatic actuator, or other tactile output generating component (e.g., a component
that converts electrical signals into tactile outputs on the device). Contact intensity sensor 165
receives tactile feedback generation instructions from haptic feedback module 133 and generates
tactile outputs on device 100 that are capable of being sensed by a user of device 100. In some
embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch
sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112) and, optionally, generates a tactile
output by moving the touch-sensitive surface vertically (e.g., in/out of a surface of device 100) or
laterally (e.g., back and forth in the same plane as a surface of device 100). In some
embodiments, at least one tactile output generator sensor is located on the back of device 100,

[00121]     In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102 include
operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128, contact/motion
module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of instructions) 132, text input
module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning System (GPS) module (or set of
instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some
embodiments, memory 102 (FIG. 1A) or 370 (FIG. 3) stores device/global internal state 157, as
shown in FIGS. 1A and 3. Device/global internal state 157 includes one or more of: active
application state, indicating which applications, if any, are currently active; display state,
indicating what applications, views or other information occupy various regions of touch screen
display 112; sensor state, including information obtained from the device's various sensors and
input control devices 116; and location information concerning the device's location and/or
attitude.
[00122]     Operating system 126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X, iOS,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various software
components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory
management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication
between various hardware and software components.
[00123]     Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices over one or
more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for handling data
received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124 (e.g., Universal Serial
Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other devices or indirectly over
a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the external port is a
multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or compatible with, the
30-pin connector used on iPod@ (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.
[00124]     Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen 112 (in
conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch-sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad or
physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software components for
performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if contact has
occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an intensity of the contact (e.g., the
force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact),
determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch
sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and determining if the
contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact). Contact/motion
module 130 receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of
the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact data, optionally includes
                                                   19

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a
change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations are, optionally,
applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g.,
"multitouch"/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 and
display controller 156 detect contact on a touchpad.
[00125]     In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or more intensity
thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user (e.g., to determine
whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments, at least a subset of the intensity
thresholds are determined in accordance with software parameters (e.g., the intensity thresholds
are not determined by the activation thresholds of particular physical actuators and can be
adjusted without changing the physical hardware of device 100). For example, a mouse "click"
threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be set to any of a large range of predefined
threshold values without changing the trackpad or touch screen display hardware. Additionally,
in some implementations, a user of the device is provided with software settings for adjusting
one or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by adjusting individual intensity thresholds
and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds at once with a system-level click
"intensity" parameter).
[00126]     Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user. Different
gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g., different motions,
timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by
detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes
detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event at the same
position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of an
icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface
includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging
events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event.
[00127]     Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for rendering and
displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including components for changing the
visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation, contrast, or other visual property) of
graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term "graphics" includes any object that can be
displayed to a user, including, without limitation text, web pages, icons (such as user-interface
objects including soft keys), digital images, videos, animations, and the like.
[00128]     In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing graphics to be
used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code. Graphics module 132
receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying graphics to be displayed along

soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g., contacts 137, e-mail 140, IM 141,
browser 147, and any other application that needs text input).
[00131]      GPS module 135 determines the location of the device and provides this information
for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in location-based dialing, to camera
143 as picture/video metadata; and to applications that provide location-based services such as
weather widgets, local yellow page widgets, and map/navigation widgets).

accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (FIG. 1A) or 370
(FIG. 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a respective application
136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-151, 155, 380-390). Event sorter 170
receives event information and determines the application 136-1 and application view 191 of
application 136-1 to which to deliver the event information. Event sorter 170 includes event
monitor 171 and event dispatcher module 174. In some embodiments, application 136-1
includes application internal state 192, which indicates the current application view(s) displayed
on touch-sensitive display 112 when the application is active or executing. In some
embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is used by event sorter 170 to determine which
application(s) is(are) currently active, and application internal state 192 is used by event sorter
170 to determine application views 191 to which to deliver event information.
[00155]     In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional information,
such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application 136-1 resumes
execution, user interface state information that indicates information being displayed or that is
ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the user to go back to a prior
state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of previous actions taken by the user.
[00156]     Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface 118. Event
information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch-sensitive display
112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118 transmits information it receives
from I/O subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity sensor 166, accelerometer(s) 168, and/or
microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110). Information that peripherals interface 118
receives from I/O subsystem 106 includes information from touch-sensitive display 112 or a
touch-sensitive surface.
[00157]     In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals interface
118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits event
information. In other embodiments, peripherals interface 118 transmits event information only
when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a predetermined noise threshold
and/or for more than a predetermined duration). In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also
                                                  26

    WO 2015/183756                                                            PCT/US2015/032309
includes a hit view determination module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination
module 173.
[00158]     Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for determining
where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views, when touch-sensitive display 112
displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other elements that a user can
see on the display.
[00159]     Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of views,
sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which information is
displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a respective application) in
which a touch is detected may correspond to programmatic levels within a programmatic or view
hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level view in which a touch is detected
may be called the hit view, and the set of events that are recognized as proper inputs may be
determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a touch-based
gesture.
[00160]     Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to sub-events of a
touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy, hit view
determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy which should
handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level view in which an
initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub-events that form an
event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view determination module
172, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch or input source for
which it was identified as the hit view.
[00161]     Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view or views
within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that only the hit
view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event
recognizer determination module 173 determines that all views that include the physical location
of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively involved
views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, even if touch
sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular view, views higher in
the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.
[00162]     Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event recognizer
(e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event recognizer determination
module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to an event recognizer
determined by active event recognizer determination module 173. In some embodiments, event
                                                   27

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
dispatcher module 174 stores in an event queue the event information, which is retrieved by a
respective event receiver 182.
[00163]     In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170. Alternatively,
application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments, event sorter 170 is a
stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory 102, such as contact/motion
module 130.
[00164]     In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event handlers 190
and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions for handling touch
events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface. Each application
view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event recognizers 180. Typically, a
respective application view 191 includes a plurality of event recognizers 180. In other
embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate module, such as a user
interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which application 136-1 inherits methods
and other properties. In some embodiments, a respective event handler 190 includes one or more
of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event data 179 received from
event sorter 170. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176, object updater 177 or
GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192. Alternatively, one or more of the
application views 191 include one or more respective event handlers 190. Also, in some
embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are
included in a respective application view 191.
[00165]     A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event data 179)
from event sorter 170 and identifies an event from the event information. Event recognizer 180
includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some embodiments, event recognizer
180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and event delivery instructions 188 (which
may include sub-event delivery instructions).
[00166]     Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The event
information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch movement.
Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional information, such as
location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a touch the event information
may also include speed and direction of the sub-event. In some embodiments, events include
rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g., from a portrait orientation to a
landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event information includes corresponding
information about the current orientation (also called device attitude) of the device.
[00167]     Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event or sub
event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or determines
                                                 28

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event comparator 184
includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions of events (e.g.,
predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2 (187-2), and others.
In some embodiments, sub-events in an event (187) include, for example, touch begin, touch
end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one example, the definition
for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double tap, for example, comprises
a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a first liftoff (touch
end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, and a second liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase. In another
example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a dragging on a displayed object. The dragging,
for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a
movement of the touch across touch-sensitive display 112, and liftoff of the touch (touch end).
In some embodiments, the event also includes information for one or more associated event
handlers 190.
[00168]      In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an event for a
respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184 performs a hit test
to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For example, in an
application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch-sensitive display
112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112, event comparator 184 performs a
hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is associated with the touch (sub
event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective event handler 190, the event
comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler 190 should be
activated. For example, event comparator 184 selects an event handler associated with the sub
event and the object triggering the hit test.
[00169]      In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event (187) also includes
delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined
whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's event
type.
[00170]      When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub-events do
not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event recognizer 180 enters
an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it disregards subsequent sub
events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event recognizers, if any, that remain
active for the hit view continue to track and process sub-events of an ongoing touch-based
gesture.

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
[00171]     In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes metadata 183 with
configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery system should
perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some embodiments,
metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how event
recognizers may interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some embodiments,
metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate whether sub
events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
[00172]     In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event handler 190
associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are recognized. In
some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event information associated with
the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler 190 is distinct from sending (and
deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some embodiments, event recognizer
180 throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and event handler 190 associated with
the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.
[00173]     In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event delivery
instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an event handler.
Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event handlers
associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event handlers associated
with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the event information and
perform a predetermined process.
[00174]     In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in application
136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in contacts module
137, or stores a video file used in video player module. In some embodiments, object updater
177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1. For example, object updater 177
creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a user-interface object. GUI
updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater 178 prepares display information and
sends it to graphics module 132 for display on a touch-sensitive display.
[00175]     In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data updater
176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data updater 176, object
updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of a respective application
136-1 or application view 191. In other embodiments, they are included in two or more software
modules.
[00176]     It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling of user
touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to operate
multifunction devices 100 with input-devices, not all of which are initiated on touch screens. For

example, mouse movement and mouse button presses, optionally coordinated with single or
multiple keyboard presses or holds, contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc. on
touchpads; pen stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye
movements; biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs
corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
[00177]     FIG. 2 illustrates a portable multifunction device 100 having a touch screen 112 in
accordance with some embodiments. The touch screen optionally displays one or more graphics
within user interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described below, a user is
enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the graphics, for example,
with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one or more styluses 203 (not
drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of one or more graphics occurs
when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In some embodiments, the gesture
optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes (from left to right, right to left, upward
and/or downward), and/or a rolling of a finger (from right to left, left to right, upward and/or
downward) that has made contact with device 100. In some implementations or circumstances,
inadvertent contact with a graphic does not select the graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that
sweeps over an application icon optionally does not select the corresponding application when
the gesture corresponding to selection is a tap.
[00178]     Device 100 may also include one or more physical buttons, such as "home" or menu
button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 may be used to navigate to any
application 136 in a set of applications that may be executed on device 100. Alternatively, in
some embodiments, the menu button is implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on touch
screen 112.
[00179]     In some embodiments, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button 204, push
button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume adjustment button(s)
208, subscriber identity module (SIM) card slot 210, headset jack 212, and docking/charging
external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to turn the power on/off on the device by
depressing the button and holding the button in the depressed state for a predefined time interval;
to lock the device by depressing the button and releasing the button before the predefined time
interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or initiate an unlock process. In an alternative
embodiment, device 100 accepts verbal input for activation or deactivation of some functions
through microphone 113. Device 100 also, optionally, includes one or more contact intensity
sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile
output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 100.

[00180]      FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a display and a
touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300 need not be portable.
In some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a
multimedia player device, a navigation device, an educational device (such as a child's learning
toy), a gaming system, or a control device (e.g., a home or industrial controller). Device 300
typically includes one or more processing units (CPUs) 310, one or more network or other
communications interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more communication buses 320 for
interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320 optionally include circuitry
(sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between system
components. Device 300 includes input/output (1/0) interface 330 comprising display 340,
which is typically a touch screen display. 1/0 interface 330 also optionally includes a keyboard
and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and touchpad 355, tactile output generator 357 for
generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g., similar to tactile output generator(s) 167 described
above with reference to FIG. 1A), sensors 359 (e.g., optical, acceleration, proximity, touch
sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors similar to contact intensity sensor(s) 165 described
above with reference to FIG. 1A). Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory,
such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM. or other random access solid state memory devices; and
optionally includes non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices,
optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage
devices. Memory 370 optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from
CPU(s) 310. In some embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures
analogous to the programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100 (FIG. 1A), or a subset thereof. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally
stores additional programs, modules, and data structures not present in memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing
module 380, presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module
386, disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100 (FIG. 1A) optionally does not store these modules.
[00181]      Each of the above-identified elements in FIG. 3 may be stored in one or more of the
previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above identified modules corresponds to a
set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above identified modules or
programs (e.g., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs,
procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise
rearranged in various embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 370 may store a subset of
                                                  32

the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore, memory 370 may store
additional modules and data structures not described above.
[00182]     Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces that may be
implemented on, for example, portable multifunction device 100.
[00183]     FIG. 4A illustrates an exemplary user interface for a menu of applications on portable
multifunction device 100 in accordance with some embodiments. Similar user interfaces may be
implemented on device 300. In some embodiments, user interface 400 includes the following
elements, or a subset or superset thereof:
e           Signal strength indicator(s) 402 for wireless communication(s), such as cellular and
Wi-Fi signals;
e           Time 404;

  indicator 414 of the number of missed calls or voicemail messages;
  o           Icon 418 for e-mail client module 140, labeled "Mail," which optionally includes an
  indicator 410 of the number of unread e-mails;
  o           Icon 420 for browser module 147, labeled "Browser;" and
  o           Icon 422 for video and music player module 152, also referred to as iPod
  (trademark of Apple Inc.) module 152, labeled "iPod;" and
e           Icons for other applications, such as:
  o           Icon 424 for IM module 141, labeled "Messages;"
  o           Icon 426 for calendar module 148, labeled "Calendar;"

  o           Icon 444 for notes module 153, labeled "Notes;" and
  o           Icon 446 for a settings application or module, labeled "Settings," which provides
  access to settings for device 100 and its various applications 136.

[00184]     It should be noted that the icon labels illustrated in FIG. 4A are merely exemplary.
For example, icon 422 for video and music player module 152 may optionally be labeled
"Music" or "Music Player." Other labels are, optionally, used for various application icons. In
some embodiments, a label for a respective application icon includes a name of an application
corresponding to the respective application icon. In some embodiments, a label for a particular
application icon is distinct from a name of an application corresponding to the particular
application icon.
[00185]     FIG. 4B illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300, FIG. 3)
with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, FIG. 3) that is separate from
the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also, optionally, includes one or
more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors 357) for detecting intensity of
contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more tactile output generators 359 for
generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.
[00186]     Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference to inputs
on touch screen display 112 (where the touch-sensitive surface and the display are combined), in
some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from
the display, as shown in FIG. 4B. In some embodiments, the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in
FIG. 4B) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in FIG. 4B) that corresponds to a primary axis (e.g., 453 in
FIG. 4B) on the display (e.g., 450). In accordance with these embodiments, the device detects
contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in FIG. 4B) with the touch-sensitive surface 451 at locations that
correspond to respective locations on the display (e.g., in FIG. 4B, 460 corresponds to 468 and
462 corresponds to 470). In this way, user inputs (e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and movements
thereof) detected by the device on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in FIG. 4B) are used by
the device to manipulate the user interface on the display (e.g., 450 in FIG. 4B) of the
multifunction device when the touch-sensitive surface is separate from the display. It should be
understood that similar methods are, optionally, used for other user interfaces described herein.
[00187]     Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with reference to
finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures), it should be
understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are replaced with input
from another input device (e.g., a mouse based input or stylus input). For example, a swipe
gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a contact) followed by
movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of movement of the contact).
As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click while the cursor is
located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead of detection of the contact followed by

[00188]     FIG. 5A illustrates exemplary personal electronic device 500. Device 500 includes
body 502. In some embodiments, device 500 can include some or all of the features described
with respect to devices 100 and 300 (e.g., FIGS. 1A-4B). In some embodiments, device 500 has
touch-sensitive display screen 504, hereafter touch screen 504. Alternatively, or in addition to
touch screen 504, device 500 has a display and a touch-sensitive surface. As with devices 100
and 300, in some embodiments, touch screen 504 (or the touch-sensitive surface) may have one
or more intensity sensors for detecting intensity of contacts (e.g., touches) being applied. The
one or more intensity sensors of touch screen 504 (or the touch-sensitive surface) can provide
output data that represents the intensity of touches. The user interface of device 500 can respond
to touches based on their intensity, meaning that touches of different intensities can invoke
different user interface operations on device 500.
[00189]     Techniques for detecting and processing touch intensity may be found, for example,
in related applications: International Patent Application Serial No. PCT/US2013/040061, titled
"Device, Method, and Graphical User Interface for Displaying User Interface Objects
Corresponding to an Application," filed May 8, 2013 and International Patent Application Serial
No. PCT/US2013/069483, titled "Device, Method, and Graphical User Interface for
Transitioning Between Touch Input to Display Output Relationships," filed November 11, 2013,
each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[00190]     In some embodiments, device 500 has one or more input mechanisms 506 and 508.
Input mechanisms 506 and 508, if included, can be physical. Examples of physical input
mechanisms include push buttons and rotatable mechanisms. In some embodiments, device 500
has one or more attachment mechanisms. Such attachment mechanisms, if included, can permit
attachment of device 500 with, for example, hats, eyewear, earrings, necklaces, shirts, jackets,
bracelets, watch straps, chains, trousers, belts, shoes, purses, backpacks, and so forth. These
attachment mechanisms may permit device 500 to be worn by a user.
[00191]     FIG. 5B depicts exemplary personal electronic device 500. In some embodiments,
device 500 can include some or all of the components described with respect to FIGS. 1A, IB,
and 3. Device 500 has bus 512 that operatively couples I/O section 514 with one or more
computer processors 516 and memory 518. 1/0 section 514 can be connected to display 504,
which can have touch-sensitive component 522 and, optionally, touch-intensity sensitive
component 524. In addition, 1/0 section 514 can be connected with communication unit 530 for
receiving application and operating system data, using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, near field
communication (NFC), cellular and/or other wireless communication techniques. Device 500

can include input mechanisms 506 and/or 508. Input mechanism 506 may be a rotatable input
device or a depressible and rotatable input device, for example. Input mechanism 508 may be a
button, in some examples.
[00192]      Input mechanism 508 may be a microphone, in some examples. Personal electronic
device 500 can include various sensors, such as GPS sensor 532, accelerometer 534, directional
sensor 540 (e.g., compass), gyroscope 536, motion sensor 538, and/or a combination thereof, all
of which can be operatively connected to I/O section 514.
[00193]      Memory 518 of personal electronic device 500 can be a non-transitory computer
readable storage medium, for storing computer-executable instructions, which, when executed by
one or more computer processors 516, for example, can cause the computer processors to
perform the techniques described above, including processes 3300, 3400, 3500, 3600, 3700,
3800, 3900, 4000, 4600, and 4900 (FIGS. 33-49). The computer-executable instructions can also
be stored and/or transported within any non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for
use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a
computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the
instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the
instructions. For purposes of this document, a "non-transitory computer-readable storage
medium" can be any medium that can tangibly contain or store computer-executable instructions
for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The non
transitory computer-readable storage medium can include, but is not limited to, magnetic,
optical, and/or semiconductor storages. Examples of such storage include magnetic disks,
optical discs based on CD, DVD, or Blu-ray technologies, as well as persistent solid-state
memory such as flash, solid-state drives, and the like. Personal electronic device 500 is not
limited to the components and configuration of FIG. 5B, but can include other or additional
components in multiple configurations.
[00194]      As used here, the term "affordance" refers to a user-interactive graphical user
interface object that may be displayed on the display screen of devices 100, 300, and/or 500
(FIGS. 1, 3, and 5). For example, an image (e.g., icon), a button, and text (e.g., hyperlink) may
each constitute an affordance.
[00195]      As used herein, the term "focus selector" refers to an input element that indicates a
current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some implementations that
include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a "focus selector" so that when an
input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touchpad 355 in FIG. 3 or
touch-sensitive surface 451 in FIG. 4B) while the cursor is over a particular user interface
element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface element), the particular user
                                                   36

    WO 2015/183756                                                            PCT/US2015/032309
interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some implementations
that include a touch-screen display (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112 in FIG. 1A or touch
screen 112 in FIG. 4A) that enables direct interaction with user interface elements on the touch
screen display, a detected contact on the touch-screen acts as a "focus selector" so that when an
input (e.g., a press input by the contact) is detected on the touch-screen display at a location of a
particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface element),
the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some
implementations focus is moved from one region of a user interface to another region of the user
interface without corresponding movement of a cursor or movement of a contact on a touch
screen display (e.g., by using a tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one button to another
button); in these implementations, the focus selector moves in accordance with movement of
focus between different regions of the user interface. Without regard to the specific form taken
by the focus selector, the focus selector is generally the user interface element (or contact on a
touch-screen display) that is controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended
interaction with the user interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user
interface with which the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus
selector (e.g., a cursor, a contact or a selection box) over a respective button while a press input
is detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate that the
user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface elements
shown on a display of the device).
[00196]      As used in the specification and claims, the term "characteristic intensity" of a
contact refers to a characteristic of the contact based on one or more intensities of the contact. In
some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is based on multiple intensity samples. The
characteristic intensity is, optionally, based on a predefined number of intensity samples, or a set
of intensity samples collected during a predetermined time period (e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2,
5, 10 seconds) relative to a predefined event (e.g., after detecting the contact, prior to detecting
liftoff of the contact, before or after detecting a start of movement of the contact, prior to
detecting an end of the contact, before or after detecting an increase in intensity of the contact,
and/or before or after detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact). A characteristic intensity
of a contact is, optionally based on one or more of: a maximum value of the intensities of the
contact, a mean value of the intensities of the contact, an average value of the intensities of the
contact, a top 10 percentile value of the intensities of the contact, a value at the half maximum of
the intensities of the contact, a value at the 90 percent maximum of the intensities of the contact,
or the like. In some embodiments, the duration of the contact is used in determining the
characteristic intensity (e.g., when the characteristic intensity is an average of the intensity of the
                                                    37

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
contact over time). In some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is compared to a set of one
or more intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user.
For example, the set of one or more intensity thresholds may include a first intensity threshold
and a second intensity threshold. In this example, a contact with a characteristic intensity that
does not exceed the first threshold results in a first operation, a contact with a characteristic
intensity that exceeds the first intensity threshold and does not exceed the second intensity
threshold results in a second operation, and a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds
the second threshold results in a third operation. In some embodiments, a comparison between
the characteristic intensity and one or more thresholds is used to determine whether or not to
perform one or more operations (e.g., whether to perform a respective operation or forgo
performing the respective operation) rather than being used to determine whether to perform a
first operation or a second operation.
[00197]      In some embodiments, a portion of a gesture is identified for purposes of determining
a characteristic intensity. For example, a touch-sensitive surface may receive a continuous swipe
contact transitioning from a start location and reaching an end location, at which point the
intensity of the contact increases. In this example, the characteristic intensity of the contact at
the end location may be based on only a portion of the continuous swipe contact, and not the
entire swipe contact (e.g., only the portion of the swipe contact at the end location). In some
embodiments, a smoothing algorithm may be applied to the intensities of the swipe contact prior
to determining the characteristic intensity of the contact. For example, the smoothing algorithm
optionally includes one or more of: an unweighted sliding-average smoothing algorithm, a
triangular smoothing algorithm, a median filter smoothing algorithm, and/or an exponential
smoothing algorithm. In some circumstances, these smoothing algorithms eliminate narrow
spikes or dips in the intensities of the swipe contact for purposes of determining a characteristic
intensity.
[00198]      The intensity of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface may be characterized relative
to one or more intensity thresholds, such as a contact-detection intensity threshold, a light press
intensity threshold, a deep press intensity threshold, and/or one or more other intensity
thresholds. In some embodiments, the light press intensity threshold corresponds to an intensity
at which the device will perform operations typically associated with clicking a button of a
physical mouse or a trackpad. In some embodiments, the deep press intensity threshold
corresponds to an intensity at which the device will perform operations that are different from
operations typically associated with clicking a button of a physical mouse or a trackpad. In some
embodiments, when a contact is detected with a characteristic intensity below the light press
intensity threshold (e.g., and above a nominal contact-detection intensity threshold below which
                                                   38

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
the contact is no longer detected), the device will move a focus selector in accordance with
movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface without performing an operation
associated with the light press intensity threshold or the deep press intensity threshold.
Generally, unless otherwise stated, these intensity thresholds are consistent between different
sets of user interface figures.
[00199]     An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the light
press intensity threshold to an intensity between the light press intensity threshold and the deep
press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as a "light press" input. An increase of
characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the deep press intensity threshold
to an intensity above the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as a "deep press"
input. An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the contact
detection intensity threshold to an intensity between the contact-detection intensity threshold and
the light press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as detecting the contact on the touch
surface. A decrease of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity above the contact
detection intensity threshold to an intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold is
sometimes referred to as detecting liftoff of the contact from the touch-surface. In some
embodiments, the contact-detection intensity threshold is zero. In some embodiments, the
contact-detection intensity threshold is greater than zero.
[00200]     In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are performed in
response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or in response to detecting
the respective press input performed with a respective contact (or a plurality of contacts), where
the respective press input is detected based at least in part on detecting an increase in intensity of
the contact (or plurality of contacts) above a press-input intensity threshold. In some
embodiments, the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the increase in
intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold (e.g., a "down stroke"
of the respective press input). In some embodiments, the press input includes an increase in
intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent
decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective
operation is performed in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the
respective contact below the press-input threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press
input).
[00201]     In some embodiments, the device employs intensity hysteresis to avoid accidental
inputs sometimes termed "jitter," where the device defines or selects a hysteresis intensity
threshold with a predefined relationship to the press-input intensity threshold (e.g., the hysteresis
intensity threshold is X intensity units lower than the press-input intensity threshold or the
                                                  39

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
hysteresis intensity threshold is 75%, 90%, or some reasonable proportion of the press-input
intensity threshold). Thus, in some embodiments, the press input includes an increase in
intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent
decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that corresponds to
the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to
detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the hysteresis
intensity threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input). Similarly, in some
embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device detects an increase in intensity of
the contact from an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity at or
above the press-input intensity threshold and, optionally, a subsequent decrease in intensity of
the contact to an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity, and the respective operation is
performed in response to detecting the press input (e.g., the increase in intensity of the contact or
the decrease in intensity of the contact, depending on the circumstances).
[00202]     For ease of explanation, the descriptions of operations performed in response to a
press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in response to a gesture including
the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to detecting either: an increase in intensity
of a contact above the press-input intensity threshold, an increase in intensity of a contact from
an intensity below the hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity above the press-input
intensity threshold, a decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input intensity
threshold, and/or a decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold
corresponding to the press-input intensity threshold. Additionally, in examples where an
operation is described as being performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of a
contact below the press-input intensity threshold, the operation is, optionally, performed in
response to detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact below a hysteresis intensity threshold
corresponding to, and lower than, the press-input intensity threshold.
[00203]     As used herein, an "installed application" refers to a software application that has
been downloaded onto an electronic device (e.g., devices 100, 300, and/or 500) and is ready to
be launched (e.g., become opened) on the device. In some embodiments, a downloaded
application becomes an installed application by way of an installation program that extracts
program portions from a downloaded package and integrates the extracted portions with the
operating system of the computer system.
[00204]     As used herein, the term "open application" or "executing application" refers to a
software application with retained state information (e.g., as part of device/global internal state
157 and/or application internal state 192). An open or executing application may be any one of
the following types of applications:
                                                  40

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
e            an active application, which is currently displayed on a display screen of the device
that the application is being used on;
e            a background application (or background processes), which is not currently
displayed, but one or more processes for the application are being processed by one or more
processors; and
e            a suspended or hibernated application, which is not running, but has state information
that is stored in memory (volatile and non-volatile, respectively) and that can be used to resume
execution of the application.
[00205]      As used herein, the term "closed application" refers to software applications without
retained state information (e.g., state information for closed applications is not stored in a
memory of the device). Accordingly, closing an application includes stopping and/or removing
application processes for the application and removing state information for the application from
the memory of the device. Generally, opening a second application while in a first application
does not close the first application. When the second application is displayed and the first
application ceases to be displayed, the first application becomes a background application.
[00206]      Attention is now directed to embodiments of message user interfaces for capturing,
sending, and viewing or playing media and location data.
[00207]      FIGS. 6A-32C illustrate exemplary user interfaces for messages, in accordance with
some embodiments. The user interfaces in these figures are used to illustrate the processes
described below, including the processes in FIGS. 33-49.
[00208]      FIG. 6A depicts an exemplary message user interface that is, optionally, displayed by
device 100. The message user interface includes a message region 602 for displaying messages
sent between participants in a message conversation, along with a message compose field 604 for
composing a message. Messages exchanged by the participants are displayed inside bounded
message areas 606. In some embodiments, a bounded message area is a contiguous region that is
visually distinguished from a background of the application canvas.
[00209]      In this embodiment, the message user interface includes two media affordances 608,
610 for capturing and sending media streams: an audio capture affordance 608 for capturing and
sending an audio message, and a visual-media capture affordance 610 for capturing and sending
an image or a video. In this embodiment, the visual-media capture affordance and the audio data
capture affordance are displayed on either side of the message compose field. The message user
interface also includes a virtual keyboard 612 for entering text in the message compose field 604.
In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 6B, in response to detecting a user input in the message
compose field 604, device 100 replaces display of the audio capture affordance 608 with display
of a send button 614 for sending a message.
                                                  41

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
[00210]      As will be described in more detail below, device 100 can capture and send a variety
of media-such as audio, video, and images-from within the messaging application.
[00211]      In some embodiments,, device 100 records and sends an audio message from within
the messaging application. For example, as depicted by FIGS. 6C-D, in response to detecting a
contact on audio capture affordance 608, device 100 displays a visually distinguished region 616
containing a plurality of affordances 618, 620, 622 and begins to record an audio message using
a microphone of device 100. The audio message may be a user speaking or singing, for
example, or some other type of audio message that can be captured by device 100.
[00212]      In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 6D, the visually distinguished region 616
contains a send affordance 618 for sending the captured audio message to a participant in the
message conversation, a cancel affordance 620 for ceasing to record the audio message and
forgoing sending the audio message to a participant, and a record affordance 622 for recording
an audio message. In some embodiments, the send affordance is displayed near the media
affordance on the display.
[00213]      In this embodiment, the visually distinguished region 616 is displayed on the same
side of the display as the audio capture affordance 608, and is vertically centered on the location
corresponding to the audio capture affordance 608. Thus, as a user makes contact with the audio
capture affordance 608, the visually distinguished region 616 appears around the location of the
audio capture affordance, with the record affordance 622 replacing the audio capture affordance
608.
[00214]      As shown in FIG. 6D, the exemplary visually distinguished region 616 is bounded by
an edge 626 of the display and a semi-circle 624 that begins and ends at the edge 626 of the
display and encloses the send affordance 618, the cancel affordance 620, and the record
affordance 622 against the edge of the display. The visually distinguished region 616 may
provide the user with a visual indication that device 100 has entered a media capture mode.
[00215]      In some embodiments, device 100 continues to record an audio message as long as
the contact is maintained at the location on the display corresponding to the record affordance.
In some embodiments, as depicted in FIGS. 7A-B, in response to detecting a swipe gesture on
the display to the send affordance 618, device 100 stops recording the audio message and
immediately sends the recorded audio message to a participant in the message conversation. The
swipe gesture may correspond to a movement of the contact on the display to the send
affordance 618 followed by a lift-off of the contact at the send affordance 618. In some
embodiments, the movement of the contact is detected after the send affordance is displayed.
[00216]      In some embodiments, in conjunction with sending media (such as an audio message)
to a participant in the message conversation, a representation of the media is displayed in the
                                                  42

    WO 2015/183756                                                         PCT/US2015/032309
message region. For example, as shown in FIG. 7B, in some embodiments, device 100 displays
a representation of a sent audio message in a bounded message area 708 that is inserted into the
message conversation. In this embodiment, the representation of the audio message includes an
image of a waveform 702 representing the audio message, a playback affordance 704 for playing
the audio message, and a time duration 706 of the audio message. In some embodiments, the
waveform is generated based on the recorded audio message and depicts specific characteristics
of the audio content of the message. In some embodiments, the waveform is iconic. In some
embodiments, the length of the waveform may correspond to the length of the audio recording.
[00217]     In some embodiments, while recording an audio message device 100 displays a
representation of the audio message in a message compose field. The representation may be a
waveform as described above, and may dynamically change shape as the user records an audio
message to indicate the changing audio content being recorded.
[00218]     In some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on the playback affordance
704, device 100 plays the audio message. In some embodiments, the color of the playback
affordance may change after the audio message has been played to provide a visual indication to
the user that the audio message has been played. In some embodiments, a portion of the
playback affordance changes in appearance as a corresponding portion of the audio message is
played, providing a visual indication of the elapsed playing time.
[00219]     In some embodiments, device 100 displays the waveform 702 representing the audio
message in an initial color, and changes the waveform color when the audio message is played to
provide a visual indication to the user that the audio message has been played. In some
embodiments, device 100 changes the color of a portion of the waveform 702 as a corresponding
portion of the audio message is played, providing a visual representation of the elapsed playing
time. The above-described audio message representations and color changes may be used to
represent any audio message exchanged from within the messaging application, where it is
represented in the message conversation, in the message compose field, or elsewhere.
[00220]     In some embodiments, device 100 stops recording the audio message in response to
detecting the movement of the contact away from the audio capture affordance, either towards
the send affordance or in another direction. In some embodiments, device 100 sends the
recorded audio message in response to detecting a lift-off at the location corresponding to the
send affordance 618 after the movement of the contact. The initial contact on the audio capture
affordance and the subsequent movement of the contact to the send affordance may be
performed by a user as a single, continuous contact on the display.
[00221]     As depicted in FIGS. 7C-D, in some embodiments, if device 100 detects a swipe
gesture on the display to the cancel affordance 620, device 100 ceases to record the audio
                                                  43

     WO 2015/183756                                                         PCT/US2015/032309
message, removes the visually distinguished region 616 from the display, re-displays the audio
capture affordance 608, and forgoes sending the audio message to a participant. In some
embodiments, as discussed earlier with respect to the send affordance, the swipe gesture may
correspond to a single, continuous movement of the contact starting from the initial contact on
the audio capture affordance 608 across the display to the cancel affordance 620, followed by a
lift-off at the cancel affordance 620.
[00222]       In some embodiments, as depicted in FIG. 8, in response to detecting a movement of
the contact on the display away from the record affordance, device 100 expands the visually
distinguished region 616. In some embodiments, the visually distinguished region expands in
accordance with movement of the contact (e.g., the expansion of the visually distinguished
region is proportional to the movement of the contact while the visually distinguished region is
expanding). In some embodiments, the send affordance 618 and the cancel affordance 620
displayed inside the visually distinguished region 616 move outwards in accordance with the
expansion of the visually distinguished region 616. Expanding the visually distinguished region
may provide the user with an indication that device 100 has detected a movement away from the
location of the record affordance, and may also provide the user with a larger area of the display
for performing a swipe gesture, potentially making it easier for the user to control the trajectory
or destination of the swipe gesture.
[00223]       In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 9A, if device 100 detects that a lift-off of the
contact from the display without detecting a previous movement of the contact to the send
affordance or the cancel affordance, device 100 stops recording the audio message, displays a
representation of the audio message in the message compose field 604, and replaces the audio
capture affordance with a send button 906 for sending the recorded audio message to a
participant in the message conversation.
[00224]       As previously discussed with respect to FIG. 7A, in some embodiments, the
representation of the recorded audio message displayed in the message compose field includes an
image of a waveform 702 representing the recorded audio message, a duration 706 of the
recorded audio message, and a playback affordance 704 for playing the recorded audio message.
[00225]       In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 9B, in response to detecting a contact on the
send button 906, device 100 sends the recorded audio message to a participant in the message
conversation and replaces the send button 906 with the audio capture affordance 608. As shown
in FIG. 9B, in some embodiments, after sending the audio message in response to a contact on
the send button, device 100 displays a representation of the sent audio message in a bounded
message area 908 that is inserted into the message conversation.
                                                 44

    WO 2015/183756                                                         PCT/US2015/032309
[00226]     Thus, as described above with respect to FIGS. 6A-9B, in some embodiments, device
100 displays message user interfaces in a messaging application that enable a user to record and
send an audio message from within the messaging application, without requiring the user to
launch a separate application. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the user can record and send
audio message using a single, continuous gesture on the display, comprising an initial contact on
the audio capture affordance followed by a movement to the send affordance and a lift-off. This
approach increases efficiency of the user interface and reduces the cognitive burden on the user.
[00227]     In some embodiments, device 100 can also capture and send camera images from
within the messaging application. In some embodiments, as shown in FIGS. 10A-B, in response
to detecting a contact on the visual-media capture affordance 610, device 100 displays a camera
user interface. The camera user interface includes a live media preview 1010 from a camera
sensor on device 100, and a visually distinguished region 1002 containing an image affordance
1004 for capturing an image using the camera sensor and a record affordance 1006. The visual
media capture affordance 610 is replaced with a cancel affordance 1008. In some embodiments,
the live media preview replaces display of the message region.
[00228]     In this embodiment, the visually distinguished region 1002 appears on the same side
of the display as the visual-media capture affordance 610, and is vertically centered on the
location corresponding to the visual-media capture affordance 610. Thus, as a user makes
contact with the visual-media capture affordance 610, the visually distinguished region 1002
appears around the location of the visual-media capture affordance, and the cancel affordance
replaces the visual-media capture affordance.
[00229]     As depicted in FIGS. 11 A-B, in some embodiments, in response to detecting a swipe
gesture on the display to the image affordance 1004, device 100 captures an image shown in the
preview and sends the image as a message to a participant. The swipe gesture may correspond to
a movement of the contact across the display to the image affordance 1004, followed by a lift-off
at the image affordance 1004. In some embodiments, device 100 captures the image in response
to detecting the movement, and sends the image in response to the lift-off.
[00230]     As shown in FIG. 11B, in some embodiments, after sending the image as a message,
device 100 ceases to display the preview and re-displays the message region, message compose
field, and media affordances. In some embodiments, device 100 displays a thumbnail 1104
representing the captured image in a bounded message area 1106 that is inserted into the
displayed message conversation.
[00231]     FIGS. 1 1C-E depict another technique device 100 can, optionally, use for quick
capture and send of an image from within the messaging application. In some embodiments, as
depicted in FIGS. 11C-E, in response to detecting a contact on the visual media affordance,
                                                 45

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
rather than displaying a live media preview in the message region as described with respect to
FIGS. 10A-B, device 100 expands the message compose field 604 and displays a live media
preview in the message compose field 604. In some embodiments, device 100 replaces display
of the audio capture affordance with display of a send button 614. In some embodiments, in
response to detecting a lift-off of the contact from the visual-media capture affordance 610,
device 100 captures a new image. In some embodiments, the captured image is sent as a
message to a participant in response to detecting the lift-off from the visual-media affordance, or
in response to detecting a contact on the send button 614. In some embodiments, as depicted in
FIG. 1 IC, after sending the image, device 100 displays a thumbnail representing the image in a
bounded message area that is inserted into the displayed message conversation. In some
embodiments, after sending the image, device 100 re-displays the audio capture affordance in
place of the send button.
[00232]     As depicted in FIG. 1 IF, in some embodiments, after detecting the lift-off and
capturing the new image, device 100 displays a representation 1108 of the captured image in the
message compose field 604. In some embodiments, while displaying the representation of the
captured image in the message compose field, device 100 detects user entry of additional content
1110 in the message compose field; for example, the additional content may be entered adjacent
to the representation of the captured image. Such additional content may be textual content as
depicted in FIG. 1 IF, for example, or may be graphical objects such as emoji or icons. In some
embodiments, the additional content and the captured image are sent to the participant in
response to detecting a contact on the send button.
[00233]      In some embodiments, as depicted in FIG. 1 iG, after sending the image and the
additional content to the participant, device 100 displays a thumbnail 1114 representing the
captured image along with the additional content 1110 in a bounded message area 1112 that is
inserted into the conversation. In some embodiments, after sending the image and the additional
content, device 100 re-displays the audio capture affordance in place of the send button.
[00234]     In some embodiments, device 100 can also capture and send a video from within the
messaging application. As previously described with respect to FIG. 10A, in some
embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on the visual-media capture affordance 610,
device 100 displays a camera preview and a visually distinguished region with an image
affordance for capturing an image, a record affordance for capturing a video, and a cancel
affordance for cancelling the media capture.
[00235]     In some embodiments, as depicted in FIGS. 12A-B, in response to detecting a contact
on the record affordance 1006, device 100 begins recording a video, replaces the record
affordance with a stop affordance 1212 for ceasing to record the video, and replaces the image
                                                   46

    WO 2015/183756                                                         PCT/US2015/032309
affordance 1004 with a send affordance 1210 for sending the video to a participant. In some
embodiments, device 100 begins recording the video in response to detecting a movement of the
contact onto the record affordance 1006, or in response to a touch or tap on the record affordance
1006. In some embodiments, while device 100 is recording a video, device 100 displays an
indication of the elapsed recording time 1208.
[00236]     As depicted in FIGS. 13A-C, in some embodiments, if device 100 detects that the
contact has been lifted off of the display while device 100 is recording a video without detecting
a contact on the send affordance 1210, device 100 continues to record the video and replaces
display of the record affordance 1006 with display of a stop affordance 1212. In some
embodiments, while device 100 is recording the video, in response to detecting a contact on the
stop affordance 1212, device 100 stops recording the video and replaces the stop affordance
1212 with a playback affordance 1314 for viewing the recorded video data before sending to a
recipient.
[00237]     In some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on the send affordance 1210,
device 100 stops recording the video (if recording has not already been stopped) and sends the
recorded video to a participant in the message conversation. In some embodiments, as shown in
FIG. 14, device 100 inserts a thumbnail 1402 of the video into the message conversation between
the participants, and removes display of visually distinguished region, including the record
affordance and the send affordance. In some embodiments, inserting the thumbnail includes
displaying the thumbnail 1402 and a playback affordance 1414 in a bounded message area 1406
in the message region. In some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on the playback
affordance 1414 in the bounded message area 1406, device 100 plays the video within the
boundaries of the bounded message area 1406. In some embodiments, in response to detecting a
contact on the playback affordance 1414, device 100 plays the video in a full-screen mode.
[00238]     Returning to FIG. 12A, in some embodiments, device 100 stops recording the video
in response to detecting a lift-off from the record affordance 1006 while device 100 is recording
the video. In some embodiments, after detecting the lift-off from the record affordance 1006 and
stopping the recording of the video, device 100 replaces display of the record affordance 1006
with display of a playback affordance 1314 for viewing the video before it is sent to the
recipient, as depicted in FIG. 13C.
[00239]     Thus, in some embodiments, while the visually distinguished region is displayed, a
swipe upwards to the image affordance captures and sends an image, while a swipe over to the
record affordance followed by a swipe upwards towards the send affordance captures and sends
a video.

[00240]     In some embodiments, the visual-media capture affordance 610 depicted in FIG. 10A
can be used for selecting one or more existing images or videos to add to the message
conversation. These images may have been captured using an application other than the
messaging application; for example, such images or videos may have been captured using a
camera application executing on device 100 or executing on a remote device, or may have been
captured by another user using a different application either on device 100 or on a remote device.
Such existing images or videos may be stored in the memory of device 100 or accessed from a
remote storage location.
[00241]     FIG. 15A displays an exemplary media selector interface that device 100 can,
optionally, display in response to detecting a request to add media to a conversation, such as a
contact on the visual-media capture affordance 610. In some embodiments, the media selector
interface enables a user to select one or more existing images, videos, or audio files to add to the
message conversation. In some embodiments, the media selector interface is displayed below
the message region while a message conversation is displayed. The media selector interface
includes a filmstrip 1502 with several thumbnails 1504 representing existing images or videos.
In some embodiments, the thumbnails 1504 represent the most recently captured or accessed
images, videos, or audio files. In some embodiments, in response to detecting a swipe gesture on
a location associated with a filmstrip 1502, device 100 scrolls the filmstrip in accordance with
the swipe gesture.
[00242]     In some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on a particular thumbnail
1504, device 100 sends the image, video, or audio file associated with the thumbnail to a
participant in the message conversation and inserts a representation 1506 of the image, video, or
audio file into the conversation, as depicted in the example of FIG. 15B.
[00243]     In some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on a particular thumbnail
1504 in the filmstrip 1502, device 100 displays an image or video represented by the thumbnail.
In some embodiments, the image or video can be displayed in a larger version of the image
represented by the thumbnail, such as in a full-screen view.
[00244]     In some embodiments, one thumbnail in a filmstrip 1502 represents a camera
preview. In some embodiments, in response to detecting a selection of the thumbnail
representing the preview, device 100 captures a new image using a camera on device 100 and
sends the new image to a participant in the conversation.
[00245]     FIGS. 16A-B depict another embodiment of a media selector interface for adding
media to a conversation. In this embodiment, the filmstrip 1602 is displayed below the message
compose field 604. In response to detecting a selection of a thumbnail 1604 in the filmstrip, in
some embodiments, device 100 displays a representation 1608 of the selected thumbnail in the
                                                  48

message compose field 604 and replaces display of the audio capture affordance with display of
a send button 614 for sending the image to a participant in the message conversation. In some
embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on the send button 1610, device 100 sends the
image to the participant, and insert a representation of the sent image into the conversation, as
previously shown and described with respect to FIG. 11B.
[00246]     In some embodiments, in response to device 100 detecting selection of two or more
thumbnails 1604 in a filmstrip followed by a selection of the send button 1610, device 100 sends
two or more images or videos corresponding to the selected thumbnails to a participant in the
message conversation.
[00247]     FIGS. 17A-C depict another embodiment of a media selector interface for adding
media to a conversation. As depicted in FIG. 17A, in some embodiments, device 100 displays a
filmstrip 1702 with thumbnails 1704 along with a photo library button 1706 for selecting an
image or video from a library, a take photo button 1710 for capturing a new photo or video, and
a cancel button 1708 for cancelling and exiting the display of the media selector interface. In
some embodiments, the thumbnails 1704 in the filmstrip represent the most recently captured or
accessed images or videos.
[00248]     In some embodiments, in response to detecting a selection of the photo library button
1706, device 100 displays a list of photo libraries 1712, 1714. In some embodiments, in
response to detecting a selection of a photo library in the list, device 100 displays another
filmstrip 1716 with thumbnails 1718 of images or videos from the selected photo library. In
some embodiments, in response to detecting a selection of a particular thumbnail 1718, device
100 displays the image or video represented by the thumbnail or sends the corresponding image
or video to a participant in the conversation, as described above with respect to FIG. 15A.
[00249]     Turning to FIGS. 18A-C, as depicted in FIG. 18B, in some embodiments, in response
to detecting a selection of the take photo button 1710 for taking a new photo or video, device 100
displays a user interface for capturing a new image or video. In some embodiments, the user
interface includes a live camera preview 1802 and a capture button 1804 for capturing the image.
As depicted in FIG. 18C, in some embodiments, in response to detecting a selection of the
capture button 1804, device 100 captures the image shown in the preview and displays the
captured image on the display with a retake button 1806 for retaking the image (e.g., for
capturing another image) and a use button 1808 for sending the captured image to a participant.
In some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on the use button 1808, device 100
immediately sends the captured image to the participant and returns to the display of the message
conversation. In some embodiments, device 100 inserts a representation of the sent image into
the conversation, as described earlier with respect to FIG. 11B.

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
[00250]     In some embodiments, the visual-media capture affordance can be used for both
adding existing media to a conversation and for capturing new media to add to the conversation.
Returning to FIG. 10A, in some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact at a location on
the display corresponding to the visual-media capture affordance 610, device 100 can determine
the duration of the contact. If the duration is greater than a threshold duration-for example, if
the contact is a touch-and-hold on the visual-media capture affordance-device 100 can respond
as described above with respect to FIGS. 10-13, and display user interfaces for capturing and
sending an image or video from within the messaging application. However, if the duration of
the contact does not exceed the threshold duration-for example, if the contact is a short tap on
the visual-media capture affordance 610-then device 100 can display media selector interfaces
for selecting one or more existing images or videos to add to the message conversation. The
threshold duration may be in the range of .5 seconds to 10 seconds, for example.
[00251]     The user interfaces depicted in FIGS. 6A-B depict media affordances and a message
compose field displayed horizontally across a middle portion of the display on device 100, with
each media affordance (the visual-media capture affordance and the audio capture affordance)
displayed along an opposite edge of the display, on either side of the message compose field.
Such locations may be appropriate when a virtual keyboard is displayed on the display for
entering a message to the recipient, as depicted, for example, in FIG. 6A. However, the media
affordances and message compose field need not be displayed in the locations or orientations
shown in FIGS. 6A-B. FIGS. 19A-B depict exemplary alternative locations at which device 100
can display the audio-capture affordance 608, visual-media capture affordance 610, and message
compose field 604. Such alternative locations may be appropriate when a virtual keyboard is not
displayed on the display, and may provide for a larger message region for displaying a message
conversation.
[00252]     As depicted in FIG. 19A, in some embodiments, device 100 displays audio capture
affordance 608 at a corner of the display. As shown in FIG. 20, in some embodiments, in
response to detecting a contact on audio capture affordance in the corner, device 100 displays a
visually distinguished region 2002 that is bounded by an arc 2004 that begins and ends at two
different edges 2006, 2008 of the touch-sensitive display, rather than displaying a semi-circle
that begins and ends at the same edge of the display as described earlier with respect to FIG. 6D,
for example. As previously described with respect to FIG. 8, in response to detecting a
movement of the contact on the display away from the location of the audio capture affordance
608, in some embodiments, device 100 expands the visually distinguished region 2002. In some
embodiments, the locations of the affordances displayed inside the visually distinguished region
moves outwards in accordance with the expansion of the visually distinguished region.

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
[00253]      In some embodiments, a hit region on the display is assigned to a media affordance,
such that a contact anywhere on the hit region is interpreted by device 100 as a contact on the
media affordance. In some embodiments, a hit region is larger than the displayed media
affordance. As depicted in FIGS. 19C-D, in some embodiments, a hit region 1902 for a media
affordance is larger when a virtual keyboard is not displayed, such as in FIG. 19C, than when the
virtual keyboard is displayed, such as in FIG. 19D. For example, when the virtual keyboard is
displayed, the hit region for the media affordance may be slightly larger than the media
affordance (e.g., 5, 10, 15, or 20% larger than the media affordance) and when the virtual
keyboard is not displayed, the hit region for the media affordance may encompass up to half of
the bottom quarter of the display. This approach allows the user to more easily invoke detection
of a contact on the media affordance when there is sufficient room on the display to allow for a
larger hit region.
[00254]      In some embodiments, device 100 can also play a received audio message. In some
embodiments, as shown in FIGS. 21A-B, in response to receiving an audio message from a first
participant, device 100 displays a representation 2108 of the audio message in the message
conversation. In this embodiment, the representation includes an image depicting a waveform
2102 representing the audio message, a playback affordance 2104 for playing the audio message,
and a duration of the audio message 2106. In some embodiments, the representation is displayed
within a bounded message region. In some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on
the playback affordance 2104, device 100 plays the audio message.
[00255]      In some embodiments, after displaying the representation 2108 of the audio message,
device 100 plays the audio message in response to detecting a raising of the device. In some
embodiments, device 100 detects that a user has raised device 100 by using one or more device
motion or orientation sensors to detect movement of device 100 and/or using a proximity sensor
or ambient light sensor to detect the proximity of device 100 to the user's ear. Returning to FIG.
21A, in some embodiments, device 100 prompts the user to play the audio message in this
manner by displaying an instruction 2110 instructing a user to raise device 100 to listen to the
message.
[00256]      As depicted in FIGS. 22A-C, in some embodiments, device 100 records a second
audio message in response to detecting a raising of device 100. For example, if device 100 has
played the received audio message (which may be indicated, as depicted in FIG. 22A, by
displaying the waveform or playback affordance in a different color) and device 100 detects a
raising of device 100, device 100 begins recording the second audio message. In some
embodiments, if device 100 has played the received audio message in response to detecting a
raising of the device (rather than, for example, in response to detecting a contact on the playback
                                                  51

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
affordance) then device 100 records the second audio message only after detecting a lowering of
device 100 prior to detecting a second raising of device 100. In other words, in some
embodiments, a user can raise device 100 to listen to an audio message, lower device 100, and
then raise device 100 again to record a new audio message. In some embodiments, device 100
prompts the user to raise device 100 to record a message by displaying an instruction instructing
a user to raise device 100 to record an audio message.
[00257]      In some embodiments, if, while recording the second audio message, device 100
detects a lowering of device 100, device 100 stops recording the second audio message and
sends the second audio message to the first participant. Lowering of the device may be detected
by, for example, using one or more device motion/orientation sensors to detect movement of the
device and/or using a proximity sensor or ambient light sensor to detect an end of the proximity
of the device to the user's ear. Thus, as described with respect to FIGS. 22A-B, after receiving
and listening to an audio message from a participant in the message conversation, in some
embodiments, the user can respond by raising device 100 to record a second audio message, and
then lowering device 100 to automatically send the second audio message to the participant. In
some embodiments, as depicted in FIG. 22C, device 100 inserts a representation of the sent
second audio message into the conversation. In some embodiments, device 100 determines that
a recorded message should not be sent based on characteristics of the message (e.g., no detected
human speech, or message duration is too long therefore indicative of accidental-messaging and
thus a waste of computing resources). This aspect is shown in FIG. 22D. As depicted, in some
embodiments, device 100 displays message affordance 2214 indicating that a message has been
recorded, but the message is not automatically sent upon lowering of the device. Rather, device
100 displays affordance 2216, which, when selected, sends the message to the designated
contact.
[00258]      As depicted in FIG. 23A, in some embodiments, device 100 displays an affordance
2302 indicating a received message while device 100 is operating in a locked state. A locked
state may be a state in which device 100 limits user interaction with device 100.
[00259]      In some embodiments, as depicted in FIG. 23B, in response to detecting a swipe
gesture in a first direction on the affordance 2302, device 100 displays a reply affordance 2304
for replying to the message. As shown in FIG. 23C, in response to detecting a contact on the
reply affordance 2304, device 100 optionally displays an instruction 2306 instructing the user to
raise the electronic device to record an audio message to send in a response message. In some
embodiments, in response to detecting a raising of device 100, device 100 begins recording an
audio message as previously described with respect to FIGS. 22A-B, and similarly, in response
                                                  52

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
to a subsequent lowering of the device, device 100 sends the audio message as described above
with respect to FIG. 22C.
[00260]      Returning to FIG. 23A, in response to detecting a swipe gesture on the affordance
2302 in the opposite direction, device 100 optionally prompts the user to unlock device 100 and,
in some embodiments, after device 100 is unlocked, device 100 displays the received message as
part of a displayed message conversation.
[00261]      In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 24A, device 100 displays a notification 2402
of a received audio message in a notification area 2404 of the display. As shown in FIG. 24B, in
response to detecting a contact on the notification 2402 or the notification area 2404, such as a
downward drag or a tap, in some embodiments device 100 displays a user interface with a play
affordance 2406 for playing the audio message, an audio capture affordance 608 for recording a
reply audio message, and a cancel affordance 2408 for exiting the user interface. In some
embodiments, as shown in FIG. 24C, in response to detecting a contact on the audio capture
affordance 608, device 100 displays a visually distinguished region 2410 with a plurality of
affordances for recording and sending an audio message, as shown and described with respect to
FIGS. 6D and 20, for example.
[00262]      Similar to the above-described processes for recording audio messages, in some
embodiments, device 100 can play, record, and send video messages in response to detecting
raising and lowering of device 100. In such embodiments, device 100 may use facial recognition
techniques to determine whether device 100 has been raised into a suitable position for playback
or recording of a video message.
[00263]      In some embodiments, media captured by device 100 using the user interfaces
described above includes meta-data. Such meta-data may include a representation of a location
of device 100, for example. In some embodiments, device 100 provides an option to allow a
user to designate whether to prevent sending the meta-data with the media.
[00264]      As previously discussed, device 100 can send and receive messages containing media
(such as audio, video, or image), text, or both. In some embodiments, if device 100 receives
multiple messages within a time interval, and the received messages meet a message grouping
criteria, device 100 represents the messages within a single, group bounded message area rather
than representing the messages in multiple bounded message areas. The time interval may range
from 10 seconds to ten minutes, for example.
[00265]      Grouping representations of messages in this manner can reduce the amount of area
required in the message region for displaying messages, and may reduce the clutter associated
with receiving multiple messages. Grouping may be particularly useful for audio messages,
which can be compressed into relatively small representations for display.
                                                 53

    WO 2015/183756                                                        PCT/US2015/032309
[00266]     In some embodiments, the message grouping criteria includes a criterion that is met
when the number of messages exceeds a numeric threshold. For example, if device 100 receives
some number of consecutive messages within the time interval, and the number exceeds the
numeric threshold, device 100 can, optionally, determine that the messages satisfy the message
grouping criteria and display representations of the messages within a single group bounded
message area. The numeric threshold may be 3, 5, 7, or 10 messages received within the time
interval, for example.
[00267]     In some embodiments, the message grouping criteria includes a criterion that is met
when the received messages are spaced apart from each other by less than a threshold amount of
time. For example, consecutive messages that are spaced apart from each other by less than 30,
20, 10, or 5 seconds may meet the message grouping criteria. For example, if device 100
receives a text message followed by an audio message less than 30 seconds later, device 100 can,
optionally, determine that the messages meet the message grouping criteria and display a
grouped representation of the messages in the conversation.
[00268]     In some embodiments, the message grouping criteria are based on the type of
message received. For example, if device 100 receives multiple consecutive audio messages
within the time interval, device 100 can, optionally, determine that the messages satisfy the
message grouping criteria. If, however, device 100 receives intervening messages that are not
audio messages, device 100 can, optionally, determine that the received messages do not satisfy
the message grouping criteria and display representations of the received messages in separate
bounded message areas.
[00269]     In some embodiments, the message grouping criteria are based on the sender of the
message. For example, consecutive messages received from a single participant in the message
conversation may satisfy the message grouping criteria, but consecutive messages received from
different participants may not satisfy the message grouping criteria.
[00270]     In some embodiments, the message grouping criteria are based on whether the
messages all have the same read status. In some embodiments, the read status corresponds to
whether the message has been read, played, or viewed. For example, consecutive audio
messages that are all unread (e.g., un-played) may satisfy the message grouping criteria, but
consecutive audio messages having different read statuses-that is, some of which have been
played, and some of which have not been played-may not satisfy the message grouping criteria.
[00271]     FIG. 25A depicts an example of displaying representations of multiple audio
messages that meet message grouping criteria in a grouped bounded message area 2502. In
some embodiments, device 100 displays a play-all affordance 2504 for playing all of the grouped
audio messages, in addition to or instead of displaying a playback affordance 2506 for each
                                                 54

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
individual audio message. In some embodiments, device 100 plays back all of the grouped audio
messages in response to detecting a raising of device 100. In some embodiments, device 100
displays an instruction instructing a user to raise device 100 to play all of the multiple grouped
audio messages.
[00272]    In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 25A, each of the audio messages is represented
by a separate waveform image. However, in some embodiments, device 100 displays a single,
composite waveform representing the multiple grouped audio messages.
[00273]    FIG. 25B depicts an example of displaying multiple audio messages that do not meet
the message grouping criteria in a plurality of bounded message areas 2508.
[00274]    In some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on a grouped bounded
message area 2502, such as shown in FIG. 25A, device 100 displays the audio messages
represented by the grouped bounded message area 2502 in separate bounded message areas
2508, such as shown in FIG. 25B.
[00275]    FIG. 25C depicts an example of displaying a thumbnail representation of multiple
image messages 2510 that meet the message grouping criteria in a grouped bounded message
area 2512. FIG. 25D depicts an example of displaying representations of multiple image
messages that do not meet the message grouping criteria in a plurality of bounded message areas
2514.
[00276]    In some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on a grouped bounded
message area 2512, such as shown in FIG. 25C, device 100 displays representations of the image
messages in separate bounded message areas 2514, such as shown in FIG. 25D.
[00277]    As shown in FIG. 25E, in some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on a
grouped bounded message area 2512 representing multiple image or video messages, device 100
displays thumbnails 2518 representing the images or videos in a filmstrip 2516 on the display.
In some embodiments, the thumbnails 2518 displayed in the filmstrip 2516 are larger than the
thumbnails displayed in the bounded message area, and are, optionally, scrollable.
[00278]    Because the user interfaces described above make it easy for participants to exchange
media in a message conversation, in some cases, participants may exchange many media
messages within a conversation session. For example, participants may exchange multiple short
audio messages during the course of a message conversation. In some cases, such exchanged
messages may be intended as quick, informal communications that do not need to be retained,
and may clutter the participants' message conversation display. Accordingly, in some
embodiments, device 100 schedules messages that cease to be displayed in a conversation based
upon satisfaction of some expiration criteria. In some embodiments, ceasing to display a
                                                  55

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
message includes deleting the message from device 100. The purpose of the automatic deletion
is not privacy, but rather, avoiding cluttering the conversation with transient messages.
[00279]      In some embodiments, the expiration criteria are based on whether the message
contains any media content, or based on which type of media content a message contains. For
example, audio messages may have a different expiration criteria than video messages. In some
embodiments, text messages do not have any expiration criteria and are therefore never
automatically deleted.
[00280]      In some embodiments, the expiration criteria are based on a time interval. In some
embodiments, the time interval may be measured starting from the time the media is captured
(e.g., for the conversation participant who captured the media), or from the time the media has
been played (e.g., for the conversation participant who received the media). In some
embodiments, the expiration criteria for a message are different for a first participant than for a
second participant. In some embodiments, the time interval may be 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3
minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes, for example.
[00281]      In some embodiments, the expiration criteria are based on whether the media object
was captured using the message user interfaces described above with respect to FIGS. 6A-14, for
example, or captured using a different application, such as a camera application. In some
embodiments, media captured and added to the conversation using the quick media capture
approach described with respect to FIGS. 6A- 14, which may be intended as informal, transitory
communications, may have a different expiration criteria than media added to the conversation
using a different approach, such as a media selector interface as described with respect to FIGS.
15A-18C.
[00282]      A person of skill in the art will understand that the above-described exemplary
expiration criteria can be combined or modified in many ways.
[00283]      In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 26, device 100 provides an indication of the
expiration criteria 2602 in the representation of the message. In the embodiment shown in FIG.
26, the indication of the expiration criteria 2602 comprises the time interval after which the
message will cease to be displayed in the message conversation.
[00284]      As depicted in FIG. 26, in some embodiments, device 100 displays a keep affordance
2604 for keeping a message that would otherwise be deleted after the expiration criteria are
satisfied. In some embodiments, in response to detecting a selection of the keep affordance
2604, device 100 ignores the expiration criteria and continues to display the message in the
conversation. In some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on the keep affordance
2604, device 100 ceases to display the indication of the expiration criteria and/or ceases to
display the keep affordance.

    WO 2015/183756                                                         PCT/US2015/032309
[00285]     In some embodiments, media messages added to a conversation using the interfaces
described in FIGS. 6A-14, which may be intended as informal, transitory communications, are
not added to a media library (such as a camera roll or audio library) when sent or received, but
media messages added to a conversation using the interfaces described in FIGS. 15A-18C are
added to the media library. In some embodiments, keeping a media message (by selecting the
keep affordance, for example) adds the media to the media library.
[00286]     In some embodiments, a message having an associated expiration criteria that is sent
from a first participant to a second participant in a message conversation can be kept by the first
participant, by the second participant, by both, or by neither.
[00287]     As depicted in FIG. 27A, after sending an audio message from a first participant to a
second participant in a message conversation, device 100 optionally provides, to the first
participant, an indication 2702 that the audio message has been delivered to the second
participant. As depicted in FIG. 27B, in response to detecting that the second participant has
played at least a portion of the audio message, device 100 optionally provides, to the first
participant, an indication 2704 that the audio message has been played. As shown in FIG. 27C,
in response to detecting that the second participant has selected a keep affordance associated
with the audio message, device 100 optionally provides, to the first participant, an indication
2706 that the second participant has kept the message. In some embodiments, the indicator that
the message has been kept replaces an indicator that the message has been delivered or
played/viewed/read.
[00288]     In some embodiments, device 100 can also send static location information or share
dynamic location information between two or more participants in a message conversation, and
display the location information of the two or more participants on a map.
[00289]     In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 28A, while displaying a message
conversation, device 100 displays a details affordance 2702 for displaying additional details
about a message conversation. As shown in FIG. 28B, in some embodiments, in response to
detecting a contact on the details affordance, device 100 displays representations 2704 (such as
thumbnails or waveforms) of media that has been exchanged during the conversation, a send
location affordance 2706 for sending the current location information of device 100 to one or
more participants in the conversation, and a share-location affordance 2708 for sharing location
information of device 100 with one or more participants for a predetermined period of time.
[00290]     In some embodiments, in response to detecting a selection of the send-location
affordance 2706, device 100 provides a participant in the message conversation with current
location information for device 100. As shown in FIG. 28C, in some embodiments, device 100
inserts a map 2710 depicting the current location information into the conversation. In some
                                                  57

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
embodiments, the location information sent in response to detecting the contact on the send
location affordance 2706 is static, and is not subsequently updated in accordance with changes in
the location of device 100.
[00291]      As shown in FIGS. 29A-B, in some embodiments, in response to detecting a selection
of the share-location affordance 2708, device 100 displays a user interface 2902 for selecting a
predetermined time period during which the location information will be shared. In response to
detecting a selection of one of the predetermined time periods, device 100 provides a participant
in the message conversation with information enabling the participant to determine the location
of device 100 during the selected time period. In some embodiments, providing the information
causes a remote electronic device used by the participant receiving the information to prompt the
participant to share their location with the user of device 100. In some embodiments, after the
selected time period has elapsed, device 100 can cease to share the location information with the
participant.
[00292]      In some embodiments, enabling a participant to determine the location of device 100
includes enabling the participant to request information about the location of device 100 from a
location server to which device 100 sends location information.
[00293]      As depicted in FIG. 29C, in some embodiments, while sharing location information,
device 100 displays a stop-sharing affordance 2904 for ceasing to share the location information
with the participant before the time period has elapsed.
[00294]      In some embodiments, device 100 can receive location information from another
participant in the message conversation. In some embodiments, in response to receiving the
location information, as shown in FIG. 30, device 100 prompts the user of device 100 to share
their location information with the other participant. In some embodiments, in response to
detecting that the user has selected to share their location information, device 100 provides the
other participant with information enabling the participant to determine the location of device
100. As discussed previously with respect to FIG. 29B, device 100 can, optionally, allow the
user to select a predetermined time period for which the location information will be shared.
[00295]      As discussed above, in some embodiments, device 100 receives shared location
information from a participant in a message conversation. In some embodiments, the location
information comprises the location of an external device. In some embodiments, in response to
receiving the location information, device 100 displays a map depicting both the location of the
electronic device and the location of the external device.
[00296]      As shown in FIG. 31, in some embodiments, device 100 can receive shared location
information from multiple participants in a message conversation, and in response, display a map
3102 depicting the locations 3104 of the multiple participants and the location of device 100
                                                  58

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
3106 (on the same map). In some embodiments, device 100 displays information 3108 about
each of the participants whose locations are displayed on the map.
[00297]     In some embodiments, any one of multiple participants in a conversation can add or
remove one or more other participants from the conversation, or can change the name of the
message conversation.
[00298]     As depicted in FIG. 32A, in some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on
a map 3202 in a message conversation, device 100 displays a larger version of the map 3204. In
some embodiments, in response to detecting a contact on the larger map 3204, device 100
displays a satellite image 3206 of location information shared by a participant in a message
conversation, a map image 3208 of the location information, and affordances for displaying
directions to 3210 or directions from 3212 the location information.
[00299]     As previously described above with respect to FIGS. 28A-C and 29A-C, in some
embodiments, device 100 provides message user interfaces that allow participants to easily send
their current location to each other or share their location with each other for a predetermined
period of time.
[00300]     In some embodiments, after the predetermined time period has elapsed, device 100
changes the color of the displayed map (for example, map 2710 in FIG. 28C) to indicate that it is
no longer being updated with the location information. In some embodiments, in response to
detecting a contact on the map after the predetermined time period has elapsed, device 100
displays an affordance indicating that the location information is no longer being shared.
[00301]     FIG. 33 is a flow diagram illustrating process 3300 for quick capture and send of
media. Process 3300 may be performed at an electronic device with a display and a touch
sensitive surface, like device 100 (FIG. 2). At block 3302, the device displays on its touch
sensitive display a media affordance and a message region for displaying messages sent between
participants in a message conversation. At block 3304, the device detects a gesture on the touch
sensitive surface that includes detecting a contact at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that
corresponds to a location of the media affordance on the display. At block 3306, in response to
detecting the contact, the device displays on its touch-sensitive display a send affordance. In
block 3308, the device detects a continuation of the gesture that includes detecting movement of
the contact across the touch-sensitive surface followed by detecting lift-off of the contact from
the touch-sensitive surface. At block 3310, the device determines whether the contact moved to
a location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to a location of the send affordance on
the display. At block 3312, in accordance with a determination that the contact moved to the
location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the location of the send affordance,
and in response to detecting the lift-off, the device sends media captured in response to at least a

portion of the gesture to a participant in the message conversation. Optionally, in some
embodiments, in response to detecting the contact shown in block 3304, the device may display a
cancel affordance on the display, determine whether the contact moved to a location on the
touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to a location of the cancel affordance on the display,
and, in accordance with a determination that the contact moved to the location on the touch
sensitive surface that corresponds to the location of the cancel affordance, followed by the lift
off, the device may forgo sending the captured media to the participant. In some embodiments,
in accordance with a determination that the contact did not move to the location on the touch
sensitive surface that corresponds to the location of the send affordance nor to the location on the
touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the location the cancel affordance, and in response to
detecting the lift-off, the device may display an image in the message compose field, the image
having a waveform representing the captured media (represented by B in FIG. 33). In some
embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the contact did not move to the location
on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the location of the send affordance nor to the
location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the location the cancel affordance, and
in response to detecting the movement, the device can cease to capture the media (represented by
B' in FIG. 33).
[00302]     Note that details of the processes described above with respect to process 3300 (e.g.,
FIGS. 33 and 6A-14) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the other processes described
herein. For example, processes 3400, 3500, 3600, 3700, 3800, 3900, 4000, 4600, and 4900 may
include one or more of the characteristics of the various processes described above with
reference to process 3300. For brevity, these details are not repeated in the descriptions of the

[00303]     FIG. 34 is a flow diagram illustrating process 3400 for quick video capture. Process
3400 may be performed at an electronic device with a display and a touch-sensitive surface, like
device 100 (FIG. 2). At block 3402, the device displays on the display a media affordance and a
message region for displaying messages sent between participants in a message conversation. At
block 3404, the device detects a first input corresponding to a location of the media affordance
on the display on the touch-sensitive surface. At block 3406, in response to detecting the first
input, the device displays a record affordance and a send affordance. At block 3408, the device
detects a second input corresponding to a location of the record affordance on the display on the
touch-sensitive surface. At block 3434, in response to detecting the second input, the device
begins to record a video. At block 3412, the device detects a third input corresponding to a

location of the send affordance on the display on the touch-sensitive surface. At block 3414, in
response to detecting the third input, the device sends the recorded video to a participant and
removes the send affordance and the record affordance from the display. Optionally, at block
3414, the device may, in response to detecting the third input, insert a thumbnail representation
of the recorded video into the displayed message conversation.

FIGS. 34, 10A-B, and 12A-14) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the other processes
described herein. For example, processes 3300, 3500, 3600, 3700, 3800, 3900, 4000, 4600, and
4900 may include one or more of the characteristics of the various processes described above
with reference to process 3400. For brevity, these details are not repeated in the descriptions of
the other processes. The various methods and techniques described above with reference to
process (method) 3400 may be optionally implemented as one or more units, such as those
described with regard to FIG. 51.
[00305]      FIG. 35 is a flow diagram illustrating process 3500 for responding to an audio
message by raising an electronic device. Process 3500 may be performed at an electronic device
with a display and a touch-sensitive surface, like device 100 (FIG. 2). At block 3502, the device
displays a representation of a first audio message received from a first participant in a message
conversation. At block 3504, the device detects a request to play the first audio message.
Optionally at block 3504, in some embodiments, the device detects the request to play the first
audio message by detecting a separate raising of the device while the representation of the first
audio message is displayed. Optionally at block 3504, in some embodiments, the device detects
the request to play the first audio message by detecting a contact at a location on the touch
sensitive surface that corresponds to the location of the displayed representation of the first audio
message. At block 3506, in response to detecting the request, the device plays the first audio
message. At block 3508, after playing the first audio message, the device detects a raising of the
device. At block 3510, in response to detecting the raising of the device, the device records a
second audio message. Optionally, at block 3510, while recording the second audio message,
the device may detect a lowering of the device, and in response to detecting the lowering of the
device, the device may cease to record the second audio message. At block 3512, after recording
the second audio message, the device sends the second audio message to the first participant.
Optionally, at block 3512, in response to detecting the lowering of the device, and after ceasing

[00307]      FIG. 36 is a flow diagram illustrating process 3600 for message grouping. Process
3600 may be performed at an electronic device with a display and a touch-sensitive surface, like
device 100 (FIG. 2). At block 3602, the device receives a plurality of messages from a first
participant within a time interval. At block 3604, the device determines whether the plurality of
messages meets message grouping criteria. In some embodiments, message grouping criteria
may include a criterion that is met when the number of messages in the plurality of messages
exceeds a numeric threshold. In some embodiments, message grouping criteria may include a
criterion that is met when the plurality of messages are spaced apart from each other by less than
a threshold amount of time. In some embodiments, message grouping criteria may include a
criterion that is met when the plurality of messages are sequentially adjacent messages. In some
embodiments, sequentially adjacent messages may include messages having the same read status
without any intervening received messages with a different read status. At block 3606, in
accordance with a determination that the plurality of messages meets the message grouping
criteria, the device displays a single group bounded message area representing the plurality of
messages. Optionally, at block 3606, in some embodiments where the grouped bounded
message area represents at least two audio messages, the device may receive a request to
sequentially play the at least two audio messages and, in response to receiving the request,
sequentially play the at least two audio messages. At block 3608, in accordance with a
determination that the plurality of messages does not meet the message grouping criteria; the
device displays a plurality of separate bounded message areas representing the plurality of
messages.

[00309]      FIG. 37 is a flow diagram illustrating process 3700 for managing message display
based upon expiration criteria. Process 3700 may be performed at an electronic device with a
display and a touch-sensitive surface, like device 100 (FIG. 2). At block 3702, the device
receives a first message. At block 3704, the device displays a representation of the first message,
which is scheduled to be deleted upon satisfaction of expiration criteria, on the display. In some
embodiments, the expiration criteria may be based on a time interval. In some embodiments, the
expiration criteria may be based on whether the first message contains media. In some
embodiments, the expiration criteria may be based on whether the media was captured using a
quick media capture approach, such as described with respect to FIGS. 6A-14, or using another
approach. At block 3706, the device displays an affordance for keeping the first message. At
block 3708, in accordance with a determination that the affordance was selected prior to the
satisfaction of the expiration criteria, the device keeps the first message. Optionally, at block
3708, if the first message contains media, in accordance with a determination that the affordance
was selected prior to the satisfaction of the expiration criteria, the device may save the media in a
media library. In some embodiments, device 100 only saves media that was captured using a
quick media capture approach, such as described with respect to FIGS. 6A-14. In some
embodiments, if the first message contains media and the expiration is based on a time interval,
the time interval may be measured starting from a time after the media is played. In some
embodiments, if the first message contains media and the expiration is based on a time interval,
the time interval may be measured starting from a time when the media is created. At block
3710, in accordance with a determination that the expiration criteria has been satisfied without
detecting selection of the affordance, the device ceases to display the representation of the first
message on the display. Optionally, at block 3710, the device may receive a second message
that is not deleted based on the expiration criteria.

FIGS. 37 and 26-27C) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the other processes
described herein. For example, processes 3300, 3400, 3500, 3600, 3800, 3900, 4000, 4600, and
4900 may include one or more of the characteristics of the various processes described above
with reference to process 3700. For brevity, these details are not repeated in the descriptions of
the other processes. The various methods and techniques described above with reference to

displaying messages sent between a first participant and a second participant in a message
conversation. At block 3804, the device displays a share-location affordance for sharing the
location of the first participant with the second participant as the location changes over at least a
predetermined time period. At block 3806, the device detects a contact at a location on the
touch-sensitive display that corresponds to a location of the share-location affordance on the
display. At block 3808, in response to detecting the contact at the location on the touch-sensitive
display that corresponds to the location of the share-location affordance, the device provides the
second participant with information enabling the second participant to determine a current
location of the first participant during at least the predetermined time period. In some
embodiments, the device may allow the user to select a time period. Optionally, at block 3808,
in response to detecting the contact at the location corresponding to the share-location
affordance, the device may display at least two affordances corresponding to at least two
predetermined time periods, detect a contact at a location on the touch-sensitive surface
corresponding to a location of one of the at least two affordances on the display, and, in response
to detecting the contact at the location on the touch-sensitive surface corresponding to the
location of one of the at least two affordances on the display, provide the second participant with
information enabling the second participant to determine the current location of the first
participant during the predetermined time period corresponding to the one of the at least two
affordances. Optionally, at block 3808, the device may receive from the second participant
location information dynamically indicating a location of a first external device and display, on
the display, a location of the electronic device and the location of the first external device on a
map. Optionally, at block 3808, the device may add a third participant to the message
conversation, receive from the third participant location information indicating a location of a
second external device, and display, on the display, the location of the second external device on
the map. Optionally, at block 3808, the device may display, on the display together with the
message conversation, a details affordance, detect a contact at a location on the touch-sensitive
surface that corresponds to a location of the details affordance on the display, and, in response to
detecting the contact at the location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the
location of the details affordance on the display, display the map showing the location of two or
more participants in the message conversation that have shared their location.
[00312]     Note that details of the processes described above with respect to process 3800 (e.g.,

[00313]     FIG. 39 is a flow diagram illustrating process 3900 for adding media to a message
conversation. Process 3900 may be performed at an electronic device with a display, a touch
sensitive surface, and a camera sensor. At block 3902, the device displays on the display, a
message region for displaying a message conversation. At block 3904, the device receives a
request to add media to the message conversation. At block 3906, in response to receiving the
request, the device displays a media selection interface concurrently with at least a portion of the
message conversation, the media selection interface including a plurality of affordances, at least
a subset of which includes thumbnail representations of media available for adding to the
message conversation, for selecting media for addition to the message conversation. At block
3908, the device detects selection of a respective affordance from the plurality of affordances.
At block 3910, in response to detecting selection of the respective affordance, the device selects
corresponding media for addition to the message conversation. Optionally, at block 3910, in
response to detecting selection of the respective affordance, the device may add the media to the
message conversation. Optionally, at block 3910, if the plurality of affordances includes a live
preview affordance, the device may detect a contact at a location on the touch-sensitive display
that corresponds to a location of the live preview affordance on the display and, in response to
detecting the contact at the location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the
location of the live camera preview, capture a new image based on the live camera preview and
select the new image for addition to the message conversation.
[00314]     Note that details of the processes described above with respect to process 3900 (e.g.,
FIGS. 39 and 15A-18C) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the processes described
herein. For example, processes 3300, 3400, 3500, 3600, 3700, 3800, 4000, 4600, and 4900 may
include one or more of the characteristics of the various processes described above with
reference to process 3900. For brevity, these details are not repeated in the descriptions of the
other processes. The various methods and techniques described above with reference to process

with regard to FIG. 56.
[00315]     FIG. 40 is a flow diagram illustrating process 4000 for initiating an audio operation.
Process 4000 is performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 100) with a display (e.g., display
112 of device 100) and a microphone (e.g., microphone 113 of device 100). At block 4002, the
device detects a change in device context based on movement of the electronic device and one or
more proximity sensor readings (e.g., by rising motion as depicted in FIG. 21B). At block 4004,
                                                 65

    WO 2015/183756                                                             PCT/US2015/032309
the device determines, in response to detecting the change in device context, whether the device
meets audio-operation criteria. For example, the audio-operation criteria include a criterion that
is met when the movement of the electronic device satisfies movement criteria and the proximity
sensor reading(s) satisfy a proximity criteria. At block 4006, the device, in accordance with a
determination that the change in device context satisfies the audio-operation criteria, initiates an
audio operation. At block 4008, the device, in accordance with a determination that the change
in device context does not satisfy the audio-operation criteria, forgoes initiating the audio
operation.
[00316]      Advantageously, process 4000 enables users to initiate an audio operation with a
simple gesture (e.g., by raising a phone to the user's ear). Process 4000 reduces the need for
users to inspect the device and select affordances thereon in order to initiate audio operations
such as the sending of audio messages. Further, movement criteria and proximity criteria
combine to beneficially reduce the amount of erroneous audio operations. The increased
efficiency of the user interface and the reduced occurrence and duration of erroneous audio
operations both reduce energy usage by the device, which is particularly important for battery
powered devices where reduced energy usage increases battery life.
[00317]      In some embodiments, a movement criteria is met when the device takes the upward
trajectories illustrated in FIGS. 21A-22C. In some embodiments, movement of the device is
tracked using one or more of accelerometer 168 and optional sensors on device 100 (FIG. 1A).
In some embodiments, a movement criterion is met when the device is in an orientation distinct
from a predetermined orientation(s) (e.g., met when the device is not upside down). In some
embodiments, the movement criterion is met when the device takes a generally upward trajectory
or a trajectory that is upward with the device rotating from having its display close to parallel
with the Earth's surface (e.g., when the user is viewing the indication of the communication on
the display) to its display being close to vertical with the earth's surface (e.g., when the user has
raised the device to place it next to the user's ear to listen to or record an audio message).
[00318]      In some embodiments, a proximity criteria is met when the phone is at the user's face
as shown in FIG. 21B. In some embodiments, proximity sensor readings are provided by
proximity sensor 166 of device 100 and the proximity criteria is met when the sensor indicates
close proximity (e.g., within a few inches) with an object, which may be a user's face.
[00319]      FIGS. 41A and 41B are flow diagrams illustrating optional sub-processes within
block 4002 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). In some embodiments, one or more of optional processes
4102-4106 depicted in FIG. 41A are performed in block 4002 (FIG. 40). At block 4102, the
device receives a communication, for example, an audio message, a text message, a voicemail, a
phone call. At block 4104, in response to receiving the communication and before detecting the
                                                   66

    WO 2015/183756                                                            PCT/US2015/032309
change in device context (e.g., before block 4004 of process 4000 in FIG. 40), the device
provides an indication that the communication was received. Possible indications include a
visual notification (e.g., a message received banner or an application-specific display such as a
message bubble), a tactile notification (e.g., vibration), or an audio notification (e.g., a beep, or a
ringtone). Possible indications include those that are displayed in a user interface locked state as
well as those displayed in a user interface unlocked state. In some embodiments, displaying the
indication that the communication was received involves launching a messaging application. A
messaging application is one that is configured to process short messages via services such as
SMS and MMS, and/or text messages via services such as iMessage@ provided by Apple, Inc. of
Cupertino, California, for example.
[00320]       At block 4106, the device plays an audio component of the received communication,
prior to detecting the change in context of the device. For example, if the communication
includes a message with an audio component that has not been played by the device, e.g., a new
audio message, then the audio operation includes playing the audio component of the message.
As another example, if the communication includes a voicemail message, then plays the
voicemail message.
[00321]       Turning to FIG. 41B, in some embodiments, optional processes 4108 and 4110 are
performed at block 4002 (FIG. 40). At block 4108, prior to detecting a change in device context,
the device detects that it is in an audio messaging context. For example, the device determines
that it is in the messaging-context when an incoming messaging having an audio component is
received (optionally within some window of recency). As another example, the device
determines that it is in the message-context when a messaging application is active. At block
4110, the device detects a change in device context only when the electronic device is in an
audio messaging context (e.g., when a communication application is open or a communication
has been recently received). An advantageous effect of processes 4108 and 4110 is that the
accelerometers and/or proximity sensors needed to detect a raise-to-talk movement may be
powered-down (or at least not actively monitored) when the device is out of the audio context,
thereby reducing power usage (e.g., reducing the resources used to monitor changes in device
context as well as reducing the resources used to record and process audio from false positive
detections), and thus conserves power and extends battery life for the device.
[00322]       In some embodiments, as discussed above, at block 4110 the device monitors for
changes in device context only when the electronic device is in an audio messaging context. In
some embodiments, the device does not monitor for changes in device context that satisfy the
audio-operation criteria, even when a multimedia messaging application is open, unless a
currently selected conversation in the multimedia messaging application includes at least one
                                                  67

    WO 2015/183756                                                             PCT/US2015/032309
message that has an audio component (e.g., an audio component recorded and sent by the user or
one of the other participants of the conversation). As noted above, reducing the situations in
which the device monitors for changes in device context reduces power usage of the device,
thereby conserving power and extending battery life for battery operated devices. Additionally,
reducing the situations in which the device monitors for changes in device context reduces the
likelihood of false positive initiation of audio operations (e.g., starting to record audio when the
user lifts the device and puts it on a dresser while in a news application), thereby improving the
overall quality of the user experience.
[00323]      FIGS. 42A-43C are flow diagrams illustrating optional sub-processes within block
4004 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). Turning to FIG. 42A, in some embodiments, optional process
4202 is performed at block 4004 (FIG. 40). At block 4202, the device determines whether the
message was received within a predefined time interval before detecting the change in device
context, and playing the audio component of the message includes playing the audio component
of the message if the message was received within the predefined time interval. If the message
was not received within the time interval, block 4202 (and thus block 4004) provides an outcome
of "no" and processing proceeds to block 4008 (FIG. 40), where the device forgoes the
opportunity to initiate an audio operation such as recording a new audio message. If the message
was received within the time interval, block 4202 provides an outcome of "yes" and, if other
requirements within block 4004 are also met, then processing proceeds to block 4006 (FIG. 40),
where the device may initiate an audio operation such as recording a new audio message. As an
example, the newly recorded audio message is a response to the received communication.
[00324]      Turning to FIG. 42B, in some embodiments, optional process 4204 is performed at
block 4004 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). Recall that in some embodiments, before arriving at
process 4204, the device has played the audio component of a received communication. In these
situations, the device may perform optional block 4204 to determine whether a detected change
in device context occurred within a predetermined time interval of playing the audio message. If
the change in device context occurred outside the time interval, block 4204 (and thus block
4004) provides an outcome of "no" and processing proceeds to block 4008 (FIG. 40), where the
device forgoes the opportunity to initiate an audio operation such as recording a new audio
message. If the change in context was detected within the predetermined time interval from the
time at which the audio component was played, block 4204 provides an outcome of "yes" and, if
other requirements within block 4004 are also met, then processing proceeds to block 4006,
where the device may initiate an audio operation such as recording a new message.
[00325]      Turning to FIG. 43A, in some embodiments, optional process 4302 is performed at
block 4004 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). At block 4302, the device determines an end of the
                                                  68

    WO 2015/183756                                                                  PCT/US2015/032309
movement and an orientation of the electronic device at the end of the movement. For example,
determining an end of movement includes determining that, after moving above a predefined
threshold speed (e.g., 0.75 ft s-', 1 ft s-', 1.5 ft s-', 2 ft s-1), the device has moved above a
threshold amount (e.g., a noise filter value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art in
view of the exact accelerometer used) for no more than a time period (e.g., .5s, .75 s, 1 s, 1.25 s,
1.5 s). For example, determining an orientation of the device includes determining whether the
device is in a predetermined orientation (e.g., face-down or face-up, microphone down, or
microphone up). In some embodiments, the movement criteria is met when the electronic device
is not in a predetermined orientation (e.g., face-down) at the end of the end of the movement.
[00326]       Advantageously, this feature has the effect of reducing instances of erroneous audio
operations. Because some device orientations are improbably associated with an audio
operation, preventing audio operations when the device is in those orientations reduces the
instances of erroneous audio operations. The increased efficiency of the user interface and the
reduced occurrence and duration of erroneous audio operations both reduce energy usage by the
device, which is particularly important for battery powered devices where reduced energy usage
increases battery life.
[00327]       In some embodiments, the electronic device includes a speaker (e.g., speaker 111,
FIG. 2) positioned on a surface of the device and, in the predetermined orientation, the surface
faces down (e.g., relative to gravity). In some embodiments, the electronic device includes a
speaker and, in the predetermined orientation, the microphone is positioned above the earpiece
(e.g., relative to gravity). If the device orientation at the end of the movement does not meet the
movement criteria, block 4302 (and thus block 4004) provides an outcome of "no" and
processing proceeds to block 4008 (FIG. 40), where the device forgoes the opportunity to initiate
an audio operation such as recording a new audio message. If the device orientation at the end of
the movement meets the movement criteria, block 4302 provides an outcome of "yes" and, if
other requirements within block 4004 are also met, then processing proceeds to block 4006,
where the device may initiate an audio operation such as recording a new message.
[00328]       Turning to FIG. 43B, in some embodiments, optional process 4304 is performed at
block 4004 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). At block 4304, the devices determines whether a
proximity sensor reading indicates detection of an object in proximity to the electronic device
within a predetermined time interval after movement satisfying the movement criteria was
detected. An object in proximity is optionally within, e.g. 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 1, 2, or 5 inches, or
another reasonable threshold, of the device. The predetermined time interval includes, for
example, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, or 1.5 seconds. If the proximity sensor reading was detected outside
the time interval, block 4304 (and thus block 4004) provides an outcome of "no" and processing
                                                      69

    WO 2015/183756                                                         PCT/US2015/032309
proceeds to block 4008 (FIG. 40), where the device forgoes the opportunity to initiate an audio
operation such as recording a new audio message. If the proximity sensor reading was detected
within the time interval, block 4304 provides an outcome of "yes" and, if other requirements
within block 4004 are also met, then processing proceeds to block 4006, where the device may
initiate an audio operation such as recording a new message.
[00329]      Turning to FIG. 43C, in some embodiments, optional process 4306 is performed at
block 4004 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). At block 4306, the device determines whether the
electronic device is in the predetermined orientation within a predetermined time interval (e.g., 3
seconds) of the determination that the movement satisfies the movement criteria and the one or
more proximity sensor readings satisfy the proximity criteria. If the device is in the
predetermined orientation with the predetermined time interval, the device does not meet the
audio operation criteria, in which case block 4306 (and thus block 4004) provides an outcome of
"no" and processing proceeds to block 4008 (FIG. 40), where the device foregoes the
opportunity to initiate an operation such as recording a new audio message. If the device is not
in the predetermined orientation within the time interval, block 4304 provides an outcome of
"yes" and, if other requirements within block 4004 are also met, then processing proceeds to
block 4006, where the device may initiate an audio operation such as recording a new message.
[00330]      FIGS. 44A-45C are flow diagrams illustrating optional sub-processes within block
4006 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). In some embodiments, block 4006 includes optional processes
4402-4406 depicted in FIG. 44A. At block 4402 (FIG. 44A), after initiating the audio operation,
the device determines whether the electronic device is in a predetermined orientation. If yes,
processing proceeds to block 4404, where the device ends the audio operation, in accordance
with a determination that the electronic device is in the predetermined orientation. Ending the
audio operation optionally includes ceasing to playback audio and/or ceasing to record audio;
optionally, deleting any already recorded audio; optionally, storing the already recorded audio
and prompting a user to deliver the recorded audio. If no, processing proceeds to block 4406, the
device forgoes ending the audio operation, in accordance with a determination that the electronic
device is not in the predetermined orientation.
[00331]      In some embodiments, the electronic device includes a speaker (e.g., speaker 111 of
device 100) positioned on a surface of the device and, in the predetermined orientation, the
surface faces down (e.g., relative to gravity). In some embodiments, the electronic device
includes an earpiece and, in the predetermined orientation, the microphone is positioned above
the earpiece (e.g., relative to gravity).
[00332]      Turning to FIG. 44B, in some embodiments, optional processes 4408-4410 are
performed at block 4006 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). At block 4408, after initiating the audio
                                                  70

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
operation, the device detects a characteristic movement of the electronic device is above a
predetermined threshold. The characteristic movement may be based on accelerometer output
over time (average), peak output, output duration, or repetition. An exemplary characteristic
movement that is an improbable audio messaging scenario is the wiping phone on sleeve. At
block 4410, in response to detecting a characteristic movement of the electronic device is above
a predetermined threshold, the device ends the audio operation. Ending the audio operation
optionally includes ceasing to playback audio and/or ceasing to record audio; optionally, deleting
any already recorded audio; optionally, storing the already recorded audio and prompting a user
to deliver the recorded audio.
[00333]     These features, which are directed to the ability to end an audio operation after it has
begun, have the advantageous effect of reducing impacts to the user experience due to erroneous
audio operations. It is beneficial to initiate audio operations quickly, to thereby improve
responsiveness and enhance the user's experience. In such situations, many things may look like
a user intended to initiate an audio operation. For example, raising a phone and putting it in a
pocket may trigger movement criteria and proximity sensor criteria. The characteristic
movements and predetermined orientations above are improbably associated with an audio.
Ending the audio operation when those movements and/or orientations are detected
advantageously reduce the number of erroneous audio operations, while not affecting the user's
perception of the device's responsiveness. The increased efficiency of the user interface and the
reduced occurrence and duration of erroneous audio operations both reduce energy usage by the
device, which is particularly important for battery powered devices where reduced energy usage
increases battery life.
[00334]     Turning to FIG. 44C, in some embodiments, block 4006 of process 4000 (FIG. 40)
includes optional processes 4412-4416. Recall, as discussed above, the device may initiate
recording of a new message as a result of upstream processing. At block 4412, the device
determines whether the message includes speech. To detect speech, the device optionally
compares a detected signal to known characteristics of speech waveforms: if recorded data
includes known characteristic(s) of speech waveforms, the device determines the message
includes speech; if no such characteristic(s) in the data, the device determines the message does
not include speech. At block 4414, the device ends recording of the message in accordance with
a determination that the message does not include speech. Ending the audio operation optionally
includes ceasing to playback audio and/or ceasing to record audio; optionally, deleting any
already recorded audio; optionally, storing the already recorded audio and prompting a user to
deliver the recorded audio. At block 4416, the device forgoes ending recording of the message,
in accordance with a determination that the message does include speech.

    WO 2015/183756                                                         PCT/US2015/032309
[00335]     Turning to FIG. 45A, in some embodiments, optional processes 4502-4504 are
performed at block 4006 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). After playing a voicemail message, the
device, at block 4502, detects a pump motion of the electronic device. The pump motion
optionally includes a downward motion, followed by an upward motion (e.g., a motion that
meets the audio-operation criteria). An exemplary pump motion is illustrated in FIGS. 22A-22C.
At block 4504, the device initiates, in response to detecting the pump motion, a phone call to a
phone number associated with the voicemail message (e.g., the device makes a return phone
call).
[00336]     Turning to FIG. 45B, in some embodiments, optional processes 4506-4510 are
performed at block 4006 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). At block 4506, the device determines that
audio play-back criteria have been met. At block 4508, the devices plays, in accordance with a
determination that audio-playback criteria have been met, audio corresponding to a received
communication. In some embodiments, the audio-playback criteria include a criterion that is met
when the communication includes audio component that has not been previously played on the
device. In some embodiments, the audio-playback criteria include a criterion that is met when
the communication was received within a predetermined time period from when the change in
device context was detected. In some embodiments, the audio-playback criteria include a
criterion that is met when the communication corresponds to a communication alert that was
displayed on the display of the device when the change in device context was detected (e.g., a
pop-up notification on a user interface lock screen, a pop-up notification overlaid on another user
interface displayed on the display, or message in a conversation). At block 4508, the devices
forgoes playback, in accordance with a determination that audio-playback criteria has not been
met.
[00337]     Turning to FIG. 45C, in some embodiments, optional processes 4512-4516 are
performed at block 4006 of process 4000 (FIG. 40). At block 4512, the device determines that
audio recording criteria have been met. At block 4514, the device records, in accordance with
determination that audio-recording criteria have been met, audio for a response to the received
communication. In some embodiments, the audio-record criteria include a criterion that is met
when a user interface for a communication application is displayed on the display (e.g., a phone
dialer application, a conversation of a multi-media messaging application in which at least one
audio message has been sent or received). In some embodiments, the audio-record criteria
include a criterion that is met when an audio component of a message was played within a
predetermined time period of when the change in device context was detected. At block 4516,
the device forgoes recording, in accordance with a determination that audio-recording criteria
has not been met.

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
[00338]       Note that details of the processes described above with respect to process 4000 (e.g.,
FIGS. 40-45, 21, and 22) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the processes described
herein. For example, processes 3300, 3400, 3500, 3600, 3700, 3800, 3900, 4600, and 4900 may
include one or more of the characteristics of the various processes described above with
reference to process 4000. For brevity, these details are not repeated in the descriptions of the
other processes. The various methods and techniques described above with reference to process
(method) 4000 may be optionally implemented as one or more units, such as those described
with regard to FIG. 57.
[00339]       FIG. 46 is a flow diagram illustrating process 4600 for sending a message. Process
4600 is performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 100) with a display (e.g., display 112 of
device 100) and at least one microphone (e.g., microphone 113 of device 100), in some
embodiments. At block 4602, the device detects one or more conditions that are interpreted as a
request to record an audio message for a designated contact. A designated contact optionally
includes a person in Contacts, e-mail, and a phone number associated with a received message or
voicemail. However, an application that is responsive to voice input, without more, should not
be considered a "contact." A designated contact is a contact that is identified (e.g., designated)
by a user or by device 100. At block 4604, the devices generates an audio recording using the at
least one microphone, in response to detecting the one or more conditions. At block 4606, the
device determines whether the audio recording meets rejection criteria. At block 4608, the
device sends the audio recording to the designated contact, in accordance with a determination
that the rejection criteria is not satisfied. At block 4610, the device forgoes sending the audio
recording to the designated contact, in accordance with a determination that the rejection criteria
is satisfied.
[00340]       Advantageously, process 4600 can reduce sending of erroneous messages. By
monitoring an in-progress audio recording for rejection criteria, the device beneficially
determines that a user has inadvertently activated an audio recording or changed his or her mind
during the recording. This has the effect of improving customer satisfaction with a messaging
system. The increased efficiency of the user interface and the reduced occurrence and duration
of erroneous audio operations both reduce energy usage by the device, which is particularly
important for battery powered devices where reduced energy usage increases battery life.
[00341]       The one or more conditions in block 4602 optionally include a change in device
context or a user input such as a raising gesture described in greater detail above with reference
to process 4000 (FIG. 40), or other input while in a messaging context such as having a
multimedia messaging application displayed on the display.

    WO 2015/183756                                                            PCT/US2015/032309
[00342]      In some embodiments, the rejection criteria in block 4606 is met when the duration of
the audio recording exceeds a predetermined duration of time (e.g., 15 seconds). This feature
advantageously prevents sending audio recordings when the user is distracted.
[00343]      FIGS. 47A-47D are flow diagrams illustrating optional sub-processes within block
4606 of process 4600 (FIG. 46). Turning to FIG. 47A, in some embodiments, optional process
4702 is performed at block 4606 of process 4600 (FIG. 46). At block 4702, the device detects
whether speech is present in the audio recording. The rejection criteria is met when the audio
recording is determined not to include more than a threshold amount. A threshold amount is
optionally an absolute amount or a relative amount such as percentage. In some embodiments,
the threshold amount is an energy threshold, such as short-time energy and zero-crossing rate. In
some embodiments, the threshold amount is based on a speech model. In some embodiments,
the rejection criteria is met when no sound (above a noise filter threshold) is detected.
[00344]      Attention is now directed to rejection criteria based on a position of the device. In
some embodiments, the rejection criteria is met when the electronic device is within a distance
threshold from a sound source. Optionally, the device determines whether the electronic device
is within the distance threshold by determining whether a proximity sensor (e.g., proximity
sensor 166 of device 100) of the device has detected an object within the distance threshold of
the device.
[00345]      Turning to FIG. 47B, in some embodiments, optional process 4704 is performed at
block 4606 of process 4600 (FIG. 46). At block 4704, the device determines whether the
electronic device is within a distance threshold of a sound source by analyzing a waveform
produced by combining signals captured by a first microphone and a second microphone (for
example, evaluating, via beamforming, base attenuation in the formed beam, where the
evaluation is optionally based on equalization of a near field beam). If the device is not within
the distance threshold, block 4704 (and thus block 4606) produces an output of "no," processing
proceeds to block 4610 where the device ends the recording that is in progress. If the device is
within the distance threshold, block 4704 provides an outcome of "yes" and, if other
requirements within block 4604 are also met, then processing proceeds to block 4608, where the
device optionally continues to record and send the recorded message.
[00346]      Turning to FIG. 47C, in some embodiments, optional process 4706 is performed at
block 4606 of process 4600 (FIG. 46). At block 4706, the device determines whether the
electronic device is within the distance threshold by determining whether a sound pressure level
at the at least one microphone exceeds a sound pressure level threshold. In some embodiments,
the sound pressure level threshold is based on a function (e.g., average over time, reference
levels for whispering, speaking loudly, speaking softly, normal tone, etc.) of sound pressure
                                                  74

    WO 2015/183756                                                            PCT/US2015/032309
levels previously detected by the electronic device. If the device is not within the distance
threshold, block 4706 (and thus block 4606) produces an output of "no", processing proceeds to
block 4610 where the device ends the recording that is in progress. If the device is within the
distance threshold, block 4704 provides an outcome of "yes" and, if other requirements within
block 4604 are also met, then processing proceeds to block 4608, where the device may continue
to record and send the recorded message.
[00347]       Turning to FIG. 47D, in some embodiments, optional process 4708 is performed at
block 4606 of process (FIG. 46). At block 4708, the device determines whether the electronic
device is within the distance threshold by comparing (e.g., calculating a ratio of direct speech
energy to reverberation energy, and comparing the ratio to a threshold) a sound pressure level to
a reverberation level detected by the at least one microphones. If the ratio is indicative of far
field acoustics, processing proceeds to block 4610 where the device ends the recording that is in
progress. If the ratio is indicative of near-field acoustics, and if other requirements within block
4604 are also met, then processing proceeds to block 4608, where the device may continue to
record and send the recorded message.
[00348]       Although the description herein is offered primarily with respect to an audio
operation, it should be appreciated that the systems and methods described can be extended to
other operations. For example, determining the position of a phone can be utilized in other
applications and can be presented as platform service to provide information on whether the
phone is near a user or far away from a user. Such information can be used, for example, to set a
volume of a ringtone.
[00349]       In some embodiments, the rejection criteria is based on an orientation of the
electronic device. In some embodiments, the electronic device includes a speaker (e.g., speaker
111 of device 100) positioned on a surface of the device and the rejection criteria is met when
the surface faces down (e.g., relative to gravity). In some embodiments, the electronic device
includes an earpiece and the rejection criteria is met when the microphone is positioned above
the earpiece (e.g., relative to gravity).
[00350]       In some embodiments, the rejection criteria is met when a characteristic movement of
the electronic device exceeds a threshold. The characteristic movement optionally includes a
gyroscope and/or accelerometer output over time (average), peak movement, duration of
movement, or repetition in movement (such as wiping phone on sleeve).
[00351]       In some embodiments, determining whether the audio recording meets rejection
criteria is in response to detecting one or more conditions that are interpreted as a request to send
the audio recording to the designated contact. In some embodiments, the determination is
performed after recording the audio (e.g., after a brief segment of audio has been recorded). In
                                                   75

    WO 2015/183756                                                           PCT/US2015/032309
some embodiments, the determination is performed while recording the audio (e.g., so as to
terminate recording of a long audio segment when the user does not intend to be recording
audio).
[00352]      FIG. 48A-48B are flow diagrams illustrating optional sub-processes within block
4610 of process 4600 (FIG. 46) in some embodiments. Turning to FIG. 48A, optional process
4802 may be performed at block 4610 of process 4600 (FIG. 46). At block 4802, when the audio
recording satisfies the rejection criteria, the device concurrently displays a representation of a
draft message that includes the audio recording and a send affordance. (This aspect is illustrated
on device 100 in FGI. 22D). Upon detecting a user selection of the send affordance, the device
sends the draft message to the designated contact.
[00353]      Turning to FIG. 48B, in some embodiments, optional processes 4804-4808 are
performed at block 4610 of process 4600 (FIG. 46). At block 4804 (FIG. 48B), when the audio
recording satisfies the rejection criteria, the device determines whether an elapsed time between
detecting the one or more conditions (e.g. receiving the user input or starting to record the audio)
and determining that the audio recording satisfies rejection criteria exceeds a time threshold. At
block 4806, the device, in accordance with a determination that the elapsed time exceeds the
time threshold, displays a representation of a draft message that includes the audio recording (for
example, the user interface of device 100 in FIG. 22D). At block 4808, the device deletes, in
accordance with a determination that the elapsed time does not exceed the time threshold, the
audio recording without displaying the representation of the draft message. For example, if the
recording of the audio message is determined to be an error shortly after starting to record the
audio or shortly after finishing recording the audio, then the audio message is deleted and the
user is not bothered with displaying a draft audio message. In this instance, there is a high
likelihood that the recording was initiated in error and this embodiment eliminates the need to
bother a user with a likely unintended recording. However, if the recording of the audio message
is determined to be an error more than the threshold time after recording the audio or after
starting to record the audio, the audio message is saved as a draft that is available for sending by
the user, so as to avoid confusing or frustrating the user.
[00354]      Note that details of the processes described above with respect to process 4600 (e.g.,
FIGS. 46-48, 21, and 22) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the processes described
herein. For example, processes 3300, 3400, 3500, 3600, 3700, 3800, 3900, 4000, and 4900 may
include one or more of the characteristics of the various processes described above with

[00355]      FIG. 49 is a flow diagram illustrating process 4900 for capturing and sending media.
Process 4900 may be performed at an electronic device with a display and a touch-sensitive
surface, like device 100 (FIG. 2). At block 4902, the device displays, on the display, a media
affordance, a message compose field, and a message conversation between participants, where
the conversation is displayed in a message region. At block 4904, the device detects a contact at
a location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the location, on the display, of the
media affordance. At block 4906, in response to detecting the contact, the device displays a live
media preview in the message compose field. At block 4908, the device detects a lift-off of the
contact. At block 4910, in response to detecting the lift-off, the device captures a new image
based on the live media preview, and sends the captured image to a participant in the message
conversation. Optionally, the captured image is sent to the participant in response to detecting
the lift-off. Optionally, the device displays a send button for sending the message. The captured
media is sent to the participant in response to detecting a contact at a location corresponding to
the send button. Optionally, in response to detecting the lift-off, a representation of the captured
image is displayed in the message compose field. The device detects user entry of additional
content in the message compose field. The additional content and the captured image are sent to
the participant in response to detecting the contact. Optionally, a thumbnail of the captured
image and the additional content are displayed in a bounded message area that is inserted into the
displayed message conversation.
[00356]      Note that details of the processes described above with respect to process 4900 (e.g.,
FIGS. 49 and 11C-G) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the processes described
herein. For example, processes 3300, 3400, 3500, 3600, 3700, 3800, 3900, 4000, and 4600 may
include one or more of the characteristics of the various processes described above with
reference to process 4900. For brevity, these details are not repeated in the descriptions of the
other processes. The various methods and techniques described above with reference to process
(method) 4900 may be optionally implemented as one or more units, such as those described
with regard to FIG. 59.

[00406]     The operations described above with reference to FIG. 35 are optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGS. 1A-1B, 3, 5B, or FIG. 52. For example,
detecting operations 3504, 3508 are, optionally, implemented by accelerometer 168, event sorter
170, event recognizer 180, and/or event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170
detects a request, such as request represented by a contact or raising of the device, and event
dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1. A respective event
recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to respective event
definitions 186, and determines whether the request corresponds to a predefined event or sub
event, such as a request to play an audio message. When a respective predefined event or sub
event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the
detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or
object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event
handler 190 accesses audio circuitry 110 to play an audio message. Similarly, it would be clear

message, and enabling changing of a color (e.g., using display enabling unit 5308) of at least a
portion of the waveform during playback to indicate the portion of the audio message that has
been played.
[00417]      In some embodiments, processing unit 5306 is further configured to: enable changing
of the color of the portion of the waveform as a corresponding portion of the audio message is

using detecting unit 5310) a selection of the grouped bounded message area; and in response to
detecting the selection of the grouped bounded message area, enable replacement of the display
(e.g., using display enabling unit 5308), on display unit 5302, of the single grouped bounded
message area with display of a plurality of representations of the plurality of messages.
[00422]      In some embodiments, the grouped bounded message area includes text representing
a first message of the plurality of messages and an image thumbnail representing a second
message of the plurality of messages, and processing unit 5306 is further configured to: detect

[00509]      In some embodiments, the sound pressure level threshold is based on a function of
sound pressure levels previously detected by the electronic device.
[00510]      In some embodiments, processing unit 5804 is further configured to: determine (e.g.,
using determining unit 5810) whether electronic device 5800 is within the distance threshold by
comparing (e.g., using comparing unit 5816) a sound pressure level to a reverberation level
detected by the at least one microphones.
[00511]      In some embodiments, the rejection criteria is based on an orientation of electronic
device 5800.
[00512]      In some embodiments, the electronic device 5800 comprises a speaker (e.g., an
earpiece), and the speaker is positioned on a surface of the device, and the rejection criteria is
met when the surface faces down.
[00513]      In some embodiments, the electronic device 5800 comprises a speaker (e.g., an ear
piece), and the rejection criteria is met when the orientation of the electronic device places the
microphone above the speaker.
[00514]      In some embodiments, the rejection criteria is met when a characteristic movement
of the electronic device exceeds a threshold.
[00515]      In some embodiments, the electronic device comprises display unit 5802, and
processing unit 5804 is further configured to, when the audio recording satisfies the rejection
criteria, concurrently enable display (e.g., using display enabling unit 5806), on the display unit
5802, of: a representation of a draft message that includes the audio recording; and a send
affordance, wherein the send affordance, when selected by a user, causes the device to send the
draft message to the designated contact.
[00516]      In some embodiments, processing unit 5804 is further configured to, when the audio
recording satisfies the rejection criteria: determine (e.g., using determining unit 5810) whether an
elapsed time between detecting the one or more conditions and determining that the audio
recording satisfies rejection criteria exceeds a time threshold; in accordance with a determination
that the elapsed time exceeds the time threshold, enable display (e.g., using display enabling unit
5806), on display unit 5802, of a representation of a draft message that includes the audio
recording; and in accordance with a determination that the elapsed time does not exceed the
time threshold, delete (e.g., using deleting unit 5818) the audio recording without enabling
display of the representation of the draft message.
[00517]      The operations described above with reference to FIGS. 46-48B are optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGS. 1A-1B, 3, 5B, or FIG. 58. For example,
detecting operation 4602, display enabling operation 4802, generating operation 4604,
determining operation 4606, and/or sending operation 4608 are, optionally, implemented by

event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, event handler 190, accelerometer 168, proximity sensor
166, and peripherals interface 118. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on
touch-sensitive display 112 and/or a change in device context (e.g., using proximity sensor 166
and/or accelerometer 168), and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event
information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether the contact on the touch
sensitive surface or change in device context correspond to a predefined event or sub event, such
as a request to record an audio message. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is
detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the
event or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177
to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a
respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application, or accesses audio
circuitry 110 and microphone 113 to generate an audio recording. In some embodiments, event
handler 190 accesses peripherals interface 118 to send a recording to a designated contact.
Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can
be implemented based on the components depicted in FIGS. 1A-1B, 3, 5B, or FIGS. 46-48B.
[00518]      As shown in FIG. 59, an electronic device 5900 includes a display unit 5902
configured to display user interfaces; a touch-sensitive surface unit 5904 configured to receive
contacts; and a processing unit 5906 coupled to display unit 5902 and touch-sensitive surface
unit 5904. In some embodiments, processing unit 5906 includes a display enabling unit 5908, a
detecting unit 5910, a determining unit 5912, a sending unit 5914, and a media capture unit
5916.
[00519]      The processing unit 5906 is configured to: enable display (e.g., using display enabling
unit 5908), on display unit 5902, of a media affordance, a message compose field, and a message
conversation between participants, wherein the conversation is displayed in a message region on
the display unit 5902; detect (e.g., using detecting unit 5910) a contact at a location on the touch
sensitive surface unit 5904 that corresponds to a location of the media affordance on the display
unit 5902; in response to detecting the contact, enable display (e.g., using the display enabling
unit 5908), on the display unit 5902, of a media preview in the message compose field; detect
(e.g., using detecting unit 5910) a lift-off of the contact from the touch-sensitive surface unit
5904; in response to detecting the lift-off, capture (e.g., using media capture unit 5916) a new
image based on the media preview; and send (e.g., using sending unit 5914) the captured image
to a participant in the message conversation.
[00520]      In some embodiments, the captured image is sent to the participant in response to
detecting the lift-off.

[00521]      In some embodiments, processing unit 5906 is further configured to: enable display
(e.g., using display enabling unit 5908), on display unit 5902, of a send button for sending a
message to the participant in the message conversation; after detecting the lift-off and capturing
the media, detect (e.g., using detecting unit 5910) a second contact at a location on touch
sensitive surface unit 5904 that corresponds to a location of the send button on display unit 5902,
and the captured image is sent to the participant in response to detecting the second contact.
[00522]      In some embodiments, processing unit 5906 is further configured to: further in
response to detecting the lift-off, enable display (e.g., using display enabling unit 5908), on the
display unit 5902, of a representation of the captured image in the message compose field.
[00523]      In some embodiments, processing unit 5906 is further configured to: while displaying
the representation of the captured image in the message compose field, detect (e.g., using
detecting unit 5910) user entry of additional content in the message compose field, and the
additional content and the captured image are sent to the participant in response to detecting the
second contact.
[00524]      In some embodiments, enabling display of the media preview in the message
compose field comprises enabling expansion (e.g., using the display enabling unit 5908), on the
display unit 5902, of the message compose field.
[00525]      The operations described above with reference to FIG. 49 are optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGS. 1A-1B, 3, 5B, or FIG. 59. For example, display
enabling operation 4902, detecting operation 4904, and/or capturing operation 4910 are,
optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, event handler 190, and
peripherals interface 118. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch
sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event
information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a contact at a location
on the touch-sensitive display corresponds to a predefined event or sub event, such as activation
of an affordance on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is
detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the
event or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177
to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a
respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. In some
embodiments, event handler 190 accesses peripherals interface to capture an image. Similarly, it
would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be
implemented based on the components depicted in FIGS. 1A-1B, 3, 5B, or FIG. 59.

[00526]     The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with
reference to specific embodiments. However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended
to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and
variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and
described in order to best explain the principles of the techniques and their practical applications.
Others skilled in the art are thereby enabled to best utilize the techniques and various
embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
[00527]     Although the disclosure and examples have been fully described with reference to the
accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will become
apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as
being included within the scope of the disclosure and examples as defined by the claims.
[00528]     As described above, one aspect of the present technology is the gathering and use of
data available from various sources to share location information with other participants in a
message conversation. The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, this gathered
data may include personal information data that uniquely identifies or can be used to contact or
locate a specific person. Such personal information data can include demographic data, location
based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, home addresses, or any other identifying
information.
[00529]     The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information data, in
the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. For example, the personal
information data can be used to enable participants to determine each others' location and
estimated arrival time. Further, other uses for personal information data that benefit the user are
also contemplated by the present disclosure.
[00530]     The present disclosure further contemplates that the entities responsible for the
collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal information data
will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy practices. In particular, such
entities should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally
recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining
personal information data private and secure. For example, personal information from users
should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside
of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection should occur only after receiving the informed
consent of the users. Additionally, such entities would take any needed steps for safeguarding
and securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to the
personal information data adhere to their privacy policies and procedures. Further, such entities
                                                  104

    WO 2015/183756                                                          PCT/US2015/032309
can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted
privacy policies and practices.
[00531]     Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in
which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is, the
present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided to
prevent or block access to such personal information data. For example, in the case of location
sharing features, the present technology can be configured to allow users to select not to provide
location information to message conversation participants. In yet another example, users can
select to not provide precise location information, but permit sharing of location zone
information.
[00532]     Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal information
data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present disclosure also
contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the need for
accessing such personal information data. That is, the various embodiments of the present
technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such personal
information data. For example, estimated time of arrival content can be determined using a bare
minimum amount of personal information, such as location zone information, or publicly
available information.
