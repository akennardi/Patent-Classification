CONVERTIBLE ZERO-CLEARANCE CIRCULAR SAW
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]    This is a divisional application of AU 2011291595, the contents of which are
incorporated by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]    The present invention relates to portable circular saws for zero-clearance or flush
cutting, such as undercut saws.
BACKGROUND
[0003]    Conventional portable circular saws are not capable of safely making flush cuts- i.e.
zero clearance- against a planar surface. Conventional tools mount the saw blade using
attachments which project outward beyond the outside blade face, and the blade guard extends
at least partially over both blade faces, and no "bearing surface, or "deck", is provided to support
the saw against a first plane and the saw blade flush against a second plane. Conventional tools
also use a fixed forward blade guard which is not adjustable, preventing the operator from
inserting the saw by a front entry which provides superior visibility and control from "bucking",
and prevents a smooth continuous transition through different cutting directions - e.g. cutting
along a floor edge and then continuously upward along a door frame or wall corner.
Additionally, conventional designs do not provide effective one-handed control of the movable
blade guard, so operators are either required to use one hand to operate the trigger and their
other hand to operate the blade guard-placing the operator's other hand close to the moving
blade

or they bypass the safety feature by jamming something into the guard to hold it back
also quite dangerous (but unfortunately very common).
        [0004] None of the conventional tool designs provides the ability to perform all of
these functions in a safe and effective manner, nor are they able to convert between
conventional circular saw and a flush cutting device.        Conventional single-purpose tools
have other disadvantages. Generally, they are unable to make deep cuts - e.g. through a
double-deck comprising two or more layers of two-inch thick stacked boards - and provide
limited angular adjustment to make beveled cuts.
        [0005] A number of devices have provided an ability to perform undercutting. For
example, Crain.     1oolsM produces a conventional "undercut saw", the model 820, capable
of horizontal use to undercut along base boards and door jams. However, it is not useful
for cutting vertical surfaces, lacking a deck, adjustable front guard and bevel adjustment,
and is not suitable for 360* contour cutting.       Additionally, jam saws lack controllable
blade guards. Nor are conventional circular saws capable of conversion to a flush cutting
tool. Conventional designs are (safely) capable merely of single purpose uses.
        [0006] U.S. Patent No. 5,481,806, to Pratt, is for a tongue attachment to a lower blade
guard of a portable electric circular saw. During a cutting operation, that tongue attachment is
intended to prevent binding or snagging of the leading edge of the lower blade guard on the
nearest edge of a cut, bifurcated work. The saw disclosed therein is no more capable of
making a zero clearance cut than any other portable electric circular saw.
        [0007] U.S. Patent No. 6,021,826 discloses a powered, chain saw cutting system for
cutting mortises in a work for making mortise-and-tenon joints. Zero clearance cuts can be
made with the system only in a manner that the nose end of system's saw bar and its
entrained cutting chain is used to cut into a work peice in order to create a mortise therein.
                                              2

The apparatus lacks a blade deck bearing surface and adjustable base deck for use on
vertical and horizontal through-cuts and the retractable flush blade shield.
         [00081 U.S. Patent No. 6,606,930 B2 discloses a saw cutting guide for a portable,
electric, circular power saw that is intended as an aid in cutting the of the excess ends of roof
shingles and the like. The disclosed saw cutting guide does nothing to permit a portable,
circular power saw to achieve a zero clearance cut, and nothing in the disclosure would assist
a person of ordinary skill to arrive at Applicant's invention. U.S. Patent Pub. 2004/0035274 A
is similar.
         [00091 U.S. Patent No. 4,245,390 discloses a scoring attachment for a portable,
electric, circular saw. The attachment attaches to a front end portion of a such portable saw
and imposes a score upon a surface of a wood article aligned with the rotating, circular saw
blade in order to reduce or eliminate splintering of the wood during the cutting operation. The
reference does not teach solutions to the need for a zero clearance saw.
         [00101 U.S. Patent No. 6,568,088 B I discloses a wheel attachment for portable power
cutting tools. The attachment mounts a pair of laterally spaced-apart roller wheels at a front
end of portable, electric, circular power saw to reduce friction of movement of the saw over a
work peice during a cutting operation. The wheels are placed all on the same side of the
blade, but this is to enhance stability of the saw, not for achieving a zero clearance cut.
         [00111 U.S. Patent Pub. No. US 2007/0137446 A I discloses a guide for a hand-held
power tool, which can include a portable, electric, circular power saw. The guide is intended
for making cross-cuts on a work. No modifications to a circular power are made or even
suggested for achieving a zero clearance cut.
         [0012] U.S. PatentNo. 5,121,545 discloses an improved base tilting mechanism for a
portable, electric circular saw, which is said to improve stability of handling of the saw as well
                                                3

as more accurate cutting. No modifications to a circular power are made or even suggested
for achieving a zero clearance cut.
        [0013] U.S. 7,043,845 B2 discloses a trim attachment for a portable, electric circular
saw that provides a fence for cutting accurate trims of a desired thickness and substantial
length from common elongated wood stock. The reference teaches only a conventional
circular saw with an attachement, but does not disclose a saw capable of flush cutting.
        [0014] Thus, there is a need circular saw that: (1) is portable; (2) provides zero
clearance cutting capability; (3) provides continuous 360 cutting capability; (4) provides
one-handed trigger and guard control using either hand; (5) i.s adjustable for beve].
cutting; (6) provides near-instantaneous stopping of the blade; (7) can safely make deep
cuts through multiple layers of lumber; (8) provide ability to convert between
conventional circular saw arrangement and a zero clearance circular saw arrangement.
                              SUMMARY AND ADVANTAGES
        [0015] A convertible zero clearance circular saw includes a motor frame portion
having a motor coupled to a drive shaft; a handle portion coupled to the aft end of the
motor frame portion, the handle portion including a hand grip,       motor actuator on the
hand grip, and one or two lower blade shield triggers proximate the hand grip to be
operable by an operator's thumb; a blade deck planar bearing surface and circular cutting
blade mounted to be flush with the blade deck planar bearing surface; a lower blade
shield movable between a deployed position and a retracted position, disposed between
the blade and motor frame portion, the blade shield including an arcuate sidewall
partially circumscribing the blade cutting edge and having an edge face coplanar with the
blade deck planar bearing surface; a base deck pivotable about a transverse axis and a
longitudinal axis; and a front deck portion coupled to the front end of the base deck to
                                            4

move between a flat deployed position and a perpendicular position. The handle may be
rotatingly coupled to the motor frame portion to lock at least at 0 degrees and 90 degrees.
The saw may include a removable dust cover, articulated to adapted to the saw
movements.     The saw may include an offset blade or a flat blade with countersunk and
beveled connections. The blade shield triggers may be operable independently from each
other.    The lower blade shield may be operably coupled to the blade shield triggers
through a double pulley of dissimilar diameter sheaves.          The saw may include an
electromagnetic brake for near instantaneous stopping of the blade.           The saw may
convert to mount a standard flat blade as well,
        [0016] The convertible zero clearance circular saw of the present invention
presents numerous advantages, including: (1) 360 degree flush cutting against a planar
surface; (2) usable as a vertical cutter or a undercut saw; (3) a remotely operated blade
shield so that operators do not place their fingers near the moving blade; (4) provides
greater bevel and pitchdepth adjustment than standard. saws; (5) may be used as a
standard circular saw or a plunge cut saw; (6) provides instantaneous braking of the
blade for safety; (7)    provides easy access to motor internals for maintenance; (8)
independently operable blade shield triggers do not interfere with the operator's hand
grip; (9) provides for ambidextrous operation; (10) allows for use of a dust cover; (11) may
include a pulley-operated blade shield system which reduces wear and likelihood of
binding.
        [0017] Additional advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the
description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be
learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention may be realized and
attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        [0020] Before beginning a detailed description of the subject invention, mention of
the following is in order. When appropriate, like reference materials and characters are
used to designate identical, corresponding, or similar components in differing figure
drawings. The figure drawings associated with this disclosure typically are not drawn
with dimensional accuracy to scale, i.e., such drawings have been drafted with a focus on
clarity of viewing and understanding rather than dimensional accuracy.
        [00211 In the interest      of clarity, not all  of the routine features of the
implementations described herein are shown and described.            It will, of course, be
appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, numerous
                                             16

impiementation-specific decisions must be made in          order to achieve the developer's
specific goals, such as compliance with application- and business-related constraints, and
that these specific goals will vary from one implementation to another and from one
developer to another.     Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort
might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking
of engineering for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.
        [0022] Referring to Figs. 1-33, a first embodiment of a zero clearance circular saw
10 is shown,. having opposed forward and aft ends 12 and 14, respectively, which define
the longitudinal forward-aft direction, and including a motor frame portion 16, a handle
portion 18, a blade deck 20, a base deck 22, a lower blade shield 24, and a first lower
blade shield trigger 26. In this Specification, "longitudinal" refers generally to an axis or
orientation parallel to the forward-aft axis of the saw 10, and "transverse" refers
generally to an axis or orientation extending perpendicular to the longitudinal direction.
        [0023] Motor frame portion 16 includes opposed forward and aft ends 30 and 32,
respectively, a motor 34 mounted to motor frame portion 16 operably coupled to drive
shaft 36 projecting from a first lateral side 38 of the motor frame portion 16, the drive
shaft defining a first transverse axis 40. In the embodiment, motor 34 is connectable to a
power source via electrical cord 42         Alternatively, motor 34 could be powered by
batteries, fuel cells, internal combustion engine, or other power sources or combination
thereof.   Arbor 28 is coupled to drive shaft 36 and includes a first mounting face 46
adapted to mate to a second mounting face 224 of a circular saw blade 48.               In the
embodiment, arbor 28 is a separable from drive shaft 36, but may be integral to drive
shaft 36 as well. Tie rotation of rotary blade 48 mounted to saw 10 defines a blade arc
50, equating to the perimeter traced by the teeth tips 52 of blade 48. In practice, blade
                                             17

are 50 will have a range of diameters based on the size of the saw blade 48 selected. In
the embodiment motor 34 is mounted longitudinally, but could be mounted transversely
as well. In the embodiment, drive shaft 36 is coupled to motor 34 through a reduction
worm gear 54, but other configurations may be used, including by way of example, a
transverse engne mounting eliminating the worm gear, or a direct coupling to motor 34

tabs 184 and 186 overlap first and second lower blade shield triggers 26 and 154.,
respectively, such that either first or second trigger 26 or 154 will engage against its
respective tab 184 or 186 to move the center lever 202 when the respective trigger 26 or
154 is depressed. Double pulley 190 is rotatably coupled to the motor frame portion first
lateral 38 side at a fifth transverse axis 192, the double pulley 190 including a first
sheave 194 having a first diameter 196 and a second sheave 198 having a second
diameter 200, the second diameter 200 smaller than the first diameter 196. First cable
204 operatively couples center lever 202 to first sheave 194; and, second cable 108 couples
second sheave 198 to lower blade shield 24 around lower blade shield sheave 106, as

114 is coupled at a first end 116 to the motor frame portion 16 and at a second end 118 to
blade shield 24 in order to bias lower blade shield 24 to the deployed position.
        [0044] Lower blade shield triggers 26, 154 moving independently of each other
allows ambidextrous use, wherein operating one trigger will not bring the other trigger
down. in contact with the hand.       The lower blade shield 24 pulley and cable system
permits locating the operating parts virtually anywhere on the saw 10, and provides the
ability to use a rotatable handle portion 28, rather than the direct lever couplings
common in existing devices. Dual pulley sheaves 194, 198 provide large shield movement
for a small trigger movement, due to greater diameter of the inner sheave 196. Second
cable 108 a distributes out of axis force substantially around the perimeter of         lower
blade shield journal bearing portion 84, thereby reducing trans-axial stress on the shield
24 and shaft 44, which lessens the likelihood of binding.

                                           27

cutting edge 232 corresponds to the teeth 52 disposed along the perimeter.            Blade
perimeter 234 corresponds to or is coextensive to blade arc 50, as the rotation of cutting
edge 232 defines the blade arc 50.     In the embodiment, blade central mounting portion
218 is offset laterally from blade cutting portion second surface 230 and the distance from
second mounting face 224 to blade cutting portion first planar surface 228 is equal to
blade offset depth 46, such that blade cutting portion first planar surface 228 is coplanar

lower blade cover portion 246, and a front cover portion 248. Aft cover portion 244 is
removably mountable to blade deck 24 by snapping over the upper and aft portion of
blade deck 24 and covers a portion of blade 48 mounted to saw 10. Lower blade cover
portion 246 is removably mountable to the lower blade shield 24 using snap fitting 356,
with matching sidewall and edge face 358 and 360,i respectively, to mate against blade
shield edge face 98, and rotatably coupled to the aft cover portion 244, the rotatable
coupling connector 250 coaxial with the first transverse axis 40, such that lower blade
cover portion 246 moves with lower blade shield 24 between the deployed and retracted

having bevels on an opposed. cutting portion planar surface 1230 to make blade
reversible.   This arrangement allows for a reversible blade.     Generally, blade cutting
edges have unidireciona.l cutting teeth, but some blades may have bidirectional cutting
edges, for instance simple triangular teeth, or blades that have a thin grinding edge for a
cutting edge, rather than teeth. Reversible blade may be desirable to extend blade life, or
to prevent incorrect mounting (i.e. "idiot proofing").
        [0049] In the second embodiment, the saw 1010 is adapted to mount a flat blade
1048 flush for zero clearance cuts. In this regard, flat blade means the blade depth 1066
is equal to the blade thickness.    Arbor 1028 includes a plurality of fastener receiving
holes 1360; the blade central mounting portion 1218 having a having a first plurality of
mounting apertures 1362, the first plurality of mounting apertures 1362 countersunk
1364 on the mounting portion first surface 1222, the first plurality of mounting apertures
1362 corresponding to the fastener receiving holes 1360; and, a plurality of bevel head
                                            29

fasteners 1366 to engage the blade 1048 to the arbor 1028 through the first plurality of
mounting apertures 1362 and fastener receiving holes 1360, the fastener heads 1368
flush with the mounting portion second surface when fully engaged through the first
plurality of mounting apertures 1362.
        [0050] In the embodiment, the blade central mounting portion may also include a
second plurality of mounting apertures 1370, the second plurality of mounting apertures
1370 countersunk 1372 on the mounting portion second surface , the second plurality of
mounting apertures      1370 corresponding to the fastener receiving holes 1360, the
plurality of fasteners 1366 engagable through the second plurality of mounting apertures
1370 to be flush with the central mounting portion second surface, such that the blade is
reversible.
        [0051]  Using the first embodiment 10 as an example, in operation a blade 48 is
mounted onto a saw 10 by fastening a center fastener 348 through the center mounting
aperture 346 thread into drive shaft 36, thereby compressing blade second mounting face
224 against arbor first mounting face 46. Arbor 28 is rotatingly engaged to drive shaft
36, and so rotates with the drive shaft, stabilized within lower blade shield axle 44, To
make a flush cut, the operator lays the saw blade first planar surface 228 against the flat
surface to be cut to, supported by coplanar with blade deck planar bearing surface 64 and
blade shield sidewall edge face 98, actuates the motor using actuator 60., retracts the
lower blade shield 24 by compressing first or second shield trigger 26 or 254, and drives
the rotating saw blade 48 into the material.      If the operator first locks forward deck
portion 322 into the second position, then the operator may continue the cut through
360 .    For example, the operator may cut continuously along a floor-wall interface,
continuing up the far wall, along the ceiling, and back down the near wall.
                                            30

        [0052] Alternatively, the operator may rotate handle portion 18 by 90' to lay the
blade 48 and planar bearing surface 64 horizontal for use as an undercut or "jam" saw.

       a.  a biasing spring coupled between the motor frame portion and the lower
           blade shield to bias the lower blade shield toward the deployed position,
30. A circular saw blade removably mountable to a zero clearance circular saw having
    a motor coupled to a drive shaft, a blade deck including a planar bearing surface,
    and a first mounting face coupled to a drive shaft, the distance from the first
    mounting face to the blade deck bearing surface defining a blade offset depth., the
    saw blade comprising:
       a.  a central mounting portion having opposed first and second surfaces
           wherein the central mounting portion second surface comprises a second
           mounting face adapted to mate to the first mounting face;
       b. a cutting portion having        opposed   first and second      planar  surfaces
           extending from the central. mounting portion to a cutting edge disposed.
           along the blade perimeter, the rotation of the cutting edge defining the
           blade arc;
       c.  wherein, the blade central mounting portion is offset laterally from the
           blade cutting portion second surface and the distance from the second
                                        40

mounting face to the blade cutting portion first planar surface is equal to
the blade offset depth,. such that the blade cutting portion first planar
surface is coplanar to the blade deck planar bearing surface when mounted
to the saw.
