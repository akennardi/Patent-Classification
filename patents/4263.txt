                               Heating Smokeable Material
Field
[0001]      The invention relates to heating smokeable material.
[0002]      This application is a divisional application of Australian patent application
number 2013251940, whose specification as filed is hereby incorporated by reference
in its entirety.
Background
[0003]      Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way
be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of
common general knowledge in the field.
[0004]      Smoking articles such as cigarettes and cigars burn tobacco during use to
create tobacco smoke. Attempts have been made to provide alternatives to these
smoking articles by creating products which release compounds without creating
tobacco smoke. Examples of such products are so-called heat-not-burn products
which release compounds by heating, but not burning, tobacco.

Detailed description
[0059]     As used herein, the term 'smokeable material' includes any material that
provides volatilized components upon heating and includes any tobacco-containing
material and may, for example, include one or more of tobacco, tobacco derivatives,
expanded tobacco, reconstituted tobacco or tobacco substitutes.
[0060]     An apparatus 1 for heating smokeable material comprises an energy source
2, a heater 3 and a heating chamber 4. The energy source 2 may comprise a battery
such as a Li-ion battery, Ni battery, Alkaline battery and/or the like, and is electrically
coupled to the heater 3 to supply electrical energy to the heater 3 when required. The
heating chamber 4 is configured to receive smokeable material 5 so that the
smokeable material 5 can be heated in the heating chamber 4. For example, the
heating chamber 4 may be located adjacent to the heater 3 so that thermal energy from
the heater 3 heats the smokeable material 5 therein to volatilize aromatic compounds
and nicotine in the smokeable material 5 without burning the smokeable material 5. A

                                            -7
mouthpiece 6 is provided through which a user of the apparatus 1 can inhale the
volatilized compounds during use of the apparatus 1. The smokeable material 5 may
comprise a tobacco blend.
[0061]     A housing 7 may contain components of the apparatus 1 such as the energy
source 2 and heater 3. As shown in figure 1, the housing 7 may comprise an
approximately cylindrical tube with the energy source 2 located towards its first end 8
and the heater 3 and heating chamber 4 located towards its opposite, second end 9.
The energy source 2 and heater 3 extend along the longitudinal axis of the housing 7.
For example, as shown in figure 1, the energy source 2 and heater 3 can be aligned
along the central longitudinal axis of the housing 7 in a substantially end-to-end
arrangement so that an end face of the energy source 2 faces an end face of the
heater 3. The length of the housing 7 may be approximately 130mm, the length of
energy source may be approximately 59mm, and the length of the heater 3 and heating
region 4 may be approximately 50mm. The diameter of the housing 7 may be between
approximately 15mm and approximately 18mm. For example, the diameter of the
housing's first end 8 may be 18mm whilst the diameter of the mouthpiece 6 at the
housing's second end 9 may be 15mm. The diameter of the heater 3 may be between
approximately 2.0mm and approximately 6.0mm. The diameter of the heater 3 may,
for example, be between approximately 4.0mm and approximately 4.5mm or between
approximately 2.0mm and approximately 3.0mm. Heater diameters and thicknesses
outside these ranges may alternatively be used. For example, the diameter of the
housing 7 and size of the apparatus 1 as a whole can be reduced significantly by the
use of the film heater 3 and vacuum insulation 18 described below. The depth of the
heating chamber 4 may be approximately 5mm and the heating chamber 4 may have
an exterior diameter of approximately 10mm at its outwardly-facing surface. The
diameter of the energy source 2 may be between approximately 14.0mm and
approximately 15.0mm, such as 14.6mm. However, an energy source 2 with a smaller
diameter could alternatively be used.
[0062]     Heat insulation may be provided between the energy source 2 and the heater
3 to prevent direct transfer of heat from one to the other. The mouthpiece 6 can be
located at the second end 9 of the housing 7, adjacent the heating chamber 4 and
smokeable material 5. The housing 7 is suitable for being gripped by a user during use

                                           -8
of the apparatus 1 so that the user can inhale volatilized smokeable material
compounds from the mouthpiece 6 of the apparatus 1.
[0063]     The heater 3 may comprise a film heater 3 such as a film polyimide heater 3.
An example is a Kapton@ polyimide heater 3. Other materials could alternatively be
used. The film heater 3 has high tensile strength and high resistance to tearing. The
dielectric strength of the heater 3 may be approximately 1000VAC. The film heater 3
has a small thickness, such as less than 1mm, which can contribute significantly in
reducing the size of the apparatus 1 compared to the use of other types of heaters. An
example thickness of the film 3 is approximately 0.2mm, although heaters 3 with
smaller and larger thickness dimensions can alternatively be used. For example, the
thickness of the film heater 3 may be as low as approximately 0.0002mm. The power
output of the heater 3 may be between approximately 5W/ cm2 and approximately
8W/cm 2, although the power output may be lower and may be controlled, as required,
over time. The film heater 3 may optionally be transparent, thereby allowing easy
inspection of its internal structure.
[0064]     Such ease of inspection may be beneficial for quality control and
maintenance tasks. The film heater 3 may incorporate one or more etched foil heating
elements for heating the smokeable material in the heating chamber 4. The operating
temperature of the heater 3 may, for example, be up to approximately 260'C. The
apparatus 1 may comprise a Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) or a
thermocouple for use with controlling the temperature of the heater 3. Sensors may be
mounted to a surface of the heater 3, which are configured to send resistance
measurements to a controller 12 so that the controller 12 can maintain or adjust the
temperature of the heater 3 as required. For example, the controller 12 may cycle the
heater 3 at a set temperature for a predetermined period of time or may vary the
temperature in accordance with a heating regime. The controller 12 and examples of
heating regimes are described in more detail below. The film heater 3 has a low mass
and therefore its use can help to reduce the overall mass of the apparatus 1.
[0065]     As shown in figure 1, the heater 3 may comprise a plurality of individual
heating regions 10. The heating regions 10 may be operable independently of one
another so that different regions 10 can be activated at different times to heat the
smokeable material 5. The heating regions 10 may be arranged in the heater 3 in any

                                             -9
geometric arrangement. However, in the example shown in figure 1, the heating
regions 10 are geometrically arranged in the heater 3 so that different ones of the
heating regions 10 are arranged to predominately and independently heat different
regions of the smokeable material 5.
[0066]     For example, referring to figures 1 and 2, the heater 3 may comprise a
plurality of axially aligned heating regions 10 in a substantially elongate arrangement.
The regions 10 may each comprise an individual element of the heater 3. The heating
regions 10 may, for example, all be aligned with each other along a longitudinal axis of
the heater 3, thus providing a plurality of independent heating zones along the length of
the heater 3.
[0067]     Referring to figure 1, each heating region 10 may comprise a hollow heating
cylinder 10, which may be a ring 10, having a finite length which is significantly less
than the length of the heater 3 as a whole. The arrangement of axially aligned heating
regions 10 define the exterior of the heating chamber 4 and are configured to heat
smokeable material 5 located in the heating chamber 4. The heat is applied inwardly,
predominately towards the central longitudinal axis of the heating chamber 4. The
heating regions 10 are arranged with their radial, or otherwise transverse, surfaces
facing one another along the length of the heater 3. The transverse surfaces of each
heating region 10 may be separated from the transverse surfaces of their neighbouring
heating region(s) 10 by thermal insulation 18, as shown in figure 1 and described
below.
[0068]     As shown in figure 2, the heater 3 may alternatively be located in a central
region of the housing 7 and the heating chamber 4 and smokeable material 5 may be
located around the longitudinal surface of the heater 3. In this arrangement, thermal
energy emitted by the heater 3 travels outwards from the longitudinal surface of the
heater 3 into the heating chamber 4 and the smokeable material 5.
[0069]     The heating regions 10 may each comprise an individual element of the
heater 3. As shown in figures 1 and 2, each heating region 10 may comprise a heating
cylinder 10 having a finite length which is significantly less than the length of the heater
3 as a whole. However, other configurations of heater 3 could alternatively be used
and so the use of cylindrical sections of film heater 3 is not required. The heating

                                             -10
regions 10 may be arranged with their transverse surfaces facing one another along
the length of the heater 3. The transverse surfaces of each region 10 may touch the
transverse surfaces of its neighbouring regions 10. Alternatively, a heat insulating or
heat reflecting layer may be present between the transverse surfaces of the regions 10
so that thermal energy emitted from each one of the regions 10 does not substantially
heat the neighbouring regions 10 and instead travels predominately into the heating
chamber 4 and smokeable material 5. Each heating region 10 may have substantially
the same dimensions as the other regions 10.
[0070]      In this way, when a particular one of the heating regions 10 is activated, it
supplies thermal energy to the smokeable material 5 located adjacent, for example
radially adjacent, the heating region 10 without substantially heating the remainder of
the smokeable material 5. Referring to figure 2, the heated region of smokeable
material 5 may comprise a ring of smokeable material 5 located around the heating
region 10 which has been activated. The smokeable material 5 can therefore be
heated in independent sections, for example rings or substantially solid cylinders,
where each section corresponds to smokeable material 5 located directly adjacent a
particular one of the heating regions 10 and has a mass and volume which is
significantly less than the body of smokeable material 5 as a whole.
[0071]     Additionally or alternatively, the heater 3 may comprise a plurality of
elongate, longitudinally extending heating regions 10 positioned at different locations
around the central longitudinal axis of the heater 3. The heating regions 10 may be of
different lengths, or may be of substantially the same length so that each extends along
substantially the whole length of the heater 3.
[0072]     The heated sections of smokeable material 5 may comprise longitudinal
sections of smokeable material 5 which lie parallel and directly adjacent to the
longitudinal heating regions 10. Therefore, as explained previously, the smokeable
material 5 can be heated in independent sections.
[0073]     As will be described further below, the heating regions 10 can each be
individually and selectively activated.

                                            - 11
[0074]      The smokeable material 5 may be comprised in a cartridge 11 which can be
inserted into the heating chamber 4. For example, as shown in figure 1, the cartridge
 11 can comprise a substantially solid body of smokeable material 5 such as a cylinder
which fits into a recess of the heater 3. In this configuration, the external surface of the
smokeable material body faces the heater 3. Alternatively, as shown in figure 2, the
cartridge 11 can comprise a smokeable material tube 11 which can be inserted around
the heater 3 so that the internal surface of the smokeable material tube 11 faces the
longitudinal surface of the heater 3. The smokeable material tube 11 may be hollow.
The diameter of the hollow centre of the tube 11 may be substantially equal to, or
slightly larger than, the diameter or otherwise transverse dimension of the heater 3 so
that the tube 11 is a close fit around the heater 3. The length of the cartridge 11 may
be approximately equal to the length of the heater 3 so that the heater 3 can heat the
cartridge 11 along its whole length.
[0075]      The housing 7 of the apparatus 1 may comprise an opening through which
the cartridge 11 can be inserted into the heating chamber 4. The opening may, for
example, comprise an opening located at the housing's second end 9 so that the
cartridge 11 can be slid into the opening and pushed directly into the heating chamber
4. The opening is preferably closed during use of the apparatus 1 to heat the
smokeable material 5. Alternatively, a section of the housing 7 at the second end 9 is
removable from the apparatus 1 so that the smokeable material 5 can be inserted into
the heating chamber 4. The apparatus 1 may optionally be equipped with a user
operable smokeable material ejection unit, such as an internal mechanism configured
to slide used smokeable material 5 off and/or away from the heater 3. The used
smokeable material 5 may, for example, be pushed back through the opening in the
housing 7. A new cartridge 11 can then be inserted as required.
[0076]     As mentioned previously, the apparatus 1 may comprise a controller 12, such
as a microcontroller 12, which is configured to control operation of the apparatus 1.
The controller 12 is electronically connected to the other components of the apparatus
1 such as the energy source 2 and heater 3 so that it can control their operation by
sending and receiving signals. The controller 12 is, in particular, configured to control
activation of the heater 3 to heat the smokeable material 5. For example, the controller
12 may be configured to activate the heater 3, which may comprise selectively
activating one or more heating regions 10, in response to a user drawing on the

                                             -12
mouthpiece 6 of the apparatus 1. In this regard, the controller 12 may be in
communication with a puff sensor 13 via a suitable communicative coupling. The puff
sensor 13 is configured to detect when a puff occurs at the mouthpiece 6 and, in
response, is configured to send a signal to the controller 12 indicative of the puff. An
electronic signal may be used. The controller 12 may respond to the signal from the
puff sensor 13 by activating the heater 3 and thereby heating the smokeable material 5.
The use of a puff sensor 13 to activate the heater 3 is not, however, essential and other
means for providing a stimulus to activate the heater 3 can alternatively be used. For
example, the controller 12 may activate the heater 3 in response to another type of
activation stimulus such as actuation of a user-operable actuator. The volatilized
compounds released during heating can then be inhaled by the user through the
mouthpiece 6. The controller 12 can be located at any suitable position within the
housing 7. An example position is between the energy source 2 and the heater
3/heating chamber 4, as illustrated in figure 4.
[0077]      If the heater 3 comprises two or more heating regions 10 as described
above, the controller 12 may be configured to activate the heating regions 10 in a
predetermined order or pattern. For example, the controller 12 may be configured to
activate the heating regions 10 sequentially along or around the heating chamber 4.
Each activation of a heating region 10 may be in response to detection of a puff by the
puff sensor 13 or may be triggered in an alternative way, as described further below.
[0078]      Referring to figure 5, an example heating method may comprise a first step
S1 in which an activation stimulus such as a first puff is detected followed by a second
step S2 in which a first section of smokeable material 5 is heated in response to the
first puff or other activation stimulus. In a third step S3, hermetically sealable inlet and
outlet valves 24 may be opened to allow air to be drawn through the heating chamber 4
and out of the apparatus 1 through the mouthpiece 6. In a fourth step, the valves 24
are closed. These valves 24 are described in more detail below with respect to figure
20. In fifth S5, sixth S6, seventh S7 and eighth S8 steps, a second section of
smokeable material 5 may be heated in response to a second activation stimulus such
as a second puff, with a corresponding opening and closing of the heating chamber
inlet and outlet valves 24. In ninth S9, tenth S10, eleventh S11 and twelfth S12 steps,
a third section of the smokeable material 5 may be heated in response to a third
activation stimulus such as a third puff with a corresponding opening and closing of the

                                              -13
heating chamber inlet and outlet valves 24, and so on. As referred to above, means
other than a puff sensor 13 could alternatively be used. For example, a user of the
apparatus 1 may actuate a control switch to indicate that he/she is taking a new puff.
In this way, a fresh section of smokeable material 5 may be heated to volatilize nicotine
and aromatic compounds for each new puff. The number of heating regions 10 and/or
independently heatable sections of smokeable material 5 may correspond to the
number of puffs for which the cartridge 11 is intended to be used. Alternatively, each
independently heatable smokeable material section 5 may be heated by its
corresponding heating region(s) 10 for a plurality of puffs such as two, three or four
puffs, so that a fresh section of smokeable material 5 is heated only after a plurality of
puffs have been taken whilst heating the previous smokeable material section.
[0079]      Instead of activating each heating region 10 in response to an individual puff,
the heating regions 10 may alternatively be activated sequentially, one after the other,
in response to a single, initial puff at the mouthpiece 6. For example, the heating
regions 10 may be activated at regular, predetermined intervals over the expected
inhalation period for a particular smokeable material cartridge 11. The inhalation
period may, for example, be between approximately one and approximately four
minutes. Therefore, at least the fifth and ninth steps S5, S9 shown in figure 5 are
optional. Each heating region 10 may be activated for a predetermined period
corresponding to the duration of the single or plurality of puffs for which the
corresponding independently heatable smokeable material section 5 is intended to be
heated. Once all of the heating regions 10 have been activated for a particular
cartridge 11, the controller 12 may be configured to indicate to the user that the
cartridge 11 should be changed. The controller 12 may, for example, activate an
indicator light at the external surface of the housing 7.
[0080]      It will be appreciated that activating individual heating regions 10 in order
rather than activating the entire heater 3 means that the energy required to heat the
smokeable material 5 is reduced over what would be required if the heater 3 were
activated fully over the entire inhalation period of a cartridge 11. Therefore, the
maximum required power output of the energy source 2 is also reduced. This means
that a smaller and lighter energy source 2 can be installed in the apparatus 1.

                                             - 14
[0081]      The controller 12 may be configured to de-activate the heater 3, or reduce
the power being supplied to the heater 3, in between puffs. This saves energy and
extends the life of the energy source 2. For example, upon the apparatus 1 being
switched on by a user or in response to some other stimulus, such as detection of a
user placing their mouth against the mouthpiece 6, the controller 12 may be configured
to cause the heater 3, or next heating region 10 to be used to heat the smokeable
material 5, to be partially activated so that it heats up in preparation to volatilize
components of the smokeable material 5. The partial activation does not heat the
smokeable material 5 to a sufficient temperature to volatilize nicotine. A suitable
temperature could be approximately 100 C. In response to detection of a puff by the
puff sensor 13, the controller 12 can then cause the heater 3 or heating region 10 in
question to heat the smokeable material 5 further in order to rapidly volatilize the
nicotine and other aromatic compounds for inhalation by the user. If the smokeable
material 5 comprises tobacco, a suitable temperature for volatilizing the nicotine and
other aromatic compounds may be between 150'C and 250'C. Therefore, an example
full activation temperature is 250'C. A super-capacitor can optionally be used to
provide the peak current used to heat the smokeable material 5 to the volatization
temperature. An example of a suitable heating pattern is shown in figure 7, in which
the peaks may respectively represent the full activation of different heating regions 10.
As can be seen, the smokeable material 5 is maintained at the volatization temperature
for the approximate period of the puff which, in this example, is two seconds.
[0082]      Three example operational modes of the heater 3 are described below.
[0083]      In a first operational mode, during full activation of a particular heating region
10, all other heating regions 10 of the heater are deactivated. Therefore, when a new
heating region 10 is activated, the previous heating region is deactivated. Power is
supplied only to the activated region 10.
[0084]      Alternatively, in a second operational mode, during full activation of a
particular heating region 10, one or more of the other heating regions 10 may be
partially activated. Partial activation of the one or more other heating regions 10 may
comprise heating the other heating region(s) 10 to a temperature which is sufficient to
substantially prevent condensation of components such as nicotine volatized from the
smokeable material 5 in the heating chamber 4. The temperature of the heating

                                             -15
regions 10 which are partially activated is less than the temperature of the heating
region 10 which is fully activated. The smokeable material 10 located adjacent the
partially activated regions 10 is not heated to a temperature sufficient to volatize
components of the smokeable material 5.
[0085]     Alternatively, in a third operational mode, once a particular heating region 10
has been activated, it remains fully activated until the heater 3 is switched off.
Therefore, the power supplied to the heater 3 incrementally increases as more of the
heating regions 10 are activated during inhalation from the cartridge 11. As with the
second mode previously described, the continuing activation of the heating regions 10
substantially prevent condensation of components such as nicotine volatized from the
smokeable material 5 in the heating chamber 4.
[0086]     The apparatus 1 may comprise a heat shield 3a, which is located between
the heater 3 and the heating chamber 4/smokeable material 5. The heat shield 3a is
configured to substantially prevent thermal energy from flowing through the heat shield
3a and therefore can be used to selectively prevent the smokeable material 5 from
being heated even when the heater 3 is activated and emitting thermal energy.
Referring to figure 14, the heat shield 3a may, for example, comprise a cylindrical layer
of heat reflective material which is located co-axially around the heater 3. Alternatively,
if the heater 3 is located around the heating chamber 4 and smokeable material 5 as
previously described with reference to figure 1, the heat shield 3a may comprise a
cylindrical layer of heat reflective material which is located co-axially around the
heating chamber 4 and co-axially inside of the heater 3. The heat shield 3a may
additionally or alternatively comprise a heat-insulating layer configured to insulate the
heater 3 from the smokeable material 5.
[0087]     The heat shield 3a comprises a substantially heat-transparent window 3b
which allows thermal energy to propagate through the window 3b and into the heating
chamber 4 and smokeable material 5. Therefore, the section of smokeable material 5
which is aligned with the window 3b is heated whilst the remainder of the smokeable
material 5 is not. The heat shield 3a and window 3b may be rotatable or otherwise
moveable with respect the smokeable material 5 so that different sections of the
smokeable material 5 can be selectively and individually heated by rotating or moving
the heat shield 3a and window 3b. The effect is similar to the effect provided by

                                            -  16
selectively and individually activating the heating regions 10 referred to above. For
example, the heat shield 3a and window 3b may be rotated or otherwise moved
incrementally in response to a signal from the puff detector 13. Additionally or
alternatively, the heat shield 3a and window 3b may be rotated or otherwise moved
incrementally in response to a predetermined heating period having elapsed.
Movement or rotation of the heat shield 3a and window 3b may be controlled by
electronic signals from the controller 12. The relative rotation or other movement of the
heat shield 3a/window 3b and smokeable material 5 may be driven by a stepper motor
3c under the control of the controller 12. This is illustrated in figure 14. Alternatively,
the heat shield 3a and window 3b may be manually rotated using a user control such
as an actuator on the housing 7. The heat shield 3a does not need to be cylindrical
and may optionally comprise one or more suitably positioned longitudinally extending
elements and or/plates.
[0088]     It will be appreciated that a similar result can be obtained by rotating or
moving the smokeable material 5 relative to the heater 3, heat shield 3a and window
3b. For example, the heating chamber 4 may be rotatable around the heater 3. If this
is the case, the above description relating to movement of the heat shield 3a can be
applied instead to movement of the heating chamber 4 relative to the heat shield 3a.
[0089]     The heat shield 3a may comprise a coating on the longitudinal surface of the
heater 3. In this case, an area of the heater's surface is left uncoated to form the heat
transparent window 3b. The heater 3 can be rotated or otherwise moved, for example
under the control of the controller 12 or user controls, to cause different sections of the
smokeable material 5 to be heated. Alternatively, the heat shield 3a and window 3b
may comprise a separate shield 3a which is rotatable or otherwise moveable relative to
both the heater 3 and the smokeable material 5 under the control of the controller 12 or
other user controls.
[0090]     The apparatus 1 may comprise air inlets 14 which allow external air to be
drawn into the housing 7 and through the heated smokeable material 5 during puffing.
The air inlets 14 may comprise apertures 14 in the housing 7 and may be located
upstream from the smokeable material 5 and heating chamber 4 towards the first end 8
of the housing 7. This is shown in figure 1. Another example is shown in figure 6. Air
drawn in through the inlets 14 travels through the heated smokeable material 5 and

                                            -17
therein is enriched with smokeable material vapours, such as aroma vapours, before
being inhaled by the user at the mouthpiece 6. Optionally, as shown in figure 6, the
apparatus 1 may comprise a heat exchanger 15 configured to warm the air before it
enters the smokeable material 5 and/or to cool the air before it is drawn through the
mouthpiece 6. For example, the heat exchanger 15 may be configured to use heat
extracted from the air entering the mouthpiece 6 to warm new air before it enters the
smokeable material 5.
[0091]     The apparatus 1 may comprise a smokeable material compressor 16
configured to cause the smokeable material 5 to compress upon activation of the
compressor 16. The apparatus 1 can also comprise a smokeable material expander
17 configured to cause the smokeable material 5 to expand upon activation of the
expander 17. The compressor 16 and expander 17 may, in practice, be implemented
as the same unit as will be explained below. The smokeable material compressor 16
and expander 17 may optionally operate under the control of the controller 12. In this
case, the controller 12 is configured to send a signal, such as an electrical signal, to the
compressor 16 or expander 17 which causes the compressor 16 or expander 17 to
respectively compress or expand the smokeable material 5. Alternatively, the
compressor 16 and expander 17 may be actuated by a user of the apparatus 1 using a
manual control on the housing 7 to compress or expand the smokeable material 5 as
required.
[0092]     The compressor 16 is principally configured to compress the smokeable
material 5 and thereby increase its density during heating. Compression of the
smokeable material increases the thermal conductivity of the body of smokeable
material 5 and therefore provides a more rapid heating and consequent rapid
volatization of nicotine and other aromatic compounds. This is preferable because it
allows the nicotine and aromatics to be inhaled by the user without substantial delay in
response to detection of a puff. Therefore, the controller 12 may activate the
compressor 16 to compress the smokeable material 5 for a predetermined heating
period, for example one second, in response to detection of a puff. The compressor 16
may be configured to reduce its compression of the smokeable material 5, for example
under the control of the controller 12, after the predetermined heating period.
Alternatively, the compression may be reduced or automatically ended in response to
the smokeable material 5 reaching a predetermined threshold temperature. A suitable

                                            -18
threshold temperature may be in the range of approximately 150'C to 250"C, and may
be user selectable. A temperature sensor may be used to detect the temperature of
the smokeable material 5.
[0093]     The expander 17 is principally configured to expand the smokeable material
5 and thereby decrease its density during puffing. The arrangement of smokeable
material 5 in the heating chamber 4 becomes more loose when the smokeable material
5 has been expanded and this aids the gaseous flow, for example air from the inlets
14, through the smokeable material 5. The air is therefore more able to carry the
volatilized nicotine and aromatics to the mouthpiece 6 for inhalation. The controller 12
may activate the expander 17 to expand the smokeable material 5 immediately
following the compression period referred to above so that air can be drawn more
freely through the smokeable material 5. Actuation of the expander 17 may be
accompanied by a user-audible sound or other indication to indicate to the user that the
smokeable material 5 has been heated and that puffing can commence.
[0094]     Referring to figures 8 and 9, the compressor 16 and expander 17 may
comprise a spring-actuated driving rod which is configured to compress the smokeable
material 5 in the heating chamber 4 when the spring is released from compression.
This is schematically illustrated in figures 8 and 9, although it will be appreciated that
other implementations could be used. For example, the compressor 16 may comprise
a ring, having a thickness approximately equal to the tubular-shaped heating chamber
4 described above, which is driven by a spring or other means into the heating
chamber 4 to compress the smokeable material 5. Alternatively, the compressor 16
may be comprised as part of the heater 3 so that the heater 3 itself is configured to
compress and expand the smokeable material 5 under the control of the controller 12.
A method of compressing and expanding the smokeable material 5 is shown in figure
10.
[0095]     The heater 3 may be integrated with the thermal insulation 18 mentioned
previously. For example, referring to figure 1, the thermal insulation 18 may comprise
a substantially elongate, hollow body, such as a substantially cylindrical tube of
insulation 18, which is located co-axially around the heating chamber 4 and into which
the heating regions 10 are integrated. The thermal insulation 18 may comprise a layer
in which recesses are provided in the inwardly facing surface profile 21. Heating

                                             -19
regions 10 are located in these recesses so that the heating regions 10 face the
smokeable material 5 in the heating chamber 4. The surfaces of the heating regions
 10 which face the heating chamber 4 may be flush with the inside surface 21 of the
thermal insulation 18 in regions of the insulation 18 which are not recessed.
[0096]     The integration of the heater 3 with the thermal insulation 18 means that the
heating regions 10 are substantially surrounded by the insulation 18 on all sides of the
heating regions 10 other than those which face inwardly towards the smokeable
material heating chamber 4. As such, heat emitted by the heater 3 is concentrated in
the smokeable material 5 and does not dissipate into other parts of the apparatus 1 or
into the atmosphere outside the housing 7.
[0097]     Integration of the heater 3 with the thermal insulation 18 may also reduce the
thickness of the combination of heater 3 and thermal insulation 18. This can allow the
diameter of the apparatus 1, in particular the external diameter of the housing 7, to be
further reduced. Alternatively, the reduction in thickness provided by the integration of
the heater 3 with the thermal insulation 18 can allow a wider smokeable material
heating chamber 4 to be accommodated in the apparatus 1, or the introduction of
further components, without any increase in the overall width of the housing 7.
[0098]     Alternatively, the heater 3 may be adjacent the insulation 18 rather than
being integrated into it. For example, if the heater 3 is located externally of the heating
chamber 4, the insulation 18 may be lined with the film heater 3 around its inwardly
facing surface 21. If the heater 3 is located internally of the heating chamber 4, the
insulation 18 may be lined with the film heater 3 on its outwardly-facing surface 22.
[0099]     Optionally, a barrier may be present between the heater 3 and the insulation
18. For example, a layer of stainless steel may be present between the heater 3 and
the insulation 18. The barrier may comprise a stainless steel tube which fits between
the heater 3 and the insulation 18. The thickness of the barrier may be small so as not
to substantially increase the dimensions of the apparatus. An example thickness is
between approximately 0.1mm and 1.0mm.
[00100]    Additionally, a heat reflecting layer may be present between the transverse
surfaces of the heating regions 10. The arrangement of the heating regions 10 relative

                                            - 20
to each other may be such that thermal energy emitted from each one of the heating
regions 10 does not substantially heat the neighbouring heating regions 10 and instead
travels predominately inwardly from the circumferential surface of the heating region 10
into the heating chamber 4 and smokeable material 5. Each heating region 10 may
have substantially the same dimensions as the other regions 10.
[00101]    The heater 3 may be bonded or otherwise secured in the apparatus 1 using
pressure sensitive adhesive. For example, the heater 3 may be adhered to the
insulation 18 or barrier referred to above using pressure sensitive adhesive. The
heater 3 may alternatively be adhered to the cartridge 11 or an exterior surface of the
smokeable material heating chamber 4.
[00102]   As an alternative to the use of pressure sensitive adhesive, the heater 3 may
be secured in position in the apparatus 1 using self-fusing tape or by clamps which
clamp the heater 3 in place. All of these methods provide a secure fixing for the heater
3 and allow effective heat transfer from the heater 3 to the smokeable material 5.
Other types of fixing are also possible.
[00103]    The thermal insulation 18, which is provided between the smokeable material
5 and an external surface 19 of the housing 7as described above, reduces heat loss
from the apparatus 1 and therefore improves the efficiency with which the smokeable
material 5 is heated. For example, referring to figure 1, a wall of the housing 7 may
comprise a layer of insulation 18 which extends around the outside of the heating
chamber 4. The insulation layer 18 may comprise a substantially tubular length of
insulation 18 located co-axially around the heating chamber 4 and smokeable material
5. This is shown in figure 1. It will be appreciated that the insulation 18 could also be
comprised as part of the smokeable material cartridge 11, in which it would be located
co-axially around the outside of the smokeable material 5.
[00104]    Referring to figure 11, the insulation 18 may comprise vacuum insulation 18.
For example, the insulation 18 may comprise a layer which is bounded by a wall
material 19 such as a metallic material. An internal region or core 20 of the insulation
18 may comprise an open-cell porous material, for example comprising polymers,
aerogels or other suitable material, which is evacuated to a low pressure. The
pressure in the internal region 20 may be in the range of 0.1 to 0.001 mbar. The wall

                                             - 21
19 of the insulation 18 is sufficiently strong to withstand the force exerted against it due
to the pressure differential between the core 20 and external surfaces of the wall 19,
thereby preventing the insulation 18 from collapsing. The wall 19 may, for example,
comprise a stainless steel wall 19 having a thickness of approximately 1OOpm. The
thermal conductivity of the insulation 18 may be in the range of 0.004 to 0.005 W/mK.
The heat transfer coefficient of the insulation 18 may be between approximately 1.10
W/(m 2 K) and approximately 1.40 W/(m 2 K) within a temperature range of between
approximately 150 degrees Celsius and approximately 250 degrees Celsius. The
gaseous conductivity of the insulation 18 is negligible. A reflective coating may be
applied to the internal surfaces of the wall material 19 to minimize heat losses due to
radiation propagating through the insulation 18. The coating may, for example,
comprise an aluminium IR reflective coating having a thickness of between
approximately 0.3pm and 1.Opm. The evacuated state of the internal core region 20
means that the insulation 18 functions even when the thickness of the core region 20 is
very small. The insulating properties are substantially unaffected by its thickness. This
helps to reduce the overall size of the apparatus 1.
[00105]    As shown in figure 11, the wall 19 may comprise an inwardly-facing section
21 and an outwardly-facing section 22. The inwardly-facing section 21 substantially
faces the smokeable material 5 and heating chamber 4. The outwardly-facing section
22 substantially faces the exterior of the housing 7. During operation of the apparatus
1, the inwardly-facing section 21 may be warmer due to the thermal energy originating
from the heater 3, whilst the outwardly-facing section 22 is cooler due to the effect of
the insulation 18. The inwardly-facing section 21 and the outwardly-facing section 22
may, for example, comprise substantially parallel longitudinally-extending walls 19
which are at least as long as the heater 3. The internal surface of the outwardly-facing
wall section 22, i.e. the surface facing the evacuated core region 20, may comprise a
coating for absorbing gas in the core 20. A suitable coating is a titanium oxide film.
[00106]    The thermal insulation 18 may comprise hyper-deep vacuum insulation such
as an Insulon@ Shaped-Vacuum Thermal Barrier as described in US 7,374,063. The
overall thickness of such insulation 18 may be extremely small. An example thickness
is between approximately 1mm and approximately 1pm, such as approximately 0.1mm,
although other larger or smaller thicknesses are also possible. The thermally insulating
properties of the insulation 18 are substantially unaffected by its thickness and

                                           - 22
therefore thin insulation 18 can be used without any substantial additional heat loss
from the apparatus 1. The very small thickness of the thermal insulation 18 may allow
the size of the housing 7 and apparatus 1 as a whole to be reduced beyond the sizes
previously discussed and may allow the thickness, for example the diameter, of the
apparatus 1 to be approximately equal to smoking articles such as cigarettes, cigars
and cigarillos. The weight of the apparatus 1 may also be reduced, providing similar
benefits to the size reductions discussed above.
[00107]    Although the thermal insulation 18 described previously may comprise a gas
absorbing material to maintain or aid with creation of the vacuum in the core region 20,
a gas absorbing material is not used in the deep-vacuum insulation 18. The absence
of the gas absorbing material aids with keeping the thickness of the insulation 18 very
low and thus helps to reduce the overall size of the apparatus 1.
[00108]    The geometry of the hyper-deep insulation 18 allows the vacuum in the
insulation to be deeper than the vacuum used to extract molecules from the core region
20 of the insulation 18 during manufacture. For example, the deep vacuum inside the
insulation 18 may be deeper than that of the vacuum-furnace chamber in which it is
created. The vacuum inside the insulation 18 may, for example, be of the order 10-7
Torr. Referring to figure 16, an end of the core region 20 of the deep-vacuum
insulation 18 may taper as the outwardly facing section 22 and inwardly facing section
21 converge to an outlet 25 through which gas in the core region 20 may be evacuated
to create a deep vacuum during manufacture of the insulation 18. Figure 16 illustrates
the outwardly facing section 22 converging towards the inwardly facing section 21 but a
converse arrangement, in which the inwardly facing section 21 converges to the
outwardly facing section 22, could alternatively be used. The converging end of the
insulating wall 19 is configured to guide gas molecules in the core region 20 out of the
outlet 25 and thereby create a deep vacuum in the core 20. The outlet 25 is sealable
so as to maintain a deep vacuum in the core region 20 after the region 20 has been
evacuated. The outlet 25 can be sealed, for example, by creating a brazed seal at the
outlet 25 by heating brazing material at the outlet 25 after gas has been evacuated
from the core 20. Alternative sealing techniques could be used.
[00109]    In order to evacuate the core region 20, the insulation 18 may be placed in a
low pressure, substantially evacuated environment such as a vacuum furnace chamber

                                             - 23
so that gas molecules in the core region 20 flow into the low pressure environment
outside the insulation 18. When the pressure inside the core region 20 becomes low,
the tapered geometry of the core region 20, and in particular the converging sections
21, 22 referred to above, becomes influential in guiding remaining gas molecules out
the core 20 via the outlet 25. Specifically, when the gas pressure in the core region 20
is low, the guiding effect of the converging inwardly and outwardly facing sections 21,
22 is effective to channel the remaining gas molecules inside the core 20 towards the
outlet 25 and make the probability of gas exiting the core 20 higher than the probability
of gas entering the core 20 from the external, low pressure environment. In this way,
the geometry of the core 20 allows the pressure inside the core 20 to be reduced below
the pressure of the environment outside the insulation 18.
[00110]    Optionally, as previously described, one or more low emissivity coatings may
be present on the internal surfaces of the inwardly and outwardly facing sections 21, 22
of the wall 19 in order to substantially prevent heat losses by radiation.
[00111]    Although the shape of the insulation 18 is generally described herein as
substantially cylindrical or similar, the thermal insulation 18 could be another shape, for
example in order to accommodate and insulate a different configuration of the
apparatus 1 such as different shapes and sizes of heating chamber 4, heater 3,
housing 7 or energy source 2. For example, the size and shape of deep-vacuum
insulation 18 such as an Insulon@ Shaped-Vacuum Thermal Barrier referred to above
is substantially unlimited by its manufacturing process. Suitable materials for forming
the converging structure described above include ceramics, metals, metalloids and
combinations of these.
[00112]    Referring to the schematic illustration in figure 12, a thermal bridge 23 may
connect the inwardly-facing wall section 21 to the outwardly-facing wall section 22 at
one or more edges of the insulation 18 in order to completely encompass and contain
the low pressure core 20. The thermal bridge 23 may comprise a wall 19 formed of the
same material as the inwardly and outwardly-facing sections 21, 22. A suitable
material is stainless steel, as previously discussed. The thermal bridge 23 has a
greater thermal conductivity than the insulating core 20 and therefore may undesirably
conduct heat out of the apparatus 1 and, in doing so, reduce the efficiency with which
the smokeable material 5 is heated.

                                            - 24
[00113]    To reduce heat losses due to the thermal bridge 23, the thermal bridge 23
may be extended to increase its resistance to heat flow from the inwardly-facing
section 21 to the outwardly-facing section 22. This is schematically illustrated in figure
13. For example, the thermal bridge 23 may follow an indirect path between the
inwardly-facing section 21 of wall 19 and the outwardly-facing section 22 of wall 19.
This may be facilitated by providing the insulation 18 over a longitudinal distance which
is longer than the lengths of the heater 3, heating chamber 4 and smokeable material 5
so that the thermal bridge 23 can gradually extend from the inwardly-facing section 21
to the outwardly-facing section 22 along the indirect path, thereby reducing the
thickness of the core 20 to zero, at a longitudinal location in the housing 7 where the
heater 3, heating chamber 4 and smokeable material 5 are not present.
[00114]    Referring to figure 15, as previously discussed, the heating chamber 4
insulated by the insulation 18 may comprise inlet and outlet valves 24 which
hermetically seal the heating chamber 4 when closed. The valves 24 can thereby
prevent air from undesirably entering and exiting the chamber 4 and can prevent
smokeable material flavours from exiting the chamber 4. The inlet and outlet values 24
may, for example, be provided in the insulation 18. For example, between puffs, the
valves 24 may be closed by the controller 12 so that all volatilized substances remain
contained inside the chamber 4 in-between puffs. The partial pressure of the volatized
substances between puffs reaches the saturated vapour pressure and the amount of
evaporated substances therefore depends only on the temperature in the heating
chamber 4. This helps to ensure that the delivery of volatilized nicotine and aromatic
compounds remains constant from puff to puff. During puffing, the controller 12 is
configured to open the valves 24 so that air can flow through the chamber 4 to carry
volatilized smokeable material components to the mouthpiece 6. A membrane can be
located in the valves 24 to ensure that no oxygen enters the chamber 4. The valves 24
may be breath-actuated so that the valves 24 open in response to detection of a puff at
the mouthpiece 6. The valves 24 may close in response to a detection that a puff has
ended. Alternatively, the valves 24 may close following the elapse of a predetermined
period after their opening. The predetermined period may be timed by the controller
12. Optionally, a mechanical or other suitable opening/closing means may be present
so that the valves 24 open and close automatically. For example, the gaseous
movement caused by a user puffing on the mouthpiece 6 may be used to open and

                                            - 25
close the valves 24. Therefore, the use of the controller 12 is not necessarily required
to actuate the valves 24.
[00115]    The mass of the smokeable material 5 which is heated by the heater 3, for
example by each heating region 10, may be in the range of 0.2 to 1.0g. The
temperature to which the smokeable material 5 is heated may be user controllable, for
example to any temperature within the temperature range of 150'C to 250'C as
previously described. The mass of the apparatus 1 as a whole may be in the range of
70 to 125g, although the mass of the apparatus 1 can be lower when incorporating the
film heater 3 and/or deep-vacuum insulation 18. A battery 2 with a capacity of 1000 to
3000mAh and voltage of 3.7V can be used. The heating regions 10 may be configured
to individually and selectively heat between approximately 10 and 40 sections of
smokeable material 5 for a single cartridge 11.
