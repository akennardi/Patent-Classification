      Please refer to FIGS. 1-6, a junction box provided by the present application is described
herein. The junction box is used to conductively connect two cables 5, and main components of the
junction box comprise: a support base 1, multiple conductive members 2 arranged on the support
base 1, a top cover 3 arranged on a first side of the support base 1, and an bottom cover 4 arranged
on a second side of the support base 1 opposite to the first side. Each of the multiple conductive
members 2 comprises two clamping plates 21 and an intermediate plate 22 connected with the two
                                                    3

clamping plates 21. The clamping plates 21 are configured to electrically connect with wires 51 of
the cables 5. In this embodiment, each cable 5 has three wires 51, i. e., a ground wire, a neutral
wire, and a fire wire, therefore, the support base 1 is correspondingly provided with three
conductive members 2, and each conductive member 2 functions in connecting wires 51 of the
same functions from the two different cables 5.
      The junction box of the present application can not only fix the cables, but also function in
connecting the two cables 5. The use of the junction box can easily connect different cables into
original cable lines, neither are the original cables or the newly connected cables required to be cut
off, nor are the existing wiring system required to be replaced, therefore, it is convenient for the
arrangement of the cable lines.
     Further, please refer to FIGS. 2-5, multiple through holes 11 are defined on the support base 1,
the intermediate plate 22 of each of the conductive members 2 passes through each of the multiple
through holes 11 and is embedded in the support base 1. The through holes 11 may be straight
holes or curved holes, and shapes of the intermediate plates 22 match with shapes of the
corresponding through holes 11. The support base 1 is made of an insulating material, and different
conductive members 2 are arranged on the support base 1 and spaced apart from each other, so that
the support base 1 functions in insulating different conductive members 2. The two clamping
plates 21 of the same conductive member 2 are respectively located at the first side and the second
side of the support base 1. When two different cables 5 are connected into the junction box, one
cable 5 is introduced to the first side to be connected with the clamping plates 21 located at the
first side, and the other cable 5 is introduced to the second side to be connected with the clamping
plates 21 located at the second side. Such a structure is more compact, facilitates a miniaturized
arrangement of the junction box, and reduces the mounting space occupied by the junction box.
     Further, please refer to FIGS. 2-4, four partitions 12 are formed on a middle region of each of
the first side and the second side of the support base 1. The four partitions 12 are spaced apart from
each other at equivalent intervals, forming three slots for accommodating the three wires 51 of
each cable 5, in this way, it is well ensured that neither short circuits nor mutual winding of the
wires 51 occurs, and the installation is very convenient.
     Further, please refer to FIGS. 2-4, locking members 13 are formed on both the first side and
the second side of the support base 1 and configured to connect with the top cover 3 and with the
bottom cover 4, respectively, and locking recesses 6 are correspondingly formed on the top cover 3
and the bottom cover 4 for allowing corresponding locking members 13 to be inserted therein.
When the top cover 3 or the bottom cover 4 are assembled with the support base 1, the locking
members 13 are inserted into the locking recesses by an assembly force, thereby realizing fixation
of the top cover 3 or the bottom cover 4. Such a structure is simple and convenient to be
                                                    4

assembled.
      Further, please refer to FIGS. 2-6, the clamping plate 21 is a flat plate provided with a fitting
groove 211 for allowing a wire 51 of the cable 5 to be fitted therein. The fitting groove comprises a
first groove section and a second groove section extending from the first groove section to a
periphery of the clamping plate. Edges of the fitting groove 211 form cutting edges. When
connecting the cable 5, an outermost cladding layer of the cable 5 is removed firstly to expose
three wires 51 with separate cladding layers, then each wire 51 is pressed into corresponding
fitting groove 211. Since the width of the fitting groove 211 is between 1 mm and 2.5 mm, which
is smaller than a diameter of each wire 51 covered with the cladding layer, the fitting groove 211
provided with the cutting edges can automatically cut the cladding layer of each wire 51 to contact
with the wire 51, in this way, connection between the wire 51 and the conductive member 2 is
achieved.
      Further, please refer to FIG. 6, the first groove section is an arc opening 23, which has a
diameter greater than a width of the second groove section. Because the width of the second
groove section of the fitting groove 211 is smaller than the diameter of the wire 51 covered with
the cladding layer, when the wire 51 is inserted into the fitting groove 211, deformation of the
clamping plate 21 is caused, and the arc opening 23 formed at an terminal end of the fitting groove
211 effectively prevents the clamping plate 21 from being torn under the action of the insertion of
the wire 51.
      Further, please refer to FIG. 1, the junction box further comprises: the top cover 3 and the
bottom cover 4. Both the top cover 3 and the bottom cover 4 are made of insulating materials,
thereby ensuring no electrical leakage of the junction box outwards. The top cover 3 covers the
first side of the support base 1 to form a first internal space allowing one of the cables 5 to pass
through. The bottom cover 4 covers the second side of the support base 1 to form a second internal
space allowing the other of the cables to pass through. Convex structures 7 are formed on inner
sides of both the top cover 3 and the bottom cover 4. When the top cover 3 covers the support base
1, positions of the convex structures 7 of the top cover 3 are aligned with positions of the fitting
grooves 211 of the clamping plates 21 located at the first side of the support base 1; and when the
bottom cover 4 covers the support base 1, positions of the convex structures 7 of the bottom cover
4 are aligned with positions of the fitting grooves 211 of the clamping plates 21 located at the
second side of the support base 1. In use, the wires 51 are aligned with openings of the fitting
groove 211, and the wires 51 can be pressed into the fitting grooves 211 by pressing the top cover
3 and the bottom cover 4.
      Further, please refer to FIG. 1, the top cover 3 and the bottom cover 4 are made of a
transparent plastic material, such that internal structures of the junction box can be observed by
                                                   5

installers when installing the top cover 3 and the bottom cover 4, thereby facilitating installation by
the installers.
     Further, please refer to FIG. 1, the top cover 3 is further provided with two mounting holes,
configured to fix the top cover 3 on a wall. The mounting holes can be screw holes or holes of
other forms.
     Further, please refer to FIGS. 2-3, a fixing structure configured to fix each wire is arranged
between every two adjacent partitions 12. After the wires are mounted between adjacent partitions,
the wires are fixed by the fixing structures, thereby effectively preventing the wires from being
loosened.
     The aforementioned embodiments are only preferred embodiments of the present application,
and are not intended to limit the present application. Any modification, equivalent replacement,
improvement, and so on, which are made within the spirit and the principle of the present
application, should be included in the protection scope of the present application.
