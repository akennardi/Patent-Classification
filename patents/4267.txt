         APPLICATIONS
[0001]          The present application claims divisional status from AU patent application
<removed-apn> filed 27 July 2016 and which in turn claims divisional status from AU
patent application 2012214267 filed 10 February 2012
[0002]          The present invention is generally related to side by side all terrain
vehicles.
     2. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0003]           Generally, all terrain vehicles ("ATVs") and utility vehicles ("UVs") are used
to carry one or two passengers and a small amount of cargo over a variety of terrains.
Due to increasing recreational interest in side by side vehicles, such as those used for
trail riding, recreational use, and cargo hauling have entered the market place.
[0004]           Most side by side vehicles include seating for two to three passengers.
Side-by-side vehicles, in which the driver and passenger are seated beside each other
on laterally spaced apart seats, have become popular because of the ability to allow the
passenger to share the driver's viewpoint and riding experience instead of being
positioned behind the driver. Two styles of vehicle are known in the marketplace; a first
sportive version is known where the driver sits low in the vehicle, and one such vehicle
is shown in US patent 7,819,220 (and counterpart EP2057060), the subject matter of
which is incorporated herein by reference. The second version has the driver seated
higher in the vehicle, and one such vehicle is shown in US patent application publication
number 20090301830, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.
     3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
