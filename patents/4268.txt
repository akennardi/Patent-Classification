                                         ABSTRACT
Briefly, in accordance with one or more embodiments, a user equipment (UE) is configured
to connect to a network with a multiple access packet data network gateway connection over
a wireless wide area network (WW AN) and a wireless local area network (WLAN), enter an
idle state for WW AN access, receive a page over the WLAN for WW AN service, connect to
the network via the WW AN, and receive the service via the WW AN. A serving gateway (S
GW) is configured to provide a multi-access PDN connection to a UE over a WW AN
simultaneously with a WLAN, receive a service to be provided over WW AN access, page
the UE via the trusted or untrusted WLAN if the UE is in an idle state, connect with the UE
via the WWAN after receiving a response from the UE, and provide the service to the UE via
the WW AN.

10                                          BACKGROUND
           Network based internet protocol flow mobility (NBIFOM) may be utilized by a network
   to provide a single packet data network connection to user equipment (UE) over multiple
   accesses simultaneously.    Network based internet protocol flow mobility allows one or more
   internet protocol (IP) flows to be transferred between different access systems while remaining
15 connected to the user equipment.      For example, a user equipment may be connected to the
   network using wireless wide area network (WWAN) access while simultaneously being
   connected to the network using wireless local area network (WLAN) access. IP flows may be
   provided to the user equipment via either of the WWAN access or the WLAN access, and
   furthermore the IP flows may be transferred from one access system to the other access system.
20 The various IP flows may be routed across different access systems according to operator
   policies, or due to congestion or changes in network conditions, or based on the type of services
   to be provided and the operator that is able to provide a given type of service. Optimizations of
   the operation of the user equipment on the network may be provided by taking advantage of the
   ability to move IP flows among the multiple available access systems seamlessly, without the
25 user experiencing any disruption in service.

                                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION
25        In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a
   thorough understanding of claimed subject matter. However, it will be understood by those
    skilled in the art that claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In
    other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and/or circuits have not been
    described in detail.
30         In the following description and/or claims, the terms coupled and/or connected, along with
    their derivatives, may be used. In particular embodiments, connected may be used to indicate
    that two or more elements are in direct physical and/or electrical contact with each other.
    Coupled may mean that two or more elements are in direct physical and/or electrical contact.
    However, coupled may also mean that two or more elements may not be in direct contact with
35  each other, but yet may still cooperate and/or interact with each other. For example, "coupled"
                                                       2

   via another element or intermediate elements. Finally, the terms "on," "overlying," and "over"
   may be used in the following description and claims. "On," "overlying," and "over" may be used
   to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical contact with each other. However,
 5 "over" may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other. For
   example, "over" may mean that one element is above another element but not contact each other
   and may have another element or elements in between the two elements. Furthermore, the term
   "and/or" may mean "and", it may mean "or", it may mean "exclusive-or", it may mean "one", it
   may mean "some, but not all", it may mean "neither", and/or it may mean "both", although the
10 scope of claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. In the following description and/or
   claims, the terms "comprise" and "include," along with their derivatives, may be used and are
   intended as synonyms for each other.
          Referring now to FIG. 1, a diagram of a network capable of implementing multiple internet
   protocol flows over a wireless wide area network and wireless local area network in accordance
15 with one or more embodiments will be discussed. As shown in FIG. 1, network 100 is capable
   of implementing multiple internet protocol (IP) flows over both wireless wide area network
   (WWAN) 112 access and wireless local area network (WLAN) 114 access.                    In such an
   arrangement, user equipment (UE) 110 may communicate with an evolved Node B (eNB) 116 of
   WWAN 112 simultaneously with gateway 118 of WLAN 114 such as a Trusted Wireless Access
20 Gateway (TWAG) or an Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG). In one or more embodiments,
   UE 110 may connect via eNB 116 and/or gateway 118 to core network 120 which may include,
    for example, a serving gateway (S-GW) 122 and a packet data network gateway (P-GW) or
    (PDN-GW) to receive data and/or services from network 100 including but not limited to data
    and/or services received via internet 126, although the scope of the claimed subject matter is not
25  limited in this respect.
          In one or more embodiments, network 100 may implement Network based IP Flow
    Mobility (NB_IPFOM) in which a single device such as UE 110 has a single packet data
    network (PDN) connection with network 100 using multiple access simultaneously such as
    WWAN 112 access and WLAN 114 access.               By using NBIFOM, network 100 is able to
30  transfer one or more IP flows for a single PDN connection with UE 110 between the multiple
    access devices. For example, a first IP flow 128 may be made to UE 110 via WWAN 112, and a
    second IP flow 130 may be made to UE 110 via WLAN 114. In response to one or more
    triggers, the IP flow via one access device may be transferred to another access device for
    example due network congestion or changes in network conditions.                 In one or more
35  embodiments as will be discussed in further detail, below, power saving for UE 110 may be
                                                     3

   obtained by taking advantage of Network Based IP Flow mobility.          Further details of how
   network 100 may implement IP flow mobility is shown in and described with respect FIG. 2,
   below.
         Referring now to FIG. 2, a diagram of the network of FIG. 1 showing additional details of
 5 internet protocol flows movable within a public data network connection using a trusted (S2a)
   connection or an untrusted (S2b) connection in accordance with one or more embodiments will
   be discussed. As shown in FIG. 2, network 100 may include user equipment (UE) 110 having a
   wireless wide area (WWAN) modem 210 to connect to network 100 using WWAN 112 access,
   and a wireless local area network (WLAN) modem 212 to connect to network 100 using WLAN
10  114 access. WWAN 112 access includes evolved Node B (eNB) 116 and serving gateway (S
   GW) 122. In one or more embodiments, WWAN 112 access may be compliant with a Third
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard including a Long Term Evolution (LTE) or and
   Advanced LTE (A-LTE) standard, although the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited
   in this respect.   Similarly, WLAN 214 includes WLAN routers such as WLAN-A 214 and
15 WLAN-B 216. In one or more embodiments, routers WLAN-A 214 and/or WLAN-B 216 may
   be in compliance with an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard such
   as IEEE 802.11 ac or other IEEE 802.11 standards, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is
   not limited in this respect. Router WLAN-A 214 may include Evolved Packet Data Gateway
   (ePDG) 218 and router WLAN-B 216 may include ePDG 222 to provide access via untrusted
20 (S2b) connections.     Likewise, router WLAN-A 214 may include Trusted Wireless Access
   Gateway (TWAG) 220 and router WLAN-B 216 may include TWAG 224 to provide access via
   trusted (S2a) connections
          In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, network 100 may include multiple operators such as
    operator 226, operator 228, and operator 230. Operator 226 may include packet data network
25  gateway (PDN-GW) 232 and PDN-GW 234.               Operator 228 may include PDN-GW 236.
    Operator 230 may include PDG-GW 238. Network 100 may implement Network based IP Flow
    Mobility (NB_IPFOM) over multiple access with UE 110. For example, S-GW 122 may couple
    with PDN-GW 232 of operator 226 and PDN-GW 236 of operator 228 to provide access via
    WWAN 112. Likewise, ePDG 218 may couple with PDN-GW 234 of operator 226 and PDN
30  GW 236 of operator 228 to implement provide access via WLAN 114. TWAG 220 may couple
    with PDN-GW 236 of operator 238 and with Non-Seamless Wireless Local Area Network
    Offload Gateway (NSWO-GW) 240 via an NSWO connection.              In addition, ePDG 222 may
    couple with PDN-GW 236 of operator 228, and TWAG 224 may couple with PDN-GW 238 of
    operator 230 and with NSWO-GW 240 via an NSWO connection. NWSO-GW 240 may allow
35  WLAN 114 traffic to be routed directly to and from Internet 126 without passing through a
                                                    4

   PDN-GW. The operators may provide various IP flows over network 100 by providing various
   services to UE 110 via network 100.      For example, operator 226 may provide Voice over LTE
   (VoLTE) services via VoLTE Access Point Name (APN) gateway 246 connected with PDN-GW
   232. Operator 226 may also provide IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) services via IMS Services
 5 APN gateway 248 connected PDN-GW 235.              Operator 228 may provide Video on Demand
   (VoD) services via VoD Services APN gateway 250 connected with PDN-GW 236. Operator
   230 may provide internet services via Internet APN gateway 252 connected with PDN-GW 238.
   Internet APN gateway 252 also may be connected with the Internet 126 to provide such internet
   services.   Network 100 also may include a Home Access Network Discovery and Selection
10 Function (H-ANDSF) and Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) server 242' to provide
   home operator policies 244 to UE 110 for example to assist UE 110 to discover available radio
   access technologies such as WWAN 112 and WLAN 114 that are available for network 100. A
   method to allow UE 110 to reduce or otherwise optimize power when connected to network 100
   using NBIPFOM is shown in and described with respect to FIG. 3, below.
15        Referring now to FIG. 3, a flow diagram of a method to save power in a user equipment
   that supports network based internet protocol flow mobility in accordance with one or more
   embodiments will be discussed. Although method 300 of FIG. 3 shows a given number of block
   in one particular order, in one or more alternative embodiments, method 300 may include more
   or fewer blocks than shown and/or in various other orders, and the scope of the claimed subject
20 matter is not limited in these respects. In method 300, UE 110 may connect at block 310 over
   both WWAN 112 access and WLAN 114 access using NBIPFOM. At block 312, UE 110 may
   enter an idle mode, such as Evolved Packet System (EPS) Connection Management (ECM) idle
   mode (ECMIDLE) according to a 3GPP standard, for WWAN 112 access. Optionally, at block
    314, UE 110 may enter into a power saving mode (PSM). At block 316, UE 110 may remain
25 connected via WLAN 114 access while in ECMIDLE mode for WWAN 112 access, and
    optionally may remain in PSM. At block 318, a determination may be made whether downlink
    (DL) data or a mobile call, or some other IP service, for UE 110 is available to be received from
    WWAN 112. If no such IP service, data, call, or connection is available or otherwise to be
    received, UE 110 may remain in ECMIDLE mode or in PSM at block 316. If, however, an IP
30  flow service, data, call, or connection is available or present to be received from WWAN 112,
    network 100 may page UE 110 via WLAN 114 at block 320. At block 322, if UE 110 is in PSM
    then UE 110 may wake from PSM, and UE 110 may initiate a service request procedure over
    WWAN 112 access.          At bock 324 UE 110 may then transition to an ECM connected
    (ECMCONNECTED) mode over WWAN access 324 to allow UE to receive the DL data, call,
35  connection, or IP service at block 326.
                                                     5

          Thus, by implementing method 300 for network 100 and UE 110, power utilization by UE
   110 may be reduced or optimized by taking advantage of IP flow Mobility functionality (IFOM)
   for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and/or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) tunneling
   protocol (GTP) based S2a (trusted) and S2b (untrusted) connections over WLAN 114 access.
 5 Such an arrangement may enable simultaneous support of a single packet data network (PDN)
   connection over multiple access, or multi-homed access, and may enable transferring one or
   multiple IP flows belonging to a single PDN connection between different access systems using
   network based protocols GTP/PMIP.          A UE 110 that is NB_IFOM enabled may reduce or
   optimize power by utilizing the connection over WLAN 114 access to page UE 110 for downlink
10 data to avoid paging the UE 1110 over WWAN 112 or 3GPP access when the WWAN 112
   access is in ECMIDLE mode. In response to an indication received over WLAN 114 access,
   UE 110 can directly initiate the service request procedure over WWAN 112 or 3GPP access and
   then transition to ECMCONNECTED mode.
           In one or more additional embodiments, further optimization is feasible if UE 110 supports
15 PSM (Power Saving Mode) mode on WWAN 112 or 3GPP access. In such an arrangement, UE
    110 will be reachable via WLAN 114 access in case of DL data or mobile terminated calls, and
   so on. As a result, UE 110 may enter a more power efficient PSM state and stay in a PSM state
   for longer periods while still being able to be expedited out of PSM state relatively quickly if
   need, as opposed to waiting for expiry of a PSM timer. Further, the mobility management entity
20 (MME) does not need to buffer any DL data if UE 110 is in a PSM state, and the WWAN 112 or
   3GPP system does not need to incur the paging overhead over WWAN 112 or 3GPP access.
    Such power optimization not only may save UE 110 battery power but also may reduce signaling
    load in network 100, for example in WWAN 112 or 3GPP access nodes. In some embodiments,
   paging optimization over WLAN 114 is feasible if UE 110 is NB_IFOM enabled and has a
25 connection over WLAN 114.          If the UE 110 does not support NB_IFOM and if there is no
    connection over WLAN 114, then network 100 optionally may not implement method 300 for
   that UE 110, but optionally may implement method 300 for other UEs 110 that are NB-IFOM
    enabled and connected via WLAN 114. Furthermore, if a given UE 110 is NB-IFOM enabled
    and a given PDN-GW can reach the UE 110, whether or not network 100 implements method
30  300 may be determined by whether or not UE 110 may be reachable over WLAN 114 via
    TWAG or ePDG may depend on whether the WLAN 114 access is trusted (S2a) or untrusted
    (S2b).    It should be noted that these are merely examples of how method 300 may be
    implemented, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects.      A
    method for UE 110 to initiate client based IP flow mobility is shown in and described with
35  respect to FIG. 5, below.
                                                    6

         Referring now to FIG. 4, a diagram of user equipment initiated client based internet
   protocol flow mobility in accordance with one or more embodiments will be discussed.         As
   shown in FIG. 4, various nodes of network 100 may include Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access 410
   such as TWAG of TWAG/ePDG 118 of WLAN 114 or TWAG 220 of WLAN-A 214. Network
 5 nodes also may include Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)
   Terrestrial Radio Access Network (EUTRAN) 412, mobility management entity (MME) 414,
   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Proxy 416, visited Policy and Charging
   Rules Function (vPCRF) 418, Home Subscriber Service and Authentication, Authorization, and
   Accounting (HSS/AAA)        server 420, home PCRF (hPCRF) 422, among others.            For an
10 NB_IFOM enabled UE 110, when adding WWAN 112 access or non-WWAN access, for
   example Trusted non-3GPP IP Access 410, to an existing PDN connection, UE 110 provides an
   indication or establishment cause indicating that the establishment of the PDN connection is for
   NBIFOM in order for network 100 to not disconnect the existing PDN connection from the
   other access. Upon receiving such an indication, PDN-GW 124 establishes and maintains the
15 GTP/PMIP tunnels with both the WWAN 112 (3GPP) access and the non-3GPP access, for
   example TWAG/ePDG 118. UE 110, however, continues to support power saving states, such
   as idle mode and PSM, even in this case when there are no IP flows or traffic over WWAN 112
   (3GPP) access, although NB_IFOM enabled UE 100 may not be entirely disconnected in this
   case.
20        In one or more embodiments, if the inactivity timer at eNB 116 of EUTRAN 412 expires,
   eNB 116 will release the S1 connection between eNB 116 and UE 110, and UE 110 will go into
   IDLE mode. If down link data arrives during IDLE mode, then S-GW 122 will not have any
   downlink General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol (GTP) Tunnel Identifier
   (DL GTP TEID) for this packet as S1 may be released. In such a case, S-GW 122 will send a
25 downlink data notification (DDN) message to mobility management entity (MME) 414, and
   MME 414 will page UE 110 over WWAN 112 (3GPP) access by sending a paging message. If
   the location of UE 110 is not known, UE can be paged in an entire tracking area. This approach,
   however, may lead to extensive use of signaling resources in the WWAN 112 (3GPP) system. In
   addition, UE 110 would need to periodically wake-up for listening to the paging channel thereby
30 consuming power resources.
          To reduce or optimize such consumption of power resources, for an NB_IFOM enabled
   UE 110, if there is at least single IP flow over WLAN 114 for a multi-homed PDN connection,
   WLAN 114 access may be utilized to page the UE 110 instead of using WWAN 112 access to
   page UE 110. Since the IP flow is established over WLAN 114, a combined and/or co-located
35  S-GW and P-GW 120 knows that UE 110 is reachable over WLAN 114 access based on routing
                                                    7

   tables, for example by using the same IP address of UE 110 over WWAN 112 (3GPP) and
   WLAN 114 access. In such an arrangement, combined and/or co-located S-GW P-GW 120 may
   send the new DDN GTP-C message indicating that there is incoming downlink data for UE 110
   over WWAN 112 (3GPP) access. The TWAG of TWAG/ePDG 18 forwards this message to UE
 5 110 using a new Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) Control Plane (WLCP) unicast message
   which is delivered to UE 110. The protocol stack inside UE 110 after receiving this WLCP
   message will initiate a Service Request procedure in response to paging over WWAN 112
   (3GPP) access.     Paging over WLAN 114 access in this scenario may be more efficient than
   paging the UE 110 over WWAN 112 (3GPP) access.           A single unicast message may be sent
10 from the TWAG of TWAG/ePDG 118 to UE 110 in this case.
          If no IP flow is established over WLAN 114 access and if UE 110 is unreachable via
   TWAG, then normal DDN over SIl          followed by paging over SI may be used.      Such an
   optimization provides a realizable benefit for combined and/or co-located S-GW and P-GW 120
   deployments. In general, most current deployments have both S-GW 122 and P-GW 124 co
15 located. Further optimization may be feasible when UE 110 supports PSM mode on WWAN
    112 (3GPP) access. In this case, UE 110 will not be reachable via WWAN 1120 (3GPP) access
   in case of DL data. Network 100 ordinarily would have to wait until the PSM timer expires, and
   UE 110 would not check for paging messages until then.        On the contrary, paging through
   WLAN 114 access allows UE 110 to terminate the PSM timer and come out of PSM mode and
20 thus respond to the incoming call in an expedited manner, which is able to enhance user
   experience.
          Referring now to FIG. 5A and 5B, diagrams of attach and paging of a wireless local area
    network for a network based internet protocol flow mobility enabled user equipment in
    accordance with one or more embodiments will be discussed. FIG. 6A shows the operations
25  involved in adding WLAN 114 access to an existing PDN connection over WWAN 112 access,
    and FIG. 6B shows the steps involved in paging an NBIFOM enabled UE 110 over WLAN 114
    access.   When using S2a interface for trusted WLAN 114, the WLCP protocol may be be
    updated and WLCP Paging Request and WLCP Paging Response messages may be added.
    Similarly, GTP protocol may be updated, and UE Paging Request and UE Paging Response
30  messages may be added. If in case the paging of UE 110 over WLAN 114 fails for any reason,
    network 100 may revert to a default scenario of paging over WWAN 112 (3GPP) access. When
    using an S2b interface for untrusted WLAN 114, the paging notification messages may be, for
    example, based on Internet Keying version 2 (IKEv2) signaling as shown in and described with
    respect to FIG. 5C, below.
35        In FIG. 5B, when S-GW and P-GW 118 receives a downlink data packet and/or control
                                                    8

   signaling for UE 110 known as not user plane connected, that is the S-GW 122 context data
   indicates no downlink user plane TEID, S-GW and P-GW 120 buffers the downlink data packet
   and identifies if UE 110 has another flow belonging to same PDN connection, that is whether UE
   110 has a multi-homed PDN connection. If UE 110 does have another flow, then S-GW 122
 5 sends a DL Data notification to TWAG 220 for paging UE 110. In one or more embodiments, a
   different or new GTP message may be used for this purpose.              For a Proxy Mobile IPv6
   (PMIPv6) based S2a connection, the same message or a different PMIPv6 message may be
   utilized.
          In one or more embodiments, a WLCP Paging Request and a WLCP Paging Response may
10 be optionally may be utilized, as UE 110 is capable of directly responding with a service request
   as shown in FIG. 5B. If combined or co-located S-GW and P-GW 118 does not receive a DDN
   response or failure, S-GW and P-GW 118 may try an Si paging procedure over WWAN 112
   (3GPP) access. Such a service request may occur any time after execution of a WLCP Paging
   Request. In some embodiments, a similar approach may be implemented for Multiple Access
15 PDN Connectivity (MAPCON) situations where UE 110 has two separate PDN connections over
   WWAN 112 (3GPP) access and WLAN 114 access. For S2a connections, a single mode
   connection WLCP may not be used between UE 110 and TWAG 220 so a new protocol or
   message may be provided. It is noted that these are merely examples of multiple access IP flows
   that may be utilized to achieve power saving or optimization for UE 110 connected with network
20  100, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects.
          Referring now to FIG. 5C, a flow diagram of Internet Keying version 2 (IKEv2) based
   paging for untrusted wireless local area network (WLAN) access using an Evolved Packet Data
    Gateway (ePDG) in accordance with one or more embodiments will be discussed. As shown in
   FIG. 5C, ePDG 218 may initiate an IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL request, which includes the
25 paging request to UE 110. The protocol stack inside UE 110 after receiving this Paging Request
    message will initiate a Service Request procedure in response to paging over wireless wide area
    network    (WWAN)      114   or 3GPP access.        In    response,  UE    110 sends    an IKEv2
    INFORMATIONAL response, acknowledging the paging request and specifying an appropriate
    paging response, although the scope of the claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects.
30         Referring now to FIG. 6, a block diagram of an information handling system capable of
    achieving power optimization with network based internet protocol flow mobility in accordance
    with one or more embodiments will be discussed. Information handling system 600 of FIG. 6
