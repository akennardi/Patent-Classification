                                        FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]            The present invention pertains to a one-piece latch attached to a first object that engages
with a catch attached to a second object to latch the first object to the second object. (As used herein,
references to the "present invention" or "invention" relate to exemplary embodiments and not necessarily
to every embodiment encompassed by the appended claims.)            More specifically, the present invention
pertains to a one-piece latch attached to a first object that engages with a catch attached to a second object
to latch the first object to the second object where the latch has a cam portion against which the second
object pushes against as it moves toward the first object, and after clearing the cam portion a hook portion
of the latch automatically engages with the catch to latch the first object with the second object.
                                   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[00031            This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of the art that may be
related to various aspects of the present invention.       The following discussion is intended to provide
information to facilitate a better understanding of the present invention.         Accordingly, it should be
understood that statements in the following discussion are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of
prior art or that anything discussed below (or in any information incorporated herein by reference) form
part of the common general knowledge.
                                                      -1

[00041            In a multitude of instances where a first object and a second object removably attach to
each other, there is a need to securely hold the first object and second object together in certain positions.
For instance, when a step ladder is moved into an open position, it is desired to latch in place a front
portion or platform to a rear portion of the ladder, so the ladder can be maintained in an open or use
position and a user's hand safely climb the stepladder without concern that the stepladder will collapse.
Simple latches are manually moved by a user into place when the first object and second object are in a
desired position. More complex latches have some type of biasing force, such as a spring, incorporated
into them so that the latch automatically latches the first object and second object together without the
user having to manually move the latch whatsoever. The more complex latches with more components
and weight because of the presence of more components, an increase the likelihood of failure in the sense
that there are more components to fail. For certain applications, it would be desirable to have a latch
which automatically biases to latch a first object and a second object when they are brought together.
                                 BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

which engages with the catch attached to the first object that the latch holds in place. The latch comprises
a base portion that is fixed to a rigid surface of the second object. The ladder comprises a pinch flex
portion connected to the base portion and the hook portion. When the pinch flex portion is compressed or
pinch flexed downward to the base portion, the hook portion moves off of the first object, thus releasing
the first object to move away from the second object. When the first object is to be held or latched to the
second object, the first object is moved against a cam portion of the hook portion, pushing the hook
portion back away from the first object until the first object clears the hook of the hook portion,
whereupon the hook portion no longer being restrained by the first object, under a force bias created in
the pinch flex portion by the pinch flex portion being compressed, automatically moves back and catches
or latches the first object to the second object without any spring or other component to create the force
bias. The hook portion and base portion and pinch flex portion all together being one piece.

                             DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[00311            Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to similar or
identical parts throughout the several views, and more specifically to figure 1 thereof, there is shown a
latch 10 for latching a first object 12 with a second object 14. The latch 10 comprises a catch 16 attached
to the first object 12. The latch 10 comprises a hook portion 18 having a hook 20 which engages with the
catch 16 attached to the first object 12 that the latch 10 holds in place. The latch 10 comprises a base
portion 22 that is fixed to a rigid surface of the second object 14. The ladder 48 comprises a pinch flex
portion 24 connected to the base portion 22 and the hook portion 18. When the pinch flex portion 24 is
compressed or pinch flexed downward to the base portion 22, the hook portion 18 moves off of the first
object 12, thus releasing the first object 12 to move away from the second object 14. When the first object
 12 is to be held or latched to the second object 14, the first object 12 is moved against a cam portion 26 of
the hook portion 18, pushing the hook portion 18 back away from the first object 12 until the first object
                                                       -6

 12 clears the hook 20 of the hook portion 18, whereupon the hook portion 18 no longer being restrained
by the first object 12, under a force bias created in the pinch flex portion 24 by the pinch flex portion 24
being compressed, automatically moves back and catches or latches the first object 12 to the second
object 14 without any spring or other component to create the force bias. The hook portion 18 and base
portion 22 and pinch flex portion 24 all together being one continuous piece. The material for the latch
may be a bendable plastic, such as Delrin 127 UV NC010, which is an acetyl resin.
[0032]            The pinch flex portion 24 may have a loop 28 and a free end 30 that together form a U
shape with the base portion 22. The free end 30 extending from the loop 28 which is able to move up and
down and essentially in parallel with the base portion 22. When a compressive force is applied to the free
end 30, the free end 30 moves down towards the base portion 22 pivoting at the loop 28.               The hook
portion 18 may extend outward away from the base portion 22 essentially perpendicularly from the free
end 30.
[00331            The hook portion 18 may include a first element 32 attached to and extending essentially
perpendicularly from the free end 30 outward away from the free end 30, a second element 34 attached at
a connection point 38 to the first element 32 extending essentially perpendicularly from the first element
32 and in parallel with the free end 30, and a third element 36 attached to the second element 34
extending outward at an acute angle away from the second element 34 and back toward the connection
point 38 between the first element 32 in the second element 34 to define a slope 40. The third element 36
may be the cam portion 26 against which the catch 16 pushes back as the first object 12 is moved toward
the second object 14 until the catch 16 moves down the slope 40 and clears the second element 34,
whereupon the second element 34 moves back over the catch 16, the second element 34 and first element
32 forming the hook 20.
[0034]            The first object may be a step 43 attached to a front rail 42 of a ladder 48, as shown in
figures 4 and 5, and the second object may be a cross bar 75 attached to the rear rail 46 of the ladder 48.
Figure 4 shows the ladder 48 in the folded position with the latch 10 engaged with the catch 16, which in
this embodiment is a step 43 attached to the inside of the front rail 42. When the ladder 48 is in the folded
position, the latch 10 on the cross bar 75 attached to the rear rail is aligned with the step 43 attached to the
front rail 42 to latch with the step 43. Figure 5 shows a ladder 48 in the open position for use.

[00351            In regard to figure 4, the stepladder 48 is in the folded position, where the front section
 102 and the rear section 101 are latched together with the latch 10 engaged with the step 43, and the
stepladder 48 is leaning against a wall 121 with the foot 117 of each rail flat or flush with the floor 119 so
the ladder 48 does not slide away from the object. In this leaning position with the ladder 48 in the folded
position, a user can climb the ladder 48. In the folded position, the rear section 101 latched to the front
section 102, is not in contact with the floor 119, so the stepladder 48 essentially acts as an extension
ladder that is leaned against a wall 121. The ladder 48 in the folded position can also lean against other
structures, besides it wall 21, such as planks or corners or poles. See U.S. patent application 15/803,023
incorporated by reference herein. With the rear section 101 latched to the front section 102, the rear
section is securely held in place and does not move about or hang loosely, which could put the ladder 48
in an unstable position while it is leaning against the wall 121 and put the user in a dangerous situation
when the user is standing on steps of the ladder 48.
[00361            The present invention pertains to a method for latching a first object 12 with a second
object 14. The method comprises the steps of compressing a pinch flex portion 24 of a latch 10 downward
toward a base portion 22 of the latch 10 that is fixed to a rigid surface of the second object 14 causing a
hook portion 18 of the latch 10 to move off of a catch 16 attached to the first object 12, thus releasing the
first object 12 to move away from the second object 14. The pinch flex portion 24 connected to the base
portion 22 and the hook portion 18. There is the step of moving the first object 12 away from the second
object 14. There is the step of moving the first object 12 against a cam portion 26 of the hook portion 18,
which pushes the hook portion 18 back away from the first object 12 until the first object 12 clears the
hook 20 of the hook portion 18, whereupon the hook portion 18 no longer being restrained by the first
object 12, under a force bias created in the pinch flex portion 24 by the pinch flex portion 24 being
compressed, automatically moves back and catches or latches the first object 12 to the second object 14
without any spring or other component to create the force bias. The hook portion 18 and base portion 22
and pinch flex portion 24 all together being one continuous piece.

portion 22 that is fixed to a rigid surface of the rear rail 46. The latch 10 comprises a pinch flex portion 24
connected to the base portion 22 and the hook portion 18. When the pinch flex portion 24 is compressed
or pinch flexed downward to the base portion 22, the hook portion 18 moves off of the step 43 of the front
rail 42, thus releasing the front rail 42 to move away from the rear rail 46. When the front rail 42 is to be
held or latched to the rear rail 46, the bottom of the rear flange 77 of the step 43 attached to the front rail
42 is moved against a cam portion 26 of the hook portion 18, pushing the hook portion 18 back away
from the rear flange 77 of the step 43 attached to the front rail 42 until the rear flange 77 of the step 43
clears the hook 20 of the hook portion 18, whereupon the hook portion 18 no longer being restrained by
the step 43 attached to the front rail 42, under a force bias created in the pinch flex portion 24 by the
pinch flex portion 24 being compressed, automatically moves back and catches or latches the rear flange
77 of the step 43 and thus the front rail 42 to the rear rail 46 without any spring or other component to
create the force bias. The hook portion 18 and base portion 22 and pinch flex portion 24 all together
being one continuous piece.

hook portion 18 can be between .75 inches and 3 inches and is preferably about 1 inch. The length of the
base portion 22 can be between 3 inches and 7 inches and is preferably about 4.8 inches. The width of the
base portion 22 can be between .75 inches and 3 inches and is preferably about 1 inch wide. The width of
the free end 30 is about the same with as the base portion and the length of the free end 30 is between 2
inches and 6 inches preferably about 3 inches. The length of the free end should be such that the rivet
receive portions 50 clear the free end 30. The dimensions of the latch 10 may be varied as the
requirements dictate with for instance the thickness changing and the other components changing in the
corresponding amount.
[0041]            The present invention pertains to a ladder 48. The ladder 48 comprises a front section
 102 having a front right rail and a front left rail. The ladder 48 comprises a rear section 101 having a rear
right rail and a rear left rail. The ladder 48 comprises a step 43 attached to the front right rail and front
left rail. The ladder 48 comprises a cross bar 75 attached to the rear right rail and the rear left rail. The
ladder 48 comprises a latch attached to the cross bar 75 and positioned on the cross bar 75 so when the
ladder 48 is in a folded position where the front section 102 is alongside and in parallel with the rear
section 101, the latch latches with the step 43. The latch comprises a hook portion 18 having a hook 20
which engages with the step 43 attached to the front right rail and front left rail that the latch holds in
place. The latch comprises a base portion 22 that is fixed to a rigid surface of the cross bar 75. The latch
comprises a pinch flex portion 24 connected to the base portion 22 and the hook portion 18. When the
pinch flex portion 24 is compressed or pinch flexed downward to the base portion 22, the hook portion 18
moves off of the step 43, thus releasing the front section 102 to move away from the rear section 101,
When the front section 102 is to be held or latched to the rear section 101, the step 43 attached to the front
section 102 is moved against a cam portion 26 of the hook portion 18, pushing the hook portion 18 back
away from the step 43 until the front section 102 clears the hook 20 of the hook portion 18, whereupon
the hook portion 18 no longer being restrained by the step 43. Under a force bias created in the pinch flex
portion 24 by the pinch flex portion 24 being compressed, automatically moves back and catches or

latches the step 43 and thus the front section 102 to the rear section 101 without any spring or other
component to create the force bias. The latch is one piece.
[0042]            The present invention pertains to a method for using a step ladder 48.           The method
comprises the steps of moving a pinch flex latch attached to a cross bar 75 of a rear section 101 of the
stepladder so a cam surface of a cam portion 26 of the pinch flex latch contacts a front edge of a striker 71
attached to a step 43 of a front section 102 of the stepladder, which moves the cam portion 26 aside so the
cam portion 26 clears the front edge of the striker 71 and the hook 20 of the pinch flex latch latches with
the striker 71 so the front section 102 and rear section 101 are latched together. There is the step of
pressing on a pinch flex portion 24 of the pinch flex latch to move the hook 20 so the hook 20 clears the
striker 71. There is the step of moving the front and rear sections 102, 101 apart after the hook 20 clears
the striker 71.
[00431            Referring to figures 10-14, in another embodiment, the base 22 is attached to a crossbar
75 that is a flat plate of a rear section 101 of a ladder 48. Preferably, a striker 71 is attached to the rear
flange 77 of the step 43. The step 43 essentially has a C shaped cross-section having a roughly flat center
portion 78 with the front flange 79 and rear flange 77 extending essentially perpendicularly down from
the center portion 78 with the center portion 78 disposed between the front and rear flanges.
[0044]            The striker 71 has a bottom 80 that is riveted to the rear flange 77. Extending from the
bottom 80 is a right solid wall 81 and a left solid wall 82 in spaced relation from the right solid wall 81.
There is a front wall 83 having a rectangular shaped window 84 and a Z shaped ceiling 85. The ceiling 85
and the front wall 83 are attached to the right and left walls. In this embodiment, the third element 36 of
the latch 10 is solid with the slope 40 and a back surface 51 that extends from the first element 32, with
the volume 39 between the back surface 51 and the slope 40 being solid. The alternative design of the
latch 10 with the cam portion solid is shown in figure 15. Figures 15-19 show overhead, front, underside,
right, left and perspective views of the striker.
[0045]            In operation, as the rear section 101 of the ladder 48 is brought together with the front
section 102, the slope 40 strikes a first slope portion 53 of the ceiling 85 of the striker 71. As the front and
rear sections move closer together, the slope 40 and the first sloped surface 53 push against each other
and move each other aside as the slope 40 slides along the first sloped surface 53 until the slope 40 clears
                                                      -11

the first sloped surface 53, whereupon the second element 34 of the hook 20 moves up alongside a
straight stem 55 of the ceiling 85 of the striker 71, and engages with the stem 55. The stem 55 acts as a
catch 16. The first sloped surface 53 extends at an acute angle upwards from the bottom 63 of the stem
55. The angle of the first sloped surface 53 and the slope 40 essentially correspond. Similarly, when the
second element 34 is adjacent and in parallel with the stem 55, the slope 40 essentially lines with and
conforms with a second sloped surface 57, whose angle is basically the same as the angle of the slope 40,
so there is essentially no or little space between them when the ladder 48 is in the closed position. The
second sloped surface 57 extends angularly downward from a top 61 of the stem 55 while the first sloped
portion 53 extends angularly upwards from the bottom 63 of the stem 55.
[00461            By having the right and left solid walls preventing access to any space between them and
the slope 40 and second sloped portion 57 being in conformance, any chance of a finger getting access to
such space is eliminated; or an object accidentally catching on the cam portion 26 and accidentally
opening and releasing the latch, resulting in the front section and rear section opening up, is eliminated.
Figure 20 shows the cam portion being solid of this embodiment. At least 30 lbs. of force is required to
pull apart the front and rear sections and overcome the latch, if the latch is not pressed down under normal
operation to allow separation of the front and rear sections.
[0047]            In yet another alternative, the rear flange 77 may have a hole through which the hook
portion of the latch fits in, with the top of the hole engaging with the hook portion, similar to the step
bottom edge, as described above. For that matter, any edge of the hole could be used to latch the hook
portion to, in which case the hook portion would be rotated to align with the desired edge of the hole
chosen.
[00481            Although the invention has been described in detail in the foregoing embodiments for the
purpose of illustration, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that variations
can be made therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention
except as it may be described by the following claims.
