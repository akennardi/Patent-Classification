number 61/708,793, filed October 2, 2012, U.S. provisional patent application serial number

                                          BACKGROUND
[0002]          Proper functioning of the central nervous system is essential in any animal.
Damage to the brain in particular, such as through an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, can have
dramatic and potentially deadly effects. One obstacle to treatment or prevention of brain
damaging events is the blood brain barrier, which is a collection of tight junctions between
neighboring capillary endothelial cells of the brain. These junctions prevent most substances
from crossing unless they are either highly lipophilic or specifically transported across the blood
brain barrier. As a result, it is extremely difficult to administer therapeutics via traditionally
preferred routes, such as through an intravenous or subcutaneous administration and observe a
therapeutic effect in the brain.
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0003]          The present invention provides, among other things, methods and compositions
for treating brain conditions including, but not limited to: stroke, vascular dementia, and
traumatic brain injury. As described in the Examples section below, the present invention is, in
part, based on the surprising discovery that systemic administration, such as subcutaneous
administration, of an angiotensin (1-7) peptide (e.g., PanCyte), results in improvement of
neurological and motor function in a rat model of ischemic stroke. Prior to the present invention,
it was believed that angiotensin(1-7) would not cross the blood brain barrier and thus had to be
administered intracerebrovascularly (ICV) or using complex methods such as infection of
hematopoietic stem cells, which are capable of crossing the blood brain barrier, with a lentivirus
that causes overexpression of Ang(1-7). Mecca et al., Cerebroprotection by Angiotensin-(1-7) in
Endothelin-1-Induced Ischaemic Stroke, (2011) Exp Physiol. 2011 96(10):1084-1096. No one

had shown that administration of an angiotensin (1-7) peptide or a non-peptidic Angiotensin-(1
7) agonist via a systemic (for example, either a subcutaneous or intravenous) route could result in
therapeutic levels reaching the brain and, in particular, damaged brain tissue.
[0004]          In some embodiments, the invention provides methods of treating a brain
condition including administering to a subject suffering from or susceptible to a brain condition
an angiotensin (1-7) peptide via systemic administration. In some embodiments, systemic
administration suitable for the present invention is intravenous administration. In some
embodiments, systemic administration suitable for the present invention is subcutaneous
administration. In some embodiments, systemic administration suitable for the present invention
is oral administration. In some embodiments, systemic administration suitable for the present
invention does not include intracerebroventricular administration. In some embodiments, the
brain condition is selected from stroke, vascular dementia, and traumatic brain injury. In some
embodiments, the stroke is ischemic stroke. In some embodiments, the stroke is hemorrhagic
stroke.
[00051          In some embodiments, the angiotensin (1-7) peptide is administered via
continuous infusion. In some embodiments, the angiotensin (1-7) peptide is administered at an
administration interval. For example, the angiotensin (1-7) peptide may be administered three
times a day, twice a day, once per day, twice per week, once per week, three times per month,
twice per month, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once every four weeks, once a
month, once every two months, once every three months, once every four months, once every
five months, once every six months, at an irregular interval.
[0006]          It is contemplated that various embodiments may use different amounts of
angiotensin (1-7) peptide. In some embodiments, the angiotensin (1-7) peptide is administered at
an effective dose ranging from about 1-1,000 gg/kg/day (e.g., ranging from about 1-900
gg/kg/day, 1-800 gg/kg/day, 1-700 gg/kg/day, 1-600 gg/kg/day, 1-500 gg/kg/day, 1-400

[00071            It is also contemplated that various angiotensin (1-7) peptides may be used in
various embodiments. In some embodiments, the angiotensin (1-7) peptide comprises the
naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7) amino acid sequence of Asp1 -Arg2-Val3 -Tyr4 -Ile'-His6_
Pro7 (SEQ ID NO:1).
[0008]            In some embodiments, the angiotensin (1-7) peptide is a functional equivalent of
SEQ ID NO: 1. In some embodiments, the functional equivalent is a linear peptide. In some
embodiments, the linear peptide comprises a sequence that includes at least four, at least five, or
at least six amino acids from the seven amino acids that appear in the naturally-occurring
Angiotensin (1-7), wherein the at least four, five or six amino acids maintain their relative
positions as they appear in the naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7). In some embodiments, the
linear peptide contains 4-25 amino acids. In some embodiments, the linear peptide is a fragment
of the naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7). In some embodiments, the linear peptide contains
amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions in the naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7).
In some embodiments, the linear peptide has an amino acid sequence of Asp -Arg2 -Val3-Ser 4
Ile -His 6 -Cys 7 (SEQ ID NO:6).
[0009]            In some embodiments, the functional equivalent is a cyclic peptide. In some
embodiments, the cyclic peptide comprises a linkage between amino acids. In some
                                                                                       4    7.
embodiments, the linkage is located at residues corresponding to positions Tyr4 and Pro in
naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7).      In some embodiments, the linkage is a thioether bridge.
In some embodiments, the cyclic peptide comprises an amino acid sequence otherwise identical
to the naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7) amino acid sequence of Asp1 -Arg2-Val-Tyr 4 -Ile 5
His -Pro7 (SEQ ID NO: 1). In some embodiments, the cyclic peptide comprises a norleucine
(Nle) replacing position Val3 in naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7). In some embodiments,
the cyclic peptide is a 4,7-cyclized angiotensin (1-7) with the following formula Asp'-Arg 2-Val3

                                            DEFINITIONS
[0028]           In order for the present invention to be more readily understood, certain terms are
first defined below. Additional definitions for the following terms and other terms are set forth
throughout the specification.
[0029]          Animal: As used herein, the term "animal" refers to any member of the animal
kingdom. In some embodiments, "animal" refers to humans, at any stage of development. In
some embodiments, "animal" refers to non-human animals, at any stage of development. In
certain embodiments, the non-human animal is a mammal (e.g., a rodent, a mouse, a rat, a rabbit,
a monkey, a dog, a cat, a sheep, cattle, a primate, and/or a pig). In some embodiments, animals
include, but are not limited to, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects, and/or worms.
In some embodiments, an animal may be a transgenic animal, genetically-engineered animal,
and/or a clone.
[0030]          Approximately or about: As used herein, the term "approximately" or "about," as
applied to one or more values of interest, refers to a value that is similar to a stated reference
value. In certain embodiments, the term "approximately" or "about" refers to a range of values
that fall within 25%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 11%, 10%,9%,8%,
7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less in either direction (greater than or less than) of the stated
reference value unless otherwise stated or otherwise evident from the context (except where such
number would exceed 100% of a possible value).
[0031]          Biologically active: As used herein, the phrase "biologically active" refers to a
characteristic of any agent that has activity in a biological system, and particularly in an
organism. For instance, an agent that, when administered to an organism, has a biological effect
on that organism, is considered to be biologically active. In particular embodiments, where a
peptide is biologically active, a portion of that peptide that shares at least one biological activity
of the peptide is typically referred to as a "biologically active" portion. In certain embodiments,
                                                   7

      WO 2014/055591                                                            PCT/US2013/062969
a peptide has no intrinsic biological activity but that inhibits the effects of one or more naturally
occurring angiotensin compounds is considered to be biologically active.
[0032]          Brain Condition - as used herein, a "brain condition" is any disease, disorder or
event that results in damage and/or dysfunction of at least a portion of a subject's brain. Non
limiting examples of brain conditions include: stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), vascular
dementia, and traumatic brain injury.
[0033]           Carrieror diluent: As used herein, the terms "carrier" and "diluent" refers to a
pharmaceutically acceptable (e.g., safe and non-toxic for administration to a human) carrier or
diluting substance useful for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation. Exemplary
diluents include sterile water, bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), a pH buffered solution
(e.g. phosphate-buffered saline), sterile saline solution, Ringer's solution or dextrose solution.
[0034]          Dosageform: As used herein, the terms "dosage form" and "unit dosage form"
refer to a physically discrete unit of a therapeutic agent for the patient to be treated. Each unit
contains a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic
effect. It will be understood, however, that the total dosage of the composition will be decided
by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment.
[00351          Dosing regimen: A "dosing regimen" (or "therapeutic regimen"), as that term is
used herein, is a set of unit doses (typically more than one) that are administered individually to a
subject, typically separated by periods of time. In some embodiments, a given therapeutic agent
has a recommended dosing regimen, which may involve one or more doses. In some
embodiments, a dosing regimen comprises a plurality of doses each of which are separated from
one another by a time period of the same length; in some embodiments, a dosing regime
comprises a plurality of doses and at least two different time periods separating individual doses.
In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is administered continuously over a predetermined
period. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is administered once a day (QD) or twice a
day (BID).
[0036]          Functionalequivalent or derivative: As used herein, the term "functional
equivalent" or "functional derivative" denotes, in the context of a functional derivative of an
amino acid sequence, a molecule that retains a biological activity (either function or structural)
that is substantially similar to that of the original sequence. A functional derivative or equivalent
                                                    8

may be a natural derivative or is prepared synthetically. Exemplary functional derivatives
include amino acid sequences having substitutions, deletions, or additions of one or more amino
acids, provided that the biological activity of the protein is conserved. The substituting amino
acid desirably has chemico-physical properties which are similar to that of the substituted amino
acid. Desirable similar chemico-physical properties include, similarities in charge, bulkiness,
hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and the like.
[00371           Improve, increase,or reduce: As used herein, the terms "improve," "increase" or
"reduce," or grammatical equivalents, indicate values that are relative to a baseline measurement,
such as a measurement in the same individual prior to initiation of the treatment described
herein, or a measurement in a control subject (or multiple control subject) in the absence of the
treatment described herein. A "control subject" is a subject afflicted with the same form of
disease as the subject being treated, who is about the same age as the subject being treated.
[00381           In vitro: As used herein, the term "in vitro" refers to events that occur in an
artificial environment, e.g., in a test tube or reaction vessel, in cell culture, etc., rather than within
a multi-cellular organism.
[00391           In vivo: As used herein, the term "in vivo" refers to events that occur within a
multi-cellular organism, such as a human and a non-human animal. In the context of cell-based
systems, the term may be used to refer to events that occur within a living cell (as opposed to, for
example, in vitro systems).
[0040]           Isolated: As used herein, the term "isolated" refers to a substance and/or entity
that has been (1) separated from at least some of the components with which it was associated
when initially produced (whether in nature and/or in an experimental setting), and/or (2)
produced, prepared, and/or manufactured by the hand of man. Isolated substances and/or entities
may be separated from at least about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about
60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 98%, about 99%, substantially
100%, or 100% of the other components with which they were initially associated. In some
embodiments, isolated agents are more than about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 91%,
about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%,
substantially 100%, or 100% pure. As used herein, a substance is "pure" if it is substantially free

of other components. As used herein, the term "isolated cell" refers to a cell not contained in a
multi-cellular organism.
[0041]          Prevent: As used herein, the term "prevent" or "prevention", when used in
connection with the occurrence of a disease, disorder, and/or condition, refers to reducing the
risk of developing the disease, disorder and/or condition. See the definition of "risk."
[0042]          Polypeptide: The term "polypeptide" as used herein refers a sequential chain of
amino acids linked together via peptide bonds. The term is used to refer to an amino acid chain
of any length, but one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the term is not limited to
lengthy chains and can refer to a minimal chain comprising two amino acids linked together via a
peptide bond. As is known to those skilled in the art, polypeptides may be processed and/or
modified.
[00431          Protein: The term "protein" as used herein refers to one or more polypeptides that
function as a discrete unit. If a single polypeptide is the discrete functioning unit and does not
require permanent or temporary physical association with other polypeptides in order to form the
discrete functioning unit, the terms "polypeptide" and "protein" may be used interchangeably. If
the discrete functional unit is comprised of more than one polypeptide that physically associate
with one another, the term "protein" refers to the multiple polypeptides that are physically
coupled and function together as the discrete unit.
[0044]          Risk: As will be understood from context, a "risk" of a disease, disorder, and/or
condition comprises a likelihood that a particular individual will develop a disease, disorder,
and/or condition (e.g., stroke). In some embodiments, risk is expressed as a percentage. In some
embodiments, risk is from 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 up to 100%.
In some embodiments risk is expressed as a risk relative to a risk associated with a reference
sample or group of reference samples. In some embodiments, a reference sample or group of
reference samples have a known risk of a disease, disorder, condition and/or event (e.g., stroke).
In some embodiments a reference sample or group of reference samples are from individuals
comparable to a particular individual. In some embodiments, relative risk is 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, or more.
[00451          Stability: As used herein, the term "stable" refers to the ability of the therapeutic
agent to maintain its therapeutic efficacy (e.g., all or the majority of its intended biological
                                                  10

     WO 2014/055591                                                            PCT/US2013/062969
activity and/or physiochemical integrity) over extended periods of time. The stability of a
therapeutic agent, and the capability of the pharmaceutical composition to maintain stability of
such therapeutic agent, may be assessed over extended periods of time (e.g., for at least 1, 3, 6,
12, 18, 24, 30, 36 months or more). In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions
described herein have been formulated such that they are capable of stabilizing, or alternatively
slowing or preventing the degradation, of one or more therapeutic agents formulated therewith.
In the context of a formulation a stable formulation is one in which the therapeutic agent therein
essentially retains its physical and/or chemical integrity and biological activity upon storage and
during processes (such as freeze/thaw, mechanical mixing and lyophilization).
[00461          Subject: As used herein, the term "subject" refers to a human or any non-human
animal (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, cattle, swine, sheep, horse or primate). A human
includes pre- and post-natal forms. In many embodiments, a subject is a human being. A subject
can be a patient, which refers to a human presenting to a medical provider for diagnosis or
treatment of a disease. The term "subject" is used herein interchangeably with "individual" or
"patient." A subject can be afflicted with or is susceptible to a disease or disorder but may or
may not display symptoms of the disease or disorder.
[00471          Substantially: As used herein, the term "substantially" refers to the qualitative
condition of exhibiting total or near-total extent or degree of a characteristic or property of
interest. One of ordinary skill in the biological arts will understand that biological and chemical
phenomena rarely, if ever, go to completion and/or proceed to completeness or achieve or avoid
an absolute result. The term "substantially" is therefore used herein to capture the potential lack
of completeness inherent in many biological and chemical phenomena.
[0048]          Sufferingfrom: An individual who is "suffering from" a disease, disorder, and/or
condition has been diagnosed with or displays one or more symptoms of the disease, disorder,
and/or condition.
[0049]          Susceptible to: An individual who is "susceptible to" a disease, disorder, and/or
condition has not been diagnosed with the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some
embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition may not
exhibit symptoms of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an
individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, condition, or event (for example, ischemic
                                                   11

      WO 2014/055591                                                           PCT/US2013/062969
stroke) may be characterized by one or more of the following: (1) a genetic mutation associated
with development of the disease, disorder, and/or condition; (2) a genetic polymorphism
associated with development of the disease, disorder, and/or condition; (3) increased and/or
decreased expression and/or activity of a protein associated with the disease, disorder, and/or
condition; (4) habits and/or lifestyles associated with development of the disease, disorder,
condition, and/or event (5) having undergone, planning to undergo, or requiring a transplant. In
some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition will
develop the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is
susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition will not develop the disease, disorder, and/or
condition.
[00501           Therapeuticallyeffective amount: As used herein, the term "therapeutically
effective amount" of a therapeutic agent means an amount that is sufficient, when administered
to a subject suffering from or susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition, to treat,
diagnose, prevent, and/or delay the onset of the symptom(s) of the disease, disorder, and/or
condition. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a therapeutically
effective amount is typically administered via a dosing regimen comprising at least one unit
dose.
[00511           Treating: As used herein, the term "treat," "treatment," or "treating" refers to any
method used to partially or completely alleviate, ameliorate, relieve, inhibit, prevent, delay onset
of, reduce severity of and/or reduce incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a
particular disease, disorder, and/or condition. Treatment may be administered to a subject who
does not exhibit signs of a disease and/or exhibits only early signs of the disease for the purpose
of decreasing the risk of developing pathology associated with the disease.
                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS
[0052]           The present invention provides, among other things, improved compositions and
methods for treating or reducing the risk of brain conditions resulting from damage to or disorder
of brain tissue.
[0053]           Various aspects of the invention are described in detail in the following sections.
The use of sections is not meant to limit the invention. Each section can apply to any aspect of
the invention. In this application, the use of "or" means "and/or" unless stated otherwise.
                                                  12

     WO 2014/055591                                                           PCT/US2013/062969
Brain Conditions
                Stroke
[0054]          The brain is highly vulnerable to a disturbance in its oxygen supply. Anoxia and
ischemia lasting only a few seconds can cause symptoms and if the condition persists for
minutes, they can cause irreversible neuronal damage. Accordingly, stroke is a prominent cause
of serious, long-term disability and a leading cause of death in the United States. Stroke is also a
significant burden on the medical industry, with total health costs for disability due to stroke
being estimated at approximately $53 billion annually.
[00551          There are two types of stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke
involves an obstruction in one or more blood vessels that supply blood to brain tissue, for
example, occlusion resulting from atherosclerotic thrombii, or embolism. Ischemic stroke
(cerebral ischemia) represent approximately 88% of all strokes, making ischemic stroke one of
the most common types of cerebrovascular injury. Ischemic conditions in the brain quickly lead
to neuronal death, often leading to permanent sensorimotor deficits. A hemorrhagic stroke is
defined herein as the accumulation of blood anywhere within the cranial vault. Hemorrhagic
strokes may result from many causes, including injury resulting from an expanding hematoma,
which can disrupt or distort tissue.
[00561          A major barrier in the treatment of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke is
delivery of a therapeutic that will reach affected tissue. Given the effectiveness of the blood
brain barrier, few compounds are capable of crossing into and affecting cerebral tissue.
Previously, delivery of compounds such as angiotensin (1-7), had to be made using
intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery. Surprisingly, embodiments of the present invention,
including the exemplary angiotensin (1-7) peptides described below, are able to cross the blood
brain barrier without complex delivery systems such as modified stem cells or the like. Rather,
in some embodiments, angiotensin (1-7) peptides may be delivered via intravenous or
subcutaneous routes.
                 Vascular Dementia
[00571          Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia, behind
Alzheimer's Disease. Vascular dementia may result from problems with blood supply in the
                                                 13

      WO 2014/055591                                                           PCT/US2013/062969
brain, such as those caused by ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or from other causes that lead to
development of lesions in the brain. Other causes of vascular dementia include cerebral amyloid
angiopathy, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, or cardiovascular disease. Dementia
resulting from one or more strokes is also known as "single-infarct dementia" or "multi-infarct
dementia," depending upon the root cause.
[00581          Treatment of vascular dementia has primarily focused on the prevention of further
cerebrovascular lesions through use of antiplatelet drugs and life style changes (alteration of diet,
cessation of smoking, etc). Cholinesterase inhibitors such as galantamine have also been
explored for use in this clinical scenario, but this type of treatment is concerned with
maintenance of acetylcholine function in the brain, and not recovery or generation of an
improved and sustained blood supply. Thus, embodiments of the present invention represent a
novel intravenous and subcutaneous therapy targeted to improving the underlying causes of the
disease rather than management of symptoms or maximization of remaining tissue resources.
                TraumaticBrain Injury
[00591          Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a form of acquired brain injury, occurs when a
sudden trauma causes damage to the brain. TBI can result when the head suddenly and violently
hits an object (or vice versa), or when an object pierces the skull and enters brain tissue.
 Symptoms of a TBI can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the extent of the damage to
the brain. A person with a mild TBI may remain conscious or may experience a loss of
consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache,
confusion, lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste
in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, a change in sleep patterns, behavioral or mood changes, and
trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. A person with a moderate or severe
TBI may show these same symptoms, but may also have a headache that gets worse or does not
go away, repeated vomiting or nausea, convulsions or seizures, an inability to awaken from
sleep, dilation of one or both pupils of the eyes, slurred speech, weakness or numbness in the
extremities, loss of coordination, and increased confusion, restlessness, or agitation.
[00601          Treatments for TBI focus primarily on preventing further injury or complications.
Primary concerns in treating TBI include insuring proper oxygen supply to the brain and the rest
of the body, maintaining adequate blood flow, and controlling blood pressure. Often, the
                                                  14

primary treatment a TBI sufferer receives post-stabilization is rehabilitation that involves
individually tailored treatment programs in the areas of physical therapy, occupational therapy,
speech/language therapy, psychology/psychiatry, and social support. Embodiments of the
present invention provide a novel treatment for these patients.
Angiotensin (1-7) peptides
[0061]            As used herein, the term "angiotensin (1-7) peptide" refers to both naturally
occurring Angiotensin (1-7) and any functional equivalent, analogue or derivative of naturally
occurring Angiotensin (1-7). As used herein, "peptide" and "polypeptide" are interchangeable
terms and refer to two or more amino acids bound together by a peptide bond. As used herein,
the terms "peptide" and "polypeptide" include both linear and cyclic peptide. The terms
"angiotensin-(1-7)", "Angiotensin-(1-7)", and "Ang-(1-7)" are used interchangeably.
                 Naturally-occurringAngiotensin (1-7)
[0062]           Naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7) (also referred to as Ang-(1-7)) is a seven
amino acid peptide shown below:
                  Asp -Arg 2-Val3 -Tyr 4 -Ile 5 -His6 -Pro7 (SEQ ID NO:1)
It is part of the renin-angiotensin system and is converted from a precursor, also known as
Angiotensinogen, which is an a-2-globulin that is produced constitutively and released into the
circulation mainly by the liver. Angiotensinogen is a member of the serpin family and also
known as renin substrate. Human angiotensinogen is 452 amino acids long, but other species
have angiotensinogen of varying sizes. Typically, the first 12 amino acids are the most
important for angiotensin activity:
                  Asp -Arg 2-Val 3-Tyr 4 -Ile 5 -His 6-Pro 7-Phes-His 9 -Leul 0 -Val '-Ile 12
                                                                                              (SEQ ID NO:3)
[0063]            Different types of angiotensin may be formed by the action of various enzymes.
For example, Angiotensin (1-7) is generated by action of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE 2).
[0064]            Ang-(1-7) is an endogenous ligand for Mas receptors. Mas receptors are G
protein coupled receptor containing seven transmembrane spanning regions. As used herein, the
term "angiotensin-(1-7) receptor' encompasses the G Protein-Coupled Mas Receptors.
                                                        15

[00651            As used herein, the term "naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7)" includes any
Angiotensin (1-7) peptide purified from natural sources and any recombinantly produced or
chemically synthesized peptides that have an amino acid sequence identical to that of the
naturally-occurring Angiotensin (1-7).
                  Functionalequivalents, analogs or derivatives ofAng-(1-7)
[0066]            In some embodiments, an angiotensin (1-7) peptide suitable for the present
invention is a functional equivalent of naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). As used herein, a
functional equivalent of naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) refers to any peptide that shares amino
acid sequence identity to the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) and retain substantially the same or
similar activity as the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). For example, in some embodiments, a
functional equivalent of naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) described herein has pro-angiogenic
activity as determined using methods described herein or known in the art, or an activity such as
nitric oxide release, vasodilation, improved endothelial function, antidiuresis, or one of the other
properties discussed herein, that positively impacts angiogenesis. In some embodiments, a
functional equivalent of naturally-occurring Ang-(1 -7) described herein can bind to or activate an
angiotensin-(1-7) receptor (e.g., the G protein-coupled Mas receptor) as determined using
various assays described herein or known in the art. In some embodiments, a functional
equivalent of Ang-(1-7) is also referred to as an angiotensin (1-7) analogue or derivative, or
functional derivative.
[00671            Typically, a functional equivalent of angiotensin (1-7) shares amino acid
sequence similarity to the naturally-occurring Ang-(1 -7). In some embodiments, a functional
equivalent of Ang-(1-7) according to the invention contains a sequence that includes at least 3
(e.g., at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7) amino acids from the seven amino acids that
appear in the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7), wherein the at least 3 (e.g., at least 4, at least 5, at
least 6, or at least 7) amino acids maintain their relative positions and/or spacing as they appear
in the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7).
[0068]            In some embodiments, a functional equivalent of Ang-(1-7) also encompass any
peptide that contain a sequence at least 50% (e.g., at least 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%) identical to
the amino acid sequence of naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). Percentage of amino acid sequence
identity can be determined by alignment of amino acid sequences. Alignment of amino acid
                                                        16

      WO 2014/055591                                                           PCT/US2013/062969
sequences can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using
publicly available computer software such as BLAST, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR)
software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring
alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of
the sequences being compared. Preferably, the WU-BLAST-2 software is used to determine
amino acid sequence identity (Altschul et al., Methods in Enzymology 266, 460-480 (1996);
http://blast.wustl/edu/blast/README.html). WU-BLAST-2 uses several search parameters,
most of which are set to the default values. The adjustable parameters are set with the following
values: overlap span=1, overlap fraction=O. 125, word threshold (T)= 11. HSP score (S) and HSP
S2 parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself, depending upon the
composition of the particular sequence, however, the minimum values may be adjusted and are
set as indicated above.
[0069]          In some embodiments, a functional equivalent, analogue or derivative of Ang-(1
7) is a fragment of the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). In some embodiments, a functional
equivalent, analogue or derivative of Ang-(1-7) contains amino acid substitutions, deletions
and/or insertions in the naturally-occurring Ang-(1 -7). Ang-(1 -7) functional equivalents,
analogues or derivatives can be made by altering the amino acid sequences by substitutions,
additions, and/or deletions. For example, one or more amino acid residues within the sequence
of the naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) (SEQ ID NO:1) can be substituted by another amino acid of
a similar polarity, which acts as a functional equivalent, resulting in a silent alteration.
Substitution for an amino acid within the sequence may be selected from other members of the
class to which the amino acid belongs. For example, the positively charged (basic) amino acids
include arginine, lysine, and histidine. The nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include leucine,
isoleucine, alanine, phenylalanine, valine, proline, tryptophane, and methionine. The uncharged
polar amino acids include serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine. The
negatively charged (acid) amino acids include glutamic acid and aspartic acid. The amino acid
glycine may be included in either the nonpolar amino acid family or the uncharged (neutral)
polar amino acid family. Substitutions made within a family of amino acids are generally
understood to be conservative substitutions. For example, the amino acid sequence of a peptide
inhibitor can be modified or substituted.

[00701          Examples of Ang-(1-7) functional equivalents, analogues and derivatives are
described in the section entitled "Exemplary Angiotensin(1-7) Peptides" below.
[00711          An angiotensin-(1-7) peptide can be of any length. In some embodiments, an
angiotensin-(1-7) peptide according to the present invention can contain, for example, from 4-25
amino acids (e.g., 4-20, 4-15, 4-14, 4-13, 4-12, 4-11, 4-10, 4-9, 4-8, 4-7 amino acids). In some
embodiments, the linear peptide contains 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23, 24, or 25 amino acids.
[0072]          In some embodiments, an angiotensin-(1-7) peptide contains one or more
modifications to increase protease resistance, serum stability and/or bioavailability. In some
embodiments, suitable modifications are selected from pegylation, acetylation, glycosylation,
biotinylation, substitution with D-amino acid and/or un-natural amino acid, and/or cyclization of
the peptide.
[0073]          As used herein, the term "amino acid," in its broadest sense, refers to any
compound and/or substance that can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain. In certain
embodiments, an amino acid has the general structure H2N-C(H)(R)-COOH. In certain
embodiments, an amino acid is a naturally-occurring amino acid. In certain embodiments, an
amino acid is a synthetic or un-natural amino acid (e.g., a,a-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl
amino acids); in some embodiments, an amino acid is a d-amino acid; in certain embodiments,
an amino acid is an 1-amino acid. "Standard amino acid" refers to any of the twenty standard
amino acids commonly found in naturally occurring peptides including both 1- and d- amino
acids which are both incorporated in peptides in nature. "Nonstandard" or "unconventional
amino acid" refers to any amino acid, other than the standard amino acids, regardless of whether
it is prepared synthetically or obtained from a natural source. As used herein, "synthetic or un
natural amino acid" encompasses chemically modified amino acids, including but not limited to
salts, amino acid derivatives (such as amides), and/or substitutions. Amino acids, including
carboxy- and/or amino-terminal amino acids in peptides, can be modified by methylation,
amidation, acetylation, and/or substitution with other chemical groups that can change the
peptide's circulating half-life without adversely affecting its activity. Examples of
unconventional or un-natural amino acids include, but are not limited to, citrulline, ornithine,
norleucine, norvaline, 4-(E)-butenyl-4(R)-methyl-N-methylthreonine (MeBmt), N-methyl

leucine (MeLeu), aminoisobutyric acid, statine, and N-methyl-alanine (MeAla). Amino acids
may participate in a disulfide bond. The term "amino acid" is used interchangeably with "amino
acid residue," and may refer to a free amino acid and/or to an amino acid residue of a peptide. It
will be apparent from the context in which the term is used whether it refers to a free amino acid
or a residue of a peptide.
[0074]          In certain embodiments, angiotensin-(1-7) peptides contain one or more L-amino
acids, D-amino acids, and/or un-natural amino acids.
[00751          In addition to peptides containing only naturally occurring amino acids,
peptidomimetics or peptide analogs are also encompassed by the present invention. Peptide
analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties
analogous to those of the template peptide. The non-peptide compounds are termed "peptide
mimetics" or peptidomimetics (Fauchere et al., Infect. Immun. 54:283-287 (1986); Evans et al., J.
Med. Chem. 30:1229-1239 (1987)). Peptide mimetics that are structurally related to
therapeutically useful peptides and may be used to produce an equivalent or enhanced
therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to the
paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biological or pharmacological activity) such
as naturally-occurring receptor-binding polypeptides, but have one or more peptide linkages
optionally replaced by linkages such as -CH 2NH-, -CH 2 S-, -CH 2 -CH 2-, -CH=CH- (cis and
trans), -CH 2 SO-, -CH(OH)CH 2-, -COCH 2- etc., by methods well known in the art (Spatola,
Peptide Backbone Modifications, Vega Data, 1(3):267 (1983); Spatola et al. Life Sci. 38:1243
1249 (1986); Hudson et al. Int. J. Pept. Res. 14:177-185 (1979); and Weinstein. B., 1983,
Chemistry and Biochemistry, of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins, Weinstein eds, Marcel
Dekker, New-York,). Such peptide mimetics may have significant advantages over naturally
occurring polypeptides including more economical production, greater chemical stability,
enhanced pharmacological properties (e.g., half-life, absorption, potency, efficiency, etc.),
reduced antigenicity and others.
[0076]          Ang-(1-7) peptides also include other types of peptide derivatives containing
additional chemical moieties not normally part of the peptide, provided that the derivative retains
the desired functional activity of the peptide. Examples of such derivatives include (1) N-acyl
derivatives of the amino terminal or of another free amino group, wherein the acyl group may be

an alkanoyl group (e.g., acetyl, hexanoyl, octanoyl) an aroyl group (e.g., benzoyl) or a blocking
group such as F-moc (fluorenylmethyl-O-CO-); (2) esters of the carboxy terminal or of another
free carboxy or hydroxyl group; (3) amide of the carboxy-terminal or of another free carboxyl
group produced by reaction with ammonia or with a suitable amine; (4) phosphorylated
derivatives; (5) derivatives conjugated to an antibody or other biological ligand and other types
of derivatives; and (6) derivatives conjugated to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain.
[00771          Ang-(1-7) peptides may be obtained by any method of peptide synthesis known to
those skilled in the art, including synthetic (e.g., exclusive solid phase synthesis, partial solid
phase synthesis, fragment condensation, classical solution synthesis, native-chemical ligation)
and recombinant techniques. For example, the peptides or peptides derivatives can be obtained
by solid phase peptide synthesis, which in brief, consist of coupling the carboxyl group of the C
terminal amino acid to a resin (e.g., benzhydrylamine resin, chloromethylated resin,
hydroxymethyl resin) and successively adding N-alpha protected amino acids. The protecting
groups may be any such groups known in the art. Before each new amino acid is added to the
growing chain, the protecting group of the previous amino acid added to the chain is removed.
Such solid phase synthesis has been disclosed, for example, by Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:
2149 (1964); Vale et al., Science 213:1394-1397 (1981), in U.S. Patent Numbers 4, 305, 872 and

amino acids to appropriate resins is also well known in the art and has been disclosed in U.S.

[0078]          Unless defined otherwise, the scientific and technological terms and nomenclature
used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill to
which this invention pertains. Generally, the procedures of cell cultures, infection, molecular
biology methods and the like are common methods used in the art. Such standard techniques can

[00791           During any process of the preparation of an Ang-(1-7) peptide, it may be desirable
to protect sensitive reactive groups on any of the molecule concerned. This may be achieved by
means of conventional protecting groups such as those described in Protective Groups In
Organic Synthesis by T.W. Greene & P.G.M. Wuts, 1991, John Wiley and Sons, New-York; and
Peptides: chemistry and Biology by Sewald and Jakubke, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Wheinheim p.142.
For example, alpha amino protecting groups include acyl type protecting groups (e.g.,
trifluoroacetyl, formyl, acetyl), aliphatic urethane protecting groups (e.g., t-butyloxycarbonyl
(BOC), cyclohexyloxycarbonyl), aromatic urethane type protecting groups (e.g., fluorenyl-9
methoxy-carbonyl (Fmoc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), Cbz derivatives) and alkyl type protecting
groups (e.g., triphenyl methyl, benzyl). The amino acids side chain protecting groups include
benzyl (for Thr and Ser), Cbz (Tyr, Thr, Ser, Arg, Lys), methyl ethyl, cyclohexyl (Asp, His), Boc
(Arg, His, Cys) etc. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage
using methods known in the art.
[0080]           Further, Ang-(1-7) peptides may be synthesized according to the FMOC protocol
in an organic phase with protective groups. Desirably, the peptides are purified with a yield of
70% with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C18 chromatography column and
eluted with an acetonitrile gradient of 10-60%. The molecular weight of a peptide can be
verified by mass spectrometry (reviewed in Fields, G.B. "Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis"
Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 289, Academic Press, 1997).
[0081]           Alternatively, Ang-(1-7) peptides may be prepared in recombinant systems using,
for example, polynucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptides. It is understood that a
polypeptide may contain more than one of the above-described modifications within the same
polypeptide.
[0082]           While peptides may be effective in eliciting a biological activity in vitro, their
effectiveness in vivo might be reduced by the presence of proteases. Serum proteases have
specific substrate requirements. The substrate must have both L-amino acids and peptide bonds
for cleavage. Furthermore, exopeptidases, which represent the most prominent component of the
protease activity in serum, usually act on the first peptide bond of the peptide and require a free
                                                  21

      WO 2014/055591                                                         PCT/US2013/062969
N-terminus (Powell et al., Pharm.Res. 10:1268-1273 (1993)). In light of this, it is often
advantageous to use modified versions of peptides. The modified peptides retain the structural
characteristics of the original L-amino acid peptides that confer the desired biological activity of
Ang-(1-7) but are advantageously not readily susceptible to cleavage by protease and/or
exopeptidases.
[0083]          Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with
D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more
stable peptides. Thus, a peptide derivative or peptidomimetic of the present invention may be all
L, all D or mixed D, L peptide, in either forward or reverse order. The presence of an N-terminal
or C-terminal D-amino acid increases the in vivo stability of a peptide since peptidases cannot
utilize a D-amino acid as a substrate (Powell et al., Pharm.Res. 10:1268-1273 (1993)). Reverse
D peptides are peptides containing D-amino acids, arranged in a reverse sequence relative to a
peptide containing L-amino acids. Thus, the C-terminal residue of an L-amino acid peptide
becomes N-terminal for the D-amino acid peptide, and so forth. Reverse D-peptides retain the
same secondary conformation and therefore similar activity, as the L-amino acid peptides, but
are more resistant to enzymatic degradation in vitro and in vivo, and thus can have greater
therapeutic efficacy than the original peptide (Brady and Dodson, Nature 368:692-693 (1994);
Jameson et al., Nature 368:744-746 (1994)). Similarly, a reverse-L peptide may be generated
using standard methods where the C-terminus of the parent peptide becomes takes the place of
the N-terminus of the reverse-L peptide. It is contemplated that reverse L-peptides of L-amino
acid peptides that do not have significant secondary structure (e.g., short peptides) retain the
same spacing and conformation of the side chains of the L-amino acid peptide and therefore
often have the similar activity as the original L-amino acid peptide. Moreover, a reverse peptide
may contain a combination of L- and D-amino acids. The spacing between amino acids and the
conformation of the side chains may be retained resulting in similar activity as the original L
amino acid peptide.
[0084]          Another effective approach to confer resistance to peptidases acting on the N
terminal or C-terminal residues of a peptide is to add chemical groups at the peptide termini,
such that the modified peptide is no longer a substrate for the peptidase. One such chemical
modification is glycosylation of the peptides at either or both termini. Certain chemical
                                                 22

      WO 2014/055591                                                         PCT/US2013/062969
modifications, in particular N-terminal glycosylation, have been shown to increase the stability
of peptides in human serum (Powell et al., Pharm.Res. 10:1268-1273 (1993)).       Other chemical
modifications which enhance serum stability include, but are not limited to, the addition of an N
terminal alkyl group, consisting of a lower alkyl of from one to twenty carbons, such as an acetyl
group, and/or the addition of a C-terminal amide or substituted amide group. In particular, the
present invention includes modified peptides consisting of peptides bearing an N-terminal acetyl
group and/or a C-terminal amide group.
[00851          Substitution of non-naturally-occurring amino acids for natural amino acids in a
subsequence of the peptides can also confer resistance to proteolysis. Such a substitution can,
for instance, confer resistance to proteolysis by exopeptidases acting on the N-terminus without
affecting biological activity. Examples of non-naturally-occurring amino acids include a,a
disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, C-a-methyl amino acids, p-amino acids, and p
methyl amino acids. Amino acids analogs useful in the present invention may include, but are
not limited to, p-alanine, norvaline, norleucine, 4-aminobutyric acid, orithine, hydroxyproline,
sarcosine, citrulline, cysteic acid, cyclohexylalanine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 6-aminohexanoic
acid, t-butylglycine, phenylglycine, o-phosphoserine, N-acetyl seine, N-formylmethionine, 3
methylhistidine and other unconventional amino acids. Furthermore, the synthesis of peptides
with non-naturally-occurring amino acids is routine in the art.
[0086]          In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a
substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods well known in
the art (Rizo and Gierasch, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:387-418 (1992)). For example, constrained
peptides may be generated by adding cysteine residues capable of forming disulfide bridges and,
thereby, resulting in a cyclic peptide. Cyclic peptides can be constructed to have no free N- or
C-termini. Accordingly, they are not susceptible to proteolysis by exopeptidases, although they
may be susceptible to endopeptidases, which do not cleave at peptide termini. The amino acid
sequences of the peptides with N-terminal or C-terminal D-amino acids and of the cyclic
peptides are usually identical to the sequences of the peptides to which they correspond, except
for the presence of N-terminal or C-terminal D-amino acid residue, or their circular structure,
respectively.

[00871           In some embodiments, a functional equivalent, analogue or derivative of
naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7) is a cyclic peptide. As used herein, a cyclic peptide has an
intramolecular covalent bond between two non-adjacent residues. The intramolecular bond may
be a backbone to backbone, side-chain to backbone or side-chain to side-chain bond (i.e.,
terminal functional groups of a linear peptide and/or side-chain functional groups of a terminal or
interior residue may be linked to achieve cyclization). Typical intramolecular bonds include
disulfide, amide and thioether bonds. A variety of means for cyclizing polypeptides are well
known in the art, as are many other modifications that can be made to such peptides. For a
general discussion, see International Patent Publication Nos. WO 01/53331 and WO 98/02452,
the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Such cyclic bonds and other
modifications can also be applied to the cyclic peptides and derivative compounds of this
invention.
[0088]           Cyclic peptides as described herein may comprise residues of L-amino acids, D
amino acids, or any combination thereof. Amino acids may be from natural or non-natural
sources, provided that at least one amino group and at least one carboxyl group are present in the
molecule; a- and P-amino acids are generally preferred. Cyclic peptides may also contain one or
more rare amino acids (such as 4-hydroxyproline or hydroxylysine), organic acids or amides
and/or derivatives of common amino acids, such as amino acids having the C-terminal
carboxylate esterified (e.g., benzyl, methyl or ethyl ester) or amidated and/or having
modifications of the N-terminal amino group (e.g., acetylation or alkoxycarbonylation), with or
without any of a wide variety of side-chain modifications and/or substitutions (e.g., methylation,
benzylation, t-butylation, tosylation, alkoxycarbonylation, and the like). Suitable derivatives
include amino acids having an N-acetyl group (such that the amino group that represents the N
terminus of the linear peptide prior to cyclization is acetylated) and/or a C-terminal amide group
(i.e., the carboxy terminus of the linear peptide prior to cyclization is amidated). Residues other
than common amino acids that may be present with a cyclic peptide include, but are not limited
to, penicillamine, 3, -tetramethylene cysteine, 0,-pentamethylene cysteine, 0
mercaptopropionic acid, 3, -pentamethylene- -mercaptopropionic acid, 2-mercaptobenzene, 2
mercaptoaniline, 2-mercaptoproline, ornithine, diaminobutyric acid, a-aminoadipic acid, m
aminomethylbenzoic acid and a,-diaminopropionic acid.

[00891          Following synthesis of a linear peptide, with or without N-acetylation and/or C
amidation, cyclization may be achieved by any of a variety of techniques well known in the art.
Within one embodiment, a bond may be generated between reactive amino acid side chains. For
example, a disulfide bridge may be formed from a linear peptide comprising two thiol-containing
residues by oxidizing the peptide using any of a variety of methods. Within one such method, air
oxidation of thiols can generate disulfide linkages over a period of several days using either basic
or neutral aqueous media. The peptide is used in high dilution to minimize aggregation and
intermolecular side reactions. Alternatively, strong oxidizing agents such as I2 and K 3Fe(CN) 6
can be used to form disulfide linkages. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that care
must be taken not to oxidize the sensitive side chains of Met, Tyr, Trp or His. Within further
embodiments, cyclization may be achieved by amide bond formation. For example, a peptide
bond may be formed between terminal functional groups (i.e., the amino and carboxy termini of
a linear peptide prior to cyclization). Within another such embodiment, the linear peptide
comprises a D-amino acid. Alternatively, cyclization may be accomplished by linking one
terminus and a residue side chain or using two side chains, with or without an N-terminal acetyl
group and/or a C-terminal amide. Residues capable of forming a lactam bond include lysine,
ornithine (Om), a-amino adipic acid, m-aminomethylbenzoic acid, U,-diaminopropionic acid,
glutamate or aspartate. Methods for forming amide bonds are generally well known in the art.
Within one such method, carbodiimide-mediated lactam formation can be accomplished by
reaction of the carboxylic acid with DCC, DIC, ED AC or DCCI, resulting in the formation of an
O-acylurea that can be reacted immediately with the free amino group to complete the
cyclization. Alternatively, cyclization can be performed using the azide method, in which a
reactive azide intermediate is generated from an alkyl ester via a hydrazide. Alternatively,
cyclization can be accomplished using activated esters. The presence of electron withdrawing
substituents on the alkoxy carbon of esters increases their susceptibility to aminolysis. The high
reactivity of esters of p-nitrophenol, N-hydroxy compounds and polyhalogenated phenols has
made these "active esters" useful in the synthesis of amide bonds. Within a further embodiment,
a thioether linkage may be formed between the side chain of a thiol-containing residue and an
appropriately derivatized a-amino acid. By way of example, a lysine side chain can be coupled
to bromoacetic acid through the carbodiimide coupling method (DCC, EDAC) and then reacted
with the side chain of any of the thiol containing residues mentioned above to form a thioether

dibromoethane and diisopropylamine in DMF.

[0103]             In some embodiments, a linear angiotensin (1-7) peptide is a peptide with an

                   Exemplary Cyclic Angiotensin (1-7) Peptides
[0104]             In certain aspects, the invention provides a cyclic angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7))
peptide analog comprising a linkage, such as between the side chains of amino acids
corresponding to positions Tyr4 and Pro7 in Ang. These peptide analogs typically comprise 7

amino acid residues, but can also include a cleavable sequence. As discussed in greater detail
below, the invention includes fragments and analogs where one or more amino acids are
substituted by another amino acid (including fragments). One example of such an analog is
Asp 1-Arg2-Val3-Ser4-le5-His6-Cys7 (SEQ ID NO: 6), wherein a linkage is formed between
Ser4 and Cys7.
[01051          Although the following section describes aspects of the invention in terms of a
thioether bond linking residues at the 4- and 7-positions, it should be understood that other
linkages (as described above) could replace the thioether bridge and that other residues could be
cyclized. A thioether bridge is also referred to as a monosulfide bridge or, in the case of Ala-S
Ala, as a lanthionine bridge. Thioether bridge-containing peptides can be formed by two amino
acids having one of the following formulas:

C1 -C6 alkyl, C 1-C 4 alkyl) or an aralkyl group, where the alkyl and aralkyl groups are optionally
substituted with one or more halogen, -OH or -NRR' groups (where R and R' are independently
-H or C 1-C 4 alkyl). In certain embodiments, R , R2, R', R4 , R5 and R6 are each independently -H
or -CH 3 , such where all are -H.
[0107]           In certain embodiments, the invention provides an Ang analog or derivative
comprising a thioether bridge according to formula (I). Typically, R1, R2, R3 and R 4 are
independently selected from -H and -CH 3 . Peptides comprising a thioether bridge according to
formula (I) can be produced, for example, by lantibiotic enzymes or by sulfur extrusion of a
disulfide. In one example, the disulfide from which the sulfur is extruded can be formed by D
cysteine in position 4 and L-cysteine in position 7 or by D-cysteine in position 4 and L
penicillamine in position 7 (see, e.g., Galande, Trent and Spatola (2003) Biopolymers 71, 534
551).
[0108]           In other embodiments, the linkage of the two amino acids can be the bridges
depicted in Formula (II) or Formula (III). Peptides comprising a thioether bridge according to
Formula (II) can be made, for example, by sulfur extrusion of a disulfide formed by D
homocysteine in position 4 and L-cysteine in position 7. Similarly, peptides comprising a

[0109]          As discussed above, the Ang analogs and derivatives of the invention vary in
length and amino acid composition. The Ang analogs and derivatives of the invention preferably
have biological activity or are an inactive precursor molecule that can be proteolytically
activated (such as how angiotensin(I), with 10 amino acids, is converted to active fragments by
cleavage of 2 amino acids). The size of an Ang analog or derivative can vary but is typically
between from about 5 to 10 amino acids, as long as the "core" pentameric segment comprising
the 3-7 Nle-thioether-ring structure is encompassed. The amino acid sequence of an analog or
derivative of the invention can vary, typically provided that it is biologically active or can
become proteolytically activated. Biological activity of an analog or derivative can be
determined using methods known in the art, including radioligand binding studies, in vitro cell
activation assays and in vivo experiments. See, for example, Godeny and Sayeski, (2006) Am. J.
Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 291:C1297-1307; Sarr et al., Cardiovasc.Res. (2006) 71:794-802; and
Koziarz et al., (1933) Gen. Pharmacol.24:705- 713.
[0110]          Ang analogs and derivatives where only the length of the peptide is varied include
the following:
[0111]          a 4,7-cyclized analog designated [Cyc 4 -7]Ang-(1-7), which is derived from natural
Ang-(1-7) (Asp1 -Arg 2-Val3 -Cyc4 -Ile 5-His6 -Cyc 7, SEQ ID NO:7).
        a 4,7-cyclized analog designated [Nle 3 , Cyc 4 -7]Ang-(1-10), which is derived from natural
Angiotensin I (Ang-( 1-10)) (Asp1 -Arg2-Nle 3-Cyc4 -Ile 5-His6-Cyc 7 -Phes-His 9 -Leu 0, SEQ ID
NO:8);
        a 4,7-cyclized analog designated [Nle 3 , Cyc 4 -7]Ang-(1-8), which is derived from natural
Angiotensin II (Ang-(1-8)) (Asp1 -Arg2 -Nle3 -Cyc4-Ile 5 -His6 -Cyc 7-Phe , SEQ ID NO:9);
        a 4,7-cyclised analog designated [Nle3 , Cyc 4-7]Ang-(2-8), which is derived from natural
Angiotensin III (Ang-(2-8)) (Arg2 -Nle3 -Cyc 4-Ile 5-His 6 -Cyc 7 -Phe , SEQ ID NO: 10);
        a 4,7-cyclised analog designated [Nle3 , Cyc 4-7]Ang-(3-8), which is derived from natural
Angiotensin IV (Ang-(3-8)) (Nle3-Cyc 4-Ile 5-His 6-Cyc 7-Phe', SEQ ID NO: 11);
                                                   30

      WO 2014/055591                                                           PCT/US2013/062969
         a 4,7-cyclised analog designated [Nle3 , Cyc 4-7]Ang-(1-7) derived from natural Ang-(1-7)
(Asp -Arg 2-Nle3 -Cyc 4-Ile 5 -His6 -Cyc 7 , SEQ ID NO: 12); and
         a 4,7-cyclised analog designated [Nle3 , Cyc 4-7]Ang-(1-9) derived from natural Ang-(1-9)
(Asp-Arg2 -Nle3 -Cyc 4-Ile 5 -His6 -Cyc 7-Phes-His 9, SEQ ID NO:13).
These analogs can have one of the thioether bridges shown in Formulae (I)-(III) as the Cyc 4 -7
moiety, for example, where Cyc 4 and Cyc 7 are represented by Formula (I), such as where R 1-R4
are each -H or -CH 3, typically -H.
[0112]           As compared to the amino acid sequence of the natural angiotensin peptide, the
amino acids at positions 4 and 7 of the Cyc 4 -7 analog are modified to allow introduction of the
thioether-ring structures shown above. In addition to the length of the Ang analogs, the amino
acids at positions other than 3, 4 and 7 can be the same or different from the naturally-occurring
peptide, typically provided that the analog retains a biological function. For analogs of inactive
precursors, like [Cyc 4 -7]Ang-(1-10), biological function refers to one or both of an analog's
susceptibility to angiotensin-converting enzymes that can cleave it to a biologically active
fragment (e.g. Ang-(1-8) or Ang-(1-7)) or the biological activity of the fragment itself. In certain
embodiments, an Ang analog or derivative of the invention has no intrinsic function but inhibits
the effects of one or more naturally-occurring angiotensin compounds.
[0113]           In certain embodiments, an Ang analog of the invention is represented by
Formula (IV):
[0114]           Xaa -Xaa 2-Xaa 3 -Cyc 4-Xaa 5-Xaa6-Cyc  7 (IV, SEQ ID NO: 14)
[01151           Xaal is any amino acid, but typically a negatively-charged amino acid such as Glu
or Asp, more typically Asp.
[0116]           Xaa2is a positively-charged amino acid such as Arg or Lys, typically Arg.
[01171           Xaa is an aliphatic amino acid, such as Leu, Ile or Val, typically Val.
[0118]           Cyc 4 forms a thioether bridge in conjunction with Cyc 7 . Cyc 4 can be a D
stereoisomer and/or a L-stereoisomer, typically a D-stereoisomer. Examples of Cyc 4 (taken with
Cyc 7) are shown in Formulas (I), (II) and (III). Typically, the R groups in Formulae (I), (II) and
(III) are -H or -CH 3, especially -H.

[0119]             Xaa5 is an aliphatic amino acid, such as Leu, Ile or Val, typically Ile.
[0120]             Xaa6 is His.
[0121]             Cyc 7 forms a thioether bridge in conjunction with Cyc 4 , such as in Formula (I),
(II) or (III). Cyc 7 can be a D-stereoisomer and/or a L-stereoisomer, typically a L-stereoisomer.
Examples of Cyc 7 (taken with Cyc 4 ) are shown in Formulas (I), (II), (III) and (IV). Typically,
the R groups in FormulaeFormulas (I), (II),) and (III) and (IV) are -H or -CH 3 , especially -H.
[0122]             In certain embodiments, one or more of Xaa1 -Xaa6 (excluding Cyc 4 and Cyc 7) is
identical to the corresponding amino acid in naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). In certain such
embodiments, all but one or two of Xaa1 -Xaa6 are identical to the corresponding amino acid in
naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7). In other embodiments, all of Xaa1 -Xaa6 are identical to the
corresponding amino acid in naturally-occurring Ang-(1-7).
[0123]             In certain embodiments, Cyc 4 and Cyc 7 are independently selected from Abu (2
aminobutyric acid) and Ala (alanine), where Ala is present in at least one position. Thus, cyclic
analogs can have a thioether linkage formed by -Ala 4-S-Ala 7- (Formula (I), where R 1-R4 are each
-H); -Ala 4-S-Abu 7 - (Formula (I): R1 -R3 are -H and R4 is -CH 3) or -Abu 4 -S-Ala 7- (Formula (I): R 1 ,
R3  and R4 are -H and R 2 is -CH 3 ). Specific examples of cyclic analogs comprise a -Abu 4-S
Ala7 - or -Ala 4 -S-Ala7 - linkage.
[0124]             In certain embodiments, the invention provides an Ang-(1-7) analog with a
thioether-bridge between position 4 and position 7 having the amino acid sequence Asp -Arg2 _
Val3 -Abu 4 -Ile 5 -His6 -Ala 7 (SEQ ID NO: 15) or the amino acid sequence Asp'-Arg 2-Val-Ala 4 -Ile 5
His -Ala7 (SEQ ID NO: 16), which are represented by the following structural diagrams:

Ang (1-7) Receptor Agonists
[0142]           In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of treating brain
conditions including administering to a subject who is suffering from or susceptible to one or
more brain conditions an angiotensin (1-7) receptor agonist. As used herein, the term
"angiotensin-(1-7) receptor agonist" encompasses any molecule that has a positive impact in a
function of an angiotensin-(1-7) receptor, in particular, the G-protein coupled Mas receptor. In
some embodiments, an angiotensin-(1-7) receptor agonist directly or indirectly enhances,
strengthens, activates and/or increases an angiotensin-(1-7) receptor (i.e., the Mas receptor)
activity. In some embodiments, an angiotensin-(1-7) receptor agonist directly interacts with an
angiotensin-(1-7) receptor (i.e., the Mas receptor). Such agonists can be peptidic or non-peptidic
including, e.g., proteins, chemical compounds, small molecules, nucleic acids, antibodies, drugs,
ligands, or other agents. In some embodiments, the angiotensin (1-7) receptor agonist is a non
peptidic agonist.
[0143]           An exemplary class of angiotensin-(1-7) receptor agonists are 1-(p
thienylbenzyl)imidazoles. Examples of these non-peptide angiotensin-(1-7) receptor agonists are

[01471           Additional examples of angiotensin-(1-7) receptor agonists are described in U.S.
Patent No. 6,235,766, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.
[0148]           Various angiotensin-(1-7) receptor agonists described above can be present as
pharmaceutically acceptable salts. As used herein, "a pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to
salts that retain the desired activity of the peptide or equivalent compound, but preferably do not
detrimentally affect the activity of the peptide or other component of a system, which uses the
peptide. Examples of such salts are acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example,
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and the like.
Salts may also be formed with organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid,
tartaric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, malic acid,
ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, and the
like. Salts formed from a cationic material may utilize the conjugate base of these inorganic and
organic acids. Salts may also be formed with polyvalent metal cations such as zinc, calcium,
bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel and the like or with an organic
cation formed from N,N'- dibenzylethylenediamine or ethylenediamine, or combinations thereof
(e.g., a zinc tannate salt). The non-toxic, physiologically acceptable salts are preferred.
[0149]           The salts can be formed by conventional means such as by reacting the free acid
or free base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate acid or base in
a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is then
removed in vacuo or by freeze-drying, or by exchanging the cations of an existing salt for
another cation on a suitable ion exchange resin.
[01501           An alkyl group is a straight chained or branched non-aromatic hydrocarbon that is
completely saturated. Typically, a straight chained or branched alkyl group has from 1 to about
20 carbon atoms, preferably from I to about 10. Examples of straight chained and branched
alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl,
hexyl, pentyl and octyl. A C1-C4 straight chained or branched alkyl group is also referred to as a
"lower alkyl" group.
[01511           An alkenyl group is a straight chained or branched non-aromatic hydrocarbon that
is includes one or more double bonds. Typically, a straight chained or branched alkenyl group

has from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to about 10. Examples of straight
chained and branched alkenyl groups include ethenyl, n-propenyl, and n-butenyl.
[0152]            Aromatic (aryl) groups include carbocyclic aromatic groups such as phenyl,
naphthyl, and anthracyl, and heteroaryl groups such as imidazolyl, thienyl, furyl, pyridyl,
pyrimidyl, pyranyl, pyrazolyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazinyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, and tetrazolyl. Aromatic
groups also include fused polycyclic aromatic ring systems in which a carbocyclic aromatic ring
or heteroaryl ring is fused to one or more other heteroaryl rings. Examples include benzothienyl,
benzofuryl, indolyl, quinolinyl, benzothiazole, benzoxazole, benzimidazole, quinolinyl,
isoquinolinyl and isoindolyl.

Formulations
[0154]            In accordance with the methods of the invention, an Ang (1-7) peptide or
angiotensin (1-7) receptor agonist as described herein of the invention can be administered to a
subject alone (e.g., as a purified peptide or compound), or as a component of a composition or
medicament (e.g., in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of the disease), as
described herein. The compositions can be formulated with a physiologically acceptable carrier
or excipient to prepare a pharmaceutical composition. The carrier and composition can be
sterile. The formulation should suit the mode of administration, for example intravenous or
subcutaneous administration. Methods of formulating compositions are known in the art (see,
e.g., Remington's Pharmaceuticals Sciences, 17th Edition, Mack Publishing Co., (Alfonso R.
Gennaro, editor) (1989)).
[01551            Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to water,
salt solutions (e.g., NaCl), saline, buffered saline, alcohols, glycerol, ethanol, gum arabic,
vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, carbohydrates such as lactose,
amylose or starch, sugars such as mannitol, sucrose, or others, dextrose, magnesium stearate,
talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid esters, hydroxymethylcellulose,
polyvinyl pyrolidone, etc., as well as combinations thereof. The pharmaceutical preparations
can, if desired, be mixed with auxiliary agents (e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting
agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, coloring and/or aromatic
substances and the like) which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds or
                                                   40

interference with their activity. In a preferred embodiment, a water-soluble carrier suitable for
intravenous administration is used.
[01561           The composition or medicament, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of
wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. The composition can be a liquid solution,
suspension, emulsion, sustained release formulation, or powder. The composition can also be
formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides.
[01571           The composition or medicament can be formulated in accordance with the routine
procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for administration to human beings. For
example, in a preferred embodiment, a composition for intravenous administration typically is a
solution in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a
solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the
ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as
a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an
ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be
administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile
pharmaceutical grade water, saline or dextrose/water. Where the composition is administered by
injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients
may be mixed prior to administration.
[0158]           An Ang (1-7) peptide or angiotensin (1-7) receptor agonist as described herein
can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those
formed with free amino groups such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic,
oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with free carboxyl groups such as those derived from
sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2
ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.
[01591           An Ang (1-7) peptide or angiotensin (1-7) receptor agonist as described herein (or
a composition or medicament containing an Ang (1-7) peptide or angiotensin (1-7) receptor
agonist described herein) is administered by any appropriate route. In some embodiments, an
Ang (1-7) peptide or angiotensin (1-7) receptor agonist described herein is administered
subcutaneously. As used herein, the term "subcutaneous tissue", is defined as a layer of loose,
irregular connective tissue immediately beneath the skin. For example, the subcutaneous

administration may be performed by injecting a composition into areas including, but not limited
to, thigh region, abdominal region, gluteal region, or scapular region. In some embodiments, an
Ang (1-7) peptide or angiotensin (1-7) receptor agonist described herein is administered
intravenously. Alternatively, an Ang (1-7) peptide or angiotensin (1-7) receptor agonist
described herein (or a composition or medicament containing an Ang (1-7) peptide or
angiotensin (1-7) receptor agonist described herein) can be administered by inhalation,
parenterally, intradermally, transdermally, rectally, or transmucosally. More than one route can
be used concurrently, if desired.
[0160]           In some embodiments, a composition is administered in a therapeutically effective
amount and/or according to a dosing regimen that is correlated with a particular desired outcome
(e.g., with treating or reducing risk for ischemic stroke).
[0161]           Particular doses or amounts to be administered in accordance with the present
invention may vary, for example, depending on the nature and/or extent of the desired outcome,
on particulars of route and/or timing of administration, and/or on one or more characteristics
(e.g., weight, age, personal history, genetic characteristic, lifestyle parameter, severity of cardiac
defect and/or level of risk of cardiac defect, etc., or combinations thereof). Such doses or
amounts can be determined by those of ordinary skill. In some embodiments, an appropriate
dose or amount is determined in accordance with standard clinical techniques. For example, in
some embodiments, an appropriate dose or amount is a dose or amount sufficient to reduce a
disease severity index score by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

embodiments, an appropriate dose or amount is a dose or amount sufficient to reduce a disease
severity index score by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30,
35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100%. Alternatively or additionally, in some
embodiments, an appropriate dose or amount is determined through use of one or more in vitro
or in vivo assays to help identify desirable or optimal dosage ranges or amounts to be
administered.
[0162]           In various embodiments, an Ang (1-7) peptide or angiotensin (1-7) receptor
agonist is administered at a therapeutically effective amount. As used herein, the term
"therapeutically effective amount" is largely determined based on the total amount of the

Generally, a therapeutically effective amount is sufficient to achieve a meaningful benefit to the
subject (e.g., treating, modulating, curing, preventing and/or ameliorating the underlying disease
or condition). In some particular embodiments, appropriate doses or amounts to be administered
may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test
systems.

                                              EXAMPLES
Example 1. Continuous PanCyte Administration
[0172]           Several animal models have been used to study cerebral ischemia in an effort to
understand its pathophysiology and to identify therapeutic strategies for minimizing the severity
of ischemic damage. Focal ischemia brings about localized brain infarction and may be induced
by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). A rat model of MCAO has gained acceptance as a
model for hemispheric infarction in humans. After MCAO, a cortical and striatal infarct with
temporal and spatial evolution occurs within the vascular region supplied by the middle cerebral
artery.
[0173]           In the past several years, ample evidence has been gathered regarding behavioral
assessments in stroke animal studies, including the MCAO rat model of ischemic stroke.
Behavioral improvement is thought to be a reliable parameter for efficacy studies of potential
therapeutics.
[0174]           A desirable treatment for vascular complications of stroke would be a non
invasive means of promoting neovascularization in ischemic tissues. Embodiments of the
present invention provide such a therapeutic treatment. Binding of angiotensin (1-7) peptides on
the cell surface of endothelial cells can rescue those cells from apoptosis, induce their
proliferation, migration, and formation of small blood vessels in vitro.
[01751           In this example, the MCAO rat model was used to evaluate the dose-dependent
efficacy of angiotensin (1-7) peptides, for example, PanCyte, in improving post-occlusion
function as measured by several accepted behavioral evaluations.
[0176]           Animal handling was performed according to guidelines of the National Institute
of Health (NIH) and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care (AAALAC). Animals were housed in polyethylene cages (5/cage) measuring 35 x 30 x 15
cm, with stainless steel top grill facilitating pelleted food and drinking water in plastic bottle;

bedding: steam sterilized clean paddy husk (Harlan, Sani-chip cat#:2018SC+F) was used and
bedding material were changed along with the cage at least twice a week. In this example, a total
of 60 rats were used and each rat weighed approximately 300 grams at study initiation.
[01771           Animals were fed ad libitum a commercial rodent diet (Teklad Certified Global
18% Protein Diet cat #: 106S8216). Animals had free access to acidified drinking water (pH
between 2.5 and 3.5) obtained from the municipality supply according to PharmaSeed's SOP No.
214 (Water System). Animals were housed under standard laboratory conditions, air conditioned
and filtered (HEPA F6/6) with adequate fresh air supply (Minimum 15 air changes/hour).
Animals were kept in a climate controlled environment. Animals were kept within a
temperatures range of approximately 20-24 C with a relative humidity range of 30-70% and a
12 hours light-dark cycle. Animals were inspected on arrival and were inspected daily for any
signs of morbidity or mortality. Animals found in a moribund condition and animals showing
severe pain and enduring signs of severe distress (such as dyspnea, lateral recumbency,
convulsions, plegia or inability to reach food or water) were humanely euthanized.
[0178]           For the purposes of this example, Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO) procedure Day is defined as "Day 1" in this study. On the day of surgery anesthesia
were induced with 4% isoflurane in a mixture of 70% N 2 0 and 30% 02 and maintained with 1.5
2% isoflurane.
[01791           The tMCAO procedures were performed according to the method described R.
Schmid-Elsaesser et al.. Briefly, the right CCA (Common Carotid Artery) was exposed through
a midline neck incision and carefully dissected free from surrounding nerves and fascia - from
its bifurcation to the base of the skull. The occipital artery branches of the ECA (External
Carotid Artery) were then isolated, and these branches were dissected and coagulated. The ECA
was dissected further distally and coagulated along with the terminal lingual and maxillary artery
branches, which was then divided. The ICA (Internal Carotid Artery) was isolated and carefully
separated from the adjacent vagus nerve, and the pterygopalatine artery was ligated close to its
origin with a 5-0 nylon suture (SMI, Belgium). Next, a 4-0 silk suture was tied loosely around
the mobilized ECA stump, and a 4 cm length of 4-0 monofilament nylon suture (the tip of the
suture was blunted by using a flame, and the suture was coated with polylysine, prior to
insertion) was inserted through the proximal ECA into the ICA and thence into the circle of

re-anesthetized, the monofilament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion, the surgical wound was
closed and rats were returned to their cages.
[01801           Animals were subjected to a modified Modified Neurological Rating Scale
(mNRS) at 24 hours post reperfusion. Only animals with an overall score of > 10 are included in
this study. Animals were allocated into the test groups, according to the mNRS results on day 2,
in order to have similar distribution of rats performance between groups. Started on day 2, 24
hours post-surgery, each animal is implanted subcutaneously with osmotic Alzet pump and is
treated by continuous PanCyte administration (2.5mg/ml or 25 mg/ml in PBS; SEQ ID NO:6).

                 Stepping Test (Evaluation at Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 and Day 36)
[0181]           Animals were tested for forelimb akinesia in a stepping test. The animal was held
with its hind limbs fixed with one hand and the forelimb not monitored with the other, while the
unrestrained fore-paw touches a table. The number of adjusting steps were counted while the
animal was moved sideways along the table surface (85 cm in approximately five seconds), in
the forehand & backhand direction for both forelimbs. FIG. 1 shows the results of the stepping
test at days 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36. Four groups were analyzed in this test, a control group
(receiving only PBS for 49 days), a group receiving 50gg/kg PanCyte for 49 days, a group

receiving 500gg/kg PanCyte for 49 days, and a group receiving 50gg/kg PanCyte for 14 days.
The data shows that each group receiving administration of PanCyte enjoyed increased
performance of rats by day 22 as compared to control animals, and that this effect continued
through day 36, with increasing statistical significance. Additionally, the group that was exposed
to 50 gg/kg dose of PanCyte for 49 days performed significantly better than controls on day 15
as well, while the groups exposed to either 500 gg/kg of PanCyte for 49 days or 50 gg/kg
Pancyte for 14 days, while trending toward improvement, did not reach statistically significant
levels at this time point in this particular experiment.
                 Forelimb Placement (Evaluationat Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 and Day 36)
[0182]           The limb placing tests were divided into both forelimb and hindlimb tests. For
the forelimb-placing test, the examiner held the rat close to a tabletop and scored the rat's ability
to place the forelimb on the tabletop in response to whisker, visual, tactile, or proprioceptive
stimulation. Similarly, for the hindlimb placing test, the examiner assessed the rat's ability to
place the hindlimb on the tabletop in response to tactile and proprioceptive stimulation. Separate
sub-scores were obtained for each mode of sensory input and added to give total scores (for the
forelimb placing test: 0  = normal, 12   = maximally impaired; for the hindlimb placing test: 0   =
normal; 6   = maximally impaired). Scores were given in half-point increments as follows:
Forelimb placing test: whisker placing (0-2), visual placing -forward (0-2), -sideways (0-2);
tactile placing -dorsal (0-2), -lateral (0-2); proprioceptive placing (0-2); for a total of 0-12. FIG.
2 shows the results of the forelimb placing test at days 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36. Four groups were
analyzed in this test, a control group (receiving only PBS for 49 days), a group receiving
50gg/kg PanCyte for 49 days, a group receiving 500gg/kg PanCyte for 49 days, and a group
receiving 50gg/kg PanCyte for 14 days. The data shows that each group receiving
administration of PanCyte enjoyed increased performance on this test by day 29 as compared to
control animals, and that this effect continued to day 36. Also, the group exposed to 50gg/kg
Pancyte for 14 days performed significantly better than control animals beginning on day 15,
whereas the other treatment groups, though trending in the same way, did not reach statistical
significance until day 29 in this experiment.

[01831          The rat was held approximately one inch from the base of its tail. It was then
elevated to an inch above a surface of a table. The rat was held in the vertical axis, defined as no
more than 100 to either the left or the right side. A swing was recorded whenever the rat moved
its head out of the vertical axis to either side. Before attempting another swing, the rat had to
return to the vertical position for the next swing to be counted. Twenty (20) total swings were
counted. A normal rat typically has an equal number of swings to either side. Following focal
ischemia, rats tend to swing to the contralateral side (left side in this example). Body swing
scores are expressed as a percentage of rightward over total swings. FIG. 3 shows the results of
the body swing test at days 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36. Four groups were analyzed in this test, a control
group (receiving only PBS for 49 days), a group receiving 50gg/kg PanCyte for 49 days, a group
receiving 500gg/kg PanCyte for 49 days, and a group receiving 50gg/kg PanCyte for 14 days.
The data shows that each group receiving administration of PanCyte enjoyed improved
performance on the test by day 36 as compared to the control group, with the group receiving 50
gg/kg PanCyte for 14 days showed statistical significance beginning on day 29 as compared to
control in this experiment. All treatment groups exhibited a trend toward improved scores
beginning on day 8 as compared to the control group.
                mNRS Evaluation (Evaluationat Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 and Day
36)
[0184]          The Modified Neurological Rating Scale (mNRS) was administered by an
individual who was unaware of the drug/dose given (blind test). The mNRS as administered
allows for neuro-scoring on a scale of 0 to 18 possible points. Animals with higher scores
showed more severe symptoms and disability than lower scoring rats. FIG. 4 shows the results
of the mNRS evaluation at days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36. Four groups were analyzed in this test, a
control group (receiving only PBS for 49 days), a group receiving 50gg/kg PanCyte for 49 days,
a group receiving 500gg/kg PanCyte for 49 days, and a group receiving 50gg/kg PanCyte for 14
days. The data shows that each group receiving administration of PanCyte enjoyed improved
performance on the test by day 29 as compared to the control group. In addition to days 29 and
36, the group receiving 50 gg/kg PanCyte for 49 days showed statistically improved
performance on days 8 and 15, and the group receiving 500 gg/kg PanCyte for 49 days showed
statistically improved performance on day 22 in this experiment.

[0187]          Animals were tested for forelimb akinesia in a stepping test (ST). The animal was
held with its hind limbs fixed with one hand and the forelimb not to be monitored with the other,
while the unrestrained fore-paw touches the table. The number of adjusting steps are counted
while the animal is moved sideways along the table surface (85 cm in approximately five
seconds), in the forehand & backhand direction for both forelimbs. FIG. 5 shows treatment with
TXA127, PanCyte or Linear Pancyte significantly improved the performance of treated rats in all
experimental conditions by Day 21 post-surgery, as compared to the vehicle control condition.
A trend of improvement is observed as early as Day 14 post-surgery. It is of note that although
only 50ug/kg of Linear Pancyte was administered, the results are substantially equivalent to ten
times as much TXA127 or PanCyte.
                Forelimb Placement (EvaluationBefore Operation, Day 14, Day 21, Day 28, Day
35, Day 42 and Day 49)
[0188]          For the forelimb-placing test, the rat was held close to a tabletop and the rat's
ability to place the forelimb on the tabletop in response to whisker, visual, tactile, or
proprioceptive stimulation was scored (0     = normal, 12  = maximally impaired). Scores were
given in half-point increments (see below). Typically, there is a slow and steady recovery of
limb placing behavior during the first month after stroke. FIG. 6 shows that significant
improvement in performance was observed in all treatment conditions, as compared to vehicle
control, beginning on Day 14 and continuing through the duration of the study. It again appears
that the Linear PanCyte group had the best performance, particularly from Day 35 onward,
despite being exposed to a far lower dose of agent than the other experimental groups were.

counted. A normal rat typically has an equal number of swings to either side. Following focal
ischemia, the rat tends to swing to the contralateral side (left side in this case). Body swing
scores are expressed as a percentage of rightward over total swings. Often, there is a
spontaneous partial recovery of body swing scores (toward 50%) during the first month after
stroke. FIG. 7 shows that the 1,000 gg/kg TXA127, TXA Alzet, PanCyte Alzet, 500 gg/kg
PanCyte, and Linear PanCyte groups all showed significant improvement in performance by Day
28, as compared to the vehicle control. The 500 gg/kg TXA127 group did not show significant
results until Day 35. The 1,000 gg/kg TXA127, TXA Alzet, PanCyte Alzet, and Linear PanCyte
groups all showed improvement by Day 21, and all experimental groups showed a trend toward
improvement by Day 14. On Day 49, the TXA 1,000 g/kg, TXA Alzet, and Linear PanCyte
groups each appeared to perform at a near-normal (uninjured) level.
                mNRS Evaluation (EvaluationBefore Operation,Day 1, Day 14, Day 21, Day 28,
Day 35, Day 42 and Day 49)
[0190]          The Modified Neurological Rating Scale (mNRS) was administered by an
individual who was unaware of the drug/dose given (blind test). The mNRS as administered
allows for neuro-scoring on a scale of 0 to 18 possible points. Animals with higher scores
showed more severe symptoms and disability than lower scoring rats. FIG. 8 shows that each
experimental group showed significant improvement in performance by Day 14, as compared to
the vehicle control. The observed increased performance was maintained for the duration of the
study.
[0191]          These results show that TXA127, PanCyte and Linear PanCyte are all strong
therapeutic candidates with the ability to dramatically improve the performance of animals post
stroke. In addition to the performance benefits discussed above, blood flow and blood vessel
diameter was measured using Laser Doppler, according to known protocols, in each non-Alzet
group on Day 50. The results are shown in FIG. 9 and show that animals in all assessed
treatment groups showed significantly increased blood vessel diameter and blood flow compared
to control animals by Day 50. In particular, Linear PanCyte appears to have significantly
improved therapeutic potential even beyond the other effective treatments tested in this example.
These results are particularly surprising since the only difference between PanCyte and Linear
PanCyte appears to be that PanCyte is cyclized, while Linear PanCyte is not. Cyclization of a

peptide is typically thought to allow a peptide to be more effective in vivo by making it more
resistant to protease degradation. Linear PanCyte, however, is almost equally effective at a
lower dose of 50 gg/kg (as compared to 500 gg/kg of PanCyte) in this example.

scores are expressed as a percentage of rightward over total swings. FIG. 12 shows that
treatment with PanCyte or AVE0991 (via oral gavage) showed a significant improvement by day

        mNRS Evaluation (EvaluationBefore Operation,Day 2, Day 15, Day 22, and Day 29)
[01971          The Modified Neurological Rating Scale (mNRS) was administered by an
individual who was unaware of the drug/dose given (blind test). The mNRS as administered
allows for neuro-scoring on a scale of 0 to 18 possible points. Animals with higher scores
showed more severe symptoms and disability than lower scoring rats. FIG. 13 shows
administration of PanCyte and AVE0991 (via oral gavage) resulted in significant improvement
in performance by day 22, while subcutaneously administered AVE0991 trended toward
improvement as compared to vehicle control. By day 29, all treatment groups exhibited
significantly improved performance as compared to vehicle control. All treatment groups
showed a trend toward improvement as early as day 15.
[0198]          This Example shows that AVE0991 is also a strong therapeutic candidate for the
treatment of stroke, providing significant benefit to recovering subjects within 2-3 weeks of
treatment.
