CLEANABLE FILTER
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]     This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2014205286, filed
on 10 January 2014. Australian Patent Application No. 2014205286 is hereby incorporated by
reference in its entirety and for all purposes.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]     The present invention relates to air filtration systems. More particularly, the present
application relates to cleanable filter elements for air filtration systems.
BACKGROUND
[0003]     Air filtration systems typically filter particulate (e.g., dust and other contaminants) out
of dirty air (e.g., from an external environment) to provide clean air to a system. For example,
an automotive air intake system typically includes an air filtration system configured to filter
dirty air from the external environment prior to providing the air to a combustion chamber of the
engine. The filtration may be performed by an air filter element within the filtration system. The
air filter element may include air filter media. The air filter media may be supported in the air
filter element by a frame. The air filter media is configured to trap the particulate contained in
the dirty air as the air flows through the air filter media.
[0004]     As dirty air is filtered through the air filter media, the air filter media loads as
particulate builds within the air filter media and on the surface of the air filter media. As the load
of the air filter media increases, the efficiency of the air filter typically increases. Additionally,
as the load of the air filter media increases, the restriction of air flow through the air filter media
typically increases. At a certain point in the air filter's life, the restriction through the air filter
media becomes too large for the air filtration system to function properly. At or before this
point, the air filter element, including the air filter media, is typically replaced with a new or
refurbished air filter element.
[0005]     The consistent need to replace filter elements within filtration systems has associated
drawbacks. A first drawback is the cost of regularly replacing the filter elements. Replacement

                                                  2
filter elements may be expensive. Additionally, the labor costs of technicians can drive up the
operating costs of the filtration systems. A second drawback is negative environmental impact
associated with the disposal of used filter elements in landfills. A third drawback is the potential
contamination of the filtration systems that may occur when the old filter elements are removed.
For example, a seal may be broken within the air filtration system when the old air filter element
is removed, and prior to installation of the new air filter element, dirty air may travel to the clean
side of the air filtration system. The above drawbacks are driving owners and operators of
filtration systems to request self-cleaning filtration systems, thereby eliminating the need to
replace the filter elements at regular service intervals.
OBJECT
[0005a] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
one or more of the above drawbacks.

                DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS
[0024]     Referring to the figures generally, the various embodiments disclosed herein relate to a
cleanable filter elements within an filter system. The cleanable filter elements are cleanable
without requiring removal from the filter systems. A pressurized air supply may be coupled to
the filter systems. Air from the pressurized air supply may be used to "blow out" or "blow off'
captured and caked on particulate (e.g., dust) from the filter media of the filter element. Air from
the pressurized air supply may drive a vibration mechanism that vibrates the filter element
thereby assisting in dislodging captured and caked on particulate from the filter media of the
filter element. A vacuum may assist in evacuating any dislodged particulate from the region
surrounding the filter media. The evacuated particulate may be ejected into the outside
environment.
[0025]     Referring to FIG. 1, a cross-sectional view of a cleanable air filter 100 is shown
according to an exemplary embodiment. The air filter 100 includes a housing 102 and filter

                                                    7
media 104. The filter media 104 is arranged in a cylindrical manner within the housing 102.
The air filter 100 is configured to filter particulate out of dirty air (e.g., from an external
environment) to provide clean air to another system (e.g., an internal combustion engine system,
a compressor system, a medical system, a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)
system, etc.). Filtering is performed by the filter media 104. As shown in FIG. 1, the filter
media 104 is in an installed position within the housing 102. The filter media 104 may be
removable from the filter housing 102.
[0026]     As shown in FIG. 1, the filter media 104 includes a dirty side 106 and a clean side 108.
The dirty side 106 receives dirty air from the external environment. The air then passes through
the filter media 104 and out the clean side 108. As the air passes from the dirty side 106 to the
clean side 108, the filter media captures particulate 110 contained in the air from the external
environment. The clean air may then be passed out of the opening 112 to the system that
receives the clean air (e.g., an internal combustion engine). A first seal may be positioned
between the filter media 104 and the opening 112 to isolate the dirty side 106 from the clean side
108. A second seal may be positioned between the filter media 104 and the housing 102 (e.g., at
the top of the housing opposite the opening 112) to isolate the dirty side 106 from the clean side
108. The second seal may be spaced apart from the first seal.
[0027]     As the filter media 104 collects particulate 110, the particulate 110 builds within the
filter media 104 and on the surface of the filter media 104. As the amount of built up particulate
110 increases, the efficiency of the air filter 100 increases. Additionally, the amount of built up
particulate 110 increases, the restriction of air flow through the air filter 100 increases. At a
certain point in the life of the filter media 104, the restriction becomes too large for the filter
media 104 to function properly. Accordingly, air filter 100 includes a pressurized air input 114
that supplies clean, pressurized air to blow the particulate 110 out of and off of the filter media
106.
[0028]     The pressurized air input 114 may be connected to a pressurized air source. The air
from the pressurized air source may have already been filtered through the air filter 100 (e.g.,

                                                    8
stored in a pressurized take after a prior filtering operation). During a cleaning operation, the air
from the pressurized air source may flow through the pressurized air input 114 and into the air
filter 100. The air may be supplied to the clean side 108 of the filter media 104. Accordingly,
clean air passes into the filter media 104 through the clean side 108, continues through the filter
media 104, and passes out of the filter media 104 through the dirty side 106. In the process, the
air sweeps particulate 110 out of the filter media 104 and off of the dirty side 106 of the filter
media. The freed particulate 110 may then pass out of the filter housing 102 through an ejection
port 116. The ejection portion 116 may include a check valve 118 that prevents air and
particulate 110 from flowing out of the housing 102 when cleaning operations are not being
performed. The check valve 118 may be selectively opened and closed during a cleaning
operation or during a filter operation. The ejection port 116 may eject the now dirtied cleaning
air and the particulate 110 to the external environment. In some arrangements, a vacuum source
(e.g., a vacuum chamber, a vacuum pump, etc.) may be connected to the ejection port 116 to
assist in removing particulate 110 from the filter. The opening 112 may be selectively closed
during the cleaning operation (e.g., by operation of a valve) to increase the amount of air flowing
from the pressurized air input 114 and out the dust ejection port 116. The air entering the air
filter 100 through the pressurized air input 114 may be routed through an air distributor 120. The
air distributor 120 may be conical in shape, although other shapes are also possible. The air
distributor 120 includes a plurality of openings 122. The openings may be substantially evenly
spaced across the air distributor 120 to evenly distribute the air from the pressurized air input
across a surface of the clean side 108 of the filter media 104.
[0029]     The cleaning operation removes particulate 110 from the filter media 104.
Accordingly, the lifespan of the filter media 104 may be increased through the cleaning
operations. The cleaning operation may be automatically performed (e.g., at regular intervals,
based on feedback from a sensor, etc.) or may be performed as an on-demand operation at the
instruction of a user. The cleaning operation may be performed while the system connected to
the air filter 100 is operating or while the system connected to the air filter 100 is not operating.
The cleaning operation does not require the filter 100 to be disassembled or the filter media 104

                                                   9
to be removed or uninstalled from the housing 102. Accordingly, the cleaning operation may be
performed in-situ (e.g., with the filter media 104 in the installed condition).
[0030]     Referring to FIG. 2, a cross-sectional view of a cleanable air filter 200 is shown
according to another exemplary embodiment. Air filter 200 is substantially similar to air filter
100 in its arrangement of components and function. However, the air filter 200 routes cleaning
air through filter media 202 in a slightly different manner. Similar to air filter 100, the air filter
200 includes an air distributor 204. The air distributor 204 may be placed on the clean side of
the air filter media 202. The air distributor 204 may be conical in shape, with other shapes also
being possible. The air distributor 204 includes a plurality of openings 206. The openings 206
may be substantially evenly spaced across the air distributor 204 to evenly distribute the air from
the pressurized air input across a surface of the clean side of the filter media 202. In addition to
the air distributor 204, the air filter 200 may route cleaning air directly into the air filter media
202 through an air pipe 208 coupled to the air filter media 202. The air filter 200 may include a
plurality of air pipes 208. The air pipe 208 may provide cleaning air into a top end of the air
filter media 202. A cleaning air manifold 210 may provide air to both the air pipe 208 and to the
air distributor 204.
[0031]     Referring to FIG. 3, a cross-sectional view of a cleanable air filter 300 is shown
according to yet another exemplary embodiment. Air filter 300 is substantially similar to air
filters 100 and 200 in its arrangement of components and function. However, air filter 300
routes cleaning air through filter media 302 in a slightly different manner. Similar to air filter
200, air filter 300 includes an air pipe 304 or a plurality of air pipes 304 to route cleaning air
directly into the air filter media 302. The air pipe or pipes 304 may be coupled to the air filter
media 302. A cleaning air manifold 306 may provide air to the air pipe or pipes 304. Unlike
filters 100 and 200, filter 300 does not include a central air distributor that directs air onto the
clean side of the filter media 302.
[0032]     Referring to FIG. 4, a cross-sectional view of a cleanable air filter 400 is shown
according to still another exemplary embodiment. The air filter 400 includes a housing 402

                                                    10
containing a coiled filter media 404. The coiled filter media 404 may be could around a center
tube 406. The coiled filter media 404 may occupy the space between the center tube 406 and the
interior of the housing 402. The coiled filter media 404 includes a dirty side 408, in which dirty
air containing particulates enters the coiled filter media 404, and a clean side 410, in which
clean, filtered air exits the filter media 404. The clean filtered air may exit the air filter through
an opening 412 in the housing 402.
[0033]     Similar to the above discussed air filters, the coiled filter media 404 collects particulate
as the air is filtered through the air filter 400. Accordingly, the air filter 400 includes a
pressurized air input 414 that supplies clean, pressurized air to blow the particulate out of and off
of the coiled filter media 404. The pressurized air input 414 may be connected to a pressurized
air source. The air from the pressurized air source may have already been filtered through the air
filter 400 (e.g., stored in a pressurized tank after a prior filtering operation). During a cleaning
operation, the air from the pressurized air source may flow through the pressurized air input 414,
through the center tube 406, and through a coiled hollow tubing 416 into the filter media 404.
The hollow tubing 416 may include a plurality of holes located at a tip edge along the length of
the hollow tubing 416 to deliver the cleaning air to the dirty side 410 of the filter media 404.
The hollow tubing 416 may be extruded. The hollow tubing 416 may be an air sparge plenum.
The hollow tubing 416 may provide cleaning air to each coil of the coiled filter media 404. The
air provided by the hollow tubing 416 forces captured particulate and caked particulate out of
and off of the coiled filter media 404 in a similar manner as described above with respect to air
filters 100, 200, and 300. The freed particulate may then pass out of the housing 402 through an
ejection port. The ejection portion may include a check valve that prevents air and particulate
from flowing out of the housing 402 when cleaning operations are not being performed. The
ejection port may eject the now dirtied air and the particulate to the external environment. In
some arrangements, a vacuum source (e.g., a vacuum chamber, a vacuum pump, etc.) may be
connected to the ejection port to assist in removing particulate from the filter 400.
[0034]     Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, views of a cleanable air filter 500 are shown according to
an exemplary embodiment. FIG. 5 shows a cross-sectional view of the cleanable air filter 500 is

                                                   11
shown according to an exemplary embodiment. FIG. 6 shows a perspective view of the air filter
500 without the housing 502. Air filter 500 is similar in both arrangement and operation to
cleanable air filters 100, 200, 300, and 400. Air filter 500, however, includes a substantially
rectangular housing 502 that contains a V-shaped filter media 504. Additionally, air filter 500
differs in that pressurized cleaning air is routed into a manifold 506 from a pressurized air input
508 such that pressurized air is directed onto a dirty side of the fitter media 504 by the manifold
506. The manifold 506 may connect to the housing 502, which includes the pressurized air input
508. A locating feature and an o-ring or auxiliary seal may be used (as shown in FIG. 12) to
assist in forming an air-tight connection between the manifold 506 and the pressurized air input
508. The o-ring or auxiliary seal may be provided at an interface between the manifold 506 and
the housing 502. In this arrangement, the pressurized cleaning air dislodges particulate built up
on the surface of the dirty side of the fitter media 504. In some arrangements, the manifold 506
may be configured to provide cleaning air to the dirty side, the clean side, or both sides of the
filter media 504. The manifold 506 may include a one-way valve permitting cleaning air to exit
the manifold 506 and to prevent fluid flow from the dirty side of the filter media 504 to the clean
side of the filter media. The manifold 506 may be a constituent part of the filter media such that
when the filter media 504 is removed from the housing 502, the manifold 506 is also removed
(e.g., as shown in FIG. 6). The freed particulate may then pass out of the housing 502 through an
ejection port 510. The ejection portion 510 may include a check valve 512 that prevents air and
particulate from flowing out of the housing 502 when cleaning operations are not being
performed. The ejection port 510 may eject the now dirtied air and the particulate to the external
environment. In some arrangements, a vacuum source (e.g., a vacuum chamber, a vacuum
pump, etc.) may be connected to the ejection port 510 to assist in removing particulate from the
filter 500.
[0035]     Referring to FIGS. 7 through 9, views of different arrangements of manifold air passage
channels (e.g., air delivery ports of manifold 506) are shown. As shown in FIGS. 7-9, the
manifold may include a plurality of passage channels. The passage channels direct the cleaning
air to various locations along the filter media. As shown in FIG. 7, a first manifold arrangement

                                                   12
700 may include a plurality of passage channels 702 that are substantially perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of a manifold pipe 704. As shown in FIG. 8, a second manifold arrangement
800 may include a plurality of passage channels 802 that are substantially in line with the
longitudinal axis of a manifold pipe 804. As shown in FIG. 9, a third manifold arrangement 900
may include a plurality of passage channels 902 that are positioned at a non-perpendicular angle
with respect to the longitudinal axis of a manifold pipe 704. Although each of the above
described arrangements depict passage channels 702, 802, and 902 as slots, the ports may be
sized and shaped in any suitable manner. The passage channels 702, 802, and 902 may be
formed by a water-gas assisted injection molding process.
[0036]     Referring to FIGS. 10 through 12, a cleanable air filter 1000 is shown according to an
exemplary embodiment. The cleanable air filter 1000 is similar in both arrangement and
operation to the cleanable air filter 500 discussed above with respect to FIGS. 5 through 9. The
main difference between air filter 1000 and air filter 500 is that cleaning air in air filter 1000 is
routed into the pleats of filter media, whereas the cleaning air of filter 500 is routed to the dirty
side surface of the filter media 504. Additionally, as shown in FIG. 12, air filter 1000 includes a
manifold 1002 which connects with a pressurized air input 1004 of a housing 1006. The
manifold 1002 may be removably connected to the pressurized air input 1004. The housing 1006
may include a locator feature 1008 to assist a user in connecting the manifold 1002 to the
pressurized air input 1004. The locator feature 1008 may include an o-ring to ensure an air tight
seal between the manifold 1002 and the pressurized air input. As mentioned above, the
connection shown in FIG. 12 may also be used with air filter 500.
[0037]     Referring to FIG. 13, a cross-sectional view of a cleanable air filter 1300 is shown
according to another exemplary embodiment. The air filter 1300 is similar in both arrangement
and operation to air filters 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 1000. The air filter 1300 includes a
housing 1302 which houses filter media 1304. The filter media 1304 may include panelettes. In
an alternative arrangement, the filter media 1304 may be arranged in a cone, may be coiled (e.g.,
as in air filter 400), or may be cylindrical in shape (e.g., as in air filter 100). The filter media
1304 is supported by a frame 1306 within the housing 1302. The frame 1306 may form a seal

                                                   13
with the housing 1302 to isolate a dirty side of the filter media 1304 from a clean side of the
filter media 1304. The housing 1302 includes a dirty air inlet 1308 and a clean air outlet 1310.
[0038]     The cleaning system of filter 1300 includes at least one pressurized air inlet 1312 which
supplies cleaning air 1314 to the air filter media 1304. The cleaning air may be configured to
free captured particulate within and on the dirty side surface of the air filter media 1304 in
accordance with any of the above discussed cleaning air routing systems. Unlike air filters 100,
200, 300, 400, 500, and 1000, air filter 1300 does not include an ejection port. Air filter 1300
includes a removable cover 1316. The removable cover 1316 may be shaped like a cup or a
bucket. Accordingly, the removable cover 1316 may collect particulate that has been freed from
the filter media 1304 by the cleaning system. The removable cover may then be removed by a
user (e.g., by unscrewing the removable cover 1316, by unlatching a lock holding the removable
cover 1316 in place, or otherwise separating the removable cover 1316 from the housing) in
order to remove the collected particulate from the air filter 1300.
[0039]     Referring to FIGS. 14 and 15, a cleanable air filter 1400 is shown according to still
another exemplary embodiment. The cleanable air filter 1400 comprises a bag-style air filter
system. Air filter 1400 is similar in both arrangement and operation to air filters 100, 200, 300,
400, 500, 1000, and 1300. Air filter 1400 includes pleated filter media 1402. As shown in FIG.
15, an air flow path 1404 carries air through the filter media 1402 to be cleaned. The air filter
1400 includes a manifold 1406 configured to route pressurized cleaning air 1408 onto the dirty
side pleats of the air filter media 1402. The pressurized cleaning air frees captured particulate
within and on the dirty side surface of the air filter media 1402 in accordance with any of the
above discussed cleaning air routing systems. The freed particulate falls to the bottom of the air
filter 1400, where it is collected and removed through an ejection port 1410. A vacuum source
(e.g., a vacuum chamber, a vacuum pump, etc.) may be connected to the ejection port 1410 to
assist in removing the freed particulate from the air filter 1410.
[0040]     Referring to FIG. 16 a vibration mechanism 1600 for a cleanable air filter is shown,
where the vibration mechanism 1600 includes a rotary vibrator. The rotary vibrator may include

                                                     14
a motor having an offset weight. Accordingly, when the motor turns, the offset weight causes
the vibration mechanism to vibrate. Referring to FIG. 17, a vibration mechanism 1700 including
a linear or oscillating vibrator is shown. The vibration mechanism 1700 oscillates a mass
linearly, which causes the vibration mechanism 1700 to vibrate. The above described vibration
mechanisms 1600 and 1700 may be coupled to an air filter. The vibration mechanisms may be
coupled to an air filter frame, directly to air filter media, or to a cleaning system component (e.g.,
an air delivery manifold). The vibration mechanisms are configured to shake the air filter media
thereby assisting in dislodging captured particulate in the filter media. The above described
vibration mechanisms 1600 and 1700 may be used with any of the above described cleanable air
filters 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 1300, and 1400. In alternative arrangements, the vibration
mechanisms 1600 and 1700 may be used on air filter systems that do not use a pressurized fluid
(e.g., pressurized air) cleaning system. Each of the above vibration mechanisms 1600 and 1700
may be driven by the cleaning air passed through the manifold or by a separate electric actuator
(e.g., an electric motor).
[0041]     Referring to FIG. 18, a block diagram of a system 1800 is shown according to an
exemplary embodiment. System 1800 includes a filter 1802. The filter 1802 may be any of the
above described cleanable air filters 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 1300, and 1400. The filter
1802 may include a vibration mechanism (e.g., vibration mechanism 1600 or 1700). The filter
1802 filters a fluid (e.g., air, fuel, etc.) and provides clean fluid to a system 1804. System 1804
may be an internal combustion engine system, a compressor system, a medical system, an
HVAC system, or the like. System 1804 uses clean air provided by the filter 1802. The system
may include a controller 1806. The controller 1806 may control the operation of the system
1804. For example, if the system 1804 is an internal combustion engine system of an
automobile, the controller 1806 may be the automobile's engine control module. In other
arrangements, the controller 1806 may control the cleaning operations of filter 1802.
[0042]     The system 1800 may include a pressurized fluid supply 1808. The pressurized fluid
supply 1808 may provide pressurized cleaning fluid (e.g., air or water) to the filter 1802 during
filter cleaning operations. The pressurized fluid supply 1808 may be controlled by the controller

                                                    15
1806. The pressurized fluid supply may provide cleaning fluid to the air filter in any manner
described herein. The system 1800 may also include a vacuum source 1810. The vacuum source
1810 may provide a vacuum to an ejection port of the filter 1802 to assist with removing freed
particulate from the filter 1802. The vacuum source 1810 may be controlled by the controller
1806. If the filter 1802 includes a vibration mechanism, the controller 1806 may also control the
operation of the vibration mechanism during cleaning operations. The controller 1806 may
automatically instruct cleaning operations for the filter 1802 based on stored cleaning settings
(e.g., a periodic cleaning schedule, based on feedback from a sensor associated with the filter
1802, etc.). Alternatively, the controller 1806 may instruct cleaning operations for the filter 1802
based on a user cleaning request (e.g., a technician may provide input to the controller 1806
through an input device to instruct a filter cleaning operation to be performed on the filter 1802
while servicing the system 1804).
[0043]     Referring to FIG. 19, a flow diagram of a method 1900 of cleaning a cleanable air filter
is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The filter may be any of the above described
cleanable air filters. The filter includes a filter element. The filter element may be in an installed
condition within a filter housing. The filter element may include filter media. The filter may be
configured to provide clean air to an external system (e.g., an internal combustion engine system,
a compressor system, a medical system, an HVAC system, system 1804, or the like). The
system may include a controller that controls a cleaning operation performed on the filter. In an
alternative arrangement, the filter may include a controller configured to control the cleaning
operation.
[0044]     Method 1900 begins when the controller receives a cleaning command (1902). The
cleaning command may be received automatically. For example, the controller may be
configured to automatically instruct a cleaning operation on the filter after a set time interval
(e.g., every day, every week, every month, every 6 months, etc.), after a set usage interval (e.g.,
after the filter has filtered a certain amount of air, after the system has been used for a certain
amount of time, if the system is a car - after the car has been driven a certain distance, etc.), or
based on a feedback signal from a sensor of the filter (e.g., an air flow sensor, an air quality

                                                    16
sensor, etc.). Additionally or alternatively, the cleaning command may be received from an
external source. The external source may be an external computing system. The external source
may be a user input in which a user (e.g., a technician) may instruct an on-demand cleaning
operation.
[0045]     After receiving the cleaning command, the controller may instruct a pressurized fluid
source to provide a pressurized cleaning fluid to the filter element of the air filter (1904). The
pressurized cleaning fluid may be air, water, detergent, degreaser, or a combination thereof. The
pressurized cleaning fluid may be provided to the clean side of the filter element, the dirty side of
the filter element, directly to the filter element, or a combination thereof. The filter media of the
filter element may include channels to distribute the cleaning fluid within the filter media. The
channels may be formed within the filter media itself or in a cleaning fluid distribution manifold
coupled to the media. The channels may be formed by a water-gas assisted injection molding
process. The cleaning fluid may be applied in pulses or applied in a steady stream. The cleaning
fluid may be applied to the filter element while the filter element is in the installed position
within the filter housing. The cleaning fluid may be applied to the filter element during a
filtering operation (e.g., while the filter element is providing clean air to the external system) or
when a filtering operation is not being performed by the filter. The cleaning fluid may remove
trapped and caked on particulate from the filter media.
[0046]     The controller may activate a vibration mechanism of the filter (e.g., vibration
mechanism 1600 or 1700) (1906). Although shown as occurring after step 1904, the controller
may activate the vibration mechanism before or simultaneous to the application of cleaning fluid
to the filter element. The vibration mechanism may vibrate the filter element in order to assist in
freeing captured and caked on particulate from the filter media. The vibration mechanism may
be actuated by the flow of cleaning fluid or may be actuated by an electric actuator (e.g., an
electric motor).
[0047]     The controller may then remove freed particulate from the filter housing (1908). The
controller may instruct the opening of a valve in an ejection port of the filter to allow the freed

                                                  17
particulate to exit the filter housing. In some arrangements, the controller may activate a vacuum
source to assist in the removal of the freed particulate out of the ejection port. In an alternative
arrangement, a user may manually remove the freed particulate from the filter housing.
[0048]    As noted above, each of the above cleanable air filters 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000,
1300, and 1400, include filter media. The above described filter media may include paper filter
media, foam filter media, cotton filter media, or other suitable filter media. The filter media may
include nanofiber media. The filter media may include integrated air passage channels that
distribute cleaning air within the filter media. The air passage channels may be formed through a
water-gas assist injection molding process. The filter media may be coated in a chemical and/or
may be electrically charged.
[0049]    In each of the above cleanable air filters 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 1300, and 1400.
pressurized air is described as the cleaning fluid. The pressurized air may be pulsed through the
cleanable filters during cleaning operations or may flow in a substantially steady stream. The
pressurized air may include a detergent configured to assist in cleaning the filter media. The
detergent may include a degreaser. In other arrangements, the filters may be configured to be
cleaned with a different fluid, such as water. The water may be pressurized. The water may be
pulsed through the cleanable filters during cleaning operations or may flow in a substantially
steady stream. The water may include a detergent configured to assist in cleaning the filter
media. The detergent may include a degreaser.
