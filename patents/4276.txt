                                         ABSTRACT
The present disclosure provides a therapeutic method applicable to learning, attention,
cognitive and developmental disorders. This method combines auditory, visual and vestibular
stimuli into a systematic method which can be customized to address individual learning,
attention and processing disorders. This method may be wirelessly implemented in a group
setting.   A device for providing vestibular and somatosensory stimulation through bone
conduction of sound waves to skeletal bones is provided in the form of a pad that is applied to
or wrapped around the individual in treatment, which is comfortable in use and may contain
particulate filler material capable of providing bone conduction stimulation adjacent to the
location of a bone conduction transducer and expand the sound conduction site over a larger
area.

    Cross Reference to Related Applications
01]        The present application claims priority to U.S. Application Number 13/685,390 filed
   November 26, 2012, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application No. 12/456,625, filed
   June 19, 2009 and a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application No. 12/804,181, filed July 15,
   2010, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
   Field of the Disclosure
02]        The present disclosure relates generally to a therapeutic method for improving motor
   function, concentration, visual and auditory processing, cognitive skills (e.g. reasoning, memory,
   organization, planning and learning) energy level, self-confidence, mood, behavior, anxiousness,
   and stress level. In at least one embodiment, this method uniquely combines auditory, visual,
   and vestibular stimuli into a systematic approach which can be customized to address individual
   learning, attention, and processing disorders.        In another embodiment, utilizing a wireless
   technology system, this method combines the calming effects of bone-conducted sound with the
   energizing effect of air-conducted music.       Such a method, employing a wireless technology
    system, is a first of its kind in the wellness and preventative health field, employing movement
   and music to address the proprioceptive, vestibular, and motor aspects of fall risk, as well as
   reducing the anxiety caused by, for example, the fear of falling.       Such method, employing a
   wireless technology system, has numerous user benefits such as for fall risk reduction, in group
   wellness/fitness classes, for anxiety reduction, and for general quality of life improvement.

 03]         The present disclosure also relates to devices and methods of providing stimulation of the
     vestibular and somatosensory systems of the human body through bone conduction utilizing one
     or more transducers to transmit sound frequencies through the skeletal frame.
     Background of the Disclosure
 04]         The connection between what is heard and listened to by the ear of a subject and the
     subject's spoken voice is well recognized. Additionally, it is well recognized that hearing occurs
     through two distinct pathways: air conduction, which stimulates the cochlear system, and bone
     conduction (vibration of sound carried by the skeletal frame).       Bone conduction delivery of
     sound occurs when the sound vibration is transmitted to the inner ear through the bones of the
     skeletal framework. This process stimulates the vestibular/cochlear and somatosensory systems
     as well as the central nervous system. Stimulating these physiological systems with the low
     frequencies carried by bone conduction tends to have a relaxing, stabilizing effect; it also
     influences the ability for spatial equilibrium and balance, as well as the ability to modulate
     sensory input and to process information. Many devices and methods, including those utilizing
     bone conduction have been directed toward assisting those with cochlear hearing and vestibular
     ear difficulties to hear better with an accompanying improvement in speech.           Evidence of
     devices and methods can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,101,081, 3,043,913, 4,021,611,
     4,212,119, 4,327,252 and 4,615,680 to Tomatis, 1,969,559 to Kelly and 3,101,390 to Maille, all
     of which are incorporated herein by reference.
)05]         In addition to providing the sense of hearing, the vestibular system is the primary organ
     of equilibrium and plays a major role in the sensation of motion and spatial orientation; it also
     provides input to the nervous system, adjusting muscle activity, body posture, and stabilizes the
                                                     -2-

         WO 2014/081452                                                          PCT/US2013/023619
    eyes during head movements.        It is known that vestibular stimulation through air and bone
    conducted sound can enhance neurological development, and can be used in the treatment of
    autism, Asperger's, sensory processing disorder, and ADHD.        It is widely recognized that the
    early detection of autism in children is fundamental to effective treatment. However, with very
    young children, because of the prior art device configurations, effective vestibular stimulation
    through sound is difficult.
06]         Vestibular stimulation therapy of the prior art has consisted of the delivery of sound
    through headphones and the delivery of sound through headphones in conjunction with bone
    conduction delivery through a device attached to the headphones or the person's head. Although
    effective, the use of the headphones and bone conduction devices attached to a person's head
    may be uncomfortable and impractical in certain settings.        Clearly with infants and small
    children such headphones and bone conduction devices are not practical; and in any application,
    such headphones and bone conduction devices can become unintentionally displaced, and
    therefore ineffective, through the movement of the individual. Further, such headphones and
    bone conduction devices cannot be applied to provide vestibular stimulation to a fetus in-utero.
07]         Dr. Alfred A. Tomatis postulated and it is well recognized by others that:     1. The voice
    only contains that which the ear can hear; if you can't hear it, you won't be able to speak it; 2.
    the ear is like a battery to the brain, with a primary function of converting sound waves to
    electrical pulses to charge the cortex of the brain; 3. hearing is passive, listening is active and
    conscious, like the difference between seeing and looking; listening and looking are active
    focusing processes; 4. the quality of one's listening affects spoken and written language
    development,     alertness, creativity,  and the ability   to focus;    listening  also influences
    communication and shapes social skills, confidence, and self-image; 5. communication begins in
                                                   -3-

     utero; an unborn child hears from the 4f month after conception; sound literally helps the brain
     and nervous system of the fetus to develop. Dr. Tomatis further mapped out and postulated that
     certain filtered frequencies corresponded to stimulation of certain body and mind properties:
     frequencies between 0 and 750 Hz corresponded to balance, coordination, motor skills, muscle
     tone, body awareness, and rhythm; frequencies between 750-3,000 Hz corresponded to memory,
     concentration, attention, receptive and expressive language; and frequencies greater than 3,000
     Hz corresponded to integrating emotion, creativity, and higher cognitive thinking.
 08]         Auditory therapy, including bone conduction, treatment and filtering of music and
     sounds, and gating are well known in the prior art. Such therapy methods are premised upon the
     concept of neuroplasticity which holds that throughout the life of the subject new neural
     connections can be established through stimulation and training. Prior to the present disclosure,
     such auditory therapy has been limited to air conduction and bone conduction listening of music,
     speech, sounds, and the subject's own spoken voice.              No attempt had been made to
     simultaneously utilize visual tracking stimuli, movement stimuli, and auditory stimuli in such
     therapy to integrate and refine the cochlear and vestibular signal with that of the other senses.
 09]         It is therefore an object of the present disclosure to provide a method of training that
     systematically integrates auditory, visual, vestibular, and movement sensory inputs.
)10]         It is another object of the present disclosure to provide a wirelessly transmitted program
     of treated music and sounds to wireless bone conduction headphones having a streamlined open
     ear fit allowing for participation in group exercise/therapy classes, group activities, and
     socialization.   Air conduction signals, if desired, are then outputted via loud speakers to each
     user in the group setting. Such a program is primarily targeted at seniors who wish to maintain

     aerobics classes, sports team training, and schools, etc.

    Description of the Invention
18]          The present disclosure provides a novel method of training for motor function, sensory
    processing, and cognitive development. This model systematically integrates auditory, visual,
    vestibular and movement inputs, developing skills related to self-regulation, motor function,
    learning, attention, and cognition.
19]          The sequence of the stimuli presented in the method utilized in the present disclosure
    follows and supports the process of normal development, including movement, sensory
    processing, learning, language, and higher cognitive function.         The inventors herein have
    postulated and found that this integrated approach, while a continuous process, may be divided
    into four phases that, in part, mirror the natural development of a healthy child: an organizational
    phase, an acclimation phase, an activation phase, and an integration phase. The organizational
    phase is generally the developmental period of early, sub-cortical neurological organization
    characterized by perception and processing sound with an emphasis on low frequency sound,
    processing of vestibular and proprioceptive input and gross motor movement. The acclimation
    phase is generally the developmental period of early childhood where gradual consciousness of
    sound and early pitch discrimination of frequencies occurs along with basic language acquisition
    and continued vestibular and proprioceptive development.        These occur simultaneously with
    slow visual tracking, cross-lateral motor development and behavioral, and emotional regulation,
    including the beginning of impulse control. The activation phase is generally the developmental
    period marked by the acquisition of higher frequency perception, increased visual and fine motor
    functions combined with integration of more complex movement and cognitive processing
    activity, along with increased impulse/behavioral control.          The integration phase is the
    developmental period where there is full integration of all sensory, emotional, and mental inputs
                                                      -6-

          WO 2014/081452                                                        PCT/US2013/023619
     marked by the ability to process and integrate multi-sensory input simultaneously with higher
     cognitive organization and planning.
 20]         In the method of the present disclosure, a subject is evaluated to determine the areas of
     deficiency. The subject is evaluated in connection with a checklist of symptoms indicative of
     deficiencies of each developmental phase. The checklist includes the areas of sensory motor,
     auditory, language, social, emotional, and organizational/cognitive functions. Another method
     of identifying deficiencies in particular phases is to compare "normal" functionality with that of
     the subject.    For example, for pediatric populations this means looking at the subject's
     developmental age with the typical age for achieving certain developmental landmarks, such as
     crawling, walking, speaking their first words, and developing a sense of handedness. For adult
     populations, problems with balance and coordination indicate deficits in the organizational
     phase; while problems with language and auditory processing indicate deficits in the acclimation
     phase (e.g. pitch discrimination,       auditory processing).    Additionally, medical records,
     particularly indications   of ear infections and food allergies, indicate potential resulting
     deficiencies.  Further, LAC, IVA, SCAN-C and BASC-2 assessments are useful in identifying
     reading, auditory processing and behavior issues indicative of integrative deficiencies of certain
     phases.
)21]         After the areas of difficulty are identified, a therapeutic regimen is created, directed
     toward remediation of the deficient areas.
)22]         The auditory stimulus of the present disclosure is provided by treated music and sounds
     that are provided through a recording playback device, such as an i-PodTM or MP3 player, to a
     pair of headphones.    The headphones typically incorporate a bone conduction transducer that
     transmits sound waves which are carried by the skull to the inner ear; however, the use of the
                                                     -7-

        WO 2014/081452                                                           PCT/US2013/023619
   bone conduction transducer is not absolutely necessary in all therapeutic regimens.                In
   therapeutic regimens where the bone conduction transducer is utilized, an amplifier having
   separate outputs for the headphones and bone conduction transducer is connected to the
   recording playback device. The amplifier further provides for separate adjustment of the output
   amplitude directed toward the headphones and separate adjustment of the output amplitude
   directed toward the bone conduction transducer.
23]        Alternatively or in addition to the previously disclosed embodiment, the treated music
   and sounds may be provided first to an amplifier/splitter which output a bone conduction signal
   and an air conduction signal.     The bone conduction signal is wirelessly transmitted from a
   wireless transmitter or from the amplifier/splitter which may include a wireless transmitter. The
   air conduction signal is connected via conventional wires to one or more room speakers. The
   wireless transmitter delivers the treated music to a wireless mini-receiver located on a user's
   body. The wireless mini-receiver is in communication with lightweight streamlined open ear fit
   bone conduction headphones.        In the preferred embodiment, the wireless mini-receiver is
   physically integrated with the lightweight streamlined open ear fit bone conduction headphones.
   The mini-receiver, whether integrated or not, provides a user input for adjusting the volume
   control to the bone conduction transducer in the headphones.        The amplifier provides volume
   control to the room speakers to regulate the delivery of the sound via air waves to one or more
   users wearing the open ear fit bone conduction headphones. Such a set-up allows a plurality of
   users to share a group activity, whether that be listening to music, participating in aerobic or non
   aerobic exercise, or any other type of social interactive environment, as a group but still benefit
   from the individual application of a bone conduction signal, synchronized or unsynchronized,

   with the activity.      Additional features of the implementation of this embodiment will be
   explained in greater detail later in this application.
24]         The stimulation of the visual and movement systems by the present disclosure are
   provided by activities specifically directed toward the deficits being addressed. The activities are
   conducted simultaneous to the auditory component (while wearing headphones and listening to
   processed music). The movement activities fall within five different groups.
25]         The first group of activities consists of breathing, balance and core exercises designed to
   improve vestibular function, self-regulation, circulation, flexibility, focus, core strength, energy,
   vitality and reduce fatigue and stress. Although not an exhaustive list, the following described

    that are designed to improve visual tracking, hand/eye coordination, hemispheric integration and
    concentration. Although not an exhaustive list, the following described activities are indicative
    of those from this third group:
             [0046]          Straight Line Tap: With partner or alone, tap ball in a straight, controlled
                    line, alternate hands. 20-40 complete circuits Maintain good posture, try to keep

  [0048]         Straight Head Tap: Tap ball with forehead gently in straight line. Keep
         line straight in a slow, controlled movement.       Warning: be careful not to hit
         plastic piece above ball. Be patient as this game takes a little practice! Purpose:
         visual motor exercise, hemispheric integration, motor planning.
  [0049]         Surprise: User stands under ball plum line, helper arcs ball from behind
         w/o saying which way it's coming from. User has to catch the ball as it circles
         around.    Win points catching w/o touching string, lose points if miss ball.
         Advanced alternative: Try to catch ball before it reaches "12:00".      Purpose: fast
         visual tracking, motor planning, concentration.
  [0050]         Dodge Ball: User stands under ball plum line; user or helper starts a broad
         arc. User must count the revolutions, avoiding contact with ball. Moving head
         and body is ok, but must not move feet. Winner avoids the ball for the most
         revolutions.    Advanced alternative: cover the eye opposite oncoming ball.
         Purpose: balance, body awareness and control, eye tracking.
  [0051]         Scan Ball: User stands (or kneels) with ball at eye level. Helper swings
         ball in straight line "perpendicular" to user so user eye movements are scanning
         left and right. Start 3 feet back, count 10 swings. Repeat at 2 feet back and again
         at 1 foot back. Keep head still and count each swing. This is tiring, be careful not
         to overdo it! Purpose: lateral eye tracking.
  [0052]         Sparring:    Using a careful, gentle "punch," alternate left and right as if
         sparring with the ball. The smaller the fist, the more difficult this is. Little ones
         might find a slap easier. Games: count the number of consecutive punches, stop
         as soon as you miss.      Highest count wins. Advanced: add footwork, left foot

 63]          The fifth group of activities consists of cognitive tasks that are used in conjunction with
     activities from groups one through four and include the following: repeating phrases, singing
     lullabyes, ditties, and songs, counting forwards and backwards by multiples, giving directions to
     a location, recounting an actual event and creating a new story.
 64]          To summarize the combined activities, i.e. the combination of the auditory component
     with the visual/vestibular/movement component, of each of the four phases:
 65]          For organizational phase therapy the music and sounds selected are rich in lower
     frequency sounds and the music and sounds are treated to enhance the amplitude of lower
     frequency sound waves typically below 750 Hz in some of the music while also using the full
     spectrum of frequencies in the music. The visual and movement stimuli of the organizational
     phase therapy are simple exercises without any simultaneous combinations of visual, balance and
     cross-lateral activities.
 66]          For acclimation phase therapy the music and sounds are gradually filtered removing the
     lower frequency sound waves from 750 Hz to 3,000 Hz, including full spectrum music in which
     all frequencies are present. The visual and movement stimuli of the acclimation phase therapy
     begin to gradually blend visual, balance and cross-lateral activities.
)67]          For activation phase therapy the music and sounds are a series of increasingly filtered
     music where the maximal level of filtration is -4,000Hz.       The visual and movement stimuli of
     the activation phase therapy combine multi-sensory movement activities with simultaneous
     sequential and memory-based cognitive activities.
)68]          For integration phase therapy lower frequency sound waves that were filtered out in
     acclimation phase and activation phases are gradually reintroduced. The visual and movement

    stimuli combine more complex cognitive activities with simultaneous vestibular, proprioceptive,
    cross lateral, core strengthening and fine motor activities.
69]         In addition to the sound wave frequency filtering of the described method, gating may
    also be employed. Gating alternately boosts the high and low frequencies in a random manner,
    activated by the amplitude of the recorded music and sounds. Gating occurs as an unexpected
    event and has the effect of heightening listening and attention by causing the brain to pay
    attention to an unexpected event.
70]         The present disclosure also provides a flexible pad which can be used as a bed surface,
    blanket or pillow through which sound waves can be transmitted by bone conduction to an
    individual to be treated.    One or more transducers are embedded within a flexible pad that,
    depending upon its overall size, may be applied to or wrapped around the individual to be
    treated. The pad can be constructed in size from a few inches square to any larger size. For
    example, the pad can be up to 6 feet in length enabling a person to lie completely on it and any a
    plurality of points of the muscular-skeletal system touch bone conduction transducers. The pad
    is applied to the individual so that its one or more transducers conduct sound waves to some part
    of the individual's skeletal frame such as the cranium, spine, hip, or leg bones. The pad allows
    the individual to be treated while sleeping, sitting, swinging on a swing, or performing other
    quiet type activities. The pad is also suitable for providing stimulation to a fetus in utero by
    placing the pad upon the mother's body.         Additionally, the pad may be utilized to provide
    treatment of premature infants; in such an application, the pad serves as a bedding surface with
    the head and/or body of the premature infant placed upon the area where a bone conduction
    transducer is located. Further, the pad may be sufficiently flexible and malleable to wrap around
    parts of the body, e.g., a user's feet or face. In at least one embodiment, the pad may take the

    form of an eye pillow with an adjustable clasp to ensure a proper fit around the user's head. The
    one or more bone conduction transducers are utilized to provide sound wave bone conduction
    rich in low frequencies, primarily between 50 and 1,000 Hz.
711          The sound source to be transmitted through the one or more transducers is typically
    supplied by a tape player, CD player, or MP3 player. The sound selected for transmission may
    include full spectrum music, music rich in low frequencies, music filtered to remove higher
    frequency content, a recorded heartbeat and other rhythmic sounds which have a soothing and
    stabilizing effect. The pad may comprise an internal pocket where the sound source can be
    stored during use. In another embodiment, the pad may comprise a wireless receiver built into
    the pad so it can receive sound signals from a source outside the pad without connecting wires.
72]          The flexible bone conduction pad comprises a cover, typically of waterproof textile
    fabric, which encloses the entire pad. Likewise, the pad itself may be made to be waterproof.
    One or more bone conduction transducers are located within a recess formed within a sheet of
    foam padding or textile batting to provide a comfortable transition surrounding the transducer.
    In at least one embodiment, a plurality of bone conduction transducers may be located in a
    pattern (e.g., a square matrix) based on typical pad usage that ensures that even with movement
    (conscious or unconscious) a user remains in contact with at least one bone conduction
    transducer. Electrical leads extend from the one or more transducers to a pocket at the periphery
    of the pad where an electrical connector is provided for connection to the sound source contained
    within the pocket. As the sound source, transducer and leads are all contained within the cover
    of the pad, an individual being treated cannot become entangled within the leads from the sound
    source to the transducer.

 73]         The flexible bone conduction pad may also comprise a heating element and associated
     controller to regulate the temperature of the pad.          In one embodiment, the flexible bone
     conduction pad may comprise one or both of an accommodation space for aroma therapy
     products and one or more lights sources to provide light therapy to the user, which may or may
     not be synchronized to the sound source. In another embodiment, the flexible bone conduction
     pad may also comprise a canopy which may be located around the user's head to block outside
     light thereby creating a sensory-controller environment.
 74]         In an alternate embodiment of the foregoing disclosure additional filler material is
     utilized, in place of, or in addition to the sheet of foam padding or textile batting. The additional
     filler material is comprised of particles of firm material capable of transmission of low frequency
     sound waves in the range of 50 to 4,000 Hz.          Although various shapes and materials may be
     employed, spherical glass beads of about 1/8 inch have been found to be well suited.             The
     particles of firm material are distributed throughout a section of the pad and enclosed within a
     bag containing a transducer in at least a density that provides contact between adjacent particles
     and contact between a transducer and adjacent particles. The particles thereby provide a means
     of bone conduction adjacent to the location of a transducer and expand the sound conduction site
     over a larger area.
)75]         In yet another embodiment of the flexible bone conduction pad, the pad may comprise a
     plurality of ridges across the top surface to provide tactile sensory input to the user.
)76]         The bone conduction pad of the present disclosure has been found to have application of
     particular import in the treatment of infants and premature infants. In application the infant is

     in low frequencies, primarily between 50 and 1,000 Hz is selected, although the overall range of

     sound frequencies may be between 50 and 4,000 Hz. Classical music pieces such as Mozart,
     Bach, cello pieces and female Gregorian chants have been employed. Such pieces are filtered to
     remove higher frequency content that has an agitating effect upon infants and premature infants.
     Additionally, the sound is blended with a recorded heartbeat which provides rhythm and has a
     calming effect.
 77]         The foregoing embodiments of the present disclosure were developed to provide bone
     conduction delivery of sounds in the absence of air conduction; however, it should be recognized
     that the device could allow for a splitter to be employed at the music source to provide
     simultaneous air conduction with headphones or the like.       Such simultaneous air conduction
     would allow combined air conduction and bone conduction stimulation for the individual to be
     treated or allow a mother to monitor the sounds conducted to her fetus in utero.

     Detailed Description of the Drawings
 88]         Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, an auditory stimulus is provided by filtering and treating
     recorded music and sounds as described in the description of the invention. The filtered and
     treated music and sounds are loaded onto a recording playback device 10, such as an i-PodTM
     device.
-89]         The playback signal from the recording playback device 10, is provided to the multi
     conductor input jack 12 of an amplifier 14, through a multi-conductor audio input cable 16
     having a multi-conductor input plug 18. The amplifier 14 splits the playback signal into separate
     and distinct output signals, one for air conduction output and one for bone conduction output.
     The amplifier provides for separate adjustment of the amplitude of the air conduction output
     signal and the bone conduction output signal through air conduction amplitude adjustment 20
     and bone conduction amplitude adjustment 22, respectively. The air conduction output signal
     from the amplifier 14 is transmitted through a multi conductor air conduction output jack 32 to a
                                                      - 22 -

          WO 2014/081452                                                         PCT/US2013/023619
     multi conductor air conduction output plug 34 that is connected to a pair of air conduction
     headphones 28 contained in a headphone assembly 30. The bone conduction output signal from
     the amplifier 14 is transmitted through multi conductor bone conduction output jack 24 to a multi
     conductor bone conduction output plug 26 that is connected to a bone conduction transducer 36
     contained in a headphone assembly 30. The bone conduction transducer 36 is located within
     headphone assembly 30 so that when headphone assembly 30 is worn by a subject the bone
     conduction transducer 36 is in contact with the subject's skull.
 901         The recording playback device 10, and the amplifier 14 are preferably attached to one
     another with removable adhesive material 38 to prevent them from banging together during
     movement activities, or may be integrated into one device. Additionally, securing the recording
     playback device 10 to the amplifier 14 allows them to be readily placed in the subject's pocket or
     secured in a waist pack worn by the subject during movement activities.
 911         Referring to Fig. 3, an auditory stimulus is provided by filtering and treating recorded
     music and sounds as described herein. The filtered and treated music and sounds are loaded onto
     a recording playback device 10, such as an i-PodTM device. In this embodiment, a wireless
     connection 65 between the treated music stored on recording playback device 10 and a plurality
     of bone conduction only headphones 31 allow a group of individuals to share the same bone
     conduction signal in a group setting.
)92]         A playback signal 55 from the recording playback device 10 is provided to an input (not
     shown) of amplifier/splitter 15 where it is split into an air conduction output signal 54 which is
     connected to loud speaker 50 and a bone conduction output signal 56 which is connected to
     wireless transmitter 60. The amplifier 15 provides for adjustment of the amplitude of the air
     conduction output signal 54 which is connected to one or more room speakers 50. The air
                                                    - 23 -

    conduction output signal 54 can thus be broadcast for all users via the loud speaker 50, whether a
    user is wearing bone conduction devices or not.
93]          The bone conduction output signal 56 is transmitted to a wireless transmitter 60 for
    transmission to associated wireless receivers 70. A wireless signal 65 is thus communicated
    from wireless transmitter 60 to a plurality of wireless receivers 70, one associated with each set
    of bone conduction headphones 31. Each wireless receiver 70 may comprise a separate amplifier
    to boost the signal strength for adjusting the volume of the bone conduction headphones 31.
    Bone conduction headphones 31 are similar to the headphone assembly 30 shown in Fig. 1
    except they do not comprise the air conduction devices and associated ear surrounds 28. The
    bone conduction headphones 31 do comprise one or more of the bone conduction transducers
    36.
94]          The wireless receiver 70 may be integrated into the bone conduction headphones 31 or
    may be a separate device and coupled via wires to headphones 31. In either situation, the
    wireless receiver 70 associated with each set of bone conduction headphones 31 provides
    adjustable volume control (not shown).
95]          Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate the bone conduction pad 110 of the present disclosure. Bone
    conduction pad 110 is constructed from a flexible sheet of padding 112 having a recess 114
    formed in its upper face 116. The flexible sheet of padding 112 is typically made of foam or
    textile batting so that an individual being treated may comfortably lie upon or apply the bone
    conduction pad 110 to their body. The flexible sheet of padding 112 may be made waterproof.
    The flexible sheet of padding 112 may be 1 to 6 feet in length. The flexible sheet of padding 112
    may also be flexible and malleable. Within recess 114 is located a bone conduction transducer
    118.    In one embodiment, shown in Figs. 8 and 9, there are a plurality of recesses 114
                                                   -24 -

           WO 2014/081452                                                         PCT/US2013/023619
     strategically located on the flexible sheet of padding 112 based on typical usage.            Bone
     conduction transducer 118 is particularly selected so that it is capable of emitting low frequency
     sound waves between 50 and 4,000 Hz.              Bone conduction transducer 118 is electrically
     connected through electrical leads 120 to a sound source 122. In practice, the sound source 122
     is typically a tape player CD player or MP3 player, however other devices capable of producing
     the appropriate low frequency sound signals may be employed. In one embodiment, the sound
     source 122 is a wireless receiver 150. A wireless transmitter 160 sends wireless sound source
     signals 165 from a location remote from the bone conduction pad 110. A cover 124 typically of
     waterproof textile material encloses the flexible sheet of padding 112, bone conduction
     transducer 118, electrical leads 120, and sound source 122.         Cover 124 is constructed with a
     pocket 126 at its periphery to secure sound source 122. Flexible sheet of padding 112 may also
     be constructed with a pocket 126 at its surface to secure sound source 122.
 96]          In one application, the bone conduction pad 110 is positioned upon or under an individual
     so that bone conduction transducer 118 is able to emit low frequency waves to the skeletal frame
     of the individual. The signals provided to transducer 118 from sound source 122 are particularly
     selected, based upon the condition of the individual being treated, to provide sound waves that
     result in a particular therapeutic effect.
)97]          The flexible sheet of padding 112 may also comprise a heater 170 with a control 172 to
     regulate the temperature of the pad. In another embodiment, the flexible sheet of padding 112
     may comprise locations for aroma therapy material 174 for depositing a plurality of fragrances
     and/or a plurality of light emitting devices 180 for light therapy.
)98]          In still another embodiment, the flexible sheet of padding 112 or cover 124 may comprise
     a canopy 190 to surround a user's head and provide a "sensory-controlled" environment, isolated
                                                     - 25 -

          WO 2014/081452                                                       PCT/US2013/023619
     from the surrounding environment. In another embodiment, the pad 112 has raised ridges 194
     formed across its top surface to provide tactile sensory input.
 99]         In still another embodiment, shown in Fig. 10, the flexible sheet of padding 212 and/or
     cover 224 is formed in an eye mask configuration 200 with an adjustable head band 210 and at
     least a pair of bone conduction transducers 218 located on a surface of the pad such that when
     worn by a user, the transducers rest against the user's temples. The adjustable head band 210
     may comprise VelcroTM type attachments 242 or comprise elastic components.               Such a
     configuration may be wired or wireless as previously discussed and may or may not have a
     sound source pocket for storage of a sound source 222. Such an embodiment may optionally
     comprise any of the other previously discussed features such as temperature control, aroma
     therapy, or light therapy.
 00]         Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the bone conduction pad 110 of the
     present disclosure. Bone conduction pad 110 of this alternate embodiment is constructed in the
     same fashion as the embodiment depicted in Figs. 4 and 5, with the exception that transducer 118
     is placed within and contacts a bed of particulate matter 128 that is enclosed within a flexible
     membrane 130.       The recess 114 within the flexible sheet of padding 112 of this alternate
     embodiment is appropriately sized to accommodate transducer 118, and particulate matter 128.
101]         In application of this alternate embodiment of the bone conduction pad 110, the area for
     bone conduction of low frequency waves between the bone conduction transducer 118 and the
     skeletal frame of the individual being treated is greatly increased.  As the bed of particulate
     matter 128 surrounding the bone conduction transducer 118 transmits the waves emitted from the
     bone conduction transducer 118, the area of effective transmission is greatly increased; as a
                                                     - 26 -

result, placement of the bone conduction pad 110 need not be as precise and remains effective
despite activity that may unintentionally displace the bone conduction pad 110.
