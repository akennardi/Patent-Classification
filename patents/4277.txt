                                        Technical Field
[0002]     This disclosure relates to bearing assemblies, and, in particular, to systems,
apparatuses and methods for lifting, positioning and removing a bearing assembly from a
shaft.
                                 Background of the Disclosure
[0003]     Bearings are used to reduce friction between and support moving parts, such as, for
example, rotating shafts. Bearings have a finite operating life, requiring periodic replacement
and routine maintenance to prevent failure.       Several factors impact the service life of a
bearing or the frequency for required maintenance.      For example, bearing loads, operating
temperature, exposure to external environments, contamination, lubrication and even
electrical currents acting on the bearing may impact a bearing's service life or the frequency
that maintenance must be conducted.
[0004]    Oftentimes it is difficult to replace or service bearings due to the location, size,
weight, method of coupling or type of bearing. A bearing, for example, may weigh several
hundred pounds and/or be coupled to a part or shaft through an interference fit. As a result, it
is oftentimes necessary to remove the rotor or shaft assembly in its entirety to replace or
repair the bearings.     In some instances, the entire machine must be transported to a
maintenance facility to replace the bearings.     However, it is desirable to replace bearings
                                                1

without (i) requiring removal of the rotor assembly or rotor shaft and/or (ii) transporting the
machine to a maintenance facility.

                                      Detailed Description
[0081]    Referring to FIG. 1, an embodiment of a close-coupled pump 100 employing a
power end 102, a fluid end 104 and a rotor shaft 110 extending between the power end 102
and the fluid end 104 is illustrated. The power end 102 has a first bearing assembly 106,
oftentimes referred to as a dry end bearing assembly, and a second bearing assembly 108,
oftentimes referred to as a wet end bearing assembly. Each of the bearing assemblies can
also be referred to as sub-assemblies.    The dry end bearing assembly 106 and the wet end

longitudinal axis 112. The close-coupled pump 100 is an illustrative, non-limiting example
of how one or more bearing assemblies may be utilized and is not meant to infer a specific
number or type of bearing assembly. While one skilled in the art will appreciate that bearings
may be utilized in a number of different applications, the close-coupled pump 100 will be
used as a backdrop for illustrating systems, methods and apparatuses for lifting, positioning
and removing bearings from a rotor shaft, such as the rotor shaft 110, without removing the
rotor shaft 110 from the close-coupled pump 100.
[0082]    In an illustrative embodiment, the fluid end 104 of the close-coupled pump 100 is a
rotodynamic centrifugal type pump. In another illustrative embodiment, the close-coupled
pump 100 is a rotodynamic pitot tube type pump. In an illustrative embodiment, the power
end 102 is an electric motor. In a non-limiting embodiment, the electric motor is an induction
motor or a switched reluctance motor. In another non-limiting embodiment, the power end
102 is a diesel motor. It should be appreciated that the power end 102 may be replaced by a
bearing assembly designed to support the shaft 110 at the wet end and coupled to a separate

shaft 110 substantially positioned therein. The stator 118 is fixed to the motor housing 116 in
a manner that limits rotation of the stator 118 relative to the motor housing 116. The shaft
110 is rotatably coupled to the motor housing 116 and rotates relative to the stator 118. The
dry end bearing assembly 106 and the wet end bearing assembly 108 are mounted to the shaft
110 at opposite ends of the motor housing 116 such that the dry end bearing assembly 106 is
                                               13

positioned proximate a closed end 120 of the motor housing 116, and the wet end bearing
assembly 108 is positioned proximate a drive end 122 of the motor housing 116.

access plates 130 are removably attached to the closed end bracket 128 such that, when
removed, access is provided to the shaft 110 adjacent the closed end 120 of the motor
housing 116. The bearing assembly cover 132 includes a bearing access plate 134 and an end
cap 136. The bearing access plate 134 is removably affixed to the closed end bracket 128
with at least one fastener, and the end cap 136 is removably affixed to the bearing access
plate 134. Removal of the bearing assembly cover 132 exposes the dry end bearing assembly
106 and bearing support surfaces 138 that securely house the dry end bearing assembly 106
to the motor housing 116.
[0085]    With continued reference to FIG. 1A, a drive end plate assembly 140 is disposed on
the drive end 122 and includes an end plate 142, a bearing housing 144 and a bearing
assembly cover 146, which is removably affixed to the bearing housing 144 to provide access
to the wet end bearing assembly 108.

embodiments, the carrier sleeve may be omitted from the assembly 300 and the roller bearing
310 secured to the shaft 110 by other means. In use, the lifting tool 200 is used to position
the bearing assembly 300 (i.e., the tapered roller bearing 310 and the carrier sleeve 315) on a
rotor shaft, such as the rotor shaft 110 illustrated in FIG. 1. In particular, the bearing
assembly 300 is placed onto the rotor shaft 110, removed from the rotor shaft 110 or
repositioned on the rotor shaft 110 using the lifting tool 200.
[0087]    Referring specifically to FIGS. 2-5, the lifting apparatus or lifting tool 200 includes

the inner wall 226, and in some embodiments, is dimensionally identical and aligned with the
retention member 214 on the upper body 202. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the lower body 204 is
arcuate or semi-annular in shape with an inner wall circumference 236. As illustrated in
FIGS. 2 and 3, the retention member 234 extends from the inner wall 226 along the
                                                15

circumference 236 and is configured secure the bearing assembly 300 to the lifting tool 200.
In other embodiments, the retention member 234 extends only partially along the
circumference 236. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the lower body 204 is configured to be attached
to the upper body 202 and forms a ring 201 for clamping around and supporting the bearing
assembly 300.     Described another way, the upper and lower bodies 202 and 204 form a
channel 266 when assembled for receiving and supporting the bearing assembly 300 therein.
[0089]    In use, the retention members 214 and 234 are configured to engage the bearing
assembly 300 and otherwise secure the bearing assembly 300 within the channel 266. In an
embodiment, the retention members 214 and 234 extend into the channel 266 from the upper
and lower bodies 202 and 204 and are configured to engage or fit within a corresponding
groove 302 to secure the bearing assembly 300 relative to the lifting tool 200 when the lifting
tool 200 has been assembled around, and encompasses, the bearing assembly 300. It should
be understood that in lieu of incorporating both retention members 214 and 234, the lifting
tool 200 may utilize only retention member 214 or retention member 234. In use, the weight
of the bearing assembly 300 is supported by the lifting tool 200 when the bearing assembly
200 is positioned on or removed from the shaft 110.
[0090] According to an embodiment disclosed herein, the lifting tool 200 is made from steel
and the retention members 214 and 234 have a thickness, tl (FIG. 4), of approximately 10
mm. In one non-limiting embodiment, the retention members 214 and 234 have a thickness,
tl, of between 20% (percent) and 80% of the width, wl, and the retention members 214 and
234 extend a length, dl, of approximately 3 mm.        In one non-limiting embodiment, the
retention members 214 and 234 have a length, dl, of between 50% and 120% of the
thickness, tl. In other embodiments, the retention members 214 and 234 may be offset from
a center line, Cl, of the upper body 202. In another embodiment, the retention members 214
                                              16

and 234 are offset from the center line, Cl, such that the retention members 214 and 234 is
closer to the back face 212 than the front face 210 of the upper body 202.       In additional
embodiments, the retention members 214 and 234 are positioned between 0% and 50% the
width, wI, of the upper body 202 from the back face 212 of the upper body 202.
[0091] Referring still to FIGS. 2-5, and with additional reference to FIGS. 9-11, an upper set
of diametrically opposed flanges 238 extend from the upper body 202 and a lower set of
diametrically opposed flanges 240 extend from the lower body 204.           The lower set of
diametrically opposed flanges 240 are configured to align with and attach to the upper set of
diametrically opposed flanges 238. In the illustrated embodiment, a set of apertures 241 in
the upper set of flanges 238 align with a set of apertures 243 in the lower set of flanges 240
(FIG. 3) along a centerline Cl. Fasteners 242 are positioned through the apertures 241 and
243 to attach and secure the lower set of flanges 240 to the upper set of flanges 238. When
assembled, the upper body 202 and lower body 204 form a relief section 260 that, when
assembled, reduce stress concentrations where the inner wall 206 of the upper body 202
meets the inner wall 226 of the lower body 204. In other embodiments, the upper body 202 is
hinged to the lower body 204 (not shown).
[0092] As illustrated in FIGS. 2-5, a lifting member or a hanger assembly 218 is formed in
the upper body 202 and is configured to provide a means for lifting the lifting tool 200. The
hanger assembly 218 further includes a connection member or an attachment mechanism 224,
which includes an opening formed through the hanger assembly 218. In one embodiment, a
clevis pin 270 (FIG. 11) is positioned through the opening.
[0093]    In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 2-5, the hanger assembly 218 extends
outward from the outer wall 208 of the upper body 202. In particular, the hanger assembly
218 extends from the outer wall 208 at a top portion 268 of the upper body 202 and is
                                              17

cantilevered beyond the back face 212 of the upper body 202 (FIG. 4). In the embodiment
illustrated in FIGS. 2-5, the hanger assembly 218 and the upper body 202 are formed as a
single unitary piece through casting, molding or other similar methods of manufacturing. In
another embodiment, the hanger assembly 218 is attached or connected to the upper body 202
by welding or other known means of attaching two parts together.
[00941 In an illustrative embodiment, the hanger assembly 218 includes a first body 220 and
a second body 222 whereby the second body 222 is cantilevered from the first body 220 and
extends beyond or otherwise past the back face 212 of the upper body 202.               In one
embodiment, the second body 222 includes the connection member 224, which includes an
opening formed within the second body 222.
[0095] Referring specifically to FIG. 4, the second body 222 is cantilevered a length, 11, from
the first body 220 such that a portion of the second body 222 is substantially aligned with a
center of gravity 306 of the bearing assembly 300.       According to embodiments disclosed
herein, the opening in the connection member 224 of the second body 222 is substantially
aligned with the center of gravity 306 when the longitudinal axis 304 of the bearing assembly
300 is in a horizontal position. In yet another embodiment, the opening in the connection
member 224 is formed in the second body 222 such that the opening is substantially aligned
with the center of gravity 306 when the longitudinal axis 304 of the bearing assembly 300 is
substantially aligned with the longitudinal axis 112 of the rotor shaft 106.
[0096] The hanger assembly 218 is configured to receive a hoisting member 121 (shown in
FIGS. 11-12). In an embodiment, the hoisting member 121 may be a hook, clasp, retention
member, or other type of fastener or gripping device for attaching to the lifting member or
hanger assembly 218. In an embodiment, the opening in the connection member 224 of the
                                               18

hanger assembly 218 is substantially aligned with the center of gravity 306 of the bearing
assembly 300 when the bearing assembly 300 is supported by the hoisting member 121.
 [0097] According to embodiments disclosed herein, at least one aperture 262 is formed in the
second body 222 and extends therethrough. The at least one aperture 262 is formed to access
the opening in the connection member 224 and is configured to receive an aligning member
or mechanism 264 to adjust the position of the lifting tool 200 and the bearing assembly 300
into a substantially horizontal position or coaxial, as discussed hereinafter, with the shaft 110.
A level may be used to determine when the bearing assembly 300, along its longitudinal axis
304, is substantially horizontal.
 [0098] According to some embodiments, the aligning member 264 is a jacking bolt or a
jacking screw and further, there may be more than one aligning member 264 depending on
the number of apertures 262. The one or more aligning members 264 are operable to be
positioned between an engaging/extended position, in which the aligning members are
inserted or otherwise extend within the opening of the connection member 224, and a
retracted position, in which the aligning members 264 are at least partially retracted from the
opening. In one embodiment, the one or more aligning members 264 are threadably secured
to the apertures 262 and each optionally include a tip formed of a low-friction material, such
as, for example, nylon, brass or any other low friction material.
 [0099] In operation, adjusting the aligning member 264 changes the position or angular
alignment of the lifting tool 200 so that the lifting force runs through the center of gravity 306
of the bearing 300 when the longitudinal axis 304 of the bearing is substantially horizontal.
In one embodiment, the clevis pin 270 is positioned through the opening in the connection
member 224 in the hanger assembly 218.            The one or more aligning members 264 are
positioned in the engaging/extended position to act against the clevis pin 270 in order to
                                                 19

control the angular alignment of the lifting tool 200 until the longitudinal axis 304 of the
bearing assembly 300 is substantially horizontal. Generally, the bearing's center of gravity
306 will be on the longitudinal axis 304 of the bearing assembly 300. Adjusting the angular
alignment of the lifting tool 200 adjusts the position or direction of the lifting force.
[00100]    In some embodiments, a first leg 244 extends from the outer wall 228 of the lower
body 204 with a foot 246 optionally extending from a distal end 248 of the first leg 244. A
second leg 250 extends from the outer wall 228 of the lower body 204 with a foot 252
optionally extending from a distal end 254 of the second leg 250. The first and second legs
244 and 250 help guide the bearing assembly 300 as it is being lifted off of a surface other
than the rotor shaft 110 (e.g. a work surface) and prevents contact of the bearing assembly
300 to the surface while lifting.
[00101]    Referring specifically to FIG. 2, one or more aligning members 256 are positioned
through corresponding apertures 258 formed in the upper and lower bodies 202 and 204 and
extend radially into the channel 266. The one or more aligning members 256 are configured
to adjust a position of the bearing assembly 300 relative to the lifting tool 200 after the lifting
tool 200 has been positioned on or around the bearing assembly 300.              The one or more
aligning members 256 provide refined radial adjustments of the bearing assembly 300
relative to the upper and lower bodies 202 and 204. According to an embodiment disclosed
herein, the aligning members 256 are jacking bolts or screws and are operable to be
positioned between an engaging position and a retracted position. In one embodiment, the
one or more aligning members 256 are threadably secured to the apertures 258. According to
some embodiments, the aligning member 256 includes a tip for engaging the bearing
assembly 300 formed of a low-friction material, such as, for example nylon, brass or any
other low friction material. In operation, the one or more aligning members 256 are operable
                                                20

to work in concert to adjust a radial position of the bearing assembly 300 relative to the
lifting tool 200 after the apparatus 200 has been fastened to the bearing assembly 300 for
alignment with the shaft 110. In one embodiment, the one or more aligning members 256
project radially relative to the bearing assembly 300. As illustrated, for example, in FIGS. 2
and 3, the one or more apertures 258 and the one or more aligning members 256 are angularly
spaced apart on the upper and lower bodies 202 and 204 forming an angle of about thirty
degrees to about ninety degrees therebetween. In an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment,
the each of the one or more apertures 258 forms an angle of 45 degrees therebetween.
[00102]    According to embodiments disclosed herein, a hoist system known in the art may
be used to elevate a lifting tool 200 and generally align the bearing assembly 300 with the
rotor shaft 110. The fitting tolerances between the bearing assembly 300 and the rotor shaft
110 may result in a clearance between the bearing assembly 300 and the rotor shaft 110 on
the order of   1/ 1 0 0 0 th of an inch. Thus, once the bearing assembly 300 has been generally
aligned with the rotor shaft 110, the one or more aligning members 256 are operable, as
previously discussed, to be used to make fine adjustments to the bearing assembly 300
position relative to the lifting tool 200 and, correspondingly, to the rotor shaft 110.
[00103]     In operation, the lifting tool or assembly 200 is assembled around the bearing
assembly 300. The hoist assembly is attached to the lifting tool 200 and provides enough
force to the lifting tool 200 to support the weight of both the lifting tool 200 and the bearing
assembly 300. The aligning members 264 extending through the aperture 262 in the second
body 222 are operable to adjust the clevis pin 270 or the hoisting member 121 so that the
lifting tool 200 is movable relative to the hoisting member 121 to align the hoisting member
121 with the center of gravity 306 of the bearing assembly 300 in the event the hoisting
member is not already aligned with the center of gravity 306. The aligning members 256 are
                                                  21

adjusted (i.e., extended into and removed from the channel 266) to radially align the bearing
assembly 300 with the rotor shaft 110. The bearing assembly 300 is then positioned onto the
shaft 110 or removed from the shaft 110.
[00104]    Referring now to FIGS. 6-8, with additional reference to FIGS. 9-10 and 12-15, a
bearing assembly removal apparatus 400 is illustrated for removing the bearing assembly 300
from the rotor shaft 110 without removing the rotor assembly and shaft 110 from the pump
100. For example, the removal apparatus 400 is configured to remove the wet end bearing
assembly 108 and the dry end bearing assembly 106 from the rotor shaft 110 without
removing the rotor assembly and the shaft 110 from the power end 102.
[00105]    In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 6-8, the removal apparatus 400 includes a
base member or plate 402 having a front face 404 and a back face 406, a drive
member/jacking bolt 414, and one or more pulling rods/extension members 418 extending
from the base member 402 to, as discussed in further detail below, engage and/or otherwise
interface with the bearing assembly 300 for removal thereof.
[00106]    In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 6-8, the base member 402 includes a
circular cross section; however, the base member 402 may be otherwise shaped.             For
example, the base member 402 may include a square shaped cross section and/or otherwise
be shaped as a hub and spoke type arrangement. According to some embodiments, the base
member 402 is formed of steel and has a thickness, tI, of approximately 38 mm, although the
thickness varies depending on the expected force required to remove the bearing assembly
300 from the shaft 110. According to embodiments disclosed herein, the base member 402 is
formed having a diameter, D3, of approximately 280 mm, although the diameter is dependent
on the size of the bearing assembly 300.
                                              22

[00107]     The base member 402 includes a central opening/hole 408 extending therethrough
sized to receive the drive member 414 and inner and outer peripheral openings/holes 422 and
424, respectively, that extend through the base member 402. Referring specifically to FIGS.
6 and 7, inner peripheral openings 422 are disposed a first radial distance D1 from the central
opening 408 and the outer peripheral openings 424 are formed at a second radial distance,
D2, from the central opening 408. As illustrated in the embodiment in FIG. 8, the second
distance, D2, is greater than the first distance D1, and both distances D1 and D2 are selected
so as to facilitate alignment of the openings 422 and 424 with corresponding tapped
holes/apertures 308 disposed in the bearing assembly 300 (FIGS. 9 and 10) and tapped
holes/apertures 470 in a bearing pulling sleeve or spacer member 456 (FIGS. 13-15),
respectively. As discussed in greater detail below, the alignment of openings 422 and 424
with tapped holes 308 and 470 enable the base member 402 to be coupled and otherwise
secured to the bearing assemblies 106 and 108 via the extension members/rods 418 to
facilitate removal of the bearing assemblies 106 and 108 from the rotating shaft 110. In the
embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 6-8, three inner peripheral openings 422 are positioned at
radially spaced apart positions around the central opening 408, although a greater or fewer
numbers of inner peripheral openings 422 may be utilized.         Similarly, in the embodiment
illustrated in FIGS. 6-8, six outer peripheral openings 424 are radially spaced around the
central opening 408. Referring particularly in FIG. 7, the first set of peripheral openings 422
are formed along a first circular path 426 and the second set of peripheral openings 424 are
formed along a second and outer circular path 428; however, it should be understood that the
position of inner and outer peripheral openings 422 and 424 can vary, and further, that the
shape of paths 426 and 428 may also vary.
[00108]     As illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 12, each extension member 418 is coupled to the base
member 402 such that it extends outwardly from the back face 406. In FIG. 6, each extension
                                                23

member 418 is secured to the base member 402 by a fastener 420, such as a bolt or other
attachment means, disposed proximate the front face 404 of the base member 402.            In
particular, in the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 12, the extension member 418 has a
threaded first end 430 insertible through openings 422 or 424 and coupleable to the base
member 402 via the fastener 420.         The extension member 418 further includes and an
opposed second end 432 that is coupleable either directly to the bearing assembly 300 via the
tapped hole 308 (FIGS. 9 and 10), or coupleable to the spacer 456, which forms a part of the
bearing assembly 108, via the tapped hole 470 (FIG. 15), the spacer 456, as discussed in
further detail below, being utilized to push and otherwise move the wet end bearing assembly
108 along the shaft 110 to facilitate removal of the bearing assembly 108 from the shaft 110.
In lieu of utilizing fasteners 420, each opening 422 and 424 may include a threaded interior
(not illustrated) to facilitate engagement with a threaded end 430 of the extensions 418 to
secure each extension 418 to the base member 402. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 6
and 12, for example, the second end 432 of each extension member 418 is coupled directly to
the bearing assembly 106 or 108. In particular, as illustrated for example in FIG. 12, the
second ends 432 of the extension members 418 engage and are otherwise secured in a
corresponding tapped hole or aperture 308 of the bearing assembly 300. In the embodiment
illustrated, for example, in FIGS. 9 and 10, the tapped holes 308 are formed in the carrier
sleeve 315; however, in other embodiments, depending on the type of bearing assembly 300,
the tapped holes 308 may be formed directly on the roller bearing 310 for removal thereof. In
the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 14 and 15, for example, the second end 432 of the
extension members 418 engage and are otherwise secured to a corresponding tapped hole or
aperture 470 in the spacer 456, for, as discussed in further detail below, removal of the wet
end bearing assembly 108.
                                               24

 [00109]    Referring specifically to FIG. 6, the jacking bolt/drive member 414 is a bolt having
a head 415 and a stem 417. The stem 417 is threaded through the opening 408 and extends
past and/or otherwise beyond the back face 406 of the base member 402 for contact with
and/or otherwise abutting engagement with the end of the shaft 110. In some embodiments, a
fastener or bolt 416 is secured to and/or otherwise forms a part of the base member 402.
Accordingly and as discussed in greater detail below, during rotational movement of the
jacking bolt 414 to remove the bearing assembly 300, the fastener 420 provides a region to
enable a wrench or other tool to engage therewith so as to prevent rotation of the fastener
420.
 [00110]    During removal of the bearing assembly 106 and/or 108, rotation of the jacking
bolt 414, when abutted against the end of the shaft 110, enables the base member 402 to
traverse along the jacking bolt 414 to thereby slide or otherwise move the bearing assembly
 106 and/or 108 along the shaft 110. More particularly and with reference to FIG. 12, for
example, rotation of the jacking bolt 414 in the counterclockwise direction of arrow 414a,
causes the base member 402 to travel along the length of the stem 417 in the direction of
arrow 414b via the threaded engagement, thereby causing the extension members 418 to also
move in the direction of 414b. This movement exerts a pulling force on the bearing assembly
 106 to move the bearing assembly 106 along the rotor shaft 110 in the direction of arrow
414b to facilitate eventual removal via the lifting tool 200, as previously described.
 [00111]    According to embodiments disclosed herein, the bearing assembly removal
apparatus 400 further includes the rod extender members 442 coupleable to the extension
members 418 to effectively lengthen the extension members 418 so as to, for example,
facilitate the removal of the wet end bearing assembly 108 (FIGS. 14 and 15). In FIG. 6, for
example, the extender member 442 has a first end 444 and an opposing second end 446. In
                                                 25

use, the first end 444 is coupled an extension member 418 and the second end 446 is coupled
to the bearing assembly 300. In other configurations, the second end 446 is coupled to a
tapped hole or aperture 308 formed in the carrier sleeve 315 (FIGS. 9 and 10). In yet another
embodiment, the second end 446 is coupled to the spacer 456, and in particular, the aperture
or tapped hole 470 formed in the spacer 456 (FIGS. 14 and 15).             According to specific
configurations, the spacer 456 is positioned on the shaft 112 between a shoulder 472 formed
on the shaft 110 an inner race 458 of the bearing assembly 108.             In operation, the rod
extender members 442 and/or the extension members 418 pull the spacer 456 axially along
the shaft 110 and away from the shoulder 472, thereby causing the spacer 456 to move the
inner race 458 axially along and toward the end of the shaft 110 to facilitate removal of the
inner race 458 (and the spacer 456) from the shaft 110.
[00112]    According to some embodiments, to facilitate the placement or removal of a
bearing assembly 106 from the shaft 110, the weight of the shaft 110 is supported by one or
more support members 111 (FIG. 1A) such as, for example, a rotor jack.                The support
members 111 may be shiftably coupled relative to the motor housing 116 for movement
between a retracted position and a rotor-support position, in which the support members 111
support the weight of the shaft 110.         In particular, the support members 111 help avoid
substantial deflection of the shaft 110 due to the weight of the shaft 110. In one embodiment,
the portion of the support members 111 in contact with the shaft 110 is comprised of a low
friction, material to (1) prevent the rotor from rotational slippage and (2) protect the shaft 110
if a user does not retract the support members for activating the shaft 110.
[00113]     In order to facilitate transport and the ability to manually adjust the position of the
removal apparatus 400, the removal apparatus 400 includes one or more gripping surfaces/
handles 448 positioned on an outer perimeter 450 of the base member 402.
                                                  26

 [00114]    Embodiments disclosed herein provide a method, apparatus and system for
positioning a bearing assembly 300, including dry end bearing assembly 106 and wet end
bearing assembly 108 on a shaft 110. The method includes securing a lifting tool 200 at least
partially around the bearing assembly 300 and aligning the lifting assembly 200 with a
longitudinal axis 112 of the shaft 110. The method further includes adjusting the angular
position of the lifting tool 200 relative to the longitudinal axis 112 of the shaft 110 using a
first set of aligning members 264. The method continues by adjusting the radial position of
