PERGOLA BUILDING SYSTEM AND BRACKET
Field of the invention
The present invention relates generally to building structures, and in particular to
connectors for building structures.
Background
Outdoor structures such as pergola or similar structures are particularly popular with those
wishing to gain additional living or entertaining areas outside of their home. Pergola's and
other similar structures, are useful in that they provide full or partial protection to the
outdoor elements such as sun or rain and provide the opportunity for people to further their
enjoyment outdoors.
Known pergola structures are typically constructed from wood and include a number of
upright posts that are arranged about a rectangular area and subsequently covered by a roof
which is formed by a rectangular grid, lattice or other roofing elements. The construction of
such instructions typically requires 1st finding a suitable ground surface into which
foundations are dug into which the heavy upright post is placed into and concrete poured
around it in order to secure the post in its vertical position. In order to maintain the upright
post in the vertical position during the curing of the concrete stabilises are attached and
secured to the ground so that the upright post does not inadvertently lean over. If this
occurs and is not noticed in time the whole of the structure can be compromised, not to
mention affecting the aesthetics of the structure.
Assuming that the upright posts are installed correctly, the wooden frame members have to
then be lifted or hoisted into place, typically requiring a number of people to do so. The
wooden frame members are then held in place by a number of brackets that are either
screwed or nailed into the upright posts. Cross-rails or lattice beams are then secured to the
wooden frame members onto which is attached sheet roofing material.
                                                  1

The types of structures described above present number of problems such as the complexity
of construction as well as requiring a degree of skill and confidence in the correct
installation and assembly. In addition, several people are required to construct such
instructions due to the nature of the materials being used.
In addition, the types of structures described above are often lacking in strength, as the
elements are not connected to one another in a manner that results in an inherently strong
structure. Often the upright posts are provided without any form of bracing apart from the
foundations into which they are inserted and the coupling brackets that are nailed to them.
Other pergola structures utilise lap joints, however, in each case there is little tying the
elements together and as there can be a number of joints over the entire structure, all of
which are exposed both to weather and associated stress, this results in their being several
points of weakness across the entire structure.
As such, the construction of such structures is often beyond the capability of skill set of the
typical homeowner and therefore they are required to hire skilled labour in order to
complete the task.

Description of the invention.
The general arrangement of a freestanding pergola framing system 10 is shown in figure 1,
according to an embodiment of the present invention.
As shown in figure 1, the freestanding frame system 10 includes a frame 15 having a
plurality of generally vertically orientated spaced apart posts 20 aligned in a suitable
manner, such as that shown in figure 1. Generally horizontal frame members 25 are
attached or connected to the posts 20 in a manner that will be discussed in more detail
below. Preferably the frame members 25 are connected at right angles to the posts 20 and
extending between the frame members 25 is a plurality of panel sections 30. The frame
members 25 and vertical posts 20 are substantially similar in design being differentiated by
the numbers 20 and 25 so as to differentiate their respective orientation. As will be clear
from the description and the drawings the 20 and 25 differ only in their orientation.
The roof panel sections 30 interlock with an edge or face of the frame members 25 so as to
provide an interlocking structure.
Each frame member 25 has a channel 32 on a top face 26 and channel 33 on its bottom face
27. Other channels may be present on the side faces 28 and 29 respectively as required.
Through the centre of the frame members 25 is a hollow section 35 spanning the entire
length of the frame member 25 into which can be inserted a reinforcing rod 38. The
reinforcing rod 38 is the core of the frame member 25.
In a preferred embodiment the frame member 25 and posts 20 can be made from a suitably
lightweight material such as plastics or aluminium in order to take advantage of their
lightweight and ease of manufacture by known extrusion technologies. The internal
reinforcing rods 38 can be constructed from a high-grade aluminium or steel as required so
as to reinforce the strength of the frame members or posts that they are inserted into.
                                                7

The reinforcing rods 38 are inserted into the hollow section 35 of the frame members 25,
the reinforcing rod 38 having an internal thread 40 into which a bolt 10 threadingly engage
with. For example, a bolt 45 can be threaded into the reinforcing rod 38 partially so as to
leave a section of the bolt shank 47 showing. The distance between the bolt head 46 and the
outer face 39 of the reinforcing rod 38 is sufficient to allow the bolt shank 47 to pass into
the U shaped slot 130 of the corner connecting element/bracket 100. Thereafter the same
process can be repeated for frame member 25A-D and each of the bolts 45 can be tightened
thus drawing the end faces 60 of the frame member 25 into contact with the side face 110
of the comer connecting element 100. In order to achieve this the reinforcing rod 38 has a
length that is slightly less than the length of the frame member 25 into which it is inserted
into.
In an alternative embodiment, the reinforcing rod 38 may be sectioned so that there are two
sections of reinforcing rod inserted into the frame member 25, one left hand section and one
right hand section, which may only travel part way along the length of the frame member
25.
By repeating this process with the remaining frame members a complete frame can be
readily constructed without the need for any particular construction skill and in relatively
short time.
Each of the substantially vertical posts 20 also contain a hollow section 70, which defines a
central axis of the vertical post 20, and has sides 71 - 74 although other shapes are
considered to fall within the scope of the invention, and an end face 21 at the longitudinal
end. The opposite end face of the post is not shown.
As with the frame members 25, a reinforcing rod 80 is inserted into the hollow section 35
of the post 20 so as to increase the structural integrity of the post 20. The corner connecting
element 100, having an aperture 150 on its lower or bottom face 120 can be fastened to the
reinforcing rod 80 by insertion of the fastening means being the bolt 90 through aperture
 150 to threadably engage with the reinforcing rod 80, which has an internal thread.
                                                  8

In order to facilitate the connection between the corner connector element/bracket 100 and
the post 20 an additional connecting element can be utilised, such as the upper connecting
adapter/post adaptor element 300 is suitably shaped so as to nestingly receive or couple the
corner connection element 100 within. In the embodiment shown the upper connecting
adapter 300 is substantially square having faces 325 A-D and a void or recess/cavity 310
into which the corner connector element can 110 nest within. On the inner bottom face 307
is an opening 317, though which a reinforcing rod 80 can pass through.
On the lower face 315 of the upper connecting adapter 300 are the projecting lugs 320A-D
shaped to fit within matching recess or openings 75A-D of the post 20 or frame so as to
secure the comer connecting element square and in line with the upright post 20. In the
form of the upper connecting adaptor 300 as shown there are a number of lugs 320 however
in some instances there may only be one lug or any number of lugs as desired or needed to
mate or nest within a matching opening or recess in a face of the post.
The upper connecting adapter 300 further has the curved notches 330A-C located on the
upper periphery of the edge 335, substantially in line with the related projecting lugs 320A
C. Note that face 325D does not have any curved notches as found on faces 325A-C, as
face 325D can provide a clean aesthetic look when used to support three frame members.
Other configurations of curved notches are possible from 1-4 depending on requirements
and final shape of the upper connecting element 300, as well providing for different shapes
of notches when different shaped rods are utilized, for example square tubular rods would
nest with square shaped notches.
About the upper periphery rim 335 is a flange 340 shaped to fit complimentary with a
flange on an upper cover 380 to assist in location and orientation of the two parts.
The upper cover 380 is shaped complimentary to the corner connecting element 100 and the
upper connecting adapter 300 in that they are all square shaped. The upper cover 380
further includes a number of curved notches 382 shaped to rest against an outer surface of
the rods 38.
                                               9

In a further embodiment of the invention, the corner connecting element 100 may
incorporate a downward projection from its lower or bottom face 120 which would then
nest within the opening 75 of the post 20 so as to avoid the need to use an upper connecting
adapter. The upper connecting adapter 300 does however provide a way of at least partially
concealing the comer connecting element 100 from view and by including the upper cover
380, which can be placed over the top of the corner connecting element 100, is possible to
then fully conceal the corner connecting element 100 in the completed construction
constructed frame.
In order to securely removably attached the roof sections 30 to the frame 15, roof panel
adapters 400 slidingly engage with the slot or channel 32 on the top face 26 of the frame
member 25. The roof panels 30 can then slide in between the top face 26 of the frame
member 25 and the projecting flange 410. In the embodiment as shown a pair of roof
sections 30 can be held in place by a pair of roof panel adapters 400, the being on
positioned on the opposite frame member. Once a pair of panels 30 are in place then an
additional roof panel adapter here 400 can be inserted into the channel 32 followed by an
additional pair of roof sections until sufficient roof surface is formed as desired. This
allows then for customisation of the roof surface to the specific requirements of the
installer, or the modification of the roof surface as might be required by change of season
or aesthetic requirements without the use of additional tools or expertise.
In more detail, the corner connecting element 100, according to one embodiment, has a
plurality of side faces 110 A - D to form a generally square shape element with a bottom
face 120. The interior of the corner connecting element 100 has a void 131, which is
defined by the bottom face 120 and the side faces 110 A-D. Each of the side faces 110 A-D
includes a U- shaped slot 130 A-D, each of which is in line with a slot on an opposing face.
For example, slot 135A is in line with slot 135C on the opposing side face 1 OC. The slots
 130 have substantially parallel sides 140A and 141A respectively and terminate in a curved
ending section 135. In the embodiment shown in the figures the sides 140 and 141 are
substantially perpendicular however other angles are considered to fall within the scope of
                                                10

the invention, for example where the sides 140 and 141 are inclined with respect to one
another.
The curved section 135 may be configured in an alternative geometry, for example a flat
ending, as required. Positioned on the bottom face 120 is a main aperture 150 substantially
in the middle of the corner connecting element 100. Opening may be located close to the
right angled interface in the void area 131 between the inside side faces 110 A-D for
receiving fastening elements, such as screws or bolts in order to assist in the fixing of the
corner connecting element to an appropriate structure or surface.
The top plate 170 sits in coaxial alignment with the upper connecting element 300 and the
corner connecting element 100. The top plate 170 as the upper surface 171 and lower
surface 172. An opening 173 is located substantially in the middle of the other surface 171
to allow passage of a bolt 90 to pass through it. Located on the sides 175 A - D of the top
plate 170 are downwardly extending flange elements 176 A - D each of which terminate in
a concave face 177 A-D, the shape of which is such that it substantially matches the outer
diameter of the rod 38. When the top plate 170 is inserted over the top of the corner
connecting element 100, the flanges 176 A-B line up substantially with the voids on 130 a
B, which are the U-shaped slots. When a rod 38 is inserted into the U shaped slot 130, the
top plate 170 is then aligned with the comer connecting element 100 and inserted into the
void 131 where the flanges 176 A - D then lineup with the slots 130 and the top plate 170
is then brought into contact with the comer connecting element 100 and the flanges 176 A
D then slide into the mutually aligned slot 130 A - D where the concave end 178 of the
flanges 176 then rests against an outer surface of the respective board 38.
The bolt 90 is then inserted into the opening 173 of the upper surface 171 and fastened into
position by threaded engagement to the rod 80 that it is coaxially aligned with. Tightening
of the bolt 90 then draws the top plate 170 closer to the coroner connecting element 100
wherein the flanges 176 A-D urge against the respectively positioned rod 38 and securely
clamp it into position. This then has the effect of further holding the corner element
                                               11

assembly and the respective rods in place with one another as well as to their respective
frame elements.
As shown in the figures, only to rods are inserted into the corner connecting element 100,
but as would be appreciated by those schooled in this art, additional rods may be inserted
into the remaining unoccupied slots 130 and secured in the manner as described herein.
This would then allow the comer connecting element 100 to act as a central connecting
element with frame element extending
In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the comer connecting element 200 is
substantially cubed shaped having the side faces 210 A-D and the bottom face 220. The
side faces 210A and 210D are triangular in shape having an edges 225A and 225B that
slopes downwards towards the bottom face 220. Side faces 210B and 210C have U-shaped
slots 240 orthogonal to one another. The bottom face 220 has an opening 240 through it to
receive a bolt.
 As the corner connecting element 100 can primarily to be located in the comer position of
any structure then it will require at least two U-shaped slots. By having four U-shaped slots,
as shown corner connector 100, the versatility of the connecting element is greatly
enhanced as it allows for it to be used in line as well as for right angled connections.
In other embodiments, the corner connecting element can have a single U-shaped slot on
one of its side faces where there is no need for additional frame connection points.
In yet further embodiments, the corner connecting element may be multi-sided, such as
hexagonal or pentagonal, each side have a U-shaped as required to allow for construction of
more complicated structures.
By connecting each of the frame elements to a comer connecting element by way of the
reinforcing rods the entire structure will be cohesively and integrally connected. The
reinforcing rods through the frame members proving the required tensile strength that is
                                                12

otherwise lacking from traditional pergola systems that rely on either surface brackets or
lap joints. The connection of the reinforcing rods is readily achieved by way of tightening
the bolts in the corner connection members using readily available tools. The same corner
connection elements/bracket and upper connecting element can also be used at a ground
level of the vertical post to secure the vertical post at a lower ground level. As will then
immediately be clear to those skilled in the art, this then results in a frame that is secured
integrally on all corners providing an enhanced level of connection and overall strength.
The resulting pergola frame being relatively lightweight due to the outer frame member
being made from a plastics or aluminum material which allows it to be easily moved and
lifted as required. The interconnection of the frame elements of the pergola system also
allows for the simply insertion of roofing elements as required, no special fastening tools
needed.
As is now apparent, the present system and components allow for the quick and efficient
construction of a pergola frame without requiring specialist skills.
