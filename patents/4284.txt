FIELD
 [0001]         The present invention relates to a composite material for high-impact
polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe, belonging to the polymer materials technology field.
BACKGROUND
 [0002]         Polyvinyl chloride is currently one of the five main      general plastics.
Polyvinyl chloride pipe becomes the most widely used type of pipe due to its low cost,
simple processing and convenient construction.
 [00031         Hard polyvinyl chloride (PVC-U) reinforced pipe is a new pipe having a
smooth inner wall and an outer wall with a vertical reinforcement, made of hard
polyvinyl chloride as the main raw material. Its has the following main performances:
the strength and stiffness thereof can bear the load under the geographical environment;
the hydraulic characteristics thereof is suitable for conveying liquid; no leaking,
preventing environmental pollution; wear resistance and easy installation, therefore
with a comprehensive economy advantage. It is mainly used for underground sewage
system and drainage system. Since the principle of I-beam steel is applied to its outer
wall, polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipes have a unique performance advantage. The
product has been widely used in the drainage system and sewage system in developed
countries since the eighties, and it gradually replaced the traditional cement pipes, steel
pipes and so on, becoming the world's most advanced material for buried drainage and
9162588_1 (GHMatters)P106143.AU

sewage pipes. Due to the properties of the material itself and the special structure of the
pipe, PVC-U reinforced pipe has a high strength and rigidity. However, it has
shortcomings such as easy to break, poor toughness and so on, so it shows obvious
deficiencies in the seismic resistance, uneven foundation settlement resistance,
anti-point load and so on. These shortcomings greatly limit its application and
promotion. Therefore, it is necessary to modify the PVC materials to improve the
performances of the materials. For example, Chinese patent application (Publication No.
CN105778355A) disclosed a low density impact resistant modified polyvinyl chloride
pipe and its production process, which used a polyvinyl chloride resin as a base material
and enhanced the toughness and low temperature impact resistance of the composite
material by adding polymer hollow beads. However, the polymer hollow bead has a
high cost and is hard to process in the production process, so it is not suitable for
industrialized production.
SUMMARY
[0004]         In view of the above drawbacks of the prior art, the present invention provides
a composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe to solve the
problem of how to impart high rigidity and toughness to the materials.
[0005]         The object of the present invention is achieved by the following technical
solution which provides a composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride
reinforced pipe. comprising the following components in parts by weight:
[0006]         polyvinyl chloride resin: 100; heat stabilizer: 2.0~8.0; lubricant: 0.1~7.0;
processing modifier: 0. 1-5; and composite toughening agent: 8~50;
[0007]         said composite toughening agent is a masterbatch mainly composed of an
elastic polymer, a dispersant and a nano-montmorillonite; and mass ratio of elastic
polymer: dispersant: nano-montmorillonite in said composite toughening agent is 58-85:
0.1-12: 10-30.
[0008]         The composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe of
the present invention uses polyvinyl chloride resin as main material. The composite
                                            2
91625881 (GHMatters)P106143Ad

toughening agent is prepared by pre-compounding of elastic polymer, dispersant and
nano-montmorillonite,                  causing  the    dispersant  to   insert    into  layers   of
nano-montmorillonite or to coat on the surface of nano-montmorillonite. This can
organically              modify       nano-montmorillonite,   improve   the    layer   spacing   of
nano-montmorillonite, so that it has a good compatibility. Furthermore, an elastomer
adheres or coats on the surface of the nano-montmorillonite or interposes between the
layers so as to be able to give a cushioning effect and to improve the compatibility.
Herein, the raw materials in the composite toughening agent are formulated by using
composite toughening agent as the reference for mass ratio, then added as materials
according to the ratio. After the composite toughening agent and polyvinyl chloride are
mixed, when external force is applied, the elastomer in the composite toughening agent
can        absorb         a     large  amount  of external    energy  by   its   own   deformation.
Nano-montmorillonite can act as the stress concentration body, causing the surrounding
matrix to produce a large number of micro-cracks, and forcing the plastic deformation
of the matrix, absorbing external energy, so that elastomer and nano-montmorillonite
can achieve the effect of synergistic toughening. At the same time, these make the
PVC-M reinforced tubes produced not only meet the requirements of strength and
stiffness, but also greatly improve the impact performance, giving it excellent resistance
to stress cracking, to crack growth and anti-point load capacity, so that it can effectively
resist to external force impact during transport, installation and use.
[0009]          In the above-mentioned composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride
reinforced pipe, preferably, the composite toughening agent is obtained through
preprocessing by the following method:
[0010]          The nano-montmorillonite and dispersant are mixed; the elastic polymer is
added and mixed until the elastomer becomes soft and adheres to or covers the surface
of the nano-montmorillonite to obtain the corresponding composite toughening agent.
Pre-processed composite toughening agents can make nano-montmorillonite to be
coated inside the elastomer. The elastic polymer on the surface can create a very good
cushioning             effect, and the internal nano-montmorillonite         can act as a stress
concentration body to cause the plastic deformation of surrounding matrix, so that it has
a double impact resistance performance, achieving a better impact strength effect.

[0011]          In the composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe,
preferably,              said    elastic    polymer     is    selected     from     one    or   more    of
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene               copolymer (ABS),         chlorinated polyethylene (CPE),
methyl                 methacrylate-butadiene-styrene             terpolymer          (MBS),       methyl
methacrylate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (MABS), 1,3 -butadiene-methyl
methacrylate copolymer (AMB), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), ACM resin
(acrylate resin) and acrylate impact modifier (AIM). They have a good flexibility, so
that can more effectively play a cushioning effect, and improve the impact resistance of
materials.              More       preferably,    the     elastic     polymer     is    a    mixture    of
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene                 copolymer,        1,3 -butadiene-methyl       methacrylate
copolyner and methyl methacrylate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene                         copolymer, and
mass         ratio        of    acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene      copolymer:      1,3-butadiene-methyl
methacrylate                  copolymer:      methyl       methacrylate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene
copolymer is 1:0.5-0.8:0.5~1.0.
[00121          In the composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe,
preferably,            said nano-montmorillonite          is  selected    from Ca-montmorillonite       or
Na-montmorillonite. They have a better layer structure which makes dispersant to insert
into the layer structure of nano-montmorillonite better. After it is mixed into the base
material, it can function as a stress concentration body better, so that the matrix can play
a role in plastic deformation, thereby further improve the performances of rigidity and
impact resistance.
[0013]          In the composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe,
preferably, said dispersant is selected from one or more of dimeric glyceryl oleate,
dimeric glyceryl laurate. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester and polyoxyethylene
monostearate glyceride. The above dispersants have good chemical, thermodynamic
stability and antistatic properties. Also, they are hydrophilic and lipophilic, so that the
ether oxygen bond on the molecular chain of the dispersant can form hydrogen bonds
with the nano-montmorillonite surface-OH, so that the dispersant can be more
efficiently coated onto the surface of the nano-montmorillonite or insert into the layer
structure of nano-montmorillonite, so that the surface property of nano-montmorillonite
is changed from hydrophilicity to lipophilicity. At the same time, the dispersants can
                                                      4

increase the layer spacing. These greatly improve the dispersibility and compatibility of
nano-montmorillonite, so that the elastic polymer can be better coated or adhered to the
surface of nano-montmorillonite, improving the rigidity and toughness of the material.
More preferably, the dispersant is a mixture of dimeric glyceryl oleate, polyoxyethylene
monostearate and dimeric glyceryl laurate, and the percentage of said dimeric glyceiyl
oleate is 4wt %~5wt%,            and the mass ratio of the dimeric glyceryl oleate:
polyoxyethylene monostearate glyceride: dimeric glyceryl laurate is 1:0.5~0.6:0.4~0.5.
This can improve the ring stiffness of the composite material better and improve the
impact strength remarkably. More preferably, the mass ratio of the dispersant:
nanometer montmorillonite is 1: 2.5~3.0.
 [0014]        In the composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe,
preferably, said lubricant includes internal lubricant and external lubricant; the weight
part of said internal lubricant is 0.1~3.0; and the weight part of said external lubricant is
0.1~4.0. Lubricant can make the materials have a good lubrication performance, more
important, improves the strength property of the materials, and also gives the surface of
the product a good smoothness. More preferably, said internal lubricant is selected from
one of stearic acid and its derivatives, polyol fatty acid ester, fatty amide, polyol or a
mixture thereof; said external lubricant is selected from one of polyoxyethylene wax,
polyethylene wax, Fischer-Tropsch wax, polyether wax, montan wax, or a mixture
thereof. The raw materials of these lubricants are relatively easy to obtain, so it is
conducive to industrialized production.
 [0015]        In the composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe,
preferably, said processing modifier is selected from one of acrylate polymer and
styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, or a mixture thereof.
 [0016]        In the composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe,
preferably, said heat stabilizer is selected from one or more of composite lead heat
stabilizer, calcium and zinc heat stabilizer, organotin heat stabilizer and non-metallic
organic heat stabilizer. More preferably, said non-metallic organic heat stabilizer is
selected from one of 6-amino-1,3-dimethyluracil, 2-phenylindole, p-aminocrotonate,
triphenylurea, or a mixture thereof. Heat stabilizer can improve the thermal stability of
                                             5

the materials, effectively prevent the heat decomposition of PVC resin during
processing, and ensure the rigidity and toughness performances of the materials.
[0017]         As described above, the present invention has the following advantages over
the prior art:
[0018]          1. The composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe
of the present invention uses a composite toughening agent which is prepared by
pre-compounding of elastic polymer, dispersant and nano-montmorillonite, to give a

act as the stress concentration body, so that the PVC-M reinforced pipes produced not
only meet the requirements of strength and stiffness, but also have a great improvement
on the impact performance, giving it excellent resistance to stress cracking, to crack
growth and anti-point load capacity, so that it can effectively resist to external force
impact during transport, installation and use.
[0019]         2. The composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe
of the present invention uses a dispersant with ether oxygen bonds on the molecular
chain, which can form hydrogen bonds with the surface-OH of nano-montmorillonite,
so that the                 dispersant can     more efficiently coat  onto   the surface  of the
nano-montmorillonite or insert into the layer structure of nano-montmorillonite,
changing the surface property of nano-montmorillonite                     from hydrophilicity to
lipophilicity. At the same time, the dispersants can increase the layer spacing. These
greatly improve the                  dispersibility and compatibility  of nano-montmorillonitea,
achieving the effect of improving the rigidity and toughness of the materials.
[0020]          3. The composite material for high-impact polyvinyl chloride reinforced pipe
of the present invention, by using a mixture of dimeric glyceryl oleate, polyoxyethylene
monostearate glyceride and dimeric glyceryl laurate, and controlling the percentage of

so as to improve the ring stiffness of the composite more effectively and improve the
impact strength remarkably.
