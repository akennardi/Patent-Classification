The process will enable the recovery of previously in-orchard weather damaged stone or berry fruit
skins, by reducing or eliminating the colonisation of wild yeasts or mold. Sub-standard fruit can then
be used for making value added distilled alcoholic beverages, without requiring heat sterilisation
methods, which will change the final product flavour.

  If harvesting can't be carried out immediately after the weather event, then the fruit should be
quickly sprayed on the bush, tree or vine with a 20% solution of the pulp wastewater from olive oil
extraction. This treatment is especially useful against grey mold, botrytis cinerea.
If there are no visible signs of mold colonisation after the weather event, harvest the fruit
immediately, then spray or immerse it in 70-80% food grade ethanol for 30 seconds, drain and
collect the ethanol, as this can be redistilled for reuse. Then quickly prepare the fruit for
fermentation.
 If there is still evidence of mold colonisation after harvest, immerse the harvested fruit in a 10%
solution of olive waste water for 60 minutes, drain, rinse with fresh water and again drain. Then
immerse the fruit in 70-80% ethanol, drain and collect the ethanol, as this can be redistilled for
reuse.
In the case of stone fruit, de-pit and crush the pulp and skins immediately. Strain or press out the
fruit juice, add a suitable hydrated proprietary yeast, then allow it to ferment in the usual manner.
After the wine has completed fermentation, decant the supernatant off the dead yeast sediment
and distil it. This distilled product can then be used for fruit flavoured liqueurs or spirits.
